First, a bill passed by the U.S. House this morning moves to end the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for clean energy, including electric-vehicle tax credits. Then the U.S. Senate voted to end a so-called waiver that allows California to set its own emissions standards, which are followed by more than a dozen other states and sought to regulate all-electric new car sales by 2035.

The House vote was for Trump's ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill,"" which would enact sweeping tax cuts and dramatically reduce federal spending. Those cuts end the $7,500 tax credits used to purchase or lease new EVs, although it provides an exception for cars from manufacturers that have not sold 200,000 EVs placed in service by the end of 2026.

It also ends tax credits for home refueling infrastructure, kills the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs and plug-in hybrids, and kills the tax credit that subsidized the production of solar energy components, wind energy components, battery components and inverters.

The bill also makes it more expensive to own an EV, instituting a new ""Car Tax"" for EV and hybrid owners to the tune of $250 and $100, respectively.

Provisions of the House bill may be excluded as it heads to the Senate. However, EV and clean-energy advocates were quick to say that repealing the IRA's provisions at this level would effectively hand the future of power over to China, which is already significantly ahead on EVs, battery power and solar production.

Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition, said that the House bill will also heavily impact jobs in the U.S. Clean-energy jobs, including in the EV and battery space, have largely been concentrated in red and purple states.

“The bill passed by the House this morning takes a sledgehammer to the U.S. EV industry and undermines efforts to build robust, secure and reliable access to critical minerals,"" Prochazka said. ""Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto industry and other industries related to EVs at a critical time, immediately putting American jobs at risk.""

Albert Gore III, the executive director of the nonprofit Zero-Emission Transportation Association (ZETA), concurred in a similar statement.

""A vote to dismantle that now is not just a policy misstep but a signal that the United States is retreating from its goal to be competitive with China in the battery and mineral sector,"" Gore said. ""If this bill is enacted into law as currently written, members of Congress should not be surprised when critical mineral mining and refining projects stall and billions in manufacturing investments evaporate in states that have worked hard to attract these jobs and economic opportunities.""

There was much speculation as to how Republican members of Congress would vote on the bill, given how many of them have EV-related projects in their districts. Earlier this year, for example, Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter—whose district includes Hyundai's new electric and hybrid Metaplant—told InsideEVs that Congress should not take a ""sledgehammer"" to the IRA to avoid putting investments like that at risk.

However, Carter voted today with his colleagues to pass the bill. ""“This is a once-in-a-generation bill that will unlock President Trump’s full domestic agenda, which Georgians voted for overwhelmingly back in November,"" Carter said in a statement. ""Will they stand with the people of Georgia by preventing the largest tax hike in American history, or will they bend the knee to Chuck Schumer by siding with the liberal elites?”

US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax package will raise prices for all types of energy, risk hundreds of thousands of jobs, and cut GDP by $1tn during the next eight years, say analysts.

The House of Representatives passed the 1,000-page bill by a single vote on May 22. It will now proceed to the Senate, with a July 4 deadline for reaching the president’s desk.

The bumper bill includes various tax breaks for corporations and upper-to-middle class households, and will reportedly add more than $3.3bn to the US national debt. To pay for this, the government will cut many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy programmes.

It proposes ending most electric vehicle tax credits this year and all by the end of 2026, phasing out clean energy tax credits by 2032 and terminating residential efficiency credits by the end of 2025.

But while much attention has focused on the clean energy cuts, the bill could harm American energy and growth across the board, says research company Energy Innovation.

It would increase cumulative energy costs for all US households by more than $16bn by 2030, even if oil and gas production rises and fossil fuel prices fall as a result, says Energy Innovation.

These changes “create near-term impacts that persist over time”, adds the company, risking more than 830,000 jobs in 2030. This would result in a cumulative GDP decrease of more than $1tn by 2034.

“The IRA was arguably the single largest policy action taken anywhere in the world, and today the House has largely repealed that,” Manish Bapna, president and chief executive of the Natural Resources Defense Council, tells Sustainable Views. “I don’t anticipate a drop [in clean energy] in absolute terms, but growth will taper off. No policy is better than inconsistent policy.”

Clean energy warns of investment collapse

These losses in investment and jobs come in addition to the $10.9bn in cancelled clean energy and technology projects the US has already racked up this year, as companies attempt to navigate tariff chaos, the freezing of IRA grants and loans, and a regulatory environment undergoing major upheaval.

Renewable energy is undoubtedly the heaviest hit sector, and the share price of solar and wind companies fell in the hours following the vote.

Eighty-four per cent of investor respondents to a March survey by the American Council on Renewable Energy said they would scale back their investments if tax credits are repealed.

American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement that “there is a sensible way to phase down clean energy incentives”, but a sudden policy shift will wreak havoc on energy prices, workers and local economies across the country.

Meeting growing demand

Grumet pointed out that more than 90 per cent of electricity added to the grid in 2023 came from “the clean sources threatened by this legislation”.

While the Trump administration acknowledges increasing power demand — driven in large part by the growth of artificial intelligence — his executive orders so far have focused on boosting production of oil and gas, and even coal.

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, however, there is no realistic path to meeting growing electricity demand without a major scale-up of solar power.

Yet the bill’s changes to technology-neutral production tax credits will significantly slow deployment of new electricity-generating capacity just as demand is growing, says Energy Innovation. Its analysis projects a decrease in total new electricity capacity by 114 gigawatts by 2030, which would push up electricity costs by up to 50 per cent by 2035.

Fossil fuels stay quiet

Renewables companies have not been the only IRA beneficiaries. According to professional services company Baker Tilly, the IRA gave oil and gas entities access to nearly $500bn in new federal funding and tax credits — for renewables, but also for carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

While CCS receives sharp criticism from environmentalists for being costly and unproven, these credits have been widely used by fossil fuel companies and remain untouched in the current bill.

This makes CCS “the biggest winner” of the reconciliation bill, says Wood Mackenzie research analyst Rohan Dighe.

Chevron, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum have used the IRA’s CCS credits, with Exxon also using IRA credits to pursue “low-carbon hydrogen projects”.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in 2024 that he is “very supportive” of the IRA, which has “especially benefited” his company. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub said in 2022 that the IRA is “a net positive bill for us”.

However, conventional energy companies have been reluctant to comment on the reconciliation bill. BP, Occidental and Shell declined to comment “on a rapidly evolving process”. Other energy companies, including Exxon, did not respond to Sustainable Views’ request for comment.

Meanwhile, an American Petroleum Institute spokesperson points to a number of statements the association has published as the bill has progressed, in which its president and CEO, Mike Sommers, praises legislation “to ensure a smart regulatory framework for expanded American energy development” and that “supports American energy leadership”.

Justin Bibb, mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, says more businesses from across the economy should have been speaking up in support of the IRA. This is particularly true because “private sector pressure goes a lot further under this administration”, he tells Sustainable Views.

While local efforts to pursue clean energy projects will continue, “there is no substitute for federal investment in these projects at the state and local level”, Bibb says. “I will keep making the case to my delegates in the Senate and the House that if we want to see Ohio grow, we have to keep these tax credits in place.”",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/493039c3-bf9f-4ae1-85e0-9d7cbb6703d7.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:18:37.515515

The Senate was planning to vote Thursday on two other Congressional Review Act resolutions to block other California vehicle emissions rules by scrapping Biden-era EPA waivers.

The action comes after Senate Republicans took procedural steps Wednesday to defy the chamber’s parliamentarian, who had agreed with the Government Accountability Office in saying the waivers were not rules to be repealed under the CRA.

Slotkin joined her Democratic colleagues in opposing the GOP’s procedural maneuvers but ended up voting against the most contentious of California’s transportation rules.

“Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035,” Slotkin said in a statement.

“Michigan is the auto capital of the world, and as Michigan’s U.S. Senator, I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

The Congressional Review Act allows lawmakers and the president to repeal newly issued rules by simple majority. The Trump EPA submitted the waivers as rules so Congress could repeal them.

The Clean Air Act gives California leeway to enact tougher emissions standards than the federal government, as long as they receive permission. Michigan’s other Democratic senator, Gary Peters, voted against the resolution.

Slotkin, a former House member, promised during her Senate campaign that she would oppose any EV mandate. “What you drive is your call,” she said in one ad.

Democrats have been urging Senate Republicans against defying GAO and the parliamentarian. They forced a series of protest votes Wednesday to thwart the GOP’s plans.

“What you’re really doing here is for the fossil fuel industry, going nuclear, overruling the Senate parliamentarian, to accomplish a legislative task to amend, basically, the Congressional Review Act,” said Environment and Public Works ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

“The fossil fuel industry hates this clean air standard because it sells less gasoline in the states where the clean air standard is there.”

Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) helped persuade colleagues — including GOP moderates concerned about defying the parliamentarian — to pull the trigger.

“The decision to limit consumer choice, increase car prices, and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs was made by California, and approved by a federal administration that had already been rejected by the American voters,” Capito said in a floor speech.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ed/5e/74c47ec54621b3693795e66b3158/hegseth-confirmation-23846.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:20:06.252659

“Trucking is an industry of innovators.","Washington — The American Trucking Associations is calling today’s votes in the U.S. Senate nullifying California’s electric-vehicle mandate a “monumental victory” for the trucking industry, common sense, and consumers everywhere.

“California is the breeding ground of all bad public policy, and it’s long past time that our nation’s leadership in Washington stop abdicating its responsibility to unelected, cubicle-dwelling bureaucrats in Sacramento who have no understanding of the real world and how it works. Today’s Senate action sends a resounding message nationwide that this is not the United States of California, nor will it ever be,” said ATA President and CEO Chris Spear. “We appreciate the leadership of President Trump, EPA Administration Zeldin, and leaders in Congress who listened to our concerns and acted decisively to reverse this destructive rulemaking, which would have decimated our industry and unleashed a torrent of economic pain on the American families and businesses that we serve.”

Last month, ATA sent a letter urging Republican congressional leaders in the House and Senate to vote on two resolutions that will undo damaging regulations set by California and prevent the Golden State from setting de facto national vehicle policies. The House has already adopted the resolutions, leaving the Senate as the final hurdle necessary to clear these measures for the President’s signature.

The resolution that passed the Senate today was championed by Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Nebraska). It will revoke an EPA waiver that allowed California and other states to enforce its Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT) regulation. ACT, which has been adopted by 11 states, requires medium- and heavy-duty truck manufacturers to sell increasing percentages of zero-emission vehicles from 2024-2035.

Soon, the Senate is expected to advance another resolution championed by Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Oklahoma) that will revoke an EPA waiver that allowed California and other states to enforce its Low NOx Omnibus rule. This rule, which has been adopted by 10 states, imposes stringent emissions standards on new truck sales.

Both mandates are untethered from reality and would have been extraordinarily costly to fully implement. Even states that adopted the standards are acknowledging reality by scaling back and delaying implementation.

Trucks today produce 99% fewer nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter emissions than those on the road decades ago, and new trucks cut carbon emissions by over 40 percent compared to a truck manufactured in 2010. As a result, 60 of today’s trucks emit what just one truck did in 1988.

“Trucking is an industry of innovators.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate voted on Thursday to block California’s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, moving to kill the country’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration has doubled down on fossil fuels.

The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with a second one to block rules curbing tailpipe emissions from medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The Senate was also poised to pass a third measure later Thursday to overturn rules on smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three were approved by the House earlier this month.

The GOP effort, which comes after Senate Republicans established a new exception to the filibuster, could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends, especially because about a dozen states follow California’s lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will likely sue to keep the rules in place. Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should “send a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.”

“What we have at stake is also a state’s ability, it’s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,” Schiff said.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said ahead of the votes that the waivers would “end up not just affecting the state of California, but the whole country,” especially as around a dozen states have already followed California’s lead.

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Republicans have long criticized California’s waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Republicans created a procedural workaround through a series of votes on Wednesday that established a new Senate precedent and cleared the way for the vote.

Democrats fought the changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”

Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a “special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.

“The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,” Bozzella said.

The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), NASA’s top climate monitoring lab located above the diner made famous by Seinfeld, will close after nearly 60 years due to an executive order reviewing federal leases.

About 130 scientists are being forced to work remotely without a clear plan for relocation, as the administration seeks to slash NASA’s Earth science funding by 50%.

Despite the building’s modest lease and recent multimillion-dollar renovations, the shutdown appears driven more by ideology than cost-saving, sparking concern among former and current GISS scientists.

Key quote:

“They are trying to kill the messenger with the bad news, it’s crazy.”

— Dr. James Hansen, former director of GISS

Why this matters:

Climate science doesn’t happen in a vacuum — it needs infrastructure, continuity, and institutional support. GISS has played a critical role in shaping our understanding of global warming, from building the first climate models to documenting the accelerating pace of planetary heating. Its closure threatens not just a symbolic center of climate research, but the very mechanisms by which we monitor and respond to environmental change. Shuttering this lab sends a message that scientific expertise, especially in politically sensitive areas like climate, can be sidelined. The lab’s closure isn’t happening in isolation — it echoes a broader pattern of devaluing federal science, from vaccine research to weather forecasting.

In short:

Senate Republicans bypassed the usual 60-vote threshold to push through a resolution overturning U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waivers that permit California to impose stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal rules.

The maneuver invoked the Congressional Review Act in a “novel” way, despite objections from the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office, who said the act did not apply to the California waivers.

Democrats argued the move undermines Senate procedure and states’ rights, accusing Republicans of favoring the fossil fuel industry and setting a dangerous precedent for future legislative fights.

Key quote:

“In order to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, Republicans will erode away at the Senate and undermine this institution they claim to care about.”

— Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York

Why this matters:

California’s aggressive clean air policies have long set the pace for national vehicle emissions standards. Nearly a dozen other states follow its lead, making its rules de facto national benchmarks. Blocking California’s authority would not only reshape how climate policy is made in the U.S., but could also stall the transition away from fossil fuels in the transportation sector—one of the nation’s biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

In short:

The Interior Department will assess a request by Impossible Metals to mine nearly 30,000 square miles of seabed in U.S. territorial waters off American Samoa.

The move follows President Trump’s April executive order pushing federal agencies to expedite seabed mining permits, even in contested international waters.

Environmental and legal pushback continues, as critics say unilateral U.S. action violates international norms and risks deep-sea ecosystems that are poorly understood.

Key quote:

“As soon as the executive order came out, that very much directed the different groups to accelerate and prioritize deep-sea mining.”

— Oliver Gunasekara, CEO of Impossible Metals

Why this matters:

Deep-sea mining offers access to minerals like cobalt, nickel, and manganese — critical for electric vehicles, renewable energy, and defense technologies — but at potentially high environmental costs. These ecosystems, found thousands of feet below the ocean’s surface, remain largely unexplored and may host ancient life forms uniquely adapted to extreme pressure and darkness. Disrupting the seabed to extract mineral nodules could irreversibly damage fragile habitats and threaten species not yet studied by science. Moreover, sediment plumes and noise pollution from mining operations may ripple through the marine food chain.

While most countries await international consensus through the United Nations-backed International Seabed Authority, the U.S. — which never ratified the Law of the Sea treaty — is pushing ahead unilaterally. American Samoa, with limited political representation and a history of environmental vulnerability, stands at the intersection of global power, corporate ambition, and Indigenous rights.

In short:

An EF-3 tornado with 150-mph winds struck St. Louis on May 16, killing five people and destroying hundreds of structures, including historic Black-owned businesses.

Despite known gaps in emergency siren coverage and digital alert systems, no warnings reached many residents; half of North City heard no sirens, and many lacked smartphone access to modern notification platforms.

The Trump administration recently cut nearly $1 billion from Federal Emergency Management Agency programs intended for disaster resilience in Black and low-income neighborhoods and is actively attempting to dismantle the agency.

Key quote:

“We were giving people water not because they didn’t have pipes, but because they couldn’t afford it before the tornado.”

— Antoine White, rapper and organizer with HandsUp United

Why this matters:

Tornadoes don’t discriminate, but the systems meant to protect people from them often do. When a tornado ripped through St. Louis, it revealed how decades of racial segregation, underinvestment, and neglect put Black neighborhoods at greater risk. In places like North City, where emergency sirens failed and internet access is scarce, residents had no warning. The federal response was slow to arrive, just weeks after the government slashed funding designed to build safer infrastructure in vulnerable communities. These are not isolated incidents. Studies show that Black counties receive significantly less disaster preparedness funding, face higher insurance premiums, and suffer more damage during storms — even when weather conditions are identical. As climate change intensifies weather extremes, the disparity in who gets help and who doesn’t is widening.

In short:

UN climate chief Simon Stiell said clear climate policies can drive economic recovery and investment, pointing to recent droughts in Panama that disrupted global trade as a sign of worsening instability.

Rich nations face pressure to deliver promised climate finance, but funding gaps loom large after the U.S. pulled back from the Paris agreement and slashed foreign aid under President Trump.

A coalition of 80+ organizations urged the UK to boost climate finance through taxes on fossil fuels and luxury emissions, arguing public support is strong and action is a matter of global justice.

Key quote:

“Famine is back, and the role of global heating cannot be ignored.”

— Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change

Why this matters:

Climate-driven disruptions to trade, food supply, and infrastructure are no longer distant warnings — they’re reshaping the global economy now. The UN climate chief’s comments underscore how worsening droughts, like those hitting the Panama Canal choke off supply chains and inflate food prices, pushing millions toward hunger. Poorer nations, which have contributed least to global warming, are hit hardest and are struggling to build resilience without sufficient international help. Climate finance was designed to address this injustice, but promises made by wealthy countries are evaporating under new political leadership and shrinking aid budgets.

In short:

Glacial retreat in Alaska and British Columbia is transforming cold, sediment-choked rivers into clearer, warmer streams and lakes that could support expanding salmon populations in the decades to come.

At the same time, mining companies are rapidly staking claims in these newly exposed landscapes, fueled by record gold prices and high demand for copper, raising alarm among Indigenous groups and fisheries advocates.

Though new salmon habitat could emerge across nearly 4,000 miles of river by century’s end, much of it lies near existing or proposed mining sites, including projects without formal consent from downstream communities.

Key quote:

Are critical minerals “more critical than our lives? More critical than the fish?”

— Richard Peterson, president of the Tlingit and Haida government

Why this matters:

The race for minerals and the reshaping of ecosystems due to melting glaciers is a collision of environmental consequence and economic ambition. Salmon, already facing pressures from warming seas and dwindling freshwater flows, may find refuge in glacial waters that are now becoming more hospitable as ice recedes. But these same landscapes are becoming targets for mining companies lured by copper and gold, often aided by government subsidies. For Indigenous communities in Alaska and Canada, this trade-off is especially fraught: Salmon are both a vital food source and a cultural touchstone. As exploration moves into sensitive watersheds, calls are growing for stricter regulations, cross-border agreements, and Indigenous consent. Yet with glacial landscapes transforming faster than environmental policies can adapt, the outcome could determine whether these new salmon habitats become ecological lifelines or casualties of industrial expansion.

In short:

Pope Leo XIV, formerly Robert Prevost, has a history of environmental engagement, including partnerships with Indigenous and interfaith rainforest initiatives during his tenure in Latin America.

In past public remarks, he criticized exploitative interpretations of biblical dominion over nature, emphasized the need for reciprocity with the environment, and called for ethical scrutiny of new technologies.

His chosen papal name references Pope Leo XIII, whose 1891 encyclical launched modern Catholic social teaching, suggesting a similar commitment to confronting today’s economic and ecological crises.

Key quote:

""The great command that Jesus taught is to love your neighbor as yourself. We can't do that anymore without caring for creation, because the damage done to creation is undermining the well being of the neighbor.""

— Erin Lothes, environmental theologian with the Laudato Si’ Movement

Why this matters:

As climate disasters grow more frequent and severe, many faith leaders are amplifying calls to care for the Earth not just as a moral duty, but as a spiritual imperative. Pope Leo XIV, as an American with direct experience in Latin American environmental issues, is uniquely positioned to bridge cultural divides on climate discourse. His background also allows him to speak persuasively to industrialized nations most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. Faith-based advocacy has already pushed companies, governments, and communities toward renewable energy and conservation. By embracing ecological values as central to Catholic teaching, the new pope could invigorate grassroots and institutional efforts alike.

Every single Democratic member of the House voted against the bill.

This legislation introduces provisions that would effectively kill the job-creating investments in the Inflation Reduction Act by rendering the law’s tax credits for clean energy and advanced manufacturing unusable and sunsetting them early. Recently released modeling from Energy Innovation found that the Republican bill would cost Americans more than 830,000 jobs for just the year of 2030, and 720,000 jobs for just the year 2035. These numbers do not account for the likely cancellations of planned clean energy manufacturing facilities.

“These clean energy tax credits have been a game changer for communities across the nation, including in the districts of the Republican representatives,” said BlueGreen Alliance Executive Director Jason Walsh. “The GOP caved to the MAGA extremists in their party so they could screw over America’s workers to stuff the pockets of billionaires.”

Additional research suggests killing the credits will increase costs for American families. Other harmful provisions include:

Repealing the Clean Vehicle Tax Credits;

Repealing the Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit;

Clawing back unspent funds for air quality monitoring in schools, clean manufacturing, state and community energy programs, and electric grid upgrades;

Defunding and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), which reduces pollution and protects the health of workers and communities;

Clawing back all unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds, including many provisions that would have lowered energy bills, created jobs, and reduced pollution; and

Attacks on additional Inflation Reduction Act programs and initiatives.

“Every single Republican that said they were going to stand up for jobs in their districts either voted for this atrocity or didn’t vote,” said Walsh. “These folks just voted to kill good-paying jobs and huge private investment in their hometowns.”

In March, a group of Republican Representatives, led by Rep. Andrew Garbarino (NY-2), penned a letter calling for the protection of the tax credits. Those Representatives are: Reps. Juan Ciscomani (AZ-6), David Valadao (CA-22), Young Kim (CA-40), Earl “Buddy” Carter (GA-1), Mariannette Miller-Meeks (IA-1), Erin Houchin (IN-9), Don Bacon (NE-2), Thomas Kean, Jr. (NJ-7), Mark Amodei (NV-2), Nick LaLota (NY-1), Michael Lawler (NY-17), David Joyce (OH-14), Jennifer Kiggans (VA-2), Vince Fong (CA-20), Jeff Hurd (CO-3), Gabe Evans (CO-8), John James (MI-10), Ryan Mackenzie (PA-7), Rob Bresnahan (PA-8), Dan Newhouse (WA-4). While Garbarino himself did not show up for last night’s vote, all the other signers voted for the bill.

“Now the fight moves to the Senate. We urge all Americans to call their Senators and remind them who they work for.

Air testing by community groups can fill gaps in monitoring programs conducted by industry and state regulators, advocates say, and provide real-time alerts when accidents happen.
Several community groups said in a complaint in Louisiana federal court on Thursday that the law's ""onerous restrictions"" violate their rights to free speech and to petition the government.
""I'm not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs 'violates their constitutional rights,'"" Murril said in a statement to NPR.
""We've asked people, can you give us an example of where community air monitoring data has been misused in a government enforcement case?","Community groups in Louisiana have filed a federal lawsuit alleging a state law that regulates air-pollution monitoring violates their constitutional rights.

Private organizations have been using low-cost air sensors to detect toxic pollution from the state's refineries and chemical plants. The testing, some of which has been funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, serves as a critical line of defense, environmental and public health advocates say, especially for residents of an industrial corridor in Louisiana known as Cancer Alley. Air testing by community groups can fill gaps in monitoring programs conducted by industry and state regulators, advocates say, and provide real-time alerts when accidents happen.

Last year, Louisiana lawmakers put new requirements on those community testing activities. The law says that for community groups to allege violations of environmental rules, they have to use federally-approved monitoring equipment, and it sets restrictions for analyzing and sharing the data.

Several community groups said in a complaint in Louisiana federal court on Thursday that the law's ""onerous restrictions"" violate their rights to free speech and to petition the government.

""This is just an obvious attempt to keep citizen groups from doing any monitoring,"" says David Bookbinder, a lawyer for the plaintiffs and the director of law and policy at the Environmental Integrity Project, which helps frontline communities push for tough environmental standards.

""The impact has been muzzling — groups either stopping doing monitoring, not starting to do monitoring that they wanted to do or no longer publishing results,"" Bookbinder says.

The community groups' free-speech claims are based on Louisiana's alleged restrictions on ""publicly discussing, advocating for cleanup action, or warning people about potentially dangerous air pollution"" when it's detected using air monitors that don't meet federal standards, according to the Environmental Integrity Project.

Jo Banner, co-director of The Descendants Project, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, says the new law has made it harder to take action against polluters.

""We are prepared to just keep moving forward with the work that we've been doing and trying our best to communicate that to the public,"" Banner says. She adds, ""If we have [data] that is alarming, our community needs to know for their own safety.""

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she'll fight the lawsuit. ""I'm not sure how regulating community air monitoring programs 'violates their constitutional rights,'"" Murril said in a statement to NPR.

The state's Department of Environmental Quality declined to comment on pending litigation. The bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Eddie Lambert, didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

The air-monitoring law, which had bipartisan support, says the intent is to ensure the public gets ""accurate air quality information.""

David Cresson, chief executive of the Louisiana Chemical Association, said in a statement that the air-monitoring law doesn't prevent community groups from collecting or sharing data. ""What this law clarifies is that if air monitoring data is going to be used to trigger regulatory enforcement, penalties, or as the sole source for a lawsuit, it must meet the same EPA-approved standards already required of industry and government agencies,"" Cresson said.

Critics say ambiguities in the law are part of the problem

George Wyeth, a visiting scholar at the Environmental Law Institute, says the law is still concerning. For example, if community groups detect high levels of certain pollutants in their area and suggest there's been an environmental violation, it's unclear if that would break the new law. It's also unclear, Wyeth says, what groups have to do when they analyze and communicate air-pollution data to comply with the law.

""If I were a community member, I wouldn't know what some of these [requirements] meant, and I would probably just stay away from it,"" says Wyeth, a former EPA lawyer who isn't involved in the lawsuit.

Kentucky recently enacted a law that's similar to Louisiana's.

Those laws were passed following several years during which community groups conducted more air monitoring as lower-cost testing equipment became widely available, says Jay Benforado, board chair of the Association for Advancing Participatory Sciences, which isn't involved in the Louisiana lawsuit.

However, Benforado says it's unclear if there's an actual problem that needs solving by passing laws like those in Louisiana and Kentucky. ""We've asked people, can you give us an example of where community air monitoring data has been misused in a government enforcement case? And we haven't come across any examples,"" he says.

Banner of The Descendants Project says the Louisiana law effectively labels groups like hers as ""troublemakers.""

""If you want to see bipartisan cooperation, you should look to Louisiana and the way that we invite industry to come in, and the dangers that communities face,"" Banner says. ""And both sides, all sides, support this.""

Democratic state lawmakers who represent Banner's district didn't respond to a message seeking comment.

""It is the job of our regulatory agencies to protect us, to protect our air, to protect our health. And if that standard is not being met and people are going out to do it by themselves, that seems to be indicating that there's a problem at that first step,"" says Peter DeCarlo, an atmospheric chemist at Johns Hopkins University who has studied air pollution in Louisiana.

DeCarlo was part of a team of researchers that found the toxic gas ethylene oxide in parts of Louisiana at levels that were significantly higher than EPA estimates for the region. That suggests residents there face much greater cancer risks than previously thought, DeCarlo says.

""Now, there's retaliation against community groups for going out and trying to figure out what's going on in their air,"" DeCarlo says, ""and if they're being impacted, and how they're being impacted.""

Plans are in place to increase the power of the Northwest’s only commercial nuclear power plant, the Columbia Generating Station in Eastern Washington, to boost electrical output by 162 megawatts within six years.

It would be enough electricity, which could be reliably produced around the clock, to power about 125,000 more homes.

With some additional energy efficiency upgrades to boost the reactor’s capacity by 24 megawatts, the total gain would be 186 megawatts.

“This is a great value for ratepayers in the Pacific Northwest,” said John Hairston, BPA administrator and chief executive officer, in a statement. “Upgrading an existing resource to provide additional reliable energy will help BPA keep pace with its customers growing electricity needs and keep rates low.

The project, called an extended power uprate, would be done over the next three biennial spring refueling outages in 2027, 2029 and 2031.

Columbia Generating Station, a 1,207-megawatt plant near Richland, is already the third largest electricity generator in Washington state. It now provides enough electricity to power approximately one million homes in the Pacific Northwest.

BPA approval

The plan to increase reactor output was approved by the Bonneville Power Administration on Tuesday following 18 months of analysis, Energy Northwest said.

BPA and Energy Northwest will collaborate on planning and implementation of the plant improvements.

Columbia Generating Station is owned and operated by Energy Northwest, but BPA markets the energy produced and pays for all of the costs which are included in the revenue requirements of the power services rate structure.

The increased output would be achieved by replacing and upgrading reactor equipment, including turbines, heat exchangers and the generator, said Energy Northwest.

Significant modifications would be needed on major pieces of equipment, but the work would coincide with equipment replacement already planned, BPA said on its website.

The upgrades include replacing aging equipment with components designed for better performance and to help the reactor operate reliably for another 20 or more years.

The reactor began commercial operation in late 1984 under a 40-year license that was issued a year earlier and already has been granted one 20-year license renewal.

About 30 individual upgrades, primarily focused on increasing the size of pumps and motors, are planned.

For the nuclear plant’s spring outage currently underway, 2,000 additional workers were hired and the upgrades planned for the next three outages will create more new job opportunities for skilled workers, Energy Northwest said.

During outages, a third of the reactor’s 764 fuel assemblies are swapped out for new ones and maintenance and other work that cannot be done while the plant is operating is undertaken.

Energy Northwest’s nuclear future

Nuclear energy facilities have successfully implemented extended power uprates since the 1970s to boost clean energy generation at existing plants, said Energy Northwest.

“We applaud BPA for its decision to approve this project and for its strategic vision in advancing our region’s future with additional, reliable capacity that nuclear energy can provide,” said Bob Schuetz, Energy Northwest chief executive officer.

“Their leadership in supporting this initiative underscores a commitment to affordable and carbon-free electricity for the Northwest region, including our public power member utilities and their customers,” he said.

Energy Northwest also is pursuing separately a plan to add a small modular nuclear reactor project using advanced X-energy reactors placed near the Columbia Generating Station.

It got a jump start in October when Amazon announced that it would pay for the initial feasibility phase of the project. The project, which would be developed in phases, could eventually have a total generating capacity of up to 960 megawatts.

WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives has passed a budget reconciliation bill that inflicts a barrage of cuts and imposes policy moves that will impact everyone who cares about our clean air, clean water, public lands, and fighting climate change.

The version of the bill that passed this morning includes even deeper cuts that would effectively eliminate clean energy tax credits. This is a bad decision that will hurt communities in the South that have seen huge economic investments and new manufacturing jobs as a direct result of these programs.

The Southern Environmental Law Center is calling on the Senate to do the right thing and restore these fundamental protections in that chamber’s version of the bill.

“The House-passed bill puts the health of our clean air, water, forests, and economic progress in the South on the line. Now, will the Senate listen to their many constituents concerned about being denied affordable clean energy, about their public resources sold off, and about allowing polluters to pay their way out of the environmental review process?” said SELC Federal Affairs Director Nat Mund.

SELC’s energy, public lands, and climate experts are available for interviews. More information on how this bill would hurt states in the South is available here.

SELC is especially concerned with these provisions in the bill:

Gutting clean energy tax credits: The bill would effectively repeal clean energy tax credits that have driven one of the fastest-growing sectors of the US economy. This will increase costs for consumers and create uncertainty that will hurt investments in the South.

“Pay to Play” for polluters: The bill allows polluters to avoid oversight by paying a fee, dramatically limiting judicial review that would ensure they are following the laws. This means less community input, tipping the scale in favor of well-funded corporations at the expense of small businesses, underserved communities, and ecosystems and species that can’t speak for themselves.

The republican bill instead channels that money to wealthy elites, increasing the deficit by trillions of dollars along the way.

Republicans in Congress released their 389-page proposal last Tuesday and, as expected, it included several provisions to eliminate popular clean energy credits which were driving a boost in American manufacturing.

The credits were largely established under President Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which raised hundreds of billions of dollars through tax enforcement on wealthy individuals and corporations and channeled that into energy efficiency credits for American families.

We’ve covered how families could save thousands of dollars on upgrades to lower their energy costs through these credits.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

But these credits aren’t just money-saving for Americans, they also work to boost American manufacturing, due to various provisions in the bill, particularly around the $7,500 EV tax credit which was limited to cars that undergo final assembly in North America.

While loopholes exist, nevertheless the bill resulted in a massive expansion of American manufacturing, driving hundreds of billions of dollars of investment and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

But now, republicans in Congress have voted to roll much of that progress back. The final vote tally was 215-214, with one additional representative voting “present” (which means 215 out of 430, or 50%, of representatives voted Yea, which is not actually a majority). All Democrats voted against the job-killing measure, while only two republicans, Davidson (R-OH) and Massie (R-KY), voted to support American jobs, and Harris (R-MD) voted “present.”

Here’s a list of the bill’s various effects related to clean air and energy (via the BlueGreen Alliance):

Attaching restrictions to clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that would make them unusable in practical terms while also “sunsetting” those tax credits early, a move that research suggests will increase costs for American families;

Repealing the Clean Vehicle Tax Credits;

Repealing the Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit;

Clawing back unspent funds for air quality monitoring in schools, clean manufacturing, state and community energy programs, and electric grid upgrades;

Defunding and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), which reduces pollution and protects the health of workers and communities;

Clawing back all unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds, including many provisions that would have lowered energy bills, created jobs, and reduced pollution; and

Attacks on many additional Inflation Reduction Act programs and initiatives.

The finalized bill went through some changes, though those changes primarily made the bill worse for American jobs and clean air. For example, it seems that the bill has snuck in a repeal of EPA pollution rules that will save thousands of American lives and $100 billion per year (see sec 42201), in yet another Congressional overreach.

It also seems to have incorporated republicans’ ridiculous proposal to add a punitive fee on EVs, in the amount of $250/year. That fee was originally proposed as a way to eliminate the federal gas tax, and was accompanied by a $20/year fee on gas cars, but republicans dropped the latter fee and boosted the EV fee, with the final effect that it would increase the deficit by billions.

You can perhaps see a pattern in these effects: they’re primarily targeted towards increasing costs for regular American families who were taking advantage of these tax credits, and towards programs that would keep you and your children healthier.

Previous analyses show how repealing these tax credits would lead to increased electricity prices for all Americans.

It should not be any surprise to anyone that has been paying attention that republicans want to poison you and raise your costs, but some people apparently still need more examples, so here we are.

In particular, the bill eliminates the US EV tax credit which had driven so much of that investment due to its domestic manufacturing provision (though there are some small carveouts). Not only does that inflate the cost of the best vehicles available today for Americans, it also takes away one of the incentives that was driving investment in US manufacturing.

And the bill specifically harms Tesla more than it harms Tesla’s competitors, despite its CEO, Elon Musk, being the richest republican donor on the planet.

We’ve warned before that a bill like this would just send more EV jobs to China, a country where nobody is “debating” over which direction the auto industry is going. Chinese automakers all know the industry is going electric, and they’re putting all of their effort into it.

This is quite a contrast with Western automakers which keep hemming and hawing, begging their governments to let them go bankrupt with anti-EV policy decisions that will only slow down their transition towards modernizing to the global EV status quo.

We’ve already seen the effects of other poor policy decisions on manufacturing, with several companies pausing or canceling plans to build manufacturing facilities in North America as a result of tariff chaos at the hands of an ignoramus. Republican districts have been hit hardest, as they were where the majority of this investment had been going.

And we’ve seen it made clear that the republicans in government responsible for protecting clean air would rather poison you and raise your fuel costs, as long as it helps the oil industry which bribed them into their position.

But then, the cherry on top of today’s tax bill is that its cuts of these credits don’t even have a greater budgetary purpose. Not only was the Inflation Reduction Act revenue-positive – which is to say, it raised more money than it spent, thus reducing the deficit – today’s republican tax bill is revenue-negative, which is to say, it will increase the deficit.

The republican proposal raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, and it makes use of virtually all of that headroom, as the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that it will add $3.7 trillion to US debt. This is largely due to the bill’s significant giveaways to wealthy elites, with the majority of tax cuts targeted at the wealthiest Americans.

So the government isn’t even getting any savings out of this bill, merely channeling more money from working families to the wealthy elites that the republican party has always tried to benefit (including in other ways than the clean energy credits, like by cutting health care for the poor).

The bill will now go on to the Senate, where republicans already showed this morning they will do anything, even if it’s illegal, to harm Americans. If you have a republican Senator, it might be worth letting them know that you support American jobs and clean air, and keeping costs low for Americans, and therefore oppose this bill.

The argument could be made stronger in states that have received significant investment as a result of the credits the bill repeals. EV projects are particularly popular in states like Georgia, North Carolina, and others along the burgeoning US “battery belt”. An interactive tool showing the jobs jeopardized by this republican plan, including the ability to sort by state or Congressional district, is available here.

Otherwise, you can find your Senator on Congress’ website, and then search for the contact form on your Senator’s website to get in contact with them.

Of course, if you have a Democratic Senator, it’s also worth letting them know that you oppose the tax bill, just in case a few of them decide to jump ranks and join the republicans in harming America. We certainly hope they don’t, and are encouraged by the fact that every Democrat in the House made the right decision here, but anything could happen.

Among the bill’s cuts is the rooftop solar credit. That means you could have only until the end of this year to install rooftop solar on your home, before republicans raise the cost of doing so by an average of ~$10,000. So if you want to go solar, get started now, because these things take time and the system needs to be active before you file for the credit.

To make sure you find a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out EnergySage, a free service that makes it easy for you to go solar. It has hundreds of pre-vetted solar installers competing for your business, ensuring you get high-quality solutions and save 20-30% compared to going it alone. Plus, it’s free to use, and you won’t get sales calls until you select an installer and share your phone number with them.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Capitol_Building_Full_View-public-domain-e1713472940371.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-22 14:18:41.691726

He threatened to block or delay the confirmation process for four Trump nominees to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency if Senate Republicans voted to overturn California’s vehicle emission standards.
This year, the share of zero-emission vehicle sales has slightly slumped, making up only 23% of light-duty vehicle sales.
The Senate Parliamentarian, a non-partisan advisor to the congressional body, upheld that interpretation, ruling that the Senate couldn’t use the Congressional Review Act to repeal California’s waivers.","The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate defied congressional norms and voted Thursday to revoke California’s progressive vehicle emission standards, including a rule that would’ve effectively banned the sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035.

In a 51-44 vote, the Senate overturned a Biden-era waiver that enabled California and a contingent of Democratic-led states to enforce zero-emission requirements for the sale of new passenger vehicles. After several hours of debate and testimony, legislators struck down a landmark regulation that aimed to drastically accelerate electric vehicle sales in California and nearly a dozen other states that chose to follow its lead, substantially reducing air pollution and planet-warming carbon emissions from tailpipes.

The Advanced Clean Cars II rule, enacted in 2022 by the California Air Resources Board and granted a federal waiver by the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024, required car manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission or plug-in hybrid vehicles to California dealerships over the next decade. Starting next year, the rule would have mandated that 35% of all new vehicles supplied to California dealerships be zero-emission vehicles or plug-in hybrids. By 2035, it would’ve prohibited the sale of new, gas-only cars statewide.

By invalidating the rule, Republican senators stamped out one of California’s most ambitious environmental policies and, more broadly, challenged the state’s authority to enact vehicle standards to combat its notoriously unhealthy air quality. If the measure is signed into law by President Trump and survives impending legal challenges, the vote would serve as a coup de grace to the state’s decades-long efforts to comply with federal smog standards in Southern California and meet California’s own ambitious climate goals.

The zero-emission requirements were expected to eliminate nearly 70,000 tons of smog-forming emissions and 4,500 tons of soot statewide by 2040, preventing more than 1,200 premature deaths and providing $13 billion in public health benefits, according to the California Air Resources Board. It also was expected to prevent the release of 395 million metric tons of carbon emissions — roughly the amount released by 100 coal plants in a year.

Ahead of the vote, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) warned that nullifying this rule and stripping California’s regulatory power would have serious health effects across the state.

“We are sowing poison seeds for the future,” Schiff said. “Seeds that will grow to be more asthma and more sickness and more hospitalization and more death. That is the bleak but blatant reality of what we are debating here today.”

Republicans, however, argued that California’s zero-emission requirements threatened to cripple the American auto industry and significantly limit the options for car buyers.

“Democrats have this delusional dream of eliminating gas-powered vehicles in America,” Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said Tuesday from a lectern on the floor of the U.S. Capitol. “They want to force-feed electric vehicles to every man and woman who drives in this country. Well, Republicans are ready to use the Congressional Review Act to end this Democrat electric vehicle fantasy.”

In separate votes, Republicans also rolled back additional California clean-air rules that require the state’s heavy-duty truck fleet to adopt cleaner engines and a growing percentage of zero-emission vehicles.

Republicans moved ahead with the votes despite the warnings from the Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian that the waivers could not be overturned with the Congressional Review Act — a law that was meant to allow legislators to inspect and potentially block federal rules adopted in the waning days of a previous presidential administration.

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, said the vote was a flagrant abuse of the Congressional Review Act. He threatened to block or delay the confirmation process for four Trump nominees to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency if Senate Republicans voted to overturn California’s vehicle emission standards.

“It appears that Republicans want to overturn half a century of precedent in order to undermine California’s ability to protect the health of our residents by using the Congressional Review Act to revoke California’s waivers that allow us to set our own vehicle emission standards,” Padilla said. “Republicans seem to be putting the wealth of the big oil industry over the health of our constituents.”

Environmental advocates, many of whom had spent years supporting California’s emissions standards, expressed their disappointment in the vote.

“This is a major blow to the decades-long public health protections delivered under the Clean Air Act,” said Will Barrett, senior director of nationwide clean air advocacy for the American Lung Assn. “It is more important than ever that California and all other states that rely on Clean Air Act waivers continue to cut tailpipe pollution through homegrown, health-protective policies.”

Because of its historically poor air quality, California has been an innovator in clean car policy, enacting the nation’s first tailpipe emissions standards in 1966. California was later granted the special authority to adopt vehicle emission standards that are more strict than the federal government’s under the Clean Air Act. But the state must seek a federal waiver from the U.S. EPA for any specific rule to be enforceable.

In the five decades since then, the state has enacted dozens of rules to reduce air pollution and planet-warming greenhouse gases. Padilla stressed that these rules were largely meant to alleviate lung-aggravating smog, which was a persistent threat where he grew up in Los Angeles.

“On a pretty regular basis, we would be sent home from grade school because of the intensity and dangers of smog that settled over the San Fernando Valley,” Padilla said. “That’s the case for far too many Californians, still to this day. But it’s the reason why, decades ago, Congress recognized both California’s unique air quality challenges and its technical ingenuity, and granted California special authority to do something about it.”

Due to its enormous economy and population, automakers have conformed to California’s rules. In addition, many Democrat-led states have chosen to adhere to California’s auto emissions rules, applying more pressure on car companies first to make cleaner engines and later to manufacture more electric vehicles.

California leads the nation in zero-emission vehicle sales. In 2023 and 2024, about 25% of new cars sold in California were zero-emission or plug-in hybrids, according to the California Energy Commission. This year, the share of zero-emission vehicle sales has slightly slumped, making up only 23% of light-duty vehicle sales.

But the Advanced Clean Cars II rule would require a jump in manufacturer sales next year, with at least 35% of vehicles supplied to car dealer lots to be zero-emission or plug-in hybrids.

Mike Stanton, president of the National Automobile Dealers Assn., contended that consumer demand for electric vehicles falls far below California’s requirements, in part, because of unreliable charging infrastructure.

“Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,” Stanton wrote in a letter to senators, referring to the California Air Resources Board.

Environmental groups vehemently disagreed, arguing that the zero-emission requirements were paramount to resolving California’s unique air quality woes. They stressed there was no requirement for other states to adopt these standards, but electric vehicles could help boost domestic manufacturing and save drivers money by eliminating the need for gas.

“This vote is an unprecedented and reckless attack on states’ legal authority to address the pollution causing asthma, lung disease and heart conditions,” said Manish Bapna, president of Natural Resources Defense Council. “After a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign from Big Oil, Republicans readily jettisoned their long-held view that states can best enact measures that reflect the values and interests of their residents.”

In February, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin brought the Biden-era waivers to Congress, suggesting that they were federal rules that had not been reviewed. However, none of California’s waivers for the state’s vehicle emission standards had been brought before Congress for review, because they were largely regarded as administrative orders.

The House of Representatives voted this month to advance the resolution to the Senate. Thirty-five Democratic lawmakers, including California Reps. George Whitesides (D-Agua Dulce) and Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana), joined with the Republican majority.

In the Senate, the 51-44 vote was largely split along party lines, although Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), whose state is home to the Big Three automakers, voted with Republicans.

Conservative legislators then turned their attention to voting to repeal California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which would’ve required a significant percentage of medium- and heavy-duty truck sales be zero-emission by 2035. They also terminated a rule that established cleaner engine standards and required warranties for new heavy-duty vehicles.

Experts say the Senate vote could have lasting implications for congressional procedures.

To topple California auto emission standards, Senate Republicans controversially invoked the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that allows an incoming Congress to rescind major federal rules approved near the end of a previous presidential administration. This process notably allows federal legislators to bypass a filibuster and requires only a simple majority to repeal federal rules rather than the typical 60 votes.

However, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan government watchdog, said federal waivers for California emission standards were not subject to the Congressional Review Act, because the federal waiver is technically not a rule; it’s an order. The Senate Parliamentarian, a non-partisan advisor to the congressional body, upheld that interpretation, ruling that the Senate couldn’t use the Congressional Review Act to repeal California’s waivers.

The Senate vote proceeded in defiance of the parliamentarian’s ruling, marking a stunning rebuke of congressional norms.

The decision by Republican senators amounted to a “nuclear option” that would set a dangerous precedent, Padilla said.

“The old adage says, ‘What goes around comes around,’” he said. “It won’t be long before Democrats are once again in the driver’s seat, in the majority once again. And when that happens, all bets would be off.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c867597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F88%2F7d%2F95dd9dc84adfb030e0ff003752cc%2Felectric-vehicle-charging-explainer-44124.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:20:24.801836

At a time when political divisions run deep, clean energy remains a rare point of common ground.","The Wisconsin Public Service Commission should reject the proposal to build a new methane gas plant in Oak Creek and Paris.

Wisconsin is standing at a crossroads when it comes to our energy future. The state’s Public Service Commission (PSC) is reviewing a $2.2 billion proposal from We Energies to build new methane gas plants in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek and the Kenosha County Town of Paris. The choice is clear: double down on expensive, outdated fossil fuels—or invest in the clean energy solutions that are already creating jobs, lowering costs, and strengthening communities here in Wisconsin and across the country.

But this decision is about more than utility policy—it’s a test of leadership. The PSC, made up of three commissioners appointed by Governor Tony Evers, has the power to either help advance Wisconsin’s clean energy and economic goals or make it far harder to get there.

As someone who’s been an environmental manager, small business owner, nonprofit leader, and now a village president, I’ve seen firsthand that clean energy isn’t a burden—it’s one of Wisconsin’s greatest opportunities. But it requires bold, evidence-based choices.

The proposed gas plants would lock Wisconsin into decades of volatile fuel prices and higher utility bills. Meanwhile, battery storage technology—now 90% cheaper than a decade ago—is already replacing gas plants in states like Texas, California, and Alaska.

Rather than sink billions into fossil fuel infrastructure, Wisconsin should modernize its grid, turn old fossil fuel sites into clean energy hubs, and focus on battery storage, energy efficiency, and demand response. These solutions are cost-effective, faster to deploy, and better for our climate and economy.

Clean Energy Means Jobs and Growth

Clean energy is not only good for the planet—it’s good business. In Milwaukee’s Menomonee Valley, union workers are building and repairing wind turbines, helping revitalize a proud manufacturing area. Across Wisconsin, over 350 companies are part of the clean energy supply chain, from smart grid technology to renewable energy and electric vehicle components. This is Wisconsin’s chance to lead, not lag.

We have the people, the infrastructure, and the research power—especially through the UW System—to become a hub for clean energy innovation and investment. But we need a coordinated state strategy to turn this potential into reality.

The Business Community Is Paying Attention

Major companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta are committing to run on 100% carbon-free energy by 2030, and they’re shaping where investment flows. If Wisconsin fails to modernize its grid and support clean energy, we risk falling behind—and losing the jobs and industries of the future.

Even more troubling, the gas plant proposal relies heavily on the anticipated energy needs of data centers, but neither utilities nor tech companies have provided clear details on how much energy will be needed, when, or who will pay. Microsoft has already paused construction in Mount Pleasant to reassess its energy needs.

The PSC must ask tough questions before putting Wisconsin ratepayers on the hook for billions: What are the real energy demands? When will they materialize? And how long will this infrastructure remain useful?

Let’s Lead, Not Fall Behind

Wisconsin has the tools and resources to lead on clean energy—what’s missing is a clear, coordinated, integrated resource plan. We need a smart energy strategy that keeps energy affordable, resilient, and forward-looking.

At a time when political divisions run deep, clean energy remains a rare point of common ground. It’s about jobs, innovation, savings, and energy independence. Let’s ensure Wisconsin is known not for clinging to the past, but for building a clean, sustainable energy future that reflects our values and moves us forward.",https://upnorthnewswi.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/05/copy-of-website-feature-image-38.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:19:27.629040

Key Terms Under PFE Rules As noted above, a Prohibited Foreign Entity (“PFE”) is a Specified Foreign Entity (“SFE”) or a Foreign-Influenced Entity (“FIE”).","On May 22, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a highly anticipated piece of legislation - commonly referred to as “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill” (the “Bill”) - by a mostly party-line vote of 215-214-1 (two Republicans and all Democrats voted against it and one Republican voted present) that would make significant changes to the tax law if enacted. The Bill makes substantial cutbacks to various tax credits (the “Applicable Credits”) that were created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) (which, under current law, were generally available through the end of 2032) and imposes expanded foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions. While advanced nuclear facilities would only experience a one-year credit window haircut under the Bill, other technologies that currently qualify under the “tech-neutral” Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) (§ 45Y) and the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) (§ 48E) would be eliminated under the Bill if construction of the applicable facility did not begin before 60 days after enactment.

Below is a high-level summary of the key changes to the Applicable Credits. The Bill uses both the Begun Construction (“BOC”) and Placed in Service (“PIS”) dates for a project to constrain the availability of the Applicable Credits. Where relevant, we have noted with an asterisk where the version of the Bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives deviates from the draft released on May 12, 2025. While the Bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives, it is expected to be modified while under consideration in the Senate.

SURVIVING CREDITS: The Bill would modify but preserve the following credits:

Advanced Manufacturing PTC (§ 45X); Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (§ 45Q); Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (§ 45U); Clean Fuel PTC (§ 45Z) and Energy Property ITC for Geothermal Heat Property (§ 48).

The Clean Fuel PTC (§ 45Z) is the only surviving credit that would be extended (it was scheduled to terminate at the end of 2027 but would be extended an additional four years under the Bill.)

CREDITS ELIMINATED: The Bill would generally eliminate the following credits:

*Clean Electricity PTC (§ 45Y) (safe harbor for projects with a BOC date before 60 days after enactment and have a PIS date before 2029);

An advanced nuclear facility would remain eligible so long as BOC is before December 31, 2028.

Certain leasing arrangements where the Residential Clean Energy Credit (§ 25D) would be available to the lessee if it owned the relevant property would also be eligible for the credit for any taxable year beginning after enactment.

*Clean Electricity ITC (§ 48E) (safe harbor for projects with a BOC date before 60 days after enactment and have a PIS date before 2029);

An advanced nuclear facility (or expansion of a nuclear facility) would remain eligible so long as BOC is before December 31, 2028.

Certain leasing arrangements where the Residential Clean Energy Credit (§ 25D) would be available to the lessee if it owned the relevant property would also be eligible for the credit for any taxable year beginning after enactment.

Clean Hydrogen PTC (§45V) (safe harbor for projects with a BOC date before December 31, 2025);

The following residential tax credits for energy efficiency and clean energy would generally expire at the end of 2025: Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (§ 25C), Residential Clean Energy Credit (§ 25D), New Energy Efficient Home Credit (§ 45L); and

The following credits related to clean vehicles would generally expire at the end of 2025: Clean Vehicle Credit (§ 30D), Previously-Owned Clean Vehicles Credit (§ 25E), Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (§ 30C), Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit (§ 45W).

*TRANSFERABILITY: The Bill would substantially limit the ability to transfer certain Applicable Credits pursuant to §6418. Transferability would not be available to facilities with BOC dates falling after the second anniversary of the enactment of the Bill for the Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (§ 45Q). Transferability would not be available for the Clean Fuel PTC (§45Z) or Advanced Manufacturing PTC (§ 45X) for credits generated after 2027.

FEOC RULES: The Bill contains new Prohibited Foreign Entity (“PFE”) rules that are applicable to the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) (§ 48E); the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) (§ 45Y); the Advanced Manufacturing PTC (§ 45X); the Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (§ 45Q); the Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (§ 45U); the Clean Fuel PTC (§ 45Z) and the Energy Property ITC for Geothermal Heat Property (§ 48) (the “Restricted Credits”). These rules are more expansive than the original § 30D FEOC restriction. The PFE rules applicable to the Restricted Credits generally make such credits unavailable to taxpayers claiming them when such taxpayers are deemed to be (by designation, ownership, control or certain financial relations) either a Specified Foreign Entity (“SFE”) or a Foreign-Influenced Entity (“FIE”). The PFE rules would further limit availability of a subset of the Restricted Credits (the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit (§ 48E), the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (§ 45Y) and the Advanced Manufacturing PTC (§ 45X)) in cases where it is deemed that the credit-generating investment or activity was facilitated by “material assistance” from a PFE or where the taxpayer makes certain types of prohibited payments to one or more PFEs of an amount that reach a specified threshold.

New Prohibited Foreign Entity Rules

A Prohibited Foreign Entity (“PFE”) is a Specified Foreign Entity (“SFE”) or a Foreign-Influenced Entity (“FIE”). The key terms used in this summary are defined in more detail below.

Key Terms Under PFE Rules

As noted above, a Prohibited Foreign Entity (“PFE”) is a Specified Foreign Entity (“SFE”) or a Foreign-Influenced Entity (“FIE”).

Specified Foreign Entity (“SFE”) means any one of the following:

An FEOC, as described in specified sections of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”), which is generally a foreign terrorist organization, but is specifically:

An entity designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189);

An entity included on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury;

An entity alleged by the Attorney General to have been involved in activities for which a conviction was obtained under certain national security laws; or

An entity determined by the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to the national security or foreign policy of the United States.

An entity on the 1260H List (a Chinese military company operating in the United States);

An entity on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity List;

A listed Chinese battery and energy storage manufacturer (specifically, the entities listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) on page 47 of L. 118-31); or

A foreign-controlled entity, which includes at a high level:

The governments of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation or the Islamic Republic of Iran (each a “Covered Nation”);

A citizen, national or resident of a Covered Nation (with some exceptions);

An entity incorporated or having its principal place of business in a Covered Nation; and

An entity controlled by an entity described above.

Foreign-Influenced Entity (“FIE”) means an entity for which an SFE:

Can appoint a covered officer (i.e., a board member; executive-level officer, including president, CEO, COO, CFO, general counsel or senior vice president or an individual with similar powers or responsibilities);

Owns 10% or more of the FIE;

In aggregate with any other SFE, owns 25% or more of the FIE;

In aggregate with any other SFE, holds 25% or more of the FIE’s debt; or

During the previous tax year, receives 10% or more of all dividends, interest, compensation for services, rentals or royalties, guarantees or any other fixed, determinable, annual or periodic amount, from the FIE and which the FIE makes knowingly or with reason to know.

Covered payments that trigger the restrictions discussed above have two features: type and amount. The payment type must be dividends, interest, compensation for services, rentals or royalties, guarantees or any other fixed, determinable, annual or periodic amount. The amount of the payment must be equal to or greater than 5% of the taxpayer’s total expenditures during such taxable year that are related to the credit-generating investment or activity (or, in the case of multiple payments, 15% or more of same).

Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity means any property that meets the following criteria: (i) any component, subcomponent, or critical mineral (as defined in section 45X(c)(6)) included in such property that is extracted, process, recycled, manufactured, or assembled by a PFE; and (ii) any design of such property which is based on a copyright or patent held by a PFE or any know-how or trade secret provided by a PFE.",https://www.akingump.com/a/web/b3vrhViDbSyqFP3zdnqLdL/apzWfE/house-passes-major-cuts-to-ira-clean-energy-tax-credit-provisions.png,N,,2025-05-22 14:19:31.797287

Previously available on Silverado and Colorado, the newly available lifted off-road trim offers customers the added capability they expect from a Trail Boss with the benefits of an electric truck.

“Trail Boss has been one of the highest turning trims in our portfolio since we first launched it on the 2019 Silverado,” says Scott Bell, vice president of Chevrolet. “Adding Trail Boss to Silverado EV gives customers an option that builds on our strong truck pedigree, high electric range and off-road capability.”

With a 2-inch lift, the Trail Boss has 24 percent higher ground clearance than the base Silverado EV. The coil suspension is uniquely tuned with a hydraulic rebound control system.

Trim-exclusive Terrain mode is available at low speeds and offers additional control when maneuvering areas with uneven terrain. Compared to Normal mode, Terrain mode unlocks sharper 4-Wheel Steer, giving drivers better ability to control torque and traction at low speeds.

Paired with other drive modes, including off-road mode and Sidewinder mode, the Silverado EV Trail Boss is ready for adventure.

“The Silverado EV Trail Boss delivers similar capability expected with other Chevy Trail Bosses,” says Joe Roy, chief engineer for Silverado EV. “It’s an impressive truck that will meet the needs of our customers looking to get off trail and still have all the features customers have come to love about Silverado EV, including range and off-road power.”

Sidewinder, first introduced on RST trim vehicles, allows all four wheels to turn in the same direction and move the truck diagonally at low speeds. Selectable from the infotainment screen, the feature gives drivers a new way to conquer everything from rugged terrain to tight parking spaces.

The Trail Boss version with the extended range battery pack offers a max towing of 12,500lb and 2,100 lbs. of payload. Up to 725 horsepower and 775 lbs.-ft of torque is available with the Max Range battery pack.

Beyond capability, the Silverado EV Trail Boss includes the following trim-exclusive design features:

High-angle approach front fascia

Rugged 35-inch all-terrain tires with unique 18-inch wheels

Exterior badging

Unique interior

Red front tow hooks

For those looking to customize their rig, auxiliary switches are easily accessible for accessory lights and more.

Silverado EV is available in nine exterior colors, including three new options: White Sands; Polar White Tricoat; and Magnus Gray Matte Metallic.

Silverado EV also offers Super Cruise enhancements, including integration with Google Maps that navigates to the correct lane for your chosen route with ease when on Super Cruise-capable roads.

What’s more, newly added hands-on functionality keeps you centered in your lane and adapts to the speed of the driver ahead, all while your hands remain on the steering wheel. Then, when you reach a Super Cruise-enabled road, the steering wheel lightbar turns green and hands-free driving will automatically engage for added comfort.

Adaptive Cruise control has also been upgraded so the driver can choose to automatically adjust speed to match posted speed limits. Super Cruise with towing is available on LT and Trail Boss.

With three trims — Work Truck, LT and Trail Boss — Chevrolet offers a Silverado EV for every price point, capability need and lifestyle. The Silverado EV lineup has expanded to provide customers with more choice, and now the brand will sunset the launch trim RST. The 2026 Silverado EV has a starting MSRP of $54,895 and continues to offer:

Up to 10.2kW of off-board power available on all trims

Multi-Flex Midgate available on LT and Trail Boss

WOW mode to unlock max horsepower and torque available on LT and Trail Boss

22-inch wheels available on WT and LT

17.7-inch-diagonal center infotainment screen paired with 11-inch-diagonal driver informational center standard on all trims, including Work Truck for the first time.

American car companies will be outmatched.","Not too long ago, Republicans and Democrats could find common ground on clean air and water. But we are in a darker time now.

We are far from the days when conservative heroes Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan signed the Clean Air Act in 1970 and the Montreal Protocol in 1987, landmark initiatives that put the health of Americans over the interests of polluters.

Instead, this week, Senate Republicans are illegally using the Congressional Review Act to undermine California’s work to make and keep the air breathable. Eliminating California’s clean-air waivers is an attack on decades of work that began in earnest when then-Governor Reagan established the state’s Air Resources Board in 1967.

SENATE GOP VOWS VOTE TO END BIDEN EPA WAIVER GRANTED TO PUSH DRIVERS TO EV CARS

California’s clean-air standards, which 17 other states have chosen to follow, have pushed American car companies to innovate — and to become globally competitive.

Global electric car sales rose by 35% in the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by the growing affordability of electric models. American companies founded right here in California pioneered electric vehicles, but we risk losing our advantage in the global marketplace.

China is now the world’s EV manufacturing hub, responsible for more than 70% of global production, with Chinese imports making up three-quarters of the increase in EV sales across all emerging economies outside of China in 2024. Meanwhile, the U.S. has become a net importer of electric cars. Instead of turning that around, Republicans and some leaders in the auto industry are giving up.

California has worked with the auto industry on reasonable and cost-effective air-quality standards for over five decades. Until now, they have been good partners.

Overturning the standards that drive American manufacturing innovation will destroy the footholds we’ve made in this market — and will be the death of legacy automakers, thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States.

Republicans have decided that clean air and good jobs aren’t priorities. It’s unclear what’s important to them, but it’s certainly not American workers.

In 2021, Ford announced a $5.8 billion battery manufacturing campus in Glendale, Kentucky, that will add close to 5,000 new jobs. In 2023, Toyota said it’s investing $8 billion – now totaling nearly $14 billion – in a clean vehicle, battery, and energy storage project in Liberty, North Carolina, that is expected to create 3,000 jobs in a Republican district.

These investments happened because clean-car policies succeeded in pushing these companies to stay competitive globally — and to do better for these American communities. What will become of them now?

Republicans want to cut off the driving force behind this progress, even if that means stopping investments in their own districts. If we lose this fight, we don’t just lose California’s leadership on clean cars, we lose the race for the future.

California’s clean car rule is a critical test case for the U.S. clean vehicle strategy for the 21st century. It’s why automakers are finally investing in electric. It’s how we’re cutting pollution and building a market that reflects our values. And it’s how we’re protecting this country from the economic tsunami headed our way.

If Republicans succeed in gutting our standards, we’re clearing the road for China to dominate the global auto market. Last year, Chinese manufacturer BYD Automotive debuted its Seagull model, a luxury EV nicknamed the ""Lamborghini mini,"" for as low as $9,700. It has set an entirely new bar for the EV market and the car market as a whole. If Republicans fold, the streets in Asia, Europe, and Africa will be dominated by affordable Chinese models like this instead of American ones.

But Another World Leader Won on Clean Power.,Debra Kahn,,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/05/22/australia-climate-change-policies-elections-column-00344370,"His trajectory holds lessons for not only how to win on climate-friendly energy policies, but how to hold power while executing on them.
“The 2022 election, when we came to office, was a climate win,” Bowen said.
“The 2025 election was an energy win.” It also helped that Albanese and his party got a big assist from Donald Trump.
“We are a traditional energy superpower, and we want to become a renewable energy superpower, but it takes time,” Bowen said.
There’s something almost quaint about Australians having actually had it out over a period of decades, compared to the U.S.'s trajectory of pushing Democrats’ profferings ever more irretrievably into the partisan fray.","So the fact that Albanese became Australia’s first prime minister in 20 years to serve a full term and win another in part on his climate agenda is worth unpacking, even for politicians and energy leaders who have never heard of Warringah or Kooyong. His trajectory holds lessons for not only how to win on climate-friendly energy policies, but how to hold power while executing on them.

Key among his tactics is a relentless focus on positive economic messaging — namely, that Australia has hitched its economic engine to renewable energy. At the same time, he’s pursued a decidedly all-of-the-above energy policy that envisions continued exports of coal and natural gas from the country’s ample deposits. (Compare that to the indifference of national Democrats in the U.S. when party leaders in natural gas-rich states protested against former President Joe Biden’s moratorium on export permits.)

The campaign marked a new chapter in selling voters on not just the prospect of climate action, but the specific policies needed to get there. “The 2022 election, when we came to office, was a climate win,” Bowen said. “The 2025 election was an energy win.”

It also helped that Albanese and his party got a big assist from Donald Trump. The election was a toss-up until late February, when Trump and his trade wars began dragging down MAGA-embracing Liberal leader Peter Dutton in the polls.

But the climate formula is simple — not to say boring — to hear Bowen tell it. The win was not particularly sexy. It was basic economics and a willingness to course correct in response to voters’ anxieties about the cost of energy.

“Climate change in Australia has cost several prime ministers their job,” Bowen said. “We won the argument when we turned the debate around and didn’t accept the premise that action on climate change can come at an economic cost, but in fact was an economic opportunity for Australia.”

Albanese’s achievement in getting voters to accept this idea comes after a decade and a half of painful political lessons.

One key takeaway: double down on carrots over sticks. Where enervated Democrats in the U.S. are now backing away from climate policies in the name of “affordability,” Australia’s Labor fended off cost-of-living arguments by giving out $300 energy bill credits and corporate tax exemptions for electric vehicles. It handed out subsidies for renewable energy — rooftop solar in particular, which is now on a third of Australian homes, the highest concentration in the world — but also batteries and efficient appliances.

Another message other countries are already heeding is to jettison carbon pricing, the policy that toppled Labor’s Julia Gillard in 2013. Turning away from carbon taxes has proved a political winner in two hemispheres. It’s much the same story as in Canada, where, before Trump proved decisive to that election as well, now-Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first campaign move was to cut himself loose from Justin Trudeau’s consumer carbon tax (he kept a cap on big industrial emitters, though).

At the same time, on Australia’s right, worsening wildfires and heat waves eventually coalesced enough independents into a loose coalition known as the Teals that campaigned on climate change. In 2019, a Teal ousted Tony Abbott, the former Liberal prime minister who unseated Gillard six years earlier over her carbon tax.

That set up the 2025 election along a broad axis of nominal support for maintaining the country’s net-zero emission goal. But where Labor campaigned on more renewables to replace aging coal plants, the Liberals threw their weight behind nuclear power — complete with a $331 billion price tag, by their own estimate. Energy policy turned into an own goal, with Dutton losing his seat after he proposed putting a nuclear plant in his district.

“They weren’t vulnerable to cost of living being tied to their electricity policies or their car policies or anything, because the Liberals had already made a terrible blunder in going for really expensive nuclear,” said Mark Kenny, a professor at Australian National University and a former chief political correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald.

Albanese also hasn’t made any moves away from the country’s considerable coal and natural gas reserves, which have made it the world’s second-largest exporter of both (after the U.S., for gas, and Indonesia, for coal).

“We are a traditional energy superpower, and we want to become a renewable energy superpower, but it takes time,” Bowen said. (Carney is similarly pledging, “We can be an energy superpower.”)

Bowen’s now seeking to secure Australia’s bid to host next year’s U.N. climate talks, on the basis of his record. “We’ll be making economic arguments to other countries,” he said. “Even if you don’t think this is a moral obligation, the economics can work pretty well for us.’”

That’s how Australia has arrived at something of a Goldilocks moment. When automakers protested Labor’s first-ever vehicle emissions standards, they scaled them back some. Not everything is kumbaya — farmers are still revolting over transmission lines being built across their property — but by and large, the wars have receded.

“You must thread the needle of economic benefit first and foremost, then climate benefit,” said Andrew Forrest, the Australian mining magnate turned climate evangelist who’s made his Fortescue iron mining empire into an advertisement for the economic benefits of going green.

If these policies sound a lot like Biden’s, who signed laws that were projected to unleash roughly $1 trillion for clean energy and infrastructure while presiding over a historic boom in both fossil fuels and renewables, it’s not a coincidence.

“My little slogan is, ‘The world’s climate emergency is Australia’s jobs opportunity,’” Bowen said. “That was, in part, to be fair to our American cousins, inspired by Joe Biden saying, ‘I see climate change and I see jobs.’ We’re really saying the same sorts of things, but we’ve been able to, I guess, continue to argue and continue to prosecute it.”

Yet for all the lessons other countries might take from Albanese’s win, Australia’s success in extricating climate from the culture wars into the realm of policy debates may not be replicable here.

As the Trump administration dismantles everything from fuel efficiency rules to power plant emissions standards, the biggest remaining question is whether Republicans will muster the motivation to maintain any scraps of the Inflation Reduction Act. There’s something almost quaint about Australians having actually had it out over a period of decades, compared to the U.S.'s trajectory of pushing Democrats’ profferings ever more irretrievably into the partisan fray.

Australians concede a certain cynicism is lacking from their politics — in part thanks to mandatory voting, which reduces the incentive for politicians to pander to their bases.

“They take what a politician says, as we say in Australia, with a pinch of salt, and look for the facts,” Forrest said. “And therefore you got a different result in Australia than you did in North America.”

Still, politicians in other countries around the world would do well to look to Australia for how to turn down the temperature.",https://static.politico.com/a0/fd/f1e22fff456383c143ca19a611aa/australia-election-66309.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 14:20:27.635491

A major tax bill passed by the Republican-held House of Representatives on Thursday morning will, as currently written, demolish key components of climate legislation signed by Joe Biden that has spurred a record torrent of renewable energy and electric vehicle investment in the US.⁠

The resolution approved by the Senate goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other measures blocking California’s rules that the Senate is poised to pass. The House approved the three resolutions earlier this month.

READ MORE: Senate Republicans want to block vehicle-emission rules in California. Here’s what to know

The GOP effort to kill the rules could have a profound impact on California’s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. The push comes after Senate Republicans established a new exception to the filibuster on Wednesday to allow them to weigh in on the issue.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will likely sue to keep the rules in place.

The two other resolutions would block rules to cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. Democrats charge that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.

Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation’s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.

“The waivers in question allow California to implement a stringent electric vehicle mandate, which – given California’s size and the fact that a number of other states have signed on to California’s mandate – would end up not just affecting the state of California, but the whole country,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., before the vote.

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.

The Biden administration approved the state’s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.

Biden’s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

Through a series of votes on Wednesday, Republicans set a new precedent for the Senate to reject the state EPA waivers with a simple majority vote, as opposed to the 60 vote threshold on legislation that is subject to a filibuster. The votes were a workaround that enabled them to hold the votes after the Senate parliamentarian agreed with the Government Accountability Office that California’s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances.

Democrats fought the changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.

Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California’s laws were a “point of no return” and called the Republicans “fair weather institutionalists.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/2025-05-20T150604Z_59918164_RC2E3W9FN5IZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-AUTOS-CALIFORNIA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 13:14:37.655816

Dodge has announced that the Charger Daytona will be available as a sedan starting with the 2026 model year. The body style is arriving a little later than expected, but it will make up for this by offering up to 670 horsepower from the get-go.

The world’s only four-door muscle car doesn’t look remarkably different from its two-door counterpart. Both models share the same front and rear fascia, roofline and lift gate. Were it not for the extra length between the B- and C-pillars it would be hard to tell the difference between the two.

The pictures accompanying the announcement don’t offer much of a glimpse at the interior. This suggests it also won’t be that different, aside from the extra room for those sitting in the back. The two- and four-door models both features a 16-inch cluster screen designed to look like the instrument panel from the 1968 Charger and a 12.3-inch center display that will function as an infotainment system. The Attitude Adjustment ambient lighting system features 64 colors and adjustable intensity levels.

“It’s a real testament to the Dodge design and engineering teams that apart from two additional doors, the Dodge Charger Daytona sedan embodies the same look and feel as the coupe, with the same widebody exterior, driver-centric interior, muscle car performance and standard all-wheel-drive capability, combined with four-door practicality,” Dodge CEO Matt McAlear said in a statement.

WATCH

The news of the sedan comes just a week after the Detroit-based automaker quietly discontinued the entry-level Charger Daytona R/T. Because of this, the sedan will come with the Scat Pack trim package standard, which includes two electric motors that get their juice from a 100.5-kWh battery pack. The setup combines to produce a combined 670 hp and 627 ft lbs of torque. That’s enough to allow the beefy EV to rocket from zero to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds, or about as quick as the last gas-powered Hellcat Redeye.

The Charger Daytona and its synthetic exhaust sounds have struggled to gain traction since it launched last year, hence why the R/T variant has been “postponed.” The company clearly hopes that the addition of a set of doors, along with the launch of a gas-powered variant, will help boost sales somewhat.

Organized by the Brazilian Association for the Development of Nuclear Activities (ABDAN), the Nuclear Trade and Technology Exchange (NT2E) brought together participants from around the world to discuss opportunities and challenges for the nuclear sector, with a focus on Brazil and the wider region of Latin America.

“A reliable and widespread electricity supply is the lifeblood of any economy. Little else is so closely correlated to economic and social development that makes possible better lives, better health and better livelihoods,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told the conference in recorded opening remarks. “As the populations and economies of Latin America and the Caribbean grow, so will electricity demand. Meeting projected annual growth of more than 2 per cent will require significant investment in infrastructure, especially if we recall that more than 16 million people living in the region still lack access.”

New Global Consensus

Interest in nuclear power is growing around the world including in Latin America, amid a new global consensus to accelerate its deployment that emerged at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai. The IAEA’s annual projections for the future of nuclear power have increased for four straight years, with global nuclear capacity now projected to more than double by 2050 in the high case.

Three countries in Latin America—Argentina, Brazil and Mexico—have operated nuclear power plants for decades and are now looking to expand their programmes. The region also boasts seven of the world’s nearly 40 newcomer countries including Ecuador, which Director General Grossi visited last week to sign agreements on enhancing cooperation. Still, several challenges need to be addressed if Latin America is to reap the full benefits of nuclear power.

“One of the main barriers for deploying nuclear in the region is the cost of capital,” said Julian Gadano, Director of the Nuclear Policy Programme at the Argentine Global Foundation and a former Undersecretary of Nuclear Energy of Argentina. “Small modular reactors (SMRs) are changing the game worldwide, but this particularly presents an opportunity for Latin America. Why? Because new business models are looking into venture capital from developed and robust financial markets, lowering financing costs. This is crucial to unleash nuclear power in developing countries, particularly in Latin America,” she added.

SMRs and Financing

The IAEA hosted a workshop on SMRs during the NT2E fair that covered the state of the technology, regulatory challenges and market opportunities for SMRs. The Agency also organized a panel on financing nuclear projects to discuss the financial, policy and collaborative strategies needed to scale up nuclear energy capacity. The discussion, aimed at engaging policy makers and key stakeholders present at the NT2E, explored challenges and opportunities in financing nuclear projects as well as the links between nuclear energy, security of supply, economic growth and climate goals.

“The NT2E is characterized as a meeting space for the entire nuclear sector, bringing together various associations,” said Celso Cunha, President of ABDAN. “In this way, the IAEA has been helping us consolidate a nuclear hub for Latin America, with the presence of several delegations and the participation of different segments.”

The first reactor of Brazil’s two-unit Angra Nuclear Power Plant recently received a 20-year life extension, and construction on a third unit is currently underway. Electricity demand is projected to grow by about 3.5 per cent each year, highlighting the need to build out more clean energy capacity.

A panel on SMR projects addressed topics including public-private partnerships, feasibility studies and implementation challenges. The third edition of the IAEA’s SMR School is set to be held in Buenos Aires from 25 to 29 August with participants from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Paraguay and Peru.

G20: From Brazil to South Africa

The IAEA also joined a session focused on global cooperation in climate change mitigation, presenting the Agency’s work and increasing presence by informing on the role that nuclear energy has in the clean energy transitions at COP and the G20. The IAEA was first invited to present to the G20 on nuclear power issues during the Brazilian Presidency last year, providing key contributions to its Energy Transitions Working Group, including a report on how to accelerate investment in clean energy transitions. IAEA participation in the G20 has carried over to this year’s South African Presidency, with the Agency set to produce publications on prospects for nuclear power in Africa and the coal-to-nuclear transition and join the G20 Ministerial Meeting on Energy later this year.

“From Asia to Latin America, from Europe to North America, this new energy realism—this need for clean firm power to enhance energy security and drive economic development—is clearer by the day,” said Mikhail Chudakov, Deputy Director General and Head of the IAEA’s Department of Nuclear Energy. “Nuclear energy offers tremendous promise —but it will only deliver if we match that promise with political will and social commitment.”",https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/cd193e02-4943-4403-9750-69d749793501.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 12:24:00.751933

As the U.S. solar industry navigates rising costs, shifting incentives and surging demand, stakeholders across the value chain must reevaluate their assumptions.","As the U.S. scrambles to onshore its solar supply chain and reduce reliance on Chinese-linked imports, new tariffs threaten to disrupt utility-scale deployment just as demand for clean energy surges. On April 21st, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its final determination in the antidumping duty (“AD”) and countervailing duty (“CVD”) investigation of solar cells from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, who were hit with average effective tariff rates of 652 %, 34%, 375%, and 396%, respectively.

In this analysis, FTI Consulting examines the potential impact of these tariffs on the total cost of utility-scale solar projects and simulates the associated impact on installations using our customized PLEXOS power market model.

These tariffs have their origins in a 2011 complaint against Chinese manufacturers and are the latest move in an effort to prevent Chinese circumvention of AD/CVD tariffs by routing Chinese products through Southeast Asian nations where, allegedly, only minor processing is performed. While allegations of unfair trade practices are not new to the solar manufacturing sector, only in the last few years has U.S. domestic solar module manufacturing capacity begun to accelerate, reaching 50 gigawatts (“GW”) - more than enough to meet U.S. demand - in 2025.1 Much of this capacity has been spurred on by the introduction of the 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credit and the addition of domestic content tax credit bonuses for solar project developers. Indeed, manufacturing capacity has increased by 614% since 2020, when the U.S. could boast just 7 GW of domestic module production capacity.2

While U.S. module manufacturing capacity has exploded, however, most of this production still relies on imported solar cells. Solar cells are the primary component that converts sunlight into electricity and are assembled by the dozens into the larger solar panels, or modules used to construct solar power plants.

In 2024, the U.S. imported nearly 13.9 GW worth of solar cells, 60% of which came from four countries: Malaysia (32%), Thailand (20%), Vietnam (7%), and Cambodia (1%).

Figure 1 - Solar Cell Imports, 2024

Given that reliance on these countries, recent tariff policies are going to have a large impact. Combining these AD/CVD rates with the administration’s “Liberation Day” country-specific tariff rates, FTI Consulting estimates that, were trade patterns to remain the same, the volume weighted average solar cell price would increase by nearly 150%. And not only are Solar cells a primary component, they are also the main driver of module cost, representing more than 30% of the cost of a finished module.3 Similarly, the cost of solar modules represents roughly 30% of the total capital expenditures required to develop a utility-scale solar project.4 In aggregate, then, the total cost of a solar project that uses domestically produced modules manufactured using imported cells could rise, on average, by nearly 15%.

Figure 2 - 100 MW Solar Project Capital Cost Breakdown ($/kW)

Increased project costs may be mitigated by the fact that the U.S. has a significant amount of domestic production of solar modules that do not rely on the largely crystalline silicon solar cells that are the target of these trade actions. First Solar, the main domestic producer of “thin-film” modules that use cadmium telluride as a semiconductor rather than silicon, recently scaled its domestic production capacity to 11 GW.5 However, the U.S. installed 41.4 GW of utility-scale solar in 2024, meaning that imported crystalline silicon cells are still required to meet our growing energy needs. In 2023, for example, 72% of utility-scale installations used crystalline silicon modules.6

FTI Consulting used its PLEXOS power market model to analyze a scenario in which solar project developers could access 11 GW of domestic thin-film module production at current costs but face a 15% tariff “premium” to develop any additional capacity beyond that threshold.7 The results suggest that over the next 5 years, some 14 GW of utility-scale solar capacity would be at risk that would have otherwise been economic to develop.

These worst-case results, however, may not be realized. Anticipating tariffs, U.S. firms imported roughly 55 GW of solar modules in 2024. This amount far exceeds U.S. demand and was likely intended to build up inventories. In addition, much like Chinese manufacturers did with the move to Southeast Asia, solar cell factories could again be moved, prompting a new round of trade investigations. India, for example, is seeing a cell manufacturing boom, with up to 55 GW of total production capacity expected online by 2027.8

One potential outcome however, is for the U.S. to develop its own manufacturing capacity in order to capture more of the solar cell supply chain. The 45X tax credit, created by the Inflation Reduction Act, provides four cents per watt to domestic manufacturers of solar cells, helping to make their product more cost-competitive with imported cells.9 There have been also been a number of significant announcements regarding planned cell capacity since the IRA was passed – some 56 GW of domestic solar cell production – but most of this capacity is still in the planning phase.10

Of course, the current uncertainty surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act, specifically the 45X tax credit, has led at least one major player to “press pause” on its plans to build out a solar cell manufacturing facility in Minnesota.11 Another planned cell facility in Georgia that received $1.45 billion in late-stage loan guarantees from the outgoing Biden Administration could also be at risk given the Trump administration’s executive order suspending the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act.12, 13

Resolving that uncertainty is critical given the other forces in play, not least because of increased power demand. U.S. solar manufacturers argue that tax credits like 45X provide the industry with the certainty that is “critical for long-term business planning and capital allocation” and help the U.S. develop a domestic solar supply chain to compete with China.14 Projections of power demand are growing rapidly across the country signaling growing demand for all sources of energy, including solar. In Texas, for example, ERCOT estimates that electricity demand could almost double by 2030, driven by economic growth and new loads such as data centers and oil and gas electrification.15 Today, roughly 42% of the nearly 2,600 GW generator interconnection requests nationwide are for new solar capacity.16 Tax and trade policy will play an important role determining whether or not this capacity is built from domestically manufactured solar cells or imported components.

As the U.S. solar industry navigates rising costs, shifting incentives and surging demand, stakeholders across the value chain must reevaluate their assumptions. Understanding how these changes ripple through project economics, supply chains and long-term planning is critical. Robust analysis and forward-looking modeling can help ensure that today’s policy choices support—not stall—the next phase of the energy transition.

With nearly 14 GW of utility-scale solar capacity at risk, developers, manufacturers and investors need to act decisively—reassessing sourcing strategies, investment timelines and project viability under a shifting policy landscape. At the same time, policymakers must clarify the future of critical incentives like the 45X tax credit and consider how trade enforcement aligns with the broader clean energy agenda.",https://www.fticonsulting.com/-/media/images/shared-content/insights/articles/2025/may/solar-shock-how-new-tariffs-could-reshape-us-utility-scale-deployment_1200x627_left.jpeg?rev=dc8ce197bf35475091c7645caf85b3b4,N,,2025-05-22 12:24:04.832579

Population around power plants To quantify exposure to excess PM2.5 concentrations, we compute the population residing within 50 km of combustion power plants.
The resulting market-by-month-year variable measures the additional air pollution observed in response to hydrological droughts shifting electricity generation to combustion power plants.
All scenarios rule out the introduction of new combustion power plants and thus assume that any growth in electricity demand will be met with generation from non-combustion power plants.","Droughts affecting hydropower lead to excess PM2.5

Our analysis reveals that hydrological droughts significantly increase PM2.5 concentrations near combustion power plants in LAC, even when considering short-duration droughts. We examine the impact of droughts using the fraction of hydropower generation capacity affected by drought (FHD), which measures the proportion of hydropower capacity experiencing below-normal water conditions over a three-month window. As briefly described in the introduction, our primary analysis employs a linear regression model (Eq. (1)), hereafter referred to as the benchmark model, to quantify the relationship between FHD and PM2.5 concentrations while controlling for various meteorological factors, proxies of electricity demand, and an extensive set of fixed effects. To ensure the robustness of our findings, we conduct a comprehensive series of sensitivity analyses, detailed in the Methods section.

We find that when all hydropower generation experiences drought (FHD = 1), PM2.5 concentrations within 50 km of combustion power plants increase by 1.55 μg m−3 (p-value = 0.000) compared to non-drought conditions (Fig. 1a). This substantial impact of short-duration droughts (3 months) highlights the vulnerability of the region’s hydropower infrastructure to even brief periods of hydrological drought. We observe consistent results when analyzing alternative drought durations (see Supplementary Methods 1).

Figure 1b contextualizes the previous result by plotting the implied total PM2.5 concentrations across different levels of FHD. The benchmark model predicts baseline concentrations of 15.76 μg m−3 without drought, already well above the WHO guideline of 5 μg m−3 for harmful concentrations27. These levels rise to 16.59 μg m−3 at mean FHD and reach 17.31 μg m−3 at maximum observed FHD. The drought-induced increase of 0.83 μg m−3 at mean FHD levels represents a significant additional health risk in areas already burdened by high PM2.5 levels.

To further investigate the relationship between drought severity and PM2.5, we employ a dose-response model (Fig. 1c). Consistent with our hypothesis that hydrological droughts increase pollution by shifting energy generation to combustion power plants, we find a monotonic increase in PM2.5 concentrations as the FHD rises. Notably, the impact on PM2.5 is substantially larger when at least half of hydropower generation is affected by drought. Given that the dose-response model yields comparable results to those of the more parsimonious benchmark model (Fig. 1b, d), we focus on the benchmark model for the remainder of the analysis.

Shifts to combustion power explain excess PM2.5

Having established that hydrological droughts lead to excess PM2.5 concentrations, we investigate alternative mechanisms that could explain our results. Most prominently, droughts increase the likelihood of wildfires, one of the primary sources of PM2.5 pollution28,29,30,31, as well as increase the occurrence of dust storms32. To address these potential confounding factors, our primary analysis excludes plant-month observations with fire emissions within a 50 km radius. As described in Supplementary Methods 1, our robustness checks demonstrate that our results are robust when extending the exclusion radius up to 100 km for both fire and dust emissions. While these restrictions reduce concerns about wildfires and dust emissions driving our findings, they do not entirely rule out their influence, as PM2.5 can remain suspended in the atmosphere for several days and travel hundreds of kilometers.

To further disentangle the impact of droughts on PM2.5 through a shift in generation to combustion power from other potential mechanisms, we conduct two placebo exercises (Fig. 1e). In the first placebo exercise, we compute PM2.5 concentrations within a 50 km radius of non-combustion power plants (i.e., wind, solar, geothermal, and nuclear) and exclude observations with combustion power plants within that radius. We then estimate Eq. (1) using this sample. If wildfires or dust storms drive the excess air pollution, we should also expect to observe an increase in air pollution in this sample of non-combustion power plants. However, consistent with the idea that wildfires and dust storms are not the primary mechanism for excess air pollution, we find that the impact of FHD on air pollution around non-combustion power plants is small and statistically indistinguishable from zero (p-value = 0.638).

One important caveat with the previous exercise is that the location of combustion and non-combustion power plants may differ systematically, and the resulting null effect may reflect the differences in geographic characteristics. To address this limitation, the second placebo exercise tests whether air pollution increased among combustion power plants in the years before they were operational. Once again, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the impact of FHD on air pollution is different from zero (p-value = 0.194). Together, these placebo exercises indicate that wildfires and dust storms are unlikely to drive our results.

To further investigate whether the estimated increase in PM2.5 during hydrological droughts is consistent with a shift in energy generation towards combustion power plants, we examine how the effect varies with plant size and fuel source. Figure 1f, g presents the drought-induced excess PM2.5 for each subgroup of combustion power plants. While hydrological droughts lead to increased air pollution across all subgroups, the magnitude of the effect is notably larger for smaller capacity plants (<30 MW) and those using oil or biomass as fuel.

This pattern of heterogeneous effects aligns with the energy shift mechanism in several ways. First, larger coal and gas power plants typically serve as baseload electricity generation, operating continuously near maximum capacity1. Consequently, these plants have limited spare capacity to increase output during droughts, resulting in a more muted pollution response compared to oil or biomass plants. Second, large baseload power plants tend to be more water-intensive than their smaller counterparts1, further constraining their ability to ramp up production during water-scarce periods. In contrast, smaller combustion power plants, which in our sample primarily consist of biomass and oil plants, more frequently utilize air-cooling methods, allowing for greater flexibility in adjusting output. Notably, the most substantial increase in PM2.5 occurs around biomass power plants, a well-known source of particulate pollution33,34. Taken together, the pattern of heterogeneous effects by plant size and fuel source provides strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that our estimates of the impact of hydrological droughts on PM2.5 are primarily driven by shifts in electricity generation toward combustion power plants.

Lives lost due to excess PM2.5

To assess the human health consequences of drought-induced air pollution, we estimate premature deaths using our estimates of excess PM2.5, counts of exposed population, and the causal concentration-response function (CRF) from Deryugina et al.35. Figure 2b presents the distribution of cumulative drought-induced premature deaths between 2000 and 2020, revealing that these deaths are widespread across the region. Nearly every country has at least one power plant linked to over 250 premature deaths within this period. Figure 2c plots the annual time series of drought-induced premature deaths aggregated at the LAC level. The spread of the box plot displayed each year results from the uncertainty in our estimation of excess PM2.5 concentrations and the observed FHD. The figure reveals that the mean premature deaths per year (red triangle markers) range from 3692 to 10,641. Supplementary Fig. 1 extends the analysis to include alternative well-known CRFs36,37,38,39, yielding mean annual premature deaths ranging roughly from 700 to 13,500. Notably, the estimates based on our preferred CRF35 lie near the midpoint of this range, reflecting their alignment with the broader set of CRFs considered.

A potential limitation of the available CRFs is that they do not account for the possibly greater vulnerability to PM2.5 among populations with lower socioeconomic status. To descriptively assess whether populations residing near power plants tend to have lower socioeconomic status compared to the overall population, we use downscaled Human Development Index (HDI) data40 to compute the power plant-level mean HDI relative to country-level HDI. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, four out of five combustion power plants have nearby populations with significantly lower HDI levels. This pattern is consistent across all types of combustion power plants (i.e., coal, gas, oil, biomass) and aligns with existing literature, which highlights the negative association between socioeconomic status and PM2.5 exposure18,19,20,41. Given the prevalent residential pattern of the population with lower socioeconomic status in LAC and the available CRFs, it is likely that our estimates underestimate the premature deaths caused by excess PM2.5.

To quantify the economic value of these lives lost, we combine our premature death estimates with country and year-specific values of a statistical life (VSL). While we recognize that this metric does not fully capture the intrinsic value of human life or the lived experiences, it provides a useful standardized measure for policy evaluation. Figure 2 shows that cumulative losses for the region between 2000 and 2020 are in the order of $150 billion (2019 USD), with Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina each experiencing cumulative losses of over $24 billion. Figure 2c plots the annual time series of these drought-induced losses aggregated at the LAC level. The figure further reveals that yearly mean losses (blue triangle markers) are in the order of $4.2–12.2 billion. An analogous exercise using using alternative CRFs36,37,38,39 yields mean annual losses of 0.8–15.0 billion (Supplementary Fig. 3). Notably, these monetized longevity losses may underestimate the total social cost of worsened air quality triggered by droughts, as our counterfactual simulations do not account for decreased quality of life42 or non-health effects, such as impacts on productivity and cognitive ability43,44,45,46.

Projected lives lost due to excess PM2.5

To assess the future implications of our findings, we present projections of hydropower generation affected by drought and the associated health costs of drought-induced excess PM2.5. Figure 3a illustrates the projected percentage change in the mean fraction of hydropower generation affected by droughts during 2020–2059, relative to the baseline period of 2000–2019. These projections are derived from runoff data provided by 22 climate and earth system models under three climate scenarios: SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, and SSP3–7.0, which combine Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). These scenarios span a range of potential future climate forcing, with higher numbers indicating more severe climate change. The box plots represent the variability across model projections, while the triangle markers indicate the ensemble means. For the region, most models indicate an increase in the fraction of hydropower generation affected by hydrological droughts. The ensemble mean suggests that the FHD will likely increase between 22 and 24%. The ranking in the FHD increase is consistent with higher climate-forcing scenarios leading to a higher drought exposure. However, differences across scenarios are projected to remain small by 2059. Figure 3b–f presents results from analogous analysis for each IEA sub-region. Nearly all sub-regions are expected to experience an increase in FHD, with sub-regions like the Caribbean and Southern South America particularly affected. The exception is the Andean Region (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru), which is expected to see a reduction in the FHD of roughly 25%.

Building on the evidence that droughts will continue to affect hydropower generation across the region, we extend our analysis to project the evolution of premature deaths and the associated monetized losses caused by drought-induced excess PM2.5. These projections integrate climate, demographic, and economic growth trends under the SSP-RCPs paired with IEA energy policy scenarios that outline potential retirement schedules for combustion power plants. The three energy policy scenarios, APS, STEPS, and RES, reflect progressively fewer retirements, ranging from full implementation of announced pledges to no retirements (see Methods for details).

Figure 3g shows observed mean premature deaths and 66 projected paths (3 scenarios × 22 models). To illustrate the overall trends, we include LOESS curve fits (bold lines) for each scenario. The figure reveals that there is substantial uncertainty in the projected number of premature deaths. Only under SSP1–2.6-APS do deaths stabilize at approximately 5000 per year by 2059, a level comparable to that observed in the early 2000s. In other scenarios, premature deaths increase significantly. For instance, under SSP3–7.0-RES, premature deaths rise to approximately 30,000 annually by 2059, nearly six times the levels observed in SSP1–2.6-APS. Figure 3h presents the monetized losses associated with these premature deaths. Consistent with the previous results, projected losses are expected to persist or increase relative to the early 2000s.

To explore the drivers of these projections, Supplementary Fig. 4 depicts the evolution of premature deaths and economic losses across SSP-RCP combinations for each energy policy scenario. The figure underscores the dominant influence of energy policy, with ambitious plant retirements under APS significantly reducing premature deaths and economic losses compared to STEPS or RES scenarios. Within each energy policy scenario, differences between SSP-RCPs depend on climate, demographic, and economic factors. The figure shows that the largest projected increase in deaths occurs under SSP1–2.6, driven by the rapid aging of the population, which offsets the relatively minor differences in runoff across SSP-RCP scenarios by 2059. This finding highlights the significant role demographic factors play in shaping exposure to this hazard over this time horizon. Additionally, the figure shows that economic losses are further amplified by higher economic growth, which increases the VSL. These findings highlight that climate mitigation measures alone are insufficient and that targeted policies, such as accelerating plant retirements and reducing population exposure, are crucial to addressing these losses.

Power plant panel

The starting point for our assembled panel is the Global Power Plant Database50. This database provides detailed information on the geolocation, capacity, fuel type, and commissioning year for all power plants with generators above 1 megawatt (MW). This feature of our dataset is important because little is known about the pollution burden created by plants with smaller capacities.

Hydropower exposure to drought

Next, we augment the power plant panel with market-level measures of the degree of drought faced by hydropower plants on a monthly basis. Among various drought metrics, we focus on hydrological droughts because it allows us to directly capture the degree of water availability in hydropower watersheds. In the first step, we follow existing literature and use runoff anomalies to measure hydrological drought14,15,16. Runoff is the depth of water accumulated over time in the soil and is a valuable indicator of drought or flood conditions. Runoff anomalies indicate a period where water availability is above or below normal. Specifically, we define runoff anomalies as the difference between the monthly runoff and its corresponding average value over the reference period (2000–2019). To measure runoff anomalies, we use data from the International Energy Agency Weather for Energy Tracker database51. This database provides information derived from the ERA 5 reanalysis on monthly total runoff anomalies (surface and subsurface) measured in millimeters per hour (mm/h) at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°.

In the second step, we determine the watershed of each hydropower plant in the sample. The watershed is the area over which water would accumulate for use by the hydropower plant. To compute these areas, we use the hydro basin polygons (areas where water collects and may flow) from the HydroSHEDS database52. This dataset is produced from digital elevation maps and hydrological models. Next, following standard engineering practices for each hydropower plant, we delineate the watershed by tracing all of the upstream sub-basins that flow in the direction of the power plant. The resulting dataset provides a watershed for each hydropower plant.

In the third step, we overlay the information on runoff anomalies with the watershed delineations and compute the average monthly runoff anomalies for each watershed. Supplementary Fig. 5 plots the evolution of runoff anomalies for the whole region (a) and for sub-regions defined by the IEA (b). The figure reveals that drought is not a region-wide phenomenon, with considerable sub-regional heterogeneity even during periods of significant overall drought, such as 2015–2020. To measure the impact of anomalies with a duration greater than one month, we repeat the previous calculation using a moving average of the runoff anomalies over the past three, six, nine, and 12 months. The resulting dataset provides detailed information on whether water availability conditions are above or below normal for each hydropower plant. Supplementary Fig. 6a shows the distribution of the hydropower plants in our sample and provides a visual example of how the hydrological drought dataset is constructed.

In the fourth step, we use the information derived in the previous step to compute market-level measures of the hydropower generation affected by hydrological drought. In the absence of systematic information on the boundaries of electrical markets within countries, we define each electricity market using the country boundaries. There is little cross-border trade in the region, with less than 5% of total regional generation being transmitted across countries53.

Our preferred market-level measure is the fraction of hydropower generation capacity affected by drought (FHD). To construct this measure, we create a binary variable equal to one when the watershed of a hydropower plant has less water available than normal in the past three months (mean negative runoff anomaly) and zero otherwise. Next, we compute the average of this variable for each market and month. To account for the greater impact that larger plants experiencing drought can have on electricity generation, we weigh this average by plant capacity. We define droughts over a relatively short period (three months) because small hydropower plants are common in the region, and for these plants, even short-run changes in water availability may imply reduced generation capacity. Nonetheless, to check whether our results are robust to alternative definitions of drought duration, we also compute the FHD variable using the moving average of runoff anomalies in the past one, six, nine, and 12 months. Additionally, to verify that our results do not rely on extrapolation, we present a ridgeline plot (Supplementary Fig. 7) showing the year-by-year distribution of FHD values. The plot confirms that FHD spans the full range from 0 to 1 across all years of the study period.

We also acknowledge that different aggregation methods prioritize different features of the data. With our primary approach, we exploit the spatial granularity of our data and aim to capture the effect of both local and regional droughts by identifying periods in which hydropower generation declines due to water availability being below normal levels. However, to ensure that we study the full scope of our data, we also compute our market-level measure in other ways. For instance, we prioritize the number of plants affected in an alternative computation using an arithmetic average instead of a capacity-weighted average. Additionally, we calculate market-level measures considering only the most severe droughts. To operationalize this alternative definition, we follow Herrera-Estrada et al.15 and create a binary variable that equals one only when runoff anomalies are one standard deviation below normal levels. We then compute the average of the variable for each market and month. These and other variations of the market-level measures help us understand the effects of extreme drought. We also compute a measure that directly gauges the intensity of the drought by calculating the average runoff anomaly for each market and month. One downside of this measure is that, in the case of non-market-wide droughts, it may incorrectly assume that negative anomalies experienced by some hydropower plants can be offset by positive anomalies experienced by other plants.

Air quality around power plants

With our battery of market-level measures added to the panel using country and month-year identifiers, we now focus on measuring the concentration of PM2.5 around combustion power plants. We classify plants as combustion if the primary or secondary fuel type is coal, gas, oil (including petcoke), or biomass (including waste). To measure air quality, we use information on monthly mean surface PM2.5 concentrations measured in micrograms per cubic meter (μg m−3) from Van Donkelaar et al.54. This dataset provides estimates of PM2.5 concentrations by combining information from satellites, chemical transport models, and ground-based monitors. It provides information at 0.01° × 0.01° resolution at a monthly frequency between 1998 and 2021. To integrate this information with our panel, we define each plant’s dispersion area as the 50 km radius around the plant and calculate average monthly PM2.5 concentrations for every plant. We consider this definition of the dispersion area conservative, consistent with literature indicating that PM2.5 emissions from power plants impact areas extending at least 50 km3,4 and significantly affect health within this distance5,6,7. While we recognize that daily exposure may vary within the dispersion area due to factors like wind direction, studies have shown that on a monthly scale, power plants in the US have similar effects on PM2.5 levels at monitors located within 50 km, regardless of whether they are upwind or downwind16. These observations suggest that our monthly averages within a 50 km radius adequately measure overall exposure. Nonetheless, we also conduct analogous calculations using a 10 km radius to test result sensitivity. Supplementary Fig. 6b shows the distribution of the combustion plants in our sample and provides a visual example of how the PM2.5 concentrations are calculated. To run placebo exercises, we also compute these measures of PM2.5 concentrations within 50 km of non-combustion power plants (i.e., solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear). To assess the robustness of our findings, we also construct a comparable measure of monthly PM2.5 using data derived from ground-based monitoring stations (see Supplementary Methods 1).

Wildfires and meteorological controls

We also include in the dataset variables that can confound the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and our market-level measures of drought. A particular source of concern is wildfires, which are more prevalent during droughts and lead to higher PM2.5 concentrations30. To limit the influence of surface PM2.5 related to wildfires, we follow Qiu et al.16 and omit observations plausibly affected by wildfires. Specifically, we use data from the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 (GFED4s)55. This dataset provides monthly information on carbon emissions from fires at a spatial resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and at a monthly frequency between 1997 and 2022. Using this information, we construct our primary analysis sample by excluding plant-month-year observations where fire emissions were detected within 50 km of a power plant. To evaluate the robustness of our findings, we also create two additional samples that exclude observations potentially affected by fire emissions within 75 km and 100 km. Additionally, to account for the potential impact of dust emissions, we use data from Chappell et al.56 on seasonal sources of dust emissions (winter, spring, summer, and fall) and create three further samples that exclude plant-month observations potentially affected by either fire or dust emissions within radii of 50, 75, or 100 km.

To account for other confounding factors, we also include in our dataset several meteorological variables derived from the IEA Weather for Energy Tracker database51,57. These variables provide monthly frequency information and correspond to the variable mean within 50 km of the plant. The meteorological variables are temperature (°C at 2 m), total precipitation (mm/h), relative humidity (%), surface pressure (Pa), and wind speed (m/s at 10m and 100m). Additionally, to account for changes in electricity demand related to meteorological conditions (e.g., heat waves), we include market-level measures of heating degree-days (HDD) and cooling degree-days (CDD). Following IEA guidelines we define HDD (°C days) with 18 °C reference and a 15 °C threshold. Similarly CDD (°C days) is defined with 18 °C reference and a 21 °C threshold.

Population around power plants

To quantify exposure to excess PM2.5 concentrations, we compute the population residing within 50 km of combustion power plants. Specifically, we use 0.001° × 0.001° resolution population data available between 2000 and 2020 at five-year intervals from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL)58. To avoid double counting the population in cases where the 50 km radius for different power plants overlaps, we partition these areas using the Thiessen method. We then sum the population residing around each power plant at each time step and use linear interpolation to generate a plant-level annual time series of the population exposed.

Additionally, to better characterize the population residing around power plants, we use the Thiessen polygons derived previously and 2019 Human Development Index (HDI) data down-scaled to 0.1° × 0.1° resolution40 to compute mean plant level HDI. We then compare the plant-level HDI with country-level HDI data59 to determine whether the population residing near power plants is systematically different.

Benchmark statistical model

The final dataset for combustion power plants comprises 80,355 plant-month-year observations across 22 markets. However, since three markets lack hydropower capacity, the analysis dataset used for examining the impact of FHD includes 79,022 observations across 19 markets. The sample of non-combustion power plants used in the placebo exercise is constructed analogously and is comprised of 62,066 observations across 18 markets. Supplementary Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for key variables in these samples.

Using the analysis dataset, we estimate the impacts of drought on average PM2.5 concentrations around power plants using the fixed effects regression shown in Eq. (1):

$$P{M}_{icmy}=\beta H{D}_{cmy}+{{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{icmy}^{{\prime} }{{{\boldsymbol{\gamma }}}}+{\alpha }_{i}+{\alpha }_{my}+{\alpha }_{cm}+{\varepsilon }_{icmy},$$

(1)

where PM represents the average PM2.5 (μg m−3) within 50 km of combustion power plant i in electricity market c in month m and year y. HDcmy is the market-level measure of hydrological drought. The parameter of interest is β, which measures the impact of hydrological droughts on PM2.5 concentrations under the assumption that the shocks are exogenous, given the controls. We account for time-invariant unobserved confounders using plant-level fixed effects (αi), for time-varying unobserved common shocks using month-by-year fixed effects (αmy), and for market-specific seasonality using market-by-calendar-month fixed effects (αcm). Because meteorological conditions related to hydrological droughts can also affect PM2.5 concentrations, Eq. (1) includes a vector of meteorological controls (\({{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{icmy}^{{\prime} }\)). The vector comprises plant-level measures of temperature, total precipitation, relative humidity, surface pressure, wind speed measured at a height of 10 and 100 m, and an indicator of local hydrological drought. To account for the effect of fluctuations in electricity demand, potentially correlated with hydrological drought conditions, the vector also includes market-level measures of HDD and CDD.

We estimate Eq. (1) and alternative specifications using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). To allow for arbitrary patterns of correlation among PM2.5 concentrations across space and over time, we cluster standard errors at the market level. Reported p-values correspond to two-sided t-tests. Data analysis was performed with Stata MP v17, and figures were produced with R v4.3.2.

Alternative statistical models and robustness checks

Dose-response model: We use OLS to estimate Eq. (1) after discretizing the FHD variable into four groups: less than 0.25, 0.25–0.5, 0.5–0.75, and greater than 0.75. These groups roughly correspond to the quartiles of the FHD variable. In the estimation, the reference group is FHD less than 0.25.

Heterogeneous effect exercises: In the plant size exercise, as measured by capacity, we follow the US Department of Energy definition and create an indicator variable for larger than 30 MW. We then augment Eq. (1) by including an interaction term between the FHD variable and the size indicator variable. Analogously, we augment Eq. (1) in the fuel source exercise by including an interaction term with an indicator variable for the fuel source type (e.g., coal, gas, oil, or biomass). We then perform separate OLS estimations of each augmented version of Eq. (1) and compute the marginal effects, i.e., the impact of FHD on PM2.5 for each subgroup.

Robustness checks: We validate the robustness of our findings across a diverse array of assumptions and methodological choices. Our analysis confirms that our results are not contingent on model specification. For instance, by employing the post-double selection methodology60, we establish that our estimates remain robust even after we relax the benchmark model’s assumptions of linearity and additivity, opting instead to control for higher-order polynomials of the elements of \({{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{icmy}^{{\prime} }\) and their pairwise interactions. To account for confounding influences from wildfires and dust storms, we also conduct sensitivity analyses that exclude plant-month observations potentially affected by fire or dust emissions within radii of 50, 75, and 100 km. Results from these restricted samples yield very similar results, further supporting the robustness of our findings.

Additionally, we confirm the reliability of our confidence intervals by demonstrating consistent conclusions when standard errors are derived using the wild cluster bootstrap and the Conley error technique61,62. Furthermore, we conduct several exercises showing that we obtain similar results when we use ground-based PM2.5 measurements and when defining the dispersion area as a 10 km radius around the power plant.

We also show that using alternative methodologies for aggregating drought measures at the market level leads to consistent results. These robustness exercises fall into two categories. First, we test alternative definitions of the FHD variable. These exercises include varying the averaging windows for hydrological droughts (1, 6, 9, and 12 months), using alternative definitions of drought occurrence (e.g., anomalies below one standard deviation), testing different weighting schemes (such as arithmetic means and weighting by generation capacity), and accounting for regional market structures by integrating neighboring countries into single markets. Across these variations, the results remain consistent, with only slight differences in point estimates.

Second, we conduct a series of exercises using the mean runoff anomaly in a market as an alternative measure of hydrological drought. Results from using this measure of drought intensity align with our benchmark findings. For example, an average drought leads to similar increases in PM2.5 concentrations. Moreover, using this drought intensity measure alongside a spline specification allows us to test for differential effects of positive and negative runoff anomalies. We find that negative anomalies result in slightly larger increases in pollution than the reduction caused by positive anomalies, highlighting an asymmetry consistent with operational and infrastructure limitations of hydropower plants that may restrict their ability to fully utilize additional water resources. Furthermore, we leverage this measure to perform an additional placebo exercise, confirming that the relationship between PM2.5 and hydrological drought is only observed in markets heavily reliant on hydropower. A detailed explanation of these robustness checks is provided in the Supplementary Methods 1.

Calculation of lives lost due to excess PM2.5

To compute premature deaths, we combine a concentration-response function (CRF) with our estimate of excess PM2.5 induced by drought and counts of exposed population. Our counterfactual calculation involves several steps. In the first step, we compute excess PM2.5 by multiplying our benchmark estimate (Fig. 1a) by the observed FHD. The resulting market-by-month-year variable measures the additional air pollution observed in response to hydrological droughts shifting electricity generation to combustion power plants.

In the second step, we transform excess PM2.5 into premature deaths using the CRF estimated by Deryugina et al.35. We selected this CRF for our main estimates due to its robust causal identification strategy, which leverages variation in daily wind direction to isolate the causal effect of PM2.5 exposure on mortality. This approach minimizes the effect of potential confounders, ensuring the estimates reflect the health impacts attributable to air pollution. According to this CRF, a day of exposure to 1 μg m−3 leads to 0.69 excess deaths per million US adults 65 or older (Medicare beneficiaries). We transform this CRF to monthly frequency by multiplying it by 30. For robustness, analogous calculations using global and regional CRFs are detailed in the Supplementary Methods 2.

In the third step, we compute the counts of the exposed population. Specifically, for each combustion power plant, we compute the count of the population 65 or older residing within 50 km by multiplying the all-age population counts by the fraction of the population 65 or older. The age distribution data63 is available at the country-year level. Accordingly, our calculations assume a uniform age distribution within each country.

In the fourth step, we derive counts of premature deaths at the plant-month-year level by multiplying the variables described in steps one to three. Next, to account for uncertainty in our estimate of excess air pollution, in the first step, we draw our coefficient from a normal distribution with a mean equal to the estimated coefficient (1.55) and a standard deviation equal to the standard error (0.31). We then repeat 1000 times steps one to four, taking a new draw each time. In sum, we compute the number of premature deaths per plant-month-year for each draw with the following calculation: 0.69 (CRF) × 30 (days) × FHD × draw of FHD coefficient from \(\sim {{{\mathcal{N}}}}(1.55,0.31)\,\times\) exposed population 65 or older. To construct Fig. 2b, we aggregate the resulting dataset to the plant level and compute the mean. To construct Fig. 2c, we aggregate the same dataset to the LAC-year level.

Calculation of monetized lives lost due to excess PM2.5

To monetize the cost of the lives lost previously documented, we estimate the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) at the country-year level in two steps. In the first step, we follow Banzhaf 64 to compute a base VSL from a meta-meta analysis of US VSL estimates. In the second step, we follow Viscusi and Masterman65 and calculate an income-adjusted extrapolation for each country and year. We assume that the income elasticity of the VSL is equal to one and use our base VSL together with GNI per capita data66. Next, we compute the monetized losses in 2019 USD by multiplying our plant-month-year level dataset on premature deaths by the country and year-specific VSL estimates. To construct Fig. 2a, we aggregate the resulting dataset to the country level and compute the mean. To construct Fig. 2c, we aggregate the same dataset to the LAC-year level.

Construction of future scenarios

We assemble a projection dataset to study the expected exposure of hydropower plants and the cost of drought-induced excess PM2.5. This analysis extends through 2059, aligning with the expected operational duration of existing combustion power plants. We use three scenarios constructed as combinations of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). These SSP-RCP scenarios are SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, and SSP3–7.0. The first exercise is based on monthly runoff projections from 22 climate and earth system models from the CMPI667 with available information under the scenarios considered (see Supplementary Table 2). We compute runoff anomalies for each model using the projections and runoff climatologies from the IEA51 (same as in our main analysis). We then calculate the FHD for each market using the same methodology. To assess future exposure, we use the resulting FHD series and compute, for LAC and each IEA sub-region, the percent change in mean FHD 2020–2059 relative to the mean between 2000 and 2019. This calculation results in 66 FHD projections (22 models × 3 scenarios).

To estimate premature deaths for each scenario and model, we modify the methodology used to calculate premature deaths in three ways. First, we compute excess PM2.5 using the FHD projections instead of the observed FHD. Second, we allow for the population exposed to adjust following the SSPs demographic projections of KC and Lutz68. Third, when aggregating premature deaths by market and year, we incorporate the retirement of combustion power plants based on IEA forecasts69. Each retirement schedule is aligned with the most closely matching SSP-RCP scenario based on the expected temperature rise by 2100. Specifically, for SSP1–2.6, we use the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which assumes that generation from coal, gas, and oil will decline according to country pledges. For the SSP2–4.5, we use the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), which assumes that generation declines based on IEA’s assessment of current and announced policies. For SSP3–7.0, we construct a Reference Electricity Scenario (RES), which assumes no combustion power plant retirements. All scenarios rule out the introduction of new combustion power plants and thus assume that any growth in electricity demand will be met with generation from non-combustion power plants. To present the most optimistic scenarios for PM2.5 reduction, we also assume that plants with the largest exposed population are retired first. Our calculations also assume that combustion power plants do not benefit from technological change that would allow pollution reductions. We also assume that the concentration-response function is constant, thus ruling out that populations adopt protective measures to limit their exposure to pollution.

To estimate the monetized losses corresponding to premature deaths, we perform a calculation analogous to that performed previously but allow the country-year VSL estimates to change following the SSPs economic growth projections of Cuaresma70.

Additionally, to isolate the contributions of each factor driving our projections (runoff, demographic and economic trends, and combustion plant retirement schedules), we systematically construct projections for each energy scenario across all SSP-RCP combinations. These results are presented in Supplementary Fig. 4.

House Republicans on Thursday morning narrowly passed a sweeping budget bill that guts federal support for wind, solar, storage and other clean energy industries.

The bill terminates most technology-neutral clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2028 and those that begin construction more than 60 days after the bill’s passage. It also tightens restrictions on foreign entities’ involvement in projects, creating a “truly untenable” situation for developers, Jeffries analysts said Thursday. Nuclear projects have more time to qualify for the credit.

The bill advances to the Senate, which is expected to take it up next month. Several Republican senators are calling for significant changes, and questions remain as to how the two houses will reconcile “sharply contrasting versions of the bill,” Jeffries said.

Dive Insight:

The text that passed the House on a 215-214, party-line vote early Thursday is even less favorable to clean energy interests than a previous draft that industry groups widely panned.

The bill terminates the 48E investment and 45Y production tax credits for non-nuclear clean energy projects placed in service after 2028, with no phaseout period. Projects must begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment — likely later this year — to be eligible for the credits.

The version the House Ways and Means Committee released on May 12 stepped down the value of the 48E and 45Y credits over three years and did not include the imminent construction-start requirement, giving developers and asset owners more leeway to wait out lengthy waits for grid interconnection.

Combined with even tighter restrictions on foreign involvement in U.S. clean energy projects, the truncated eligibility window leaves a “near impossible” pathway for non-nuclear developers to qualify for the 48E and 45Y credits, Jeffries said. The foreign involvement restrictions apply to “foreign entities of concern” like China, which controls much of the upstream supply chain for batteries, electric motors and other clean energy equipment.

The bill also eliminates the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credit transferability framework for most clean energy projects. Experts say transferability, which previously enjoyed bipartisan support, expands project financing options for small and midsize energy developers.

Following an outcry from industry groups like the Nuclear Energy Institute, the House bill extends production and investment tax credit eligibility for advanced nuclear projects and power uprates of existing reactors that begin construction by 2028. It also extends a separate production credit for existing nuclear power plants through 2031 and preserves transferability for nuclear projects.

The practical effect of the nuclear carveout is unclear. Projects like the planned reactor restarts at Constellation Energy’s 835-MW Crane Clean Energy Center and Holtec International’s 800-MW Palisades plant would likely qualify, but many greenfield projects are not expected to begin reactor construction until later this decade. For example, the Tennessee Valley Authority earlier this week began a more than two-year federal permitting process for a small modular reactor that it expects to begin building in late 2028.

The biggest surprise in the latest version of the bill is what Jeffries called the “intentional targeting” of the residential solar sector. The previous version of the bill quickly terminated the 25D tax credit for customer-owned residential solar installations while preserving it for installations leased by companies like Sunrun, the country’s biggest third-party solar and energy storage leasing enterprise.

“This short-lived advantage to [residential solar leases] was seemingly corrected, with new text now 'leveling the playing field' by targeting all future residential solar originations, whether leased or owned,” Jeffries said.

Shares of Sunrun fell about 40% in early Thursday trading.

Clean energy advocates and trade groups said the bill would devastate an industry driving the United States’ manufacturing boom while increasing customers’ utility bills and threatening the stability of the electric grid.

“This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses and innovation,” the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement.

The head of Advanced Energy United, another clean energy trade group, called the legislation a “meat cleaver” in a statement noting that solar, wind, storage and other “advanced energy” added 50 GW to the U.S. grid in 2024 and produced about $400 billion in domestic revenues.

The House bill “abruptly dismantles bipartisan, long-standing tax policy that has catalyzed billions in private investment for affordable, reliable energy while sparking a rebirth of manufacturing across America,” AEU President and CEO Heather O’Neill said. “If enacted as written, this bill will weaken our power system and send shockwaves throughout the U.S. economy by raising electricity prices, killing tens of thousands of jobs and ceding energy dominance to China.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/i5Paez0A9KhyPdFHS_haM_gAAsIxwuIiPdUTueet_k8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTY3OTMwNzc3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-22 12:24:14.099893

The sweeping domestic policy legislation includes extensions of President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increased funding for immigration enforcement and defense, and work requirements for Medicaid. The legislation is expected to add $2.3 trillion to the deficit.

Notably, the bill accelerates the phaseout of several green energy subsidies that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Starting in 2028, the bill's technology-neutral production and investment tax credits for clean electricity will be fully phased out. (Earlier drafts of the bill left a partial credit available through 2032.) To qualify for these tax credits, projects will need to begin construction within 60 days of the bill's enactment, reports The Hill. Tax credits for nuclear power will remain untouched through 2031. The energy clawbacks in an earlier version of this bill were estimated to raise $515 billion in revenue.

While rollbacks are better than keeping these tax credits fully intact, the bill falls woefully short by not repealing the IRA completely.

Signed into law in 2022, the IRA extended tax credits for green energy resources and created new ones for emerging technologies. The slew of new credits and subsidies was originally expected to cost $271 billion over 10 years. Within a year of its passage, the price tag of these provisions climbed to $536 billion and now stands at $1.2 trillion over 10 years. A recent analysis from the Cato Institute estimates that these subsidies could cost $1.97 trillion through 2034 and reach $4.67 trillion by 2050. One of the drivers of projected cost increases is the IRA's technology-neutral tax credits that have no sunset date and would only expire when a 75 percent reduction (compared to 2022 levels) in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electricity sector is achieved.

For some climate hawks, these costs may be a small price to pay for tackling climate change. But it's important to note that the IRA, which was heralded as ""the boldest climate bill ever"" when it was passed, has done a poor job at reducing GHG emissions.

""I don't think you could throw that much money at industry and have nothing happen, but the latest emission data shows a lot less [emission reduction] than the initially projected benefit,"" Philip Rossetti, senior fellow at the R Street Institute, tells Reason. Rossetti says it may take ""some time"" before hard numbers are available, but it's ""fair to say that the subsidies are under performing as a climate policy.""

While the IRA has failed as a climate policy, it has succeeded as a wealth transfer program. Wealthy households have been the largest beneficiaries of the bill's tax credits for energy efficiency and electric vehicles. Meanwhile, over 90 percent of claimed green energy tax credits have gone to corporations with annual revenue of $1 billion or more.

There are few things as permanent as a federal subsidy. By keeping these tax credits alive, Congress is giving industry groups a three-year runway to ramp up their lobbying efforts and keep these provisions in place. As the Cato Institute's Adam Michel and Joshua L. Loucks write, ""Subsidy-dependent industries don't need a long offramp; they need a clear signal that the taxpayer-funded gravy train is over.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/rollcallpix165172-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 13:14:00.832195

BYD edged out Tesla by fewer than 100 vehicles, according to data for 28 European countries released on Thursday by JATO Dynamics, a research firm. BYD sold 7,231 fully battery-powered cars in Europe last month, versus Tesla’s 7,165.

Despite the small margin, it is “a watershed moment for Europe’s car market,” Felipe Munoz, an analyst at JATO, said in a statement. European car buyers appear willing to embrace Chinese electric cars, which remain cheaper than locally made alternatives despite tariffs imposed by the European Union last year aimed at protecting domestic producers.

BYD’s battery-powered car sales jumped nearly 170 percent in April, versus the same month last year. That far surpassed the pace of sales for all electric cars, which grew by 17 percent over that period.

At the same time, Europeans are shunning Tesla, which for years was the most popular brand of electric cars in Europe. Its sales plunged 49 percent year over year in April, dropping Tesla to 11th in the rankings for the month. In the first quarter of the year, it ranked second in electric vehicle sales, behind Germany’s Volkswagen.

In Europe, Tesla’s cars first became available in Norway in 2014, before becoming the leading producer of electric vehicles on the continent. It began production at a factory outside Berlin in 2022 — the same year that BYD started selling cars in Norway and the Netherlands.

The Chinese automaker is building a factory in Hungary, as well as one in Turkey, which can export cars to the European Union without having to pay tariffs. This week, BYD announced that it would establish its European headquarters in Hungary, which it said would create 2,000 jobs, including in research and development.

Over the past year, BYD has expanded rapidly throughout Europe. If its plug-in hybrid models are also included, it increased sales by well over 300 percent in April, compared with the previous year. By this measure, it also outsold established European brands like Fiat, Dacia and Seat in some big European countries.

Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin engaged in a fiery exchange Wednesday during a Senate hearing, sparring over the EPA’s decision to cancel several grants amid widespread federal funding cuts under the Trump administration.

The confrontation escalated as Whitehouse pressed Zeldin on whether the agency had conducted individualized reviews before terminating the grants. Whitehouse cited sworn court statements and internal EPA testimony that, in his view, contradict Zeldin’s public claims.

Referencing a court filing by EPA official Travis Voyles—who stated that on February 25, 2025, he had “conducted an individualized review of EPA grant programs”—Whitehouse questioned the consistency of the administration’s narrative. He also highlighted a more recent Department of Justice court filing that appeared to acknowledge no such individual reviews had occurred.

“The problem with your assertion here today is that it is belied by your own employees’ sworn statements in court and by the decision of the Department of Justice to admit that what you say isn’t true,” Whitehouse said sharply.

Zeldin pushed back forcefully, saying, “No, you’re not grasping the fact that we would have multiple employees looking at these grants. That concept just escapes you.” He later added, “We’re not going to waste dollars just because you insist on EPA lighting taxpayer dollars on fire.”

He further accused Whitehouse of political posturing, claiming, “The American taxpayers, they put President Trump in office because of people like you… because you don’t care about 99 percent of this story.”

Whitehouse responded by reiterating his central concern: “What I want is for you to explain why the Department of Justice lawyers representing EPA in court, under a duty of candor, have said that everything you’ve just said isn’t true.” ⚓️🇺🇸🌊

This isn’t the first time in the past five years that Champaign-Urbana residents have faced electricity price hikes.
The program saved Champaign residents over $11.8 million during the Illinois electricity price hike between 2021 and 2023, city records showed.
The sharp increase in capacity price was then built into the overall supply price.
The record high capacity price is expected to affect ComEd’s electricity supply price beginning June 2025.","Residential energy bills this summer are expected to increase about 20% beginning in June.

On April 28, the grid operator in central and southern Illinois, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), released its 2025 auction result. The summer electricity capacity price surged more than 21 times, a jump that will be directly reflected in Champaign-Urbana residents’ electricity bills.

This capacity price reflects the rate paid to the operator to ensure there is enough power generation to meet peak demand. The annual capacity price in Illinois is now $217 per megawatt-day (MW-day), with a sharp seasonal spike to $666.50 per MW-day in the summer. By comparison, the summer price in 2024 was just $30 per MW-day.

On May 8, the Citizens Utility Board warned of widespread electric and gas rate increases across the state.

“As a result of the increase in summer capacity charges, starting on June 1 through September 30, the typical residential customer’s summer monthly bill is expected to increase by approximately 18% to 22%, depending on their usage,” Ellie Leonard, communication executive from Ameren Illinois, said in an email.

This isn’t the first time in the past five years that Champaign-Urbana residents have faced electricity price hikes.

A City of Champaign program that saved residents millions on their electric bills was suspended last year because city officials weren’t able to secure a favorable bid from retail electricity suppliers.

The city’s Municipal Electricity Aggregation (MEA) Program has been suspended since July 2024. The program saved Champaign residents over $11.8 million during the Illinois electricity price hike between 2021 and 2023, city records showed.

The city will seek a new electric supplier this August to reinstate the MEA program.

The City of Urbana contracted with two retail supplier companies for its own municipal program, with pricing 9.98 cent per kWh from July 2024 to Dec. 2024 and 8.036 cents per kWh from Dec. 2024 to May 2025.

The MEA Program is a result of the Illinois Power Agency Act passed in 2010. The act allows municipalities to purchase electricity for residents and eligible small businesses from retail suppliers through negotiated bids.

City of Champaign Program Specialist Jamie Vermillion said the city did not receive competitive pricing from retail electricity providers compared to the utility supply service provided by Ameren Illinois (hereafter referred to as Ameren), the assigned energy delivery provider in central and southern Illinois. Delivery service charges typically make up 30% to 40% of the total bill.

During the suspension of the program, the city plans to reinstate the procurement process for the next MEA term in early August 2025.

“The electricity market is very volatile, and electricity rate bids submitted by a retail electricity supplier for the city’s MEA Program will likely only be valid for a few hours,” the City of Champaign wrote in last year’s update on the suspension.

On average, the electricity supply charge accounts for 65% of the total price. From July 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025, Ameren’s electricity price was 8.277 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for the first 800 kWh, and 7.693 cents for usage beyond that.

The typical annual electricity usage for an Illinois resident is about 10,000 kilowatt-hours. During the electricity price spike, residents paid an additional $626 per year for supply costs, and even more during peak usage hours.

The deregulated electricity market in Illinois offers residents options to purchase electricity supply service from retail suppliers. In February 2025, approximately 1.25 million residents used alternative suppliers.

Downstate capacity shortfall triggered prior electricity price spike

Electricity bills residents receive include charges for delivery service and electricity supply — the delivery charge covers the cost of bringing electricity to homes, while the supply charge covers the cost of the electricity used.

The grid operator in Central and Southern Illinois, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, oversees the regional transmission system that ensures an adequate supply of electricity flows from power generators to the grid in Illinois, where it is delivered to homes and businesses.

The operator conducts a capacity auction to set the price paid to power generators to have enough reserve electricity available during peak demand periods, such as 100 degree summer days.

In April 2022, MISO’s annual auction raised the capacity price in Central and Southern Illinois — Ameren’s utility zone — from $5 per megawatt-day to $236.66 per megawatt-day.

In the auction, MISO also indicated capacity constraints in downstate Illinois. The sharp increase in capacity price was then built into the overall supply price. In June 2022, the rate reached 10.62 cents per kWh, nearly double than the month before. The price hike lasted the whole year, once dragging the rate to 12.236 cents per kWh.

Ameren provides electricity supply at its fixed rate through its Basic Generation Service, which is procured by the Illinois Power Agency through competitive auctions. This rate consists of the cost of wholesale electricity, electric capacity and transmission charges.

According to the Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois watchdog group that advocates for consumer protection, Ameren Illinois is a delivery-only utility. It does not profit from power supply, passing through the price of power to its customers dollar for dollar.

According to Ellie Leonard, a communication executive at Ameren Illinois, the energy supply price increase in 2022 was driven by several factors, notably a rise in natural gas prices.

Natural gas is the primary source of fuel used to produce electricity during peak hours in Central and Southern Illinois, and gas prices in 2022 were at their highest since 2008.

Another crucial factor was attributed to the post-pandemic demand and a shortage of available electric generation capacity.

“Downstate Illinois is a net importer of energy, we’re bringing in more energy to our region than we are producing,” Leonard said.

In 2021, Illinois passed the Climate Equitable Jobs Act, which set the goal to transition to 50% clean energy by 2040 and 100% clean energy by 2050.

The act aims to retire fossil fuel and coal power plants by 2045. In 2022, about 2,700 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity were shut down in response to stricter environmental regulations. Coal plants stepped down from their position as the second-largest source of electricity generation.

From 2021 to 2024, renewable and solar power plants in Illinois began increasing, contributing at least 10 million megawatt hours to the state’s electricity supply. However, the growth has been slower than the pace of fossil fuel plant retirements.

Overall, electricity generation from power plants fell by nearly 7.5 million megawatt hours from 2022 to 2023, resulting in the lowest net generation since 2020. The decrease in energy supply thus directly influences residents’ electricity bills.

“When there is not enough energy available to meet that demand, that’s when we see energy prices increase,” Leonard said.

Electricity price expected to increase in Illinois

“While the 2025 auction prices reflect a tightening supply-demand balance during the summer months, there is sufficient capacity throughout the MISO footprint,” MISO said in its press release.

In 2023, Ameren’s price dropped to 7.877 cents per kWh when MISO conducted its new round auction. Starting from August, the city contracted with Constellation for the program with a slightly lower price at 7.863 cents per kWh.

The electricity price hike through 2021 to 2023 impacted the Ameren Illinois electricity market with more lasting effect, compared to another electricity delivery company ComEd in Northern Illinois, which relieved its price level before the spike. The Citizens Utility Board tracks supply charges over time on its website for both companies.

ComEd, the electricity delivery company in Northern Illinois, operates in a different wholesale market that relies more on nuclear power plants for generating electricity. Five of six state nuclear power plants are located in ComEd’s territory, generating the territory’s main supply of electricity.

Though Northern Illinois has recovered from the 2022 price hike in recent years, the latest auction from its grid operator PJM Interconnection sent prices skyrocketing again from $28.92 per MW-day to a record $269.92 per MW-day. The record high capacity price is expected to affect ComEd’s electricity supply price beginning June 2025.

Champaign seeking new program supplier this summer

Typically, the Municipal Electricity Aggregation (MEA) program secures lower electricity supply rates than the Illinois Power Agency secures for Ameren Illinois customers who elect to take their power supply from the utility. Customers can also opt out of the municipal program to receive their power supply from an alternative electricity supplier.

The City of Champaign made a two-year contract with Energy Harbor to supply the municipal program from 2021 to 2023, with an electricity supply rate of 4.89 cent per kWh. The City said the program saved $11.8 million for customers in 21 months during the electricity price hike.

According to Vermillion, the city’s program specialist, the average number of billed accounts on the program during that time was 25,687, and each saved about $460 on average.

To select retail suppliers for the program, the city established a Plan of Operation and Governance to authorize the procurement process. The plan requires that bids from retail suppliers must be lower than Ameren’s rate.

Last summer, the city did not receive bids eligible for the selection criteria. During the suspension of the program, the city plans to reinstate the procurement process for the next program term in early August 2025.

Citing the complexity of the electricity market, the city said staff require assistance from professionals to evaluate suppliers and manage purchases. The city approved a not-to-exceed budget of $42,000 this year for the company to assist in finding a new supplier for the next program cycle.

According to the city, once an electric supplier contract is executed, the selected supplier must reimburse the city: $50,000 for a one-year contract, $55,000 for a two-year contract and $60,000 for a three-year contract. The increasing amounts reflect the added staff time required to manage longer-term contracts.

After a new contract is successfully executed, the city said the reimbursement from the supplier will offset the cost of counsel.",https://i0.wp.com/cu-citizenaccess.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image.png?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-22 12:24:18.448770

California’s clean air laws have been effective in reducing pollution, with vehicle-based pollutants dropping by 98% in the last 50 years.
To avoid having to amend or repeal the Clean Air Act, which would likely raise more eyebrows from the few republican voters with any remaining rationality or self-interest.
The vote was 51-44, with 50 republicans and one Democrat voting to harm Americans with this illegal act.
So, we hope that CARB will continue to act within the law, and ignore Congress’ violent action opposing clean air.","Republicans in Congress have voted to use the Congressional Review Act to roll back California’s states’ right to protect its own residents’ lungs and pocketbooks with better pollution rules.

But here’s the thing: Congress doesn’t have that authority because that’s not how the Congressional Review Act works, so the republican party is once again just letting everyone know that it wants to poison Americans and raise their fuel costs, no matter the legality of doing so.

We’ve heard plenty of stories recently about how the senile felon squatting in the White House wants to harm Americans. But in the last 100 days of the exact kind of incompetent flailing that anyone with half a brain expected out of him, relatively less attention has been paid to the attempts of republicans in Congress to poison Americans.

Well, they’ve decided to jump into the spotlight and remind everyone just how bad the entire party is, as republicans in Congress have voted to increase pollution and fuel costs for California and 11 other states.

Advertisement - scroll for more content

The vote comes in the form of a Congressional Review Act (CRA) action withdrawing California’s “waiver” from the EPA, even though the CRA does not apply to the waiver. The House voted on the same resolution a few weeks ago, and the Senate has passed its resolution today.

For more than half a century, California has asked for and been granted this waiver that allows it to set its own emissions rules. Other states can follow California’s rules (and around 11 states do so, though that amount differs for each rule), as long as they do so exactly, and as long as those rules are stronger than the national ones.

It has this unique authority because California had its own Clean Air Act before the federal Clean Air Act was passed, and because the state had a unique problem with smog at the time and needed stricter rules than the rest of the country. So a carveout was made in the federal law in recognition of this.

California’s clean air laws have been effective in reducing pollution, with vehicle-based pollutants dropping by 98% in the last 50 years. But of course, there’s still more to be done, as the LA area remains one of the smoggiest in the country due to factors including geography, high car dependency, heavy shipping traffic, and a lack of public transitt.

Despite the protestations of industry at the time and since, these rules have not made it impossible for them to operate, or sell cars, or profit from selling cars, in California or any other states that follow its rules.

California’s newest set of rules is set to save Californians, and the residents of other states who follow them, hundreds of billions of dollars on health, fuel, and maintenance costs through 2050 by encouraging electrification – and of course will save thousands of lives due to pollution reductions. Republicans targeted not just California’s regulation on light duty vehicles (ACC II), but also some other truck emissions rules (the ACT and HD low-NOx Omnibus rules).

So, Congress has declared it wants to end California’s progress in protecting its own residents. Despite the massive improvement in health and air quality, and reduction in health costs as a result, republicans in Congress are once again making it clear that they favor poisoning Americans, so much so that they’ll even try illegal actions to do it.

The problem with using the Congressional Review Act in this situation is that it is doubly illegal to do. The CRA gives Congress the authority to roll back government agency actions, like those of the EPA, but it has been rarely used since its passing, since doing so results in a dysfunctional government and an unpredictable business environment.

But the CRA has a time limit, and Congress must act to reverse these rules within 60 days. The EPA approved California’s waiver on December 18, 2024, which is more than 60 days ago; therefore, we are past the deadline where the CRA can be used.

Further, even if it were within 60 days, the CRA can’t be used to reject California’s waiver, because it isn’t a “rule.” The CRA only allows Congress to change “rules,” and the waiver isn’t a rule itself; it’s just EPA telling California that it can set its own rules. Both the Senate Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office (the real government office that holds government to account, unlike Elon Musk’s fake and redundant “Department of Government Efficiency” advisory board), along with many, many others have recognized that this is the case, and Congress knows it. But hey, at least they have the oil companies on their side.

So, Congress’ action here is illegal, and doubly so, because the waiver is not a rule, and it is outside of the 60 day window. This action is also dangerous to your health, exacerbates climate change, and will raise Americans’ fuel costs and cede ground to China in the changing global auto industry.

Notably, one republican Senator, Mike Lee of Utah, correctly acknowledged that this is an illegal action, stating clearly that “California’s CAA federal preemption waivers cannot be reviewed under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) because the waiver granted by EPA is not a rule as that term is defined in the CRA.” However, regardless of publicly acknowledging that this cannot be done, republicans still did it anyway.

They know that this vote has no legal backing – but it still took the vote anyway, impotently screaming from the rafters “WE WANT TO KILL YOU!!!”… which apparently some people still need to hear.

But if republicans know this is illegal, why are they doing it? There are likely a number of reasons:

To avoid the filibuster, which would give Democrats a chance to stand up for clean air, and which is not allowed for CRA actions (at least, within the 60 day window… which we are outside of, so that’s another way republicans are acting illegally).

To avoid having to amend or repeal the Clean Air Act, which would likely raise more eyebrows from the few republican voters with any remaining rationality or self-interest. This action is harder to understand and therefore more likely to go under the radar.

To show to their oil donors that they are aligned in their mission to harm life on earth.

Likely as another meaningless entry into the republican culture war, where the party starts ridiculous fights over nothing in order to stop or distract from positive motion on changes that might help alleviate some of the plight republicans are constantly trying to force on Americans.

The vote was 51-44, with 50 republicans and one Democrat voting to harm Americans with this illegal act. The Democrat was Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who voted for the measure despite the harm it will bring to the auto industry that is so important in her state, which will be made less relevant globally as it retreats in the face of rising competition from China.

The bill now goes to the desk of a convicted felon who is Constitutionally barred from holding office in the US, where he will undoubtedly mark it with his chicken-scratch, as he promised the oil industry he would do in exchange for a billion dollars in bribes (which he only received a fraction of).

California’s response may or may not involve legal action – despite that this is illegal, the CRA also claims that it is not subject to judicial review, which is a violation of the checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution.

California could alternately seek to achieve the same goals through other measures that have no Congressional oversight, such as charging higher registration fees for gasoline-powered vehicles (something which many states, including California, already stupidly do against electric cars, at the behest of, once again, the oil industry – and yes, republicans want to do this federally, too).

For its part, the California Air Resources Board, the organization responsible for California’s regulations, said “CARB will continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution” after the House’s initial CRA vote. So, we hope that CARB will continue to act within the law, and ignore Congress’ violent action opposing clean air.

And California Governor Gavin Newsom reacted, stating “This Senate vote is illegal. Republicans went around their own parliamentarian to defy decades of precedent. We won’t stand by as Trump Republicans make America smoggy again — undoing work that goes back to the days of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan — all while ceding our economic future to China.“

Meanwhile, doctors, nurses, scientists, environmental groups, many businesses, people who recognize that they have lungs which they would like to continue using, and so on, generally support the strongest regulation possible.

More than 100 clean air groups sent a letter supporting the waiver in the face of republican attacks on your health… and another one led by the American Lung Association, and another one led by the Natural Resources Defense Council, and another one led by the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards. But who listens to those idiots when there’s oil donor money at stake?

That hasn’t stopped other bad actors from stepping in to show support. The auto lobbyist that represents virtually every car company, which calls itself the “Alliance for Automotive Innovation” despite routinely opposing electrification efforts, came out in favor of ending California’s clean air rules. This is despite the weasel who runs the organization, John Bozzella, appearing on stage to give a speech when the EPA implemented rules with similar goals on a national level.

Bozzella has long stated that he thinks California and the EPA should have the same set of rules – but his organization is the one that originally lobbied Mr. Trump, during his first period squatting in the White House, to shatter the single national standard that had been set up under President Obama, opening this Pandora’s Box to begin with. And in case you need a reminder, California ended up winning that fight, which somebody predicted well ahead of time.

And don’t forget: the Alliance Against Automotive Innovation’s opposition to EVs will signal the final nail in the coffin for the US auto industry. China is getting great at building EVs, to the point that other nations are desperately trying to put up barriers to stop them. But it hasn’t worked, and it won’t work. The only thing that will work is getting more serious about EVs, and trying to stop them ain’t it.

And, of course, the oil industry, responsible for untold death and destruction, has also arranged itself on the side of this illegal action to poison Americans and raise their fuel costs, alongside republicans in Congress. What a surprise.

We, at least, know what side we’re on.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/349912280_f9839a8826_k-e1734143671371.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-22 14:20:34.802907

On Thursday morning, the House passed the tax bill — an expansive piece of legislation that would extend the president's 2017 tax cuts and make key changes to the tax system, along with implementing significant changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

The bill is now headed to the Senate, where it's subject to change.

""Now, it's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Thursday morning. ""There is no time to waste.""

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that the tax bill in its current form would increase the US deficit. Moody's Analytics downgraded the US's credit rating last week, saying Trump's tax bill could add $4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. This could lead to higher interest rates on mortgages, auto loans, and more down the road.

Here are four other key ways the tax bill could affect Americans' finances.

A slew of tax policies

Many of Trump's campaign promises are included in the tax bill.

The legislation would allow workers who typically receive tips and overtime wages to claim a tax deduction on those amounts. The bill also has a measure for a $4,000 tax deduction for older people making less than $75,000 a year. Those two provisions would extend until 2029.

The bill would also raise the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,500 through 2028. Additionally, it would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits and establish a $250 annual registration fee for electric vehicle owners.

The bill would also make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and increase the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.

Student loan forgiveness repealed

Under Trump's tax bill, millions of student loan borrowers would see their repayment options change. The legislation proposes eliminating income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two options: the Repayment Assistance Plan and a standard repayment plan.

The Repayment Assistance Plan would allow for loan forgiveness after 360 qualifying payments based on the borrowers' income, while the standard repayment plan would require a fixed monthly payment over a period set by the servicer.

The bill also would repeal former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, an income-driven repayment plan that promised cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline for debt relief. The plan is blocked in court pending a final legal decision.

'Trump accounts'

If the bill passes, parents could get extra money for their kids down the line. The tax bill includes a ""Trump account,"" previously called a ""money account for growth and advancement,"" or MAGA account. The government would put $1,000 into accounts for babies born after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2029. The baby would be required to have been born in the US and have a Social Security number to receive the cash.

The accounts would have tax incentives; earnings would be tax-deferred, meaning taxes on the accounts would not need to be paid right away. Withdrawals from the accounts would also be taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate, which is dependent on income and typically lower than the regular income tax rate.

Work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP

Lower-income Americans could face bigger healthcare costs or lose federal assistance benefits. The tax bill would mean significant changes for the millions who rely on Medicaid and SNAP. The legislation would mandate that states implement an 80-hour-a-month work requirement by the end of 2026 for childless adults on Medicaid without a disability.

In the United States, tax incentives and infrastructure investments play a role in speeding the adoption of electric vehicles (EV). In a new study, researchers examined the effects of competing government incentives on EV adoption in Washington State by building a structural dynamic discrete demand model. In terms of expanding the EV market, the study found that building an EV charging network is more effective than awarding a tax rebate.

The study, published in Marketing Science, was conducted by Cheng Chou, an independent researcher, and Tim Derdenger, Associate Professor of Marketing and Strategy at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business. The paper, “CCP Estimation of Dynamic Discrete Choice Demand Models with Segment Level Data and Continuous Unobserved Heterogeneity: Rethinking EV Subsidies vs. Infrastructure,” uses data from Washington state between 2016 and 2019 to analyze consumer decisions around buying an EV or staying with a gasoline-powered car. Their findings upend the debate over EV incentives, suggesting that the key to widespread adoption may lie not in bigger tax credits but in better infrastructure.

Derdenger explains, “The main contribution of our study is our development of a new approach that uses segment-level data to model, identify, and estimate a dynamic discrete choice demand model without replacement for durable goods with dynamic selection, continuous unobserved consumer heterogeneity, and continuous unobserved product characteristics.”

Currently, the U.S. government offers a tax credit for EV buyers based on battery size. Chou and Derdenger’s research shows that tying the credit to a vehicle’s electric range (how far it can go on a single charge) would do more to boost sales and cut emissions without raising costs. By linking credits to range, their model predicts an increase in EV numbers by roughly 1.5 percent in the three largest counties in Washington state alone while, compared to the existing policy, reducing emissions by 11 percent.

The study finds that investing in charging infrastructure could outshine subsidies altogether. Removing tax credits and redirecting funds to build a network of Level 3 fast-charging stations could increase EV adoption by almost 26 percent, reducing emissions 51 percent.

When multiple groups of consumers exist in the same market, researchers can consider each group’s conditional choice probabilities (CCP) as a function of unobserved consumer heterogeneity and specify choice probabilities of one group as a function of another by shifting the unobserved component. Using this new CCP estimator, researchers estimated consumer demand for EVs in three counties in the state of Washington using aggregate consumer segment sales data between 2016 and 2019.

“Our estimation method has broader application than the study of EV adoption,” notes Chou, who coauthored the study. “Our method can be used in markets with many different products.”",https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/images/assets/electric-vehicle.png,N,,2025-05-22 14:18:48.655994

In a razor-thin 215—214 vote, the Republican-led House pushed through the more-than-1,000-page bill after days of tense negotiations among deeply divided GOP factions.

Speaker Mike Johnson said: ""To put it simply, this bill gets Americans back to winning again.""

The budget bill now moves to the Senate, where Republicans maintain a slim majority.

Two Republicans Vote Against Bill

Two Republicans broke ranks and joined every House Democrat in voting against the bill, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio. Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, voted ""present."" Two Republicans, Representatives David Schweikert of Arizona and Andrew Garbarino of New York, did not vote.

Why It Matters

The legislation would make permanent the individual income and estate tax cuts passed during Trump's first term and add fresh exemptions for tipped income, overtime pay, and interest on certain auto loans—moves designed to appeal to working-class voters.

To help offset the anticipated revenue shortfall, estimated at roughly $3.8 trillion, the bill would repeal or fast-track the expiration of clean energy tax credits enacted under President Joe Biden. That rollback would substantially reduce the net cost of the package.

Among the temporary measures included is a boost to the standard deduction: an increase of $1,000 for individual taxpayers, bringing it to $16,000, and a $2,000 increase for joint filers, raising their deduction to $32,000. The deduction directly reduces taxable income.

The child tax credit would also see a temporary $500 increase, rising to $2,500 for tax years 2025 through 2028, before reverting to $2,000. Future adjustments would be pegged to inflation.

In a significant win for wealthier households, the estate tax exemption would climb to $15 million, with annual inflation adjustments ensuring it continues to rise over time.

Additionally, the package includes $350 billion in new spending. Around $150 billion would go to the Pentagon for projects including for the Trump's new "" Golden Dome"" defense shield, and the rest would help fund the president's mass deportation and border security agenda.

New Work Requirements for Medicaid

A focal point of the package is nearly $700 billion in reduced spending in the Medicaid program, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new ""community engagement requirements"" of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. The new requirements would begin on Dec. 31, 2026. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, rather than just once.

What People Are Saying

Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Leader, Whip Katherine Clark and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar released a joint statement from the Democratic leadership: ""Today, every single House Democrat voted to stop the largest cuts to Medicaid and food assistance in American history. The GOP Tax Scam rips healthcare and food assistance away from millions of people in order to provide tax cuts to the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected.

""House Republicans promised to lower costs. Instead, Donald Trump's One Big Ugly Bill will mean millions of families will pay higher premiums, copays and deductibles. Hospitals will close, nursing homes will shut down and communities will suffer. It will take food out of the mouths of children, seniors and veterans at a time when too many families are already struggling to live paycheck to paycheck.

""The GOP Tax Scam is deeply unpopular, which is why Republicans made every effort to advance it during the dead of night. For more than 28 hours, beginning with Rules Committee Ranking Member Jim McGovern, Democrats forced Republicans to debate this toxic legislation before the American people. This fight is just beginning, and House Democrats will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure that the GOP Tax Scam is buried deep in the ground, never to rise again.""

Representative Tony Gonzales (Rep) of Texas said: ""After four years of disastrous national security and economic policies, we're putting America back on the right track.

""This morning, I voted yes on the House reconciliation package, which includes funding to reimburse our state for Operation Lone Star costs, a priority I've fought for since House budget talks began. Through my seat on the House Homeland Security Committee, I helped shape the bill's border security provisions, which include funding for checkpoint upgrades, new technology and infrastructure, Operation Stonegarden law enforcement grants, and CBP bonuses. This legislation also extends critical tax cuts, protecting TX-23 families from a 24% tax hike, and streamlines natural gas permitting to boost energy production in West Texas and lower energy costs.""

Representative Elise Stefanik (Rep) of New York said: ""Today, I was proud to be the deciding vote to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill, a historic victory for New Yorkers and President Trump's America First agenda.

""More than 77 million Americans gave House Republicans and President Trump a mandate to cut taxes, secure our borders, restore energy independence, and deliver peace through strength.

This legislation includes key provisions that will benefit hardworking New York families. I was especially proud to work with my New York Republican colleagues to lead on delivering significant tax relief for New Yorkers by increasing the State and Local Tax cap by 300%—a win for hard working families struggling under the weight of the highest tax burden in the nation because of Gov. Kathy Hochul's failed Far Left tax and spend Democrat policies.""

What's Next

The bill now heads to the Senate, where it is likely to face significant revisions before a final vote.

The company's CEO, Elon Musk, is one of America's most divisive corporate leaders because of his mercurial nature. As a result, Tesla's stock price has taken a roller coaster ride over the past decade.

Elon Musk's supporters applaud his seemingly single-handedly taking the electric vehicle market mainstream. His detractors point to a string of broken promises on model launch timelines and Tesla's much-delayed autonomous vehicles.

More recently, the debate between fans and foes has intensified due to his spending hundreds of millions supporting President Trump's election bid and his new role running the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, an organization in the executive branch tasked with cutting costs.

Musk's foray into politics has frustrated once-loyal, left-leaning supporters worldwide, causing sagging Tesla sales in markets such as Europe, China, and California.

As a result, Tesla shares have seen highs and lows in 2025. Shares fell 54% from its December peak to its low in April before rallying 52% since April 9 after President Donald Trump paused most of the reciprocal tariffs announced on April 2.

The impressive rally has caught many investors flat-footed, but additional gains may be harder to come by, particularly now that an uncommon warning signal has flashed.

Tesla struggles to maintain its moat

Tesla's (TSLA) became an aspiration vehicle coveted by celebrities and performance fans because of an important decision by Elon Musk to concentrate on luxury and speed rather than the environment.

The decision resulted in vehicles that could hold their own against rivals such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Porsche, leaving competitors like Ford and General Motors without comparable EVs to sell to willing buyers.

Unfortunately for Tesla, the luxury and performance gap with competitors has closed.

Detroit's big three car companies and almost every automaker worldwide have spent billions building EVs offering similar performance and potentially better fit-and-finish.

Stiffening competition has caused Tesla's electric vehicle market share to shrink at the same time that demand has fallen because of Musk's political activism.

Tesla’s first-quarter sales fell 62.2% year-over-year in Germany, according to KBA, and U.S. unit sales volume declined 9% from last year in Q1, according to KBB.

In California, Tesla registrations dropped 21.5% in Q1 versus Q1 2024, while non-Tesla EV registrations increased 14%.

According to the Cox/KBB quarterly EV sales report, while U.S. Tesla units sold tumbled in the first quarter, Ford's EV sales rose 12%, and General Motors brands Cadillac, GMC, and Chevrolet grew 37%, 184%, and 114%.

Tesla stock may face headwinds after rare warning signal

Tesla's struggles haven't disappeared, despite its stock price marching significantly higher over the past six weeks.

As a result, investors are right to wonder if the rally in Tesla shares will stall until there's more clarity that the company is back on track.

In its recent first-quarter conference call, Elon Musk said he would refocus on Tesla and spend less time on DOGE.

Musk has also said recently in Qatar that, ""Europe is our weakest market, but we're strong everywhere else. Our sales are doing well at this point, and we don't anticipate any sales shortfall.""

Those signs are encouraging, but Musk didn't provide evidence supporting his claim, and until more sales data comes in, Tesla fans will feel a bit uneasy.

It doesn't help matters that one technical indicator raises a red flag that Tesla's stock may have run too far, too fast.

It's the relative strength index, or RSI. RSI (14) measures price action over the preceding 14 trading periods and can signal when stocks become overbought and oversold.

When the RSI is above 70, it signals ""buyer beware."" However, when it dips below 30, it can suggest shares may be about to move higher.

For example, Tesla's RSI eclipsed 80 in mid-December when shares were near $480. Its RSI was in the 20s at its recent lows near $220.

The RSI isn't as high as December, but it was nearly 73 on May 14.

The move in RSI above 70 could mean that Tesla's stock price is due for a breather after its big run, but nothing is guaranteed. Stocks rarely turn on a dime and can get and remain overbought and oversold for a while.

Nevertheless, the technical signal is a yellow flag suggesting more gains could be harder to come by in the short term. What happens long-term is anyone's guess, but it will likely hinge on whether Musk is correct that its demand problem is going away.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjEzNjIxNjQwMjU5NDQ2MjIz/elon-musk-not-happy.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 12:26:02.601814

More than five decades ago, Congress set into law California’s authority to curb the vehicle pollution that is worsening its already poor air quality, subject to a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Clean Air Act also allows other states to choose to adopt California’s standards.

Since 1967, the EPA has granted California more than 75 waivers. Before today, Congress had never passed a measure to overturn an EPA waiver decision.

This vote also severely undermines Senate norms, as the Senate Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office had both held that these waivers could not be revoked by a fast-tracked CRA vote. Senate Republicans defied those rulings, creating a new path for evading the Senate filibuster in the process.

The following is a comment from Manish Bapna, president of NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“This vote is an unprecedented and reckless attack on states’ legal authority to address the pollution causing asthma, lung disease, and heart conditions. After a multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign from Big Oil, Republicans readily jettisoned their long-held view that states can best enact measures that reflect the values and interests of their residents.

“Halting these standards makes no sense: They reduce costs for drivers, boost domestic manufacturing, improve air quality, and help address the climate crisis.

“If other states don’t like California’s approach, they don’t need to follow it—but federal lawmakers shouldn’t be intervening to block states from providing cleaner air and a healthier environment.”

Background:

Recognizing the state’s unique air-quality challenges, Congress specifically gave California the authority to set stronger tailpipe emissions standards when it passed the Clean Air Act more than five decades ago. Congress also gave other states the right to adopt California standards.

Blocking the Advanced Clean Cars II measure would have grave consequences for consumers, public health, and the economy. It would:

Cost consumers more than $73 billion in additional fuel costs through 2040—and more than $50 billion in net costs for owning and operating a vehicle

The Clean Air Act allows California to set stricter-than-federal standards for vehicular pollution, with EPA approval, due to its historic smog problems.","The Senate voted Thursday to axe California’s phaseout of new gas-powered cars, making a controversial move to sidestep the parliamentarian in the process.

The vote was 51-44, and the measure now heads to President Trump’s desk; he is expected to sign it.

The move is a massive one for the U.S. vehicle market and for the planet, as automakers would no longer have to work toward an electric-only future in California and the 11 other states that have adopted its rule.

But it also has significance regarding Senate procedure, as the upper chamber moved to circumvent a ruling from its parliamentarian finding that it could not vote down the measure with just a simple majority.

What the Senate actually overturned is not the California mandate itself, but the Biden administration’s approval of the Golden State’s policy.

The parliamentarian determined that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval was not subject to a congressional maneuver that allowed it to evade the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold.

Both the House and Senate have voted to axe federal approval of California’s standard using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows Congress to strike down recently approved regulations with a simple majority.

But the Senate parliamentarian and Congress’s Government Accountability Office (GAO) have found that the Biden administration EPA’s decision is not subject to the act because it is a waiver, not a regulation.

However, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) held a series of procedural votes Wednesday night that aimed to sidestep the parliamentarian’s ruling.

In particular, he raised “points of order” that allowed the Senate to vote for itself on whether EPA waivers are subject to be overturned by the CRA.

“When the Senate is facing a novel situation like this one … it is appropriate for the Senate to speak as a body to the question, something the Senate does when questions over applications of the rules arise,” Thune said during a floor speech.

In response, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) reiterated that the waiver is not a rule.

“What was unprecedented was for the House to send over a document, claiming, falsely according to the parliamentarian, that the waiver is in fact a rule under the CRA and to blame the GAO or the parliamentarian for that is to mistake the referee from the player that committed the foul.”

“The foul here is pretending that a waiver is a rule and both the GAO and the parliamentarian independently blew the whistle on that foul.”

Democrats this week have accused their Republican colleagues of “going nuclear” — arguing that ignoring the parliamentarian’s decision undercuts the filibuster — under which most Senate legislation requires 60 votes to pass.

The Clean Air Act allows California to set stricter-than-federal standards for vehicular pollution, with EPA approval, due to its historic smog problems. In 2022, the state said it would ban new sales of gas-powered cars by 2035.

The Biden administration approved that rule in December 2024.",https://fox56news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/05/barrassojohn_052025gn01_w_0542d9.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-22 14:21:29.365208

The Senate has only overruled its parliamentarian a handful of times in the 90-year history of the role.

The Senate has not yet voted on related resolutions to revoke two more waivers related to heavy-duty trucks. One allows California to mandate zero-emission trucks, and the other permits stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks.

Congress is using a law called the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, as a mechanism to revoke the federal waivers that allowed California to set these rules. The House previously approved three resolutions to revoke the waivers.

But there are significant questions about whether this use of the CRA is legal; the Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian, who serve as referees within the federal government, both determined that it is not.

The GAO's opinion is merely advisory. The parliamentarian's guidance is also non-binding, but the Senate has traditionally followed it. While disregarding this advice is not unprecedented, it's extremely rare. Historically, leaders of both parties have feared that if they act unilaterally to change the Senate's norms, the other party will do the same when they're in power. That's exactly what happened in 2013 and 2017, when first Democrats and then Republicans deployed the ""nuclear option"" to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominees.

""Today it's all about California emission waivers. But tomorrow, the CRA could now be used to erase any policy from an agency that the Trump administration doesn't like at a simple majority threshold,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday evening as he tried unsuccessfully to derail the vote. He argued that the CRA could subsequently be used to repeal any policies the White House — including future administrations — doesn't support, including waivers related to Medicaid or reproductive health care. ""Republicans should tread carefully today,"" he said. ""What goes around comes around.""

Republicans have embraced a legal argument that the CRA can be used in this case. Speaking Wednesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said that Republicans were not changing the Senate's broader rules or norms, and suggested other reasons for Democratic opposition. ""I think a lot of Democrats support an electric vehicle mandate,"" he said. ""In fact I think they're somewhat frantic at the prospect of losing this 'Green New Deal' policy.""

California Attorney General Rob Bonta has said that this use of the CRA is unlawful, and the state is expected to challenge it in court. ""For more than 50 years, California has exercised its right under the federal Clean Air Act to pursue solutions that address the persistent air pollution challenges that our state faces,"" Bonta wrote in a statement to NPR after the earlier House vote. ""Reducing emissions is essential to the prosperity, health, and wellbeing of California and its families.""

Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom framed the vote as a national economic issue, arguing that rolling back the standards risks ceding the global EV market to China, where EVs make up a much higher share of production than in the U.S. ""The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for. Will you side with China or America?"" he wrote in a statement.

A unique ability

Because of its long history of regulating vehicle emissions, California has the unique ability to establish rules that are more ambitious than the federal ones. Each rule requires a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other states can choose to follow California's stricter standards if they want.

California has used this ability to push the auto industry toward zero-emission vehicles for many years, both to protect human health and to reduce the transportation industry's contributions to climate change.

In the first Trump administration, the EPA withdrew a waiver that allowed California to set vehicle standards. A legal battle ensued. Some carmakers sided with the White House and others with Sacramento in the fight over whether that was legal. But the battle became moot after the Biden administration reinstated the waiver.

Since then, California's mandates have become more aggressive, requiring a rapid acceleration in electric vehicle production, starting with 35% of new sales within the state in model year 2026 and reaching 100% of new sales by 2035.

Critics have called that goal unrealistic, given that currently EVs make up about a quarter of new car sales in California, and about 10% of sales nationally. Supporters say that the rules are flexible enough to make them more achievable than they seem.

Supporters also say that the state's standards are more important, the weaker federal rules get — especially with the Trump administration now poised to roll back federal environmental regulations, including on emissions standards.

In April, more than 100 public health and environmental groups sent a letter to Congress saying that blocking the California standards would mean ""more children suffering asthma attacks and missing school, more grandparents dying prematurely, and more death and destruction from extreme weather.""

The use of the CRA to revoke the waiver is new; last time, Congress wasn't involved and the executive branch withdrew the waiver on its own. But just like during the first Trump administration, expect this decision to trigger a legal battle, as California, climate advocates and health groups are almost certain to defend the state's rules.

Industry allied against the regulations

President Trump campaigned against ""EV mandates"" and ""gas car bans"" that would require gas cars to be replaced with electric ones. And while federal EV rules are not technically mandates, California's more aggressive rules do directly require companies to stop selling new gas vehicles (unless they can also run on electricity, like plug-in hybrids do).

The Trump administration has powerful allies in its fight against these rules. The oil industry has repeatedly sued to challenge California's stricter rules. The agriculture lobby, which favors biofuels over batteries, also opposes the California waiver. A group of more than 100 energy, agriculture and transportation trade groups issued a letter in mid-March urging Congress to disapprove the California waivers, arguing the three California rules would ""harm American economic and national security"" by increasing reliance on battery supply chains that are dominated by China.

The American Petroleum Institute has argued that electric vehicle mandates reduce consumer choice and raise the up-front costs of vehicles. In legal filings and public comments, the group also emphasizes it would cost the oil industry enormously.

""[An EV] mandate would produce widespread effects on the national economy, such as the reduced need for oil and gas production and gas processing, and changes to petroleum refining and distribution,"" the group wrote in one set of comments in 2024, describing the changes required to meet California's rules as ""extraordinary.""

Automakers have also opposed the rule, although the issue is more complicated for the auto industry than for the oil industry. Carmakers would like some regulatory stability, since they need to plan vehicle production years in advance. In the name of stability, some automakers previously volunteered to keep following some California regulations during the first Trump administration, when they were disputed.

On the other hand, many traditional automakers think that California's current rules are unrealistic, particularly for the dozen or so states that have opted in to follow those standards.

The U.S. House voted 246-164 earlier in May to pass a CRA measure to overturn the California waiver.","Washington — The U.S. Senate passed a measure Thursday canceling California regulations that would have required a 100% transition to electric vehicles for new car and truck models in many states by 2035.

The vote on the Congressional Review Act measure passed 51-44 along mostly party lines, with all Republicans present voting in favor. Michigan Democratic U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Holly joined the GOP in supporting the measure.

""Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035. Michigan is the auto capital of the world, and as Michigan’s U.S. Senator, I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry,"" she said in a statement.

Other Democrats had criticized the legislation in recent weeks less for its substance and more for Republicans' decision to hold a vote at all, overruling the Senate's nonpartisan arbiter of chamber procedures along the way.

The measure, approved with a simple majority via the CRA, next moves to President Donald Trump's desk for approval. The Republican leader is all but certain to sign it into law after repeatedly bashing ""EV mandates"" on the campaign trail in automotive-heavy Michigan last year.

Much of the debate over the measure Wednesday and Thursday centered around parliamentary procedures and the Senate's longstanding filibuster rules, which effectively set a 60-vote threshold for most actions to pass.

The impact on the auto industry will be immense. California has long set nation-leading standards for vehicle tailpipe emissions that force companies to consider stricter state environmental policies on top of more lax federal regulations. Now, automakers — barring a successful legal challenge to the Senate's action — will be spared from California's latest rules, its strictest yet.

Thirteen states had voluntarily adopted the rules with the goals of fighting climate change, improving air quality and pushing American automakers to build electric cars and trucks that better compete with China's surging EV prowess. Some states, however, had begun to pull back on their pledges amid lower-than-hoped-for EV sales.

The measure's passage is a blow to California's rule-setting authority and a victory for companies seeking more regulatory flexibility.

Industry reaction

The U.S. auto industry lobbied heavily to have the waiver overturned, claiming that the strict rules would represent an existential threat to automakers and dealerships. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the top automotive lobbying group in Washington, immediately celebrated the measure's passage.

""The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,"" said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the alliance. ""Automakers warned federal and state policymakers that reaching these EV sales targets would take a miracle, especially in the coming years when the mandates get exponentially tougher.""

He continued: ""The Senate (and the House before it) deserve enormous credit. Instead of kicking the can down the road or waiting for regulatory failure and its consequences, they voted to restore a degree of balance to U.S. vehicle emissions regulations.

""The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate — not the technology. You can be against the (California) EV mandates ... and believe that transportation is trending toward a range of electrified products like battery electric vehicles, hybrids and plug-in hybrids).""

Two top oil and gas lobbying groups, American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute, also applauded the Senate's action.

“Today, the United States Senate delivered a victory for American consumers, manufacturers, and U.S. energy security by voting to overturn the prior administration’s EPA rule authorizing California’s gas car ban and preventing its spread across our country,” said the group’s presidents, Chet Thompson and Mike Sommers, in a joint statement.

They continued: “Congress has made clear that California regulators have no authority to dictate what cars Americans can buy or to ban internal combustion engine vehicles. President Trump can now deliver on a major part of his campaign promise to end EV mandates in the United States.”

Environmentalists, meanwhile, denounced the move on its merits and on procedure.

“Senate Republicans just voted to break the law and increase asthma, lung cancer and cardiac deaths,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. “Robbing California of its clean air protections is a fundamental betrayal of democracy. This vote is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people’s health and their wallets.”

Even though Michigan is not among the states that had pledged to follow California's standards, the fate of the regulations was a question with billions of dollars at stake for the Detroit Three automakers over the next decade.

Detroit-based General Motors Co. cheered the prospect of a vote earlier in the week: “GM believes in customer choice, and we continue to focus on offering the best and broadest portfolio of vehicles on the market,"" spokesperson Bill Grotz said in a Tuesday statement. ""GM has long supported one national standard and consistency in emissions regulations that are aligned with market realities; the CRA measure would help ensure this.”

Dearborn-based Ford Motor Co. also praised the move. “In America, the customer chooses, and we need national emissions standards that not only drive progress but also reflect market realities,"" said Ford spokesperson Robyn Jackson in a Tuesday statement.

""We also need to preserve tax policies that recognize the future of the global automotive industry is up for grabs, and that domestic manufacturing and home-grown innovation are how the United States will win,"" she added, a reference to automotive tax credits House Republicans have proposed cutting.

Procedure particulars

The vote Thursday was not technically on the California rules themselves, which were scheduled to phase in between 2026 and 2035, but rather a Biden-era waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allowing the Golden State to enact its newest set of emissions standards for light-duty vehicles.

The Senate voted on the waiver using the CRA, a law that gives Congress the power to cancel rules set by outgoing presidents, so long as the rules were finalized within the last 60 legislative days of a given year. Proponents of the waiver have argued that it is not a rule and therefore not subject to the CRA.

""This is not a narrow assertion of congressional authority, as the other side claims,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said on the Senate floor Wednesday evening ahead of procedural votes teeing up the measure's final passage. ""This is an aggressive new precedent.""

""Today, it's all about California emissions waivers,"" he said. ""But tomorrow, the CRA could now be used to erase any policy from an agency that the Trump administration doesn't like at a simple majority threshold.""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, downplayed those concerns while also condemning the California policy. He said EPA waivers for California are ""clearly rules in substance, given their nationwide impact and scope.""

""I would love to believe the Democrats have suddenly come to the realization of the importance of the legislative filibuster, no matter how misplaced their concerns would be in this particular instance,"" Thune said, responding to Schumer.

The Republican added: ""I think a lot of Democrats support an electric vehicle mandate and are perfectly happy to allow California to set an EV mandate for the whole country. In fact, I think they're somewhat frantic at the prospect of losing this Green New Deal policy.""

Former Democratic President Joe Biden, notably, could have skirted the issue by issuing the waiver earlier in his presidency. But Biden's wait until the final days of his term left the waiver vulnerable to a CRA challenge.

Crucially, all CRA measures require only a simple majority in both the House and Senate. That gave the California waiver vote an easier pathway to success in the Senate, where most actions require 60 votes and Republicans hold a 53-47 majority.

The U.S. House voted 246-164 earlier in May to pass a CRA measure to overturn the California waiver. Three Michigan House lawmakers were among 35 Democrats who voted for the measure: U.S. Reps. Shri Thanedar of Detroit, Hillary Scholten of Grand Rapids and Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City.

Republican U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township was a leader in that effort. ""I have nothing against EVs. I would love to build every EV in Michigan, but my problem is with top-down, comply-or-die regulations dictated by the federal government,"" he told The Detroit News in a September interview.

Michigan's senior Democratic U.S. Sen Gary Peters of Bloomfield Township opposed the measure Thursday.

""People should be able to buy the car that best meets their own needs, whether it’s electric or gas-powered,"" Peters said Tuesday after Republicans announced plans for the vote. ""But in this case, Republicans are just using this issue as a trojan horse to blow up the Senate’s rules and make it easier to ram through the Trump administration’s harmful agenda and overturn policies they oppose, like protections for workers and Americans’ access to health care.”

California's next move

California and environmental groups are likely to mount legal challenges to the move.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom convened a special state legislative session in November to focus on ""bolstering California legal resources"" related to environmental issues, among others, against actions from the incoming Trump administration.

""The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack — and we won’t sit idle. California has faced this challenge before, and we know how to respond,"" he said in a press release at the time.

The state's emissions regulator, the California Air Resources Board, bashed Republicans' decision to hold the vote, saying in a statement that the move was ""inconsistent with past precedent and violates the plain language of the Congressional Review Act itself.""

The agency added: ""The vote does not change CARB’s authority. CARB will continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.”

Michael Buschbacher, a partner at the law firm Boyden Gray PLLC, said California is ""pretty limited"" in its options for legal recourse. ""The CRA has a provision that says that, basically, anything Congress does under the CRA is not subject to judicial review,” he said in a phone interview ahead of the vote.

Buschbacher, who represents clients seeking to block pro-EV regulations, also questioned California's ability to get a waiver for similar rules later on, if or when Democrats return to power in Washington.

“The CRA also says that federal agencies cannot do something substantially similar to a rule that gets CRA’ed. That phrase has not really been tested in court,"" the attorney said. ""The way I would interpret it would be: California can't get a waiver from the EPA for electric vehicle mandates.""

He also predicted that the ""notoriously retaliatory"" state of California might use regulatory strategies, like certifications for compliance with highly complicated national on-board diagnostic standards, to ""make companies miserable"" if automakers do not adhere to its preferred emissions standards.

""If that kind of thing happens,"" Buschbacher said, ""I would fully expect industry and probably the federal government to sue to stop that.""

Detroit’s east side grapples with persistent ozone pollution The issue highlights ongoing pollution on the east side of Detroit, where ozone levels have remained essentially unchanged over the last decade.
EGLE spokesperson Josef Greenberg said that ozone pollution is improving in southeast Michigan.
The agency didn’t request exceptional event designations for 2023, Leonard said, although an EGLE ozone trend analysis found wildfire smoke influenced ozone levels for several days in 2023.
Leonard said EGLE had the discretion to decline to seek exceptional event designations and better protect residents from air pollution.","Michigan regulators are failing to meet their own plan to reduce ozone pollution in southeast Michigan, according to the Sierra Club.

The group sent a notice of intent to sue to Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, Energy on May 14, saying the agency is required to address high levels of ozone pollution in Allen Park and on the east side of Detroit.

Ozone is formed by a chemical reaction between substances like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ozone can cause respiratory problems and increase the frequency of asthma attacks.

The Environmental Protection Agency determined a seven-county area in southeast Michigan failed to meet federal air quality standards for ozone in 2018. EGLE successfully lobbied in 2023 to have the area redesignated as meeting ozone standards, using the EPA’s “exceptional event” rule that allowed it to exclude monitoring data from days impacted by wildfire smoke in 2022.

EGLE developed a maintenance plan as part of the redesignation that included a contingency plan for addressing ozone pollution if certain action levels were exceeded. The Sierra Club argues such thresholds were crossed when the East 7 Mile and Allen Park monitors exceeded ozone standards between 2021 and 2023, but EGLE failed to enact the “additional control measures” required by the plan.

“We just want EGLE to finally uphold their promise to protect Detroit residents from dangerous levels of ozone pollution,” said Nick Leonard, executive director of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center representing the Sierra Club.

Detroit’s east side grapples with persistent ozone pollution

The issue highlights ongoing pollution on the east side of Detroit, where ozone levels have remained essentially unchanged over the last decade. This pollution is occurring in a predominantly African American area where many census tracts are in the 98% percentile or above for asthma, according to the state’s MiEJScreen, an environmental justice screening tool that tracks pollution exposure and underlying risk.

“Every step of the way, EGLE has put polluters over people,” Robert Shobe, director of the east side environmental justice group Justice for Beniteau, said in a statement. Shobe called attention to the Stellantis plant that was built behind his house, even though the area was already dealing with high levels of pollution.

EGLE spokesperson Josef Greenberg said that ozone pollution is improving in southeast Michigan.

“We followed appropriate processes in examining available data and remain confident our determinations were made properly and U.S. EPA has agreed with those determinations,” Greenberg said in a statement to Planet Detroit.

The Sierra Club’s notification shows pollution at the East 7 Mile monitor was at or above EPA’s standard for ground level ozone of 70 parts per billion for every year between 2016 and 2024.

Michigan’s environmental regulator is required to respond whenever a single monitor meets or exceeds the “two-year action level” or the ozone design value exceeds the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, or NAAQS, for ozone.

The Sierra Club found ozone levels at both the Allen Park and East 7 Mile monitors met or exceeded the two-year action level based on data from 2022 and 2023. The East 7 Mile monitor exceeded the NAAQS based on 2021-2023 data.

Will Michigan seek to exclude data due to wildfire smoke?

Leonard said EGLE may try to use the exceptional event rule to disregard monitoring data from the summer of 2023, which could allow it to argue ozone standards weren’t exceeded at the East 7 Mile and Allen Park monitors. In 2023, smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed Midwestern cities, leading Detroit to have some of the worst air quality in the world.

The state secured exceptional event designations for the East 7 Mile monitor for two days in 2022, which were accounted for in the Sierra Club’s analysis. The agency didn’t request exceptional event designations for 2023, Leonard said, although an EGLE ozone trend analysis found wildfire smoke influenced ozone levels for several days in 2023.

EGLE did not respond to Planet Detroit’s question about whether the agency would seek exceptional event designations for any days in 2023.

“If Michigan wants to exclude high ozone days due to alleged wildfire smoke impacts, they have to follow that process,” Leonard said, adding it is intended to be a strict process in which states come up with a detailed analysis.

A 2024 EGLE study found it may be a challenge for southeast Michigan to meet national ozone standards going forward, citing the effect of climate change and El Niño weather patterns on ozone.

Leonard said EGLE had the discretion to decline to seek exceptional event designations and better protect residents from air pollution. He argues the agency has instead prioritized “making sure that polluters continue to profit.”

“This is a major blow to the decades-long public health protections delivered under the Clean Air Act,” said Will Barrett, the American Lung Association’s senior director for nationwide clean air advocacy.
The Senate action follows an April 30 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives that shocked environmentalists because 35 Democrats joined Republicans to block California’s electric car mandate.
Sales of electric cars have undergone a bumpy road, taking off in the post-pandemic years, but they did not increase last year.","The U.S. Senate voted today to block California’s landmark mandate phasing out gas-powered cars, dealing a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles.

The decision to revoke a waiver that the Biden administration granted to California could upend the state’s decades-long efforts and authority to clean up its air pollution — the worst in the nation — and reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change.

The move by the Senate — following a vote in the House last month — sets the stage for what is likely to become a high-stakes legal and political battle between California and the Trump administration.

Republicans in the Senate and some Democrats in the House who voted in favor of blocking California’s electric car mandate said it’s costly and impractical, and prevents consumers from making their own choices.

But Democrats in the Senate who voted against it, including California’s Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, said the tactic used by Senate Republicans is illegal and that the state’s mandate is vital to cleaning up polluted air.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has made the adoption of zero-emission cars and trucks a top priority, has denounced the move by Congress, vowing that “zero-emission vehicles are here to stay.”

“The United States Senate has a choice: Cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,” Newsom said in a statement on Tuesday, before the vote.

Under California’s mandate, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.

California officials may now have to rely, at least temporarily, on voluntary efforts to clean up cars and trucks in order to meet federal health standards for smog and soot. For instance, state officials could offer financial incentives or rebates to persuade manufacturers to make electric cars and consumers to buy them. The state, however, faces a $12 billion deficit.

Culminating a late-night, marathon session on Wednesday, the Senate vote highlights the growing political division over electric vehicle and air pollution policy as concerns over cost, charging infrastructure and accessibility prevent many consumers from buying them, even in California, which leads the nation in sales.

For almost 60 years, California’s standards for vehicle emissions have been central to cleaning up its air, particularly in the smoggy Los Angeles basin and San Joaquin Valley. Vehicles are still the largest sources of smog-forming gases and fine particles of soot, which can cause respiratory disorders, heart attacks and other serious and deadly health problems.

Because of its highly polluted air and large population, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards under the 1967 Clean Air Act. But before those standards can take effect, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must grant the state a waiver for each one.

Before today, over the past six decades, the EPA and Congress have never blocked any of California’s dozens of car and truck rules. Eleven other states and Washington, D.C. have already adopted a version of California’s electric car mandate, according to the Air Resources Board.

“This is a major blow to the decades-long public health protections delivered under the Clean Air Act,” said Will Barrett, the American Lung Association’s senior director for nationwide clean air advocacy. “It is more important than ever that California and all other states…continue to cut tailpipe pollution through homegrown, health-protective policies.”

Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, of Wyoming, said Republicans reversed a highly unpopular move by the Biden administration.

“They were losers going out the door and they said ‘we’re coming after you — the American people — with our leftist dreams,’ ” Barrasso said. “This is a whole new meaning in California of fantasy land…America can’t meet these impossible standards, not next year, not in 10 years, and the American people don’t want to meet those standards.”

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, called California’s zero-emission standards for both cars and diesel trucks extreme and a threat to the economy. “I want to be clear, I have no problem with electric vehicles. Consumers should be able to purchase the vehicle of their choice, but I do have a big problem with electric vehicle mandates that replace the will of the consumer and the will of the government,” she said on the Senate floor on Wednesday night.

The Senators mostly voted along party lines. Fifty-one senators voted to rescind the electric car mandate waiver, while 44 voted against it.

“I wonder if any other member of this chamber grew up like I did, where on a pretty regular basis, we would be sent home from grade school because of the intensity and dangers of smog that settled over the San Fernando Valley, the city of Los Angeles,” Padilla said during a Senate session on Tuesday, ahead of the vote.

Schiff said on X Wednesday night that Senate Republicans are “doing the bidding of the oil industry” after Donald Trump promised to help them if they donated $1 billion to his campaign. He said it will mean “Californians and others will be breathing dirtier air, as will others around the country.”

The Senate today also plans to vote on blocking two other California rules approved by Biden’s EPA. One is the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which was enacted in 2020 and requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. The other is a 2020 regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses.

President Donald Trump has long opposed California’s unique authority to set its own limits on emissions from cars and trucks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that aimed to eliminate federal and state electric car regulations and subsidies and restore “consumer choice in vehicles.”

“Trump and his congressional allies have declared war on the environment and this is the first major legislative battle,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.

The Senate action follows an April 30 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives that shocked environmentalists because 35 Democrats joined Republicans to block California’s electric car mandate.

Included were two California House Democrats, both of whom represent districts in the smoggiest part of the state: Rep. Lou Correa of the 46th District in northern Orange County, and newly elected Rep. George Whitesides, from the 27th District in northern Los Angeles County.

“As Americans, we all want to do our part to protect the environment. As a lawmaker, my primary job is to listen to my neighbors and respect their choices to do what is best for their families and their circumstances. That means protecting consumers’ rights to drive whatever vehicle makes sense for them and their pocketbooks,” Correa said in an emailed statement.

California’s mandate has come under fire from auto dealerships and some car manufacturers who once were more in line with the goals of aggressively requiring more sales. Sales of electric cars have undergone a bumpy road, taking off in the post-pandemic years, but they did not increase last year.

About 23% of all new cars sold in California were zero emissions during the first three months of this year, compared to 25% for all of 2024 and 2023, mostly because of a drop in Tesla sales. Californians own 2.2 million zero-emission cars; about 150 models are now sold in the state, 40% more than a year ago, according to the California Energy Commission.

John Bozzella, CEO of an alliance of automakers, in a statement earlier this month welcomed the move by Congress, saying it would “prevent the inevitable jobs and manufacturing fallout from these unachievable regulations.”

The Biden administration’s EPA granted the waivers for California’s electric car mandate and nitrogen oxides truck rule late last year, and for the zero-emission truck rule in March 2023. Under the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA can only legally reject a waiver if it’s “arbitrary or capricious,” unnecessary for addressing air pollution or technologically infeasible due to inadequate lead time.

“Congress voted decades ago to allow California, with the nation’s most smog-choked cities, to adopt stronger vehicle air pollution standards,” Becker, a clean-air advocate, said. “This vote will set a dangerous precedent of overturning state law protecting tens of millions in California and 11 other states that have adopted its strong clean air protections.”

The Senate’s votes are likely to set up a legal challenge from the Newsom administration. Experts say the state could sue claiming improper use of the Congressional Review Act.

That law is meant to allow Congress under a new administration to revoke rules recently enacted by the previous administration. But it applies only to regulations, and experts say the waivers are not regulations so they cannot be revoked by Congress. In addition, the three waivers are already in effect, and the diesel truck one was issued more than two years ago, outside the time limits of the review act.

The U.S. Senate’s Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office said Congress cannot review Clean Air Act waivers. The Senate voted to evade their Parliamentarian’s ruling in a 51-46 party line, procedural decision on Wednesday night.

UCLA law professor Ann Carlson said Congress is violating its longstanding practices. She called the decision “totally norm-busting.”

“We’re just in a completely new territory,” she said. Congress “seems to be willing to use a statute that doesn’t apply, which is highly unusual. We’ve never seen this before.”

Carlson said by using the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers are seeking to move fast — bypassing the courts and a potential filibuster.

During the first Trump administration, California sued to reverse other actions that blocked air pollution regulations for cars.

Combined, the three regulations are designed to eliminate tons of soot and gases from cars and diesel trucks that pollute California’s air by requiring manufacturers to switch to cleaner vehicle technologies.

The stakes are high: The state still has some of the worst air pollution in the country, and failure to meet federal health standards for smog and soot could trigger economic penalties, including the loss of highway funding. People in low-income communities of color are particularly exposed to the unhealthiest air.

California is also considered a leader on climate policy, and zero-emission trucks and cars are critical to meeting its targets to phase out nearly all fossil fuels to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2045, which are mandated by state law.

Congress’ repeal of the rules follows an earlier blow to California’s efforts to clean the air. Days before Trump’s inauguration, the state Air Resources Board abandoned two of its groundbreaking standards because Trump’s EPA was unlikely to grant waivers for them.

One of them would have amped up California’s earlier zero-emission truck rule by ending the sale of new diesel trucks in 2036 and requiring large companies to convert their fleets to electric or hydrogen models by 2042.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/092523-EV-Fast-Charging-Event-LE-CM-05.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 12:24:46.631840

The solar industry keeps warning Congress that the reconciliation budget bill being drafted by the U.S. House of Representatives will be harmful to the industry, to U.S. manufacturing, energy resiliency, and the economy. And the House keeps responding by making the language even more harmful.

Hm. Are they trying to tell us something?

The House reconciliation legislation passed last night, and a “manager’s amendment” issued at the end of the process cut even more from the Inflation Reduction Act tax credit incentives for all sectors. Here’s a brief rundown:

End the residential solar investment tax credit (25D)

End the applicability of residential solar leases for 48E tax credits.

The 48E (ITC) and 45Y (PTC) phaseouts would be removed, and the credits would go away completely for any project not placed in service (PIS) by year end 2028.

There is now a construction start requirement within 60 days of the bill enactment.

Transferability would be eliminated for 45X tax credits for manufacturing upon enactment of the legislation.

Transferability of 48E/45Y would be eliminated two years after enactment.

Solar industry and U.S. impact

New analysis released by the SEIA warns that the budget bill, if enacted, could trigger an immediate decline in solar and storage investments. By 2030, up to $220 billion in investment could be lost. Roughly 80% of all at-risk factories, jobs, and investments in the solar manufacturing sector are in states that voted for Trump. That was before several of the last second changes prior to passage.

According to the ACP’s newly released State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report, more than 800 manufacturing plants are currently contributing to the U.S. renewable energy supply chain, with at least one in every state. Meanwhile, 200 existing manufacturing facilities are actively building primary renewable power components across 38 states to supply the booming demand for new energy in the United States.

With 200 renewable power manufacturing facilities in the pipeline, representing more than $150 billion in investment, the ACP report shows that if all announced facilities become operational by 2030, renewable power manufacturing could support more than 575,000 jobs, generate more than $40 billion in earnings, contribute $86 billion to the GDP, and add $164 billion in output to the economy annually.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA): “If Congress does not change course, this legislation will upend an economic boom in this country that has delivered an historic American manufacturing renaissance, lower electric bills, hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, and tens of billions of dollars of investments primarily to states that voted for President Trump.

“This unworkable legislation is willfully ignorant of the fact that deploying solar and storage is the only way the U.S. power grid can meet the demand of American consumers, businesses, and innovation. If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.

“But that’s not all: Americans’ electric bills will soar. Hundreds of factories will close. Hundreds of billions of dollars in local investments will vanish. Hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs. Families will lose the freedom to control their energy costs. And our electric grid will be destabilized.

“It’s not too late for Congress to get this right. The solar and storage industry is ready to get to work with the U.S. Senate on a more thoughtful and measured approach to unleashing true American energy dominance to create a brighter future for all Americans.”",https://solarbuildermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/congress.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 12:23:36.631851

Moderates backed down after some cuts were nixed, while lawmakers who held out over Salt won an enlarged tax break.
“This bill is a debt bomb ticking,” Massie said as the bill was debated.","Republicans in the House of Representatives won passage on Thursday of a major bill to enact Donald Trump’s tax and spending priorities while adding trillions of dollars to the US debt and potentially prevent millions of Americans from accessing federal safety net benefits.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act was approved in the early morning hours along party lines by the slim Republican majority, with 215 votes in favor and 214 against. Its passage ended weeks of negotiations that drew into question the GOP’s ability to find agreement on Trump’s top legislative priority in a chamber they control by just three seats.

“I give glory to God. I mean, there’s a lot of prayer that brought this together, I’m just going to be very blunt about it. There was a few moments over the last week when it looked like the thing might fall apart,” the House speaker, Mike Johnson, said after the bill’s passage.

Trump cheered the vote and encouraged the Senate to pass the measure quickly. “This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!” he wrote on Truth Social. “Now, it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! There is no time to waste.”

The bill will make good on several of Trump’s campaign promises, including extending tax cuts for individuals and corporations, and sunsetting clean energy incentives enacted under Joe Biden. It also relieves taxes on tips, overtime and car loan interest, offers parents $1,000 if they open “Trump accounts” for their children and expands a deduction for older taxpayers – though only for as long as Trump remains in office.

The bill also pays for construction of a wall along the border with Mexico, and new staff and facilities for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.

To offset its costs, the GOP has approved funding cuts and new work requirements for Medicaid, which provides healthcare for poor and disabled Americans, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap). Analysts fear these changes will bar millions from these benefits.

Even with the cuts, the measure is expected to cost $3.8tn over the next 10 years, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Its passage in the House comes less than a week after credit ratings agency Moody’s stripped the US of its top-notch triple-A rating and warned of its large national debt and federal budget deficit.

House Democratic leaders have decried the bill as a “tax scam” that “is deeply unpopular, which is why Republicans made every effort to advance it during the dead of night”.

“This fight is just beginning, and House Democrats will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure that the GOP Tax Scam is buried deep in the ground, never to rise again,” the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, the whip, Katherine Clark, and the caucus chair, Pete Aguilar, said.

The bill also drew rare condemnation from Barack Obama. “Right now, Republicans in Congress are trying to push through a bill that would put millions of Americans at risk of losing their healthcare. They want to cut federal funding for Medicaid, take away tax credits that help more people afford coverage and raise costs for working-class families,” the former president said. He encouraged people to contact their senators to oppose the measure.

Democratic lawmakers’ options are limited. The party is in the minority in both chambers, and Republicans are following the budget reconciliation procedure to prevent it from facing a filibuster in the Senate.

The biggest obstacle the bill faces are disputes among Republicans themselves. In the days leading up to the vote, Johnson had to reach agreements with lawmakers representing Democratic-led states who demanded a bigger deduction for state and local taxes (Salt). He also had to woo moderates wary of cutting too deeply to safety net programs and rightwing lawmakers demanding more cost savings.

The speaker appears to have bridged those divides, aided by a visit to the Capitol from Trump on Tuesday. Moderates backed down after some cuts were nixed, while lawmakers who held out over Salt won an enlarged tax break. Johnson also managed to corral most fiscal conservatives, with Kentucky’s Thomas Massie and Ohio’s Warren Davidson the sole no votes on the bill, both of whom cited its impact on the deficit.

“This bill is a debt bomb ticking,” Massie said as the bill was debated. “We’re not rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic tonight. We’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg.”

The legislation now heads to the Senate, where Republicans say they would like to have it on Trump’s desk by 4 July, the Independence Day holiday.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/890c1cdc3a387345c81c0e8fa5a85e5f28e6487f/889_0_4491_3595/master/4491.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=07c74a425fbe6a098b4181b9c6a4c984,N,,2025-05-22 14:21:16.501469

DETROIT, May 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Detroit is setting the standard for urban revitalization and sustainable development. Spearheaded by Mayor Mike Duggan's visionary leadership, the City of Detroit has taken another significant step towards combating climate change and empowering its neighborhoods. Lightstar Renewables is proud to collaborate with the City of Detroit on the Phase 2 Solar Neighborhoods initiative, turning long-vacant land into state-of-the-art solar fields and delivering exceptional benefits to the community.

Building on the success of Phase 1, which brought solar fields to three neighborhoods, Phase 2 introduces 61 acres of solar infrastructure in the Houston-Whittier/Hayes and Greenfield Park neighborhoods. Together, these efforts contribute to a total of 165 acres of solar fields across Detroit, generating 31 megawatts of renewable energy—enough to power 127 municipal buildings, including police stations, recreation centers, and transit hubs.

""The Solar Neighborhoods initiative has been very much a community driven process that is taking blighted vacant land and turning it into a productive and attractive new use while providing direct benefit to homeowners,"" said Mayor Mike Duggan. ""Residents of these neighborhoods designed the landscaping for their new solar arrays and homeowner occupants are receiving energy efficiency upgrades to their homes to increase their value and lower their utility costs.""

Direct Benefits for Detroit Communities

The Solar Neighborhoods initiative is more than an energy project; it's a testament to the power of partnerships and community-centered development.

Energy Efficiency Upgrades: Over 106 local homeowners will receive a minimum of $15,000 worth of energy efficiency improvements, reducing energy costs and enhancing the quality of life.

Community-Driven Design: Residents played an instrumental role in shaping the landscaping design of solar sites, ensuring these projects reflect their vision. Ornamental trees, perennial gardens, and flowering meadows will bring new life to previously neglected open spaces.

Support for Urban Agriculture: Through innovative agrivoltaic solutions, designated solar sites will also support local farmers, enabling them to grow crops sustainably with less water use and frost protection.

""This initiative goes far beyond renewable energy,"" said Owen Deitcher of Lightstar Renewables. ""It's a holistic vision for sustainable urban development that combines energy innovation, community empowerment, and environmental stewardship. At Lightstar, we couldn't be more honored to partner with the City of Detroit and our incredibly engaged neighborhood partners to make this vision a reality.""

A National Model for Innovation and Collaboration

The bold roadmap set by Mayor Duggan's administration showcases what's possible when municipalities and private sector leaders join forces. The commitment from the Mayor's Office, the Department of Public Works, Planning and Development, and the Office of Sustainability underscores how collaboration drives lasting impact.

Victoria Hicks, a Greenfield Park resident, shared her excitement about this transformation, saying, ""The Solar Neighborhoods program has turned blighted land into something truly beautiful and beneficial, while also improving the lives of residents. This is the progress we've been waiting for.""

The initiative also highlights Lightstar's leadership in solar development, merging cutting-edge technology with community-focused solutions. From agrivoltaic designs to providing stipends and training for local farmers, Detroit's Solar Neighborhoods serve as a national model for integrating renewable energy into urban revitalization.

Together for a Cleaner, Stronger Future

This achievement is only the beginning. With Phase 2 Solar Neighborhoods underway, Detroit is proving that renewable energy can go hand-in-hand with neighborhood empowerment and economic growth. Lightstar remains committed to supporting Detroit's green energy future, ensuring that every project brings tangible benefits to the people, environment, and economy.

Can it last?,Kristian Moravec,,,,,https://themainemonitor.org/heat-pump-workforce-development/,"The sputtered drone of a vacuum pump filled the former milking barn that now houses Kennebec Valley Community College’s heat pump lab.
Without a strong pipeline, the state risks delays in reaching its heat pump target, putting its climate goals at risk.
As part of this push, the community college launched a high-tech heat pump training lab in 2021 and has trained over 300 students.

Libby, of Royal River Heat Pumps, has 40 years of HVAC industry experience and said funding uncertainty will make it a challenge to reach the state’s heat pump goal.","The sputtered drone of a vacuum pump filled the former milking barn that now houses Kennebec Valley Community College’s heat pump lab. Instructor Dave Whittemore, who held the yellow vacuum in one hand and displayed an app tracking atmospheric pressure on his phone in the other, explained in a raised voice how to do an “evacuation,” ridding the heat pump of air and moisture to avoid malfunctions down the road.

“The longevity of the equipment is important,” said Whittemore, who teaches students how to install the increasingly popular electric heating and cooling units. “If it’s not done right, then it’s going to fail prematurely. And that’s the biggest reason that I personally try to keep up with industry best standards and I pass that on to my students.”

Six years ago, Gov. Janet Mills traveled to the college to sign a bill aimed at transforming Maine’s market for heat pumps, an environmentally friendly alternative to oil furnaces and gas boilers, and set a goal of installing 100,000 units by 2025.

The state, now a national leader for heat pump adoption, met that goal two years ahead of schedule, and Mills once again traveled to the rural Somerset County campus to announce a new target: another 175,000 heat pumps by 2027.

Maine needs skilled workers to reach this goal, demanding training initiatives from all corners of the state to build HVAC, refrigerant and electrical knowledge in the clean energy workforce. Without a strong pipeline, the state risks delays in reaching its heat pump target, putting its climate goals at risk.

So far, rural counties have seen some of the fastest rates of clean energy worker growth, according to state data. In Somerset County, where KVCC is located, the number of clean energy workers has grown by 44% since 2020.

As part of this push, the community college launched a high-tech heat pump training lab in 2021 and has trained over 300 students. The initiative is one of many clean energy programs the school offers as part of a broader, state-supported effort to meet Maine’s goal of reaching 30,000 clean energy jobs by 2030.

Efficiency Maine, a quasi-governmental agency that oversees the state’s energy efficiency programs, has invested more than $400,000 in installation and weatherization training programs at KVCC and supports 29 similar programs at other institutions each year.

Another key piece of state support comes through the Governor’s Energy Office’s Clean Energy Partnership, which has awarded nearly $5 million in grants for clean energy training and apprenticeship programs across the state since 2022 and has seen over 3,500 participants. Businesses have also developed their own on-the-job training programs to help meet demand.

But the state still faces a daunting challenge: It must employ more than 14,000 new workers to reach its goal of 30,000 clean energy jobs by the end of the decade. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of workers in the field grew by less than a thousand.

While the state says it remains dedicated to this goal, some in the industry worry federal funding cuts and tariffs could create challenges for the workforce development pipeline.

Efforts underway in many corners of Maine

Heat pumps have emerged as a pillar of Maine’s clean energy strategy: The units can reduce carbon dioxide emissions between 38% and 53% compared to a gas furnace, according to a 2022 study in the academic journal Energy Policy, and have been touted as a way to reduce energy costs.

Rural areas have historically spent more on energy bills and participated less in residential energy and efficiency financing and rebate programs to lower costs, according to a state report from 2023. To help rural Mainers overcome geographic barriers in accessing cost-lowering energy initiatives, the state must bolster its rural workforce, according to a 2018 study the Island Institute produced in partnership with the Governor’s Energy Office.

The demand for cleaner energy has grown not only in response to the state’s climate goals, but also as Maine’s electricity costs rise. A Maine Monitor analysis showed that electricity costs increased at the third-highest rate in the U.S. between 2014 and 2024.

A Maine Monitor analysis of 2023 U.S. Department of Energy and Bureau of Labor Statistics data prepared for E2 shows that two-thirds of the state’s clean energy jobs were in the energy efficiency sector, while about a fifth of jobs were in renewables.

Workforce development has become a priority for the state as the clean energy industry grows, said Tagwongo Obomsawin, the program manager for the state’s Clean Energy Partnership, noting that it can provide good paying jobs for Mainers and reduce energy costs.

“Employers are definitely a really important part of the picture, but we don’t want to leave out anyone,” Obomsawin said. “We recognize that training providers, academia, state government, organized labor and industry all have a role to play in making sure that we have a robust system that supports people in finding job opportunities, getting access to training and localizing the benefits of the energy transition.”

Heat pump training is just one of several clean energy programs offered through the Maine Community College System, which includes KVCC. The system works with industry and state leaders to grow the workforce. The network of schools also trains students in electric vehicle maintenance, fiber optics, aquaculture and more.

Dan Belyea, the system’s chief workforce development officer, said short-term training and scholarship funding are centered on needs that arise in the industry, which the schools gauge by looking at labor market data and talking to employers. Programs that are highest in demand tend to include electrical and heat pump training, Belyea said.

In 2022, KVCC hoped to use a nearly $250,000 grant from the Clean Energy Partnership to offer programs on electric vehicles and NABCEP solar photovoltaic installation. But trouble finding instructors and low interest among students made it difficult to launch.

Instead, KVCC doubled down on energy efficiency. It launched a building science program with the funding last fall, which had five students, two of whom were able to complete the certification.

Other clean energy workforce initiatives have popped up across the state. Some employers run their own heat pump or solar installation training labs, and several adult education programs and nonprofits also offer classes designed to help people move into the industry.

PassivHaus, a Freeport-based organization, received $180,000 in Clean Energy Partnership money in 2022 to host training programs on the state’s energy code. The company ran 29 trainings across the state, from Portland to Presque Isle.

Naomi Beal, executive director of PassivHaus, noted that getting enough students to attend the training was easier in areas like Portland, but trickier in more rural areas.

“I always feel like it’s very important to consider when going into Greenfield or Machiasport or wherever that there are just not that many people.… So if we get five people showing up, that’s probably statistically way more interest than (a larger number of attendees) down in Portland,” Beal said. “We just try to be patient and persistent with the smaller towns and the smaller attendance.”

A need for more collaboration

In Freeport, Scott Libby, the owner of Royal River Heat Pumps, walked through his training center as he explained that all his workers go through heat pump training that starts with the basics, regardless of experience, to ensure each worker is equipped to handle the job.

“A lot of these heat pumps have 12-year warranties,” Libby said. “That’s 4,380 days. The most important day is Day 1. It needs to be installed properly.”

Libby, who has worked with the U.S. Department of Energy on workforce development and sits on a new energy efficiency workforce subcommittee being developed by the Governor’s Energy Office, said he’s aware of a number of different workforce development initiatives but that it’s difficult to comprehend how they all work together.

He said some forms of programming aren’t sufficient for what’s actually needed in the field: Students who sit through a six-week or six-month program that teaches the basics of how heat pumps work may come out with little to no hands-on experience with a power tool or climbing a ladder.

Libby emphasized the need for more collaboration between different workforce development efforts and a more systematic approach, with quality checks in place. He suggested putting more thought into designing industrial arts and home economics programs in middle and high schools to introduce students to different career pathways early on.

He also said more stringent licensing requirements could help with the quality of workers moving into the field. As it stands, there is no specific licensing required to install heat pumps in Maine, though workers need an Environmental Protection Agency Section 608 license to deal with the refrigerant used inside the unit and an electrical license to complete the wiring.

He acknowledged that new regulation could “cripple” workforce development efforts but said the move is imperative to control the level of training workers receive and make sure everyone is qualified to install heat pumps. There are hundreds of contractors listed as qualified heat pump installers on Efficiency Maine’s website, a list he said in his opinion should be much shorter.

Uncertainties lie ahead

At KVCC’s heat pump lab, Whittemore gestured at eight heat pumps mounted on prop walls used for training, listing the types of new units he hopes to get soon – ideally through donations from companies who have given units in the past.

Regulatory changes to refrigerants that went into effect this year mean the school needs to replace the heat pumps it uses to train students.

“Most of the procedures with the new refrigerants are the same, it’s just that we can’t put this new refrigerant in these existing heat pumps,” he said. “So I’ve got to get eight new heat pumps.”

The broader challenge he sees for the industry is tariffs, which he fears could lead to higher equipment prices and lower demand. This, in turn, could mean a lower need for workers.

“I think that’s going to slow this down,” he said.

Maine has two years to reach its goal of installing 275,000 heat pumps and five years to reach its goal of 30,000 clean energy jobs. But uncertainties in building Maine’s workforce lie ahead.

The Clean Energy Partnership Project, which has funded many of the state’s clean energy workforce development programs, typically announces new grants in the summer, but the Governor’s Energy Office stopped short of committing to another round of funding this year.

“We can’t predict the future, but the existing programs that we have will continue on for at least another couple of years,” Obomsawin said.

She said a partnership the Energy Office has with the Department of Labor to provide career navigation services will continue into 2026, as will workforce development programs that received funding and are already operational. But she cautioned that it is still too early to know what impact policy changes at the federal level will have on the clean energy sector.

Efficiency Maine said that the state is still on track to achieve its heat pump goals – at least for now. Executive Director Michael Stoddard said that the heat pump rebate program has funding from the Electric Utility Conservation Program and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for at least the next three years.

However, some smaller initiatives, such as a revolving loan to help Mainers buy new heat pump systems, face uncertainty as the federal grants funding the project are in flux.

Libby, of Royal River Heat Pumps, has 40 years of HVAC industry experience and said funding uncertainty will make it a challenge to reach the state’s heat pump goal.

“I think it’s definitely going to be harder,” Libby said. “I mean, I’m not ready to give up on it yet. I don’t think anybody is ready to give up on it.”",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/heat-pump-evacuation-demonstration.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 12:23:43.612173

The sweeping package included a series of last-minute changes to appease factions of GOP holdouts whose votes are essential in the slim House majority.
Trump helped Johnson and GOP leaders close the deal, joining a House Republican conference meeting at the Capitol on Tuesday.
When Harris and other conservatives dug in further Wednesday, Trump called the group's leaders and GOP leaders down to the White House to get them on board.","WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday morning narrowly passed a massive domestic policy package, a major victory for President Donald Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., after weeks of heated intraparty negotiations and some last-minute changes.

The multitrillion-dollar tax cut and spending measure now heads to the Senate, where Republicans have vowed to change it.

Following hours of overnight debate, the vote on final passage in the House was 215-214, with two Republicans — Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio — joining all Democrats present in opposition.

Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the leader of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, voted present. Reps. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., and David Schweikert, R-Ariz., accidentally missed the vote, but said they would have voted yes.

Garbarino ""fell asleep in the back, no kidding. I’m going to just strangle him,"" Johnson joked to reporters, adding that Schweikert tried to vote but missed it by seconds.

Dubbed by Trump as the ""big, beautiful bill,"" the legislation extends the president's expiring tax cuts passed in 2017 and contains an infusion of money to expand the military, beef up border security and carry out his mass deportation plans. It also fulfills two of Trump's campaign promises: eliminating taxes on tips and overtime work.

The bill also slashes spending in other areas, including hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), while rescinding a series of clean energy tax credits passed by Democrats in 2022. And it raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

Taking a victory lap after the vote, Johnson told reporters that the massive package had been on the verge of collapse at times.

""There’s a lot of prayer that brought this together. I’m just going to be very blunt about it. There was a few moments over the last week when it looked like the thing might fall apart,"" Johnson said, flanked by his GOP leadership team and committee chairmen. ""And I went to the little chapel over here and got on my knees and prayed that these guys would have wisdom and stamina and discernment.""

""And that’s the secret here. And teamwork and mutual respect that everybody has for one another, and I think that’s what defines the Republican Party,"" he continued. ""It’s a great day to be an American. It’s great to be a Republican.""

But Johnson acknowledged there is still a long way to go in the process. The speaker had lunch with Senate Republicans this week and said he's encouraged them “to modify this as little as possible."" Any changes the Senate makes would have to be approved by the House.

Congressional GOP leaders have said they want to send the final bill to Trump's desk for his signature by July 4.

The vote came after Republicans and Democrats sparred over the legislation during a marathon House Rules Committee hearing that began just after 1 a.m. ET Wednesday and wrapped 21 hours later, when the panel sent the bill to the floor.

The sweeping package included a series of last-minute changes to appease factions of GOP holdouts whose votes are essential in the slim House majority. Republicans can only spare three GOP defections on any vote in the face of unified Democratic opposition.

Conservative hard-liners secured changes in the form of speeding up the Medicaid work requirements to begin at the end of 2026, and phasing out the clean energy tax credits more quickly.

A group of blue-state Republicans secured a larger state and local deduction (SALT) cap of $40,000 to bring home to their high-tax districts.

The measure was projected Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to increase the national debt by $2.3 trillion. The budget office said it would rescind health care coverage for 8.6 million people.

Overall, the package is set to decrease household resources among the lowest decile of income earners by 4%, while increase household resources among the highest decile of income earners by 2% by 2033.

It is unclear what impact the late changes will have on the final estimate.

Trump helped Johnson and GOP leaders close the deal, joining a House Republican conference meeting at the Capitol on Tuesday. The president told holdouts in the room that it was now time to drop their demands and unify behind his ""big, beautiful bill.""

When Harris and other conservatives dug in further Wednesday, Trump called the group's leaders and GOP leaders down to the White House to get them on board.

Both Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., returned from the meeting vowing to charge ahead with a vote, even without public assurances from the Freedom Caucus. The leaders were desperate to move quickly because they feared there could be GOP absences later in the week.

Ultimately, some of the anti-spending hawks who were skeptical of the bill, including Reps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Ralph Norman, R-S.C., voted for the bill.

“Am I happy with the deficits? No,"" Norman told reporters after the vote. ""We held it out as long as we could to get the cuts, as long as we could. We couldn’t do it. We live to fight another day.”

Democrats repeatedly blasted Republicans for debating and passing the bill “under the cover of darkness,” and warned that the deep spending cuts would boot millions of Americans off the Medicaid rolls.

“Here’s what it will mean for the American people,” Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D.N-Y., said in a speech before the vote. “Children will get hurt. Women will get hurt. Older Americans who rely on Medicaid for nursing home care and for home care will get hurt. People with disabilities who rely on Medicaid to survive, will get hurt. Hospitals in your districts will close. Nursing homes will shut down. And people will die.”

And Jeffries warned Republicans that voters would punish them in the 2026 midterm elections for supporting this bill.

“When the votes are ultimately cast on that first Tuesday in November next year,"" Jeffries said, ""this day may very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250521-Trump-and-Johnson-RS-d09f0c.jpg",N,,2025-05-22 12:26:27.988702

About Lightstar Renewables Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Boston, Lightstar Renewables is a trailblazer in the development of community solar solutions.","Mayor Duggan's Vision Transforms Vacant Land into Renewable Energy with Community Benefits

DETROIT, May 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Detroit is setting the standard for urban revitalization and sustainable development. Spearheaded by Mayor Mike Duggan's visionary leadership, the City of Detroit has taken another significant step towards combating climate change and empowering its neighborhoods. Lightstar Renewables is proud to collaborate with the City of Detroit on the Phase 2 Solar Neighborhoods initiative, turning long-vacant land into state-of-the-art solar fields and delivering exceptional benefits to the community.

Lightstar leads solar innovation, uniting tech & community, setting the standard for urban renewable energy solutions.

Building on the success of Phase 1, which brought solar fields to three neighborhoods, Phase 2 introduces 61 acres of solar infrastructure in the Houston-Whittier/Hayes and Greenfield Park neighborhoods. Together, these efforts contribute to a total of 165 acres of solar fields across Detroit, generating 31 megawatts of renewable energy—enough to power 127 municipal buildings, including police stations, recreation centers, and transit hubs.

""The Solar Neighborhoods initiative has been very much a community driven process that is taking blighted vacant land and turning it into a productive and attractive new use while providing direct benefit to homeowners,"" said Mayor Mike Duggan. ""Residents of these neighborhoods designed the landscaping for their new solar arrays and homeowner occupants are receiving energy efficiency upgrades to their homes to increase their value and lower their utility costs.""

Direct Benefits for Detroit Communities

The Solar Neighborhoods initiative is more than an energy project; it's a testament to the power of partnerships and community-centered development.

Energy Efficiency Upgrades: Over 106 local homeowners will receive a minimum of $15,000 worth of energy efficiency improvements, reducing energy costs and enhancing the quality of life.

Community-Driven Design: Residents played an instrumental role in shaping the landscaping design of solar sites, ensuring these projects reflect their vision. Ornamental trees, perennial gardens, and flowering meadows will bring new life to previously neglected open spaces.

Support for Urban Agriculture: Through innovative agrivoltaic solutions, designated solar sites will also support local farmers, enabling them to grow crops sustainably with less water use and frost protection.

""This initiative goes far beyond renewable energy,"" said Owen Deitcher of Lightstar Renewables. ""It's a holistic vision for sustainable urban development that combines energy innovation, community empowerment, and environmental stewardship. At Lightstar, we couldn't be more honored to partner with the City of Detroit and our incredibly engaged neighborhood partners to make this vision a reality.""

A National Model for Innovation and Collaboration

The bold roadmap set by Mayor Duggan's administration showcases what's possible when municipalities and private sector leaders join forces. The commitment from the Mayor's Office, the Department of Public Works, Planning and Development, and the Office of Sustainability underscores how collaboration drives lasting impact.

Victoria Hicks, a Greenfield Park resident, shared her excitement about this transformation, saying, ""The Solar Neighborhoods program has turned blighted land into something truly beautiful and beneficial, while also improving the lives of residents. This is the progress we've been waiting for.""

The initiative also highlights Lightstar's leadership in solar development, merging cutting-edge technology with community-focused solutions. From agrivoltaic designs to providing stipends and training for local farmers, Detroit's Solar Neighborhoods serve as a national model for integrating renewable energy into urban revitalization.

Together for a Cleaner, Stronger Future

This achievement is only the beginning. With Phase 2 Solar Neighborhoods underway, Detroit is proving that renewable energy can go hand-in-hand with neighborhood empowerment and economic growth.

In early 2024, HiPhi showed its EV models weren’t just about robotic arms and futuristic designs, but could actually perform.
EV Electra Ltd. owns 69.8% of the brand, while Human Horizons maintains the remaining 30.2%.
Per its website, EV Electra currently offers four very different models, which are built in Italy, specifically for Lebanon, I believe?
Hopefully, HiPhi has found a savior in EV Electra in a deal that works out for both parties.","Remember HiPhi, the ultra-futuristic EV brand led by Human Horizons? It’s been over a year since the company went on a six-month hiatus after failing to find additional funding, but it has reportedly found a savior in a Lebanese investor called EV Electra. EV Electra is taking over a majority stake and plans to resume vehicle development and production in China immediately.

HiPhi was a radical EV marque founded by Chinese startup Human Horizons over five years ago. The startup wowed us early on with a production-ready version of its flagship model, the HiPhi Z GT, complete with automatic suicide doors and a robotic touchscreen that moves independently.

The Z was joined by two robot-centric EV models, the HiPhi X “Super SUV” and the HiPhi Y “LuxTech SUV,” The Z and X EVs were actually certified for sale in Europe while Human Horizons teased a fourth model – a carbon fiber hypercar called the HiPhi A.

In early 2024, HiPhi showed its EV models weren’t just about robotic arms and futuristic designs, but could actually perform. The HiPhi Z shone during a winter range test in total distance traveled on a single charge and had the lowest range loss compared to what its makers advertised.

Shortly thereafter, however, things went dark. During Chinese New Year, HiPhi announced a six-month shutdown while it searched for more funding. Human Horizons would fail in its search, resulting in the layoffs of most of its staff. That was over a year ago, but the lights at HiPhi’s Chinese manufacturing facility look like they’re about to be turned back on by a foreign financial backer with a cloudy history of its own.

EV Electra already has HiPhi models on its website

As reported by local Chinese media outlet 21jingi, multiple independent sources have stated that HiPhi has received an investment of $100 million from EV Electra, a Lebanese company founded in 2017 by Jihad Mohammad, claiming on its official website to be “the first electric car manufacturer in Lebanon and the Arab world.”

The reports appear accurate, as HiPhi’s three production models now appear on EV Electra’s website (pictured above). According to independent sources, EV Electra intends to help HiPhi maintain its previous production capacity of 150,000 units per year at its facility in Yancheng, Jiangsu province, China.

Furthermore, that facility has reportedly already begun the necessary environmental assessment to resume EV production. Former HiPhi employees who did not sign a voluntary resignation agreement are reportedly being invited back to the company, but they are expected to see a 20% pay cut.

As of May 2022, Jihad Mohammad is the legal representative for HiPhi. EV Electra Ltd. owns 69.8% of the brand, while Human Horizons maintains the remaining 30.2%.

EV Electra’s website is quite confusing as it states it has a presence in Canada, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and China, yet its locations page lists footprints in Montreal, Lebanon, and Sweden. In 2023, Swedish media accused EV Electra of passing images of other OEMs’ vehicles off as its own, including the Skywell ET5, the K-1 Attack Rise, and SP:01 from Detroit Electric.

Per its website, EV Electra currently offers four very different models, which are built in Italy, specifically for Lebanon, I believe? This company is unique and confusing, to say the least. Hopefully, HiPhi has found a savior in EV Electra in a deal that works out for both parties. I’m not optimistic at this point.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/HiPhi-Z-GT-Hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-22 12:26:13.024030

In this morning's edition, European buyers are picking BYD over Tesla, and the UAW says Stellantis' proposed Detroit hub will cut jobs. Plus, Mercedes is moving jobs from Detroit to Atlanta, and Japanese automakers want a trade deal stat.

Tesla has long been the best-seller in Europe, with the Model Y seemingly sitting as the default new car to purchase on the continent. Now, it's losing that title, and BYD is all too eager to step in and outsell Tesla — even discounting the Chinese brand's hybrids, its EVs alone outsold Tesla in Europe. From Reuters:

Chinese automaker BYD sold more electric vehicles in Europe than Tesla for the first time, according to a report by JATO Dynamics, as an aging model lineup and CEO Elon Musk's politics hurt demand for the U.S. EV maker's cars.

BYD, which also makes plug-in hybrid vehicles, registered 7,231 battery-powered electric vehicles (BEV) in Europe in April, while Tesla registered 7,165 units, the market research firm said.

""This is a watershed moment for Europe's car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022,"" JATO Dynamics' global analyst Felipe Munoz said.

Turns out, Europeans aren't big on buying cheaply built, uncomfortable cars that haven't been visually updated in years. Elon Musk's personal toxic brand has also hurt his various companies across the board at home and abroad, with studies and sales numbers showing his extreme political antics are incredibly unpopular with the very people he needs to buy cars to keep his empire afloat.

Stellantis has big plans for a new parts distribution center outside Detroit, where the company will invest nearly $400 million in centralizing operations from its other locations. There's just one problem: The United Auto Workers, who claim that the new, automated hub will cut hundreds of union jobs — putting Stellantis below the minimum numbers required by the union contract. From Automotive News:

Stellantis confirmed its intention to consolidate Mopar operations with a new $388 million ""mega hub"" 27 miles west of Detroit, but the UAW says the move would eliminate 210 jobs.

The company said in a news release on May 21 that the highly automated facility in Van Buren Township, Mich., will launch in 2027 and support 488 UAW-represented jobs, confirming a report this month by Automotive News affiliate Crain's Detroit Business.

...

Kevin Gotinsky, the UAW's Stellantis department director, said the company is below the Mopar employment levels obligated under the 2023 collective bargaining contract. The mega hub in Southeast Michigan would consolidate four locations employing 698 people.

""If these numbers remain unchanged, we will lose an additional 210 jobs,"" Gotinsky told Crain's Detroit. ""So yes, we have major concerns at this time.""

It's a reminder — if you've ever been left with too much work and too few people to do it — that unions can push back against understaffing.

Mercedes-Benz has a big new investment in Georgia. The company will have a flashy new R&D hub in or near Atlanta, which the company claims will staff about 500 people. The small print, though, is that these won't really be new jobs — they're just shifting from other parts of the country. From the Detroit Free Press:

Mercedes-Benz is moving some 500 corporate and technical jobs from various locations across the nation — including 400 from Michigan — to the Atlanta area over the next 18 months to establish the Georgia region as its North America headquarters.

The automaker, which is based in Stuttgart, Germany, made the announcement on May 22, adding that it will also make ""a multimillion dollar"" investment in a new state-of-the-art research and development hub in the Atlanta area.

As a result of these moves, Mercedes-Benz is shuttering its Financial Services headquarters in Farmington Hills. A corporate real estate team will find a new tenant for that building, Melinda Mernovage, a Mercedes-Benz Financial Services spokeswoman, told the Detroit Free Press.

In this era of trade wars waged by ego, watch for announcements like this. A company, taking an outsized hit from tariffs, announces a big new investment in the U.S. — that, secretly, isn't actually employing many more Americans. It's a smart, shrewd move from Mercedes.

Countries are making trade deals with the U.S. that allow their products to skip the whole tariff rigamarole, and carmakers are grateful for the relief. One major automaking nation, though, doesn't yet have a deal: Japan. Carmakers from the country aren't exactly enthused about this, and they're doing their best to push for a deal sooner rather than later. From Automotive News:

Japan's automotive industry is banking on a diplomatic breakthrough to lift U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and auto components from the home market and is petitioning the Tokyo government to consider emergency stimulus measures for the Japanese economy.

Following a U.S. deal with the U.K. and a temporary abatement with China, Japan's auto industry lobby said it will continue to push the government in Tokyo for similar relief.

Japan is one of the biggest automaking countries, and Japanese vehicles are some of the most common in the States. It's in their best interests to get a deal together, though it's anyone's guess as to what Japan will have to give up to make such a deal happen.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/tesla-loses-to-byd-in-europe/l-intro-1747924156.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 12:26:16.019002

They were lowered in the 2017 tax bill, regarded as a signature achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term.
Californians would particularly benefit from the lifting of the state and local tax deduction, or SALT.","The winners from the tax and budget bill the House passed Thursday morning: Californians’ federal income tax rates and their state and local deduction.

The losers: Consumers who buy electric vehicles and people who rely on Medi-Cal for health coverage.

That’s a quick snapshot of who will benefit and who won’t from what President Donald Trump labeled the “Big, Beautiful” bill that squeezed through a bitterly divided House after an all-night session by a 215-214 vote. All 43 of California’s Democrats opposed the measure, while all nine Republicans were for it.

GOP members from California and other higher-tax states were particularly pleased that the $10,000 limit on state and local tax deductions was raised to $40,000 for qualifying taxpayers.

They liked how current income tax rates would remain intact, the standard deduction would continue to go up, seniors who see an even bigger deduction and qualifying parents could get a bigger tax credit for children.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo. said that without the bill, the average family faced a $1,700 tax increase next year. The bill, he said, “fulfills President Trump’s mandate to end insane woke ideology, replaces bad tax policy with good tax policy, and delivers for families.”

Rep. Young Kim, R-Anaheim, praised the increase to the state and local tax deduction. She called it “a huge win that allows middle-class families I represent to keep more hard-earned money in their pockets.”

Democrats protest

Democrats warned that the bill was largely a giveaway to the wealthy, a blueprint for hurting society’s already vulnerable people.

Tough new work requirements for Medicaid, as well as other restrictions, would make it more difficult for people to get help from the program, which now is used by 15 million Californians. And tax credits for clean energy items, such as electric vehicles and efficient household products, would end or be diluted.

“Bottom line: this bill is an all-out assault on American families,” said Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Sacramento.

“It’s almost cartoonishly corrupt, until you remember that this is exactly how they want government to work: captured by billionaires and weaponized against the public it’s supposed to serve,” said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-San Rafael.

It’s widely expected that much of this will change as the Senate considers the legislation next month. Lifting the state and local tax deduction is not popular in the Senate, nor are the cuts to Medicaid.

What’s most likely to survive are the tax rates.

They were lowered in the 2017 tax bill, regarded as a signature achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term. The bill also boosted the standard deduction and limited itemized deductions.

Most of those changes expire at the end of this year, but there has been virtually no dissent among Republicans, who control the House and Senate, about keeping them intact.

One of the looming flash points is the cost of the bill. The tax breaks could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years, according to independent estimates.

“Republicans talk about fiscal responsibility, but their actions tell a different story. Trump’s so-called ‘big, beautiful’ budget would add $4 trillion to the deficit by 2034. While my constituents were sleeping, Republicans jammed their partisan bill in the middle of the night, because they know their policies are wildly unpopular,” said Rep. Jim Costa, D-Fresno..

Tax rates and the wealthy

For Californians and the rest of the country, the bill generally means the more one earns, the more they get a tax break.

About 80% of all households would receive a tax cut next year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

But, it found, more than one-third of the savings would go to households with after-tax incomes of more than $460,000.

Those earning less than $35,000 would see a tax cut of about 1%, or about $160, the center said. Those with incomes between $460,000 and $1.1 million would see a cut of 4.3% to their after-tax income, or about $21,000.

Californians would particularly benefit from the lifting of the state and local tax deduction, or SALT. The deduction was capped at $10,000 per taxpayers in the 2017 bill, a change that had a big effect on higher-tax California.

In Sacramento County, for instance, about one-third of taxpayers deducted an average of $12,000 for the state and local taxes they paid before the change. After the cap was imposed, the percentage who got the break plunged to 13% in 2022.

Just how much Medi-Cal will be impacted is unclear. Much of the savings in Medicaid, the federal-state health care program called Medi-Cal in California, would come from tighter work requirements.

The new law was scheduled to take effect in 2029, but that was moved up two years after a group of staunch conservatives objected to the delay.

KFF, the nonpartisan health research firm, estimated that the House bill’s policies are likely to increase the number of uninsured people in California by 1.4 million, or about 3%.

It noted, though, that it could wind up as low as 1 million or as high as 1.7 million. California would be one of 10 states with that much of an increase.

And in 2021, EV Electra announced an investment of over 500 million US dollars in the acquisition of a majority stake in Detroit Electric.","According to Chinese media reports, HiPhi has changed its majority owner and has begun preparations for a resumption of work. Only 30.2 per cent of the brand is currently owned by its previous owner, Human Horizons. According to Chinese media, the remaining 69.8 per cent has been taken over by the Lebanese company EV Electra Ltd.

HiPhi’s production lines have been at a standstill for over a year. The brand initially caused a stir with very extravagant electric cars and later presented a Model Y competitor in the form of the HiPhi Y – the X and Z models were already available to order in Norway and Germany. However, HiPhi had to cease production in February 2024, when there was talk of a six-month break. Later, there were signs of hope in the form of alleged interest from Changan and a Hong Kong-based organisation. However, a deal was apparently never finalised, and the break became longer and longer. In August 2024, rumours also emerged that parent company Human Horizons was on the verge of insolvency.

Now things are apparently moving forward thanks to EV Electra’s investment. As reported by CN EV Post, among others, citing a local medium called 21jingji, a new company called Jiangsu HiPhi Co Ltd was founded as part of the investment commitment from Lebanon and provided with the equivalent of around 143 million dollars in capital. Production of the original models is now to be ramped up again at the existing HiPhi factory in Yancheng in the Chinese province of Jiangsu. To this end, the company is recalling former employees, according to rumours.

If the rumour is confirmed, the acquisition of HiPhi would be another purchase in the eMobility business for EV Electra. At the end of 2023, the company bought the rights to the Emily GT project from Saab successor company NEVS, a sporty electric saloon with four 90 kW wheel motors and a 175 kWh battery with a range of more than 1,000 kilometres.

Electric vehicles are holding their own when it comes to consumer demand - this, despite market uncertainty, according the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study. It found despite the uncertainty around future EV interest and potential economic headwinds hanging over the automotive industry, consumer demand for EVs has remained stable. The study reveals that 24% of vehicle shoppers say they are “very likely” to consider purchasing an EV and 35% say they are “somewhat likely,” both of which remain unchanged from a year ago.

“Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration,” said Brent Gruber, executive director of the EV practice at J.D. Power. “To further capitalize on that interest and spur adoption moving forward, the industry needs to have products that meet consumer needs and wants at prices that are affordable. Additionally, the industry should better educate consumers about EV ownership to ease concerns—many of which, such as those related to public charging, are less problematic than they might seem when it comes to actually owning an EV.”

J.D. Power highlights these key findings:

EV customers active in cross-shopping: EV shoppers who say they are “very likely” to consider an EV cross-shop an average of 2.9 brands, while those who say they are “somewhat likely” shop an average of 2.8 brands. This is in alignment with the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Sales Satisfaction Index Study,which found EV buyers shopped 3.0 different dealer brands compared to 2.5 for gas-powered vehicle shoppers. “As more EV options come to market, this should serve as an encouraging sign for automakers because it’s an opportunity for them to gain a foothold and pull shoppers from outside their brands. This year’s study results also show that EV shoppers consider products from mass market and premium brands alike, highlighting the opportunity to capture consumer interest with brands or products that shoppers may not have otherwise considered,” Gruber said.

Purchase price and cost of ownership concerns decline, while charging concerns persist: Researchers say charging station availability remains the top concern, with 52% of shoppers citing it as a reason for rejecting EVs. J.D. Power says the continuing concern with charging, coupled with flattening overall EV interest, points to a lack of progress in consumer education on these issues. However, while consumer rejection due to purchase price has dropped 4 percentage points year over year to 43%, concern with cost of ownership has dropped 2 percentage points to 33%.

Young and higher-income shoppers show most interest but rarely overlap: Only 17% of consumers who are in the 25-49 age range have an annual income of over $100,000. “It’s an interesting dichotomy because younger consumers are the most receptive to EVs, but also the least likely to be able to afford them, while older consumers have the financial means but show less interest,” Gruber said. “Much of the recent growth in the EV space has been fueled by products from mass market brands, which demonstrates the pent-up demand for more affordable products.”

Midwest states least enthusiastic about EVs: When looking at EV consideration by region, the lowest shares of consumers who say they are “very likely” to consider purchasing an EV live in Wisconsin and Kentucky (18% each), Minnesota (17%) and Ohio (16%). Researchers say this is influenced by several factors, including concerns about EV performance in cold climates and the stronger loyalty of consumers in these regions to traditional automakers.

About the Study

The U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study, now in its fifth year, is an industry benchmark focusing on gauging fully electric or battery electric vehicle shopper consideration. Study content includes overall EV consideration by geography; demographics; vehicle experience and use; lifestyle; and psychographics. It also includes model-level consideration details such as “why buy” findings and analysis of reasons for EV rejection. This year’s study measures responses from 8,164 consumers who intend to buy or lease a new vehicle in the next 12 months and was fielded from January through April 2025.

Here are only a few of the policies Democrats just unanimously opposed:

The largest tax cut in history. This means $13,300 more for American families and wage increases up to $11,000 for workers with a double-digit percent decrease to their tax bills — plus NO TAX ON TIPS, NO TAX ON OVERTIME, a tax cut on seniors’ Social Security benefits, an expanded child tax credit, and a tax deduction on American-made vehicles. Americans making between $30,000 and $80,000 per year will see their taxes cut by 15% next year.

Raising wages. American workers will see wage increases of up to $11,600; a typical family with two kids will see take-home pay rise by up to $13,300.

Strong border security. This makes President Trump’s border crackdown permanent with the largest investment ever — funding AT LEAST one million illegal immigrant deportations per year, thousands of miles of new border wall and barriers, 18,000+ new immigration officials, and pay raises for our great ICE and Border Patrol agents.

Protecting Medicaid for American citizens who need it. This ENDS taxpayer-funded benefits for at least 1.4 million illegal immigrants who are gaming the system and requires able-bodied Americans to work if they receive benefits.

Pay raises for troops. This increases special pay for servicemembers and gives them higher allowances for housing, healthcare, and family assistance.

Ending taxpayer-funded chemical castration and mutilation. It reverses the Biden-era mandate that Medicaid cover so-called “gender transition” procedures.

Modernizing air traffic control. This will allow President Trump to act where the Biden Administration failed by completely overhauling the systems that keep Americans flying safely and efficiently.

Revolutionizing the nation’s defense. This funds President Trump’s Golden Dome missile defense shield, restocks America’s arsenal, expands our naval fleet, and improves military readiness to meet the needs of a changing world.

Protecting family farmers. The bill prevents the greedy death tax from hitting two million family-owned farms that would otherwise see their exemptions cut in half and cuts taxes on farmers by over $10 billion.

Unleashing American energy dominance. The bill increases onshore and offshore oil and gas leases, spurs job growth, makes energy more affordable, and makes America less dependent on foreign adversaries.

Reversing runaway spending. This delivers $1.6 trillion in mandatory savings — the most in U.S. history and the largest deficit reduction in nearly 30 years.",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 13:15:06.869478

This corrupt Republican scheme is an attack on every American who values reducing costs, clean air and water, public health, and a thriving American economy.

These members included Rep. Jared Huffman, Ranking Member of the House Natural Resources Committee; Rep. Paul Tonko, House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) Co-Chair and Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment; Rep. Doris Matsui, SEEC Co-Chair and Ranking Member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology; Rep. Don Beyer, SEEC Vice Chair; Rep.

Teresa Leger Fernández, Ranking Member of the House Rules Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process; and Rep. Mike Thompson, Ranking Member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Tax.

WATCH PRESS CONFERENCE

""Let’s be clear about what’s happening: the billionaire-backed reconciliation bill is the single most extreme, anti-environment piece of legislation Congress has ever seen,” said Congressman Huffman. “And here’s the kicker: the same Republicans who claim to be fiscally responsible — the same ones who wring their hands about deficits when it’s time to fund food assistance or climate resilience — are about to add $3.8 trillion to the national debt according to CBO to bankroll billionaire tax cuts and fossil fuel handouts. The same folks who say they’re putting the conservative back in conservation are destroying national parks, public lands, and sacred Tribal sites just to please the oil lobby. The hypocrisy is staggering — and the American people see right through it.”

“This bill is a lose-lose. It’s bad for people’s wallets, and it’s bad for building a strong, competitive economy,” said Congressman Tonko. “It sells out current and future generations of Americans to fund tax cuts for billionaires and undermine fossil fuels’ biggest competition— clean energy. Americans will pay more down the road through higher energy bills, dirtier air, worsening climate disasters, and rising health care costs.”

“This bill is not reform. It’s legalized bribery,” said Congresswoman Matsui. “The Republicans are auctioning off our public lands to the highest bidder, prioritizing profit over our environment, and sacrificing the health and future of our communities. You’d think that would be enough, but no. In addition, they have chosen to wreck our economy and end billions of dollars in federal investments that were working to ensure that our infrastructure doesn’t collapse. To this I ask my Republican colleagues: is your endgame really permanent and irreversible damage for the sake of temporary tax cuts for the rich?”

""This bill is going to raise energy costs for every American household,” said Congressman Beyer. “It's a bad deal for America. It’s a bad deal for our climate. It’s a bad deal for economic growth. It’s a bad deal for our future government. And it’s a bad deal for all those people that voted for Donald Trump.”

“This massive big bad bill, advanced in the dead of night, is a blueprint to bulldoze many of the natural resources Oregonians treasure and rely on for their livelihoods,” said Congresswoman Bonamici. “Oregonians know what’s at stake - our coast, forests, and future. We will not back down from the fight for our planet and our people.”

“We had the fastest-growing economy in the world just a couple months ago. We had surges of manufacturing in America. We’ve now got people saying, if I build a factory in America am I going to be able to plug into a grid that’s going to have reliable supply? Can I build resources in America and know that the price of energy is going to come down,” said Congressman Casten. “This is a self-inflicted wound. We’re going to fight with every fiber of our being to make sure that we do the policy right, that we look out for the dignity of this institution the way that Gerry Connolly taught us to.""

“My message to you today is simple: House Republicans want to raise your energy bills, cut jobs, and kill the planet to give bigger tax breaks to polluters and billionaires like Elon Musk. That’s not what House Republicans want you to believe, but it’s the truth,” said Congressman Levin. “Over the past year, Donald Trump and the Republican Party have been talking about how the cost of living is too high. But they’ve been all talk and no action. Instead of working to lower costs and pass policies that uplift Americans, they are pushing one of the most harmful, misguided, and backward bills I’ve ever seen.""

“I’ve been here since one o’clock in the morning because House Republicans wanted to make sure that — in the dark of night — they could push through the rule. But Democrats have shown up and made sure that this bill sees the light of day, so that we can shine a light on what House Republicans are actually doing,” said Congresswoman Leger Fernández. “They are focused on making sure we keep the dirtiest energy dominant. When they say energy dominance, it’s not about energy, which includes the sun, and geothermal, and the wind, and those things that we know can power our homes cheaper, more affordable, while also creating the kinds of jobs communities like mine need and want.”

“It’s important to note that over half of the new clean jobs created by those provisions in the IRA are in red states and Republican districts,” said Congressman Thompson. “So House Republicans’ one big, ugly bill that we’ve been debating nearly around the clock, cuts all the clean energy production. It’ll raise electric costs by about $110 per year per household. And I did the math quickly. People making under $50,000 are going to get about $260 in tax cuts. If you subtract the energy cost increase, that just about cuts their tax cuts in half. So talk about giveth with one hand and taketh with the other.”

The legislation is broad in scope and repeals several Biden-era tax credits and policies aimed at supporting EV adoption. Tesla (TSLA) stock was mixed and other EV stocks fell in Thursday's stock market.

Trump's tax bill does away with major portions of former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, known as the IRA, which includes tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases among many other incentives. While the House-passed tax and spending bill would repeal many EV incentives, it also includes a provision for the Federal Highway Administration to impose a $250 annual fee registration for an EV vehicle and a $100 annual fee for hybrid vehicles.

This provision aims to make sure that EV operators pay to maintain U.S. roads in lieu of a gasoline tax. Thirty-seven states already collect annual EV fees ranging from $50 to $250 a year.

Tesla stock edged higher to 335.83 in morning trades after sliding 2.7% on Wednesday. EV startups Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) both edged down around 0.2%.

Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) both moved lower at the stock market open.

The IRA tax break of up to $7,500 for an EV purchase comes to an end at the end of 2025 under the House-passed tax bill. The Inflation Reduction Act has the incentives available through 2032.

However, the tax bill does include a ""special rule"" to keep IRA tax credits in place through ""taxable year"" 2026 but only for automakers that haven't yet sold 200,000 EV units by the end of 2025.

This would mean that Tesla, General Motors, Ford and others would not be able to take advantage. However, this would give extra runway for Rivian, Lucid and other EV startups.

Under the IRA, taxpayers can claim a tax credit for commercial clean vehicles placed in service in a taxable year. For vehicles weighing less than 14,000 pounds the credit value is $7,500 and for other vehicles the credit value is $40,000. The credit is already set to expire at the end of 2032.

The House-passed bill sets the expiration date at the end of 2025, but also includes a special rule allowing vehicles acquired pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before May 12, 2025, to qualify for the credit.

Currently, 10 Tesla vehicle models qualify for the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Three of Ford's electric F-15o Lightning variants qualify as well as many other makes, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

Battery Tech Incentive On The Chopping Block

The House Republican tax bill also restricts and phases out the IRA's ""advanced manufacturing production credit.""

Under current law, there is a tax credit for certain inverters, solar energy components, wind energy components, battery components manufactured and critical minerals produced. Currently for components sold in 2030 there is a 25% reduction to the credit with reduction going up to 50% in 2031 and then 75% in 2032. In the IRA, the advanced manufacturing credit disappears at the end of 2032, but the credit for critical mineral production is permanent.

The House-passed tax bill eliminates the tax credit for wind energy components sold after the end of 2027 and eliminates the credit for all other components at the end of 2031. The provision would also restrict access to the credit for ""certain prohibited foreign entities.""

Clean Energy Investment Also Would Go

The bill also would strip away IRA clean energy storage provisions, such as the clean electricity investment credit.

Under current law, there is a credit for qualified investment in an electricity facility or energy storage technology.

The House-passed bill would phase out the clean electricity investment credit. In the bill, there is a 20% credit reduction for facilities placed in service in 2029, a 40% reduction for facilities placed in service in 2030 and a 60% reduction in 2031. The tax credit ends at the end of 2031.

Tesla has taken advantage of these IRA provision for its battery storage business.

Meanwhile, the House bill also eliminates at the end of 2025 the residential clean energy credit.

Tesla Stock To Be Affected?

U.S. EV makers are bound to be hit by the repeal of the IRA EV tax credits of up to $7,500. Tesla vehicle sales have already hit a rough patch in recent quarters.

Tesla stock is up 18.6% in May. On May 9, shares blasted above the 200-day moving average, offering investors an aggressive entry. However, Tesla is stock is now extended.

Shares are still down about 17% this year as of Wednesday's stock market close, even as it has surged as the general analyst consensus was positive coming out of the Q1 conference call. There is also still significant overhead, with shares down about 31% from its 488.54 peak on Dec. 18.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk is focused on a limited robotaxi rollout next month in Austin.

""We've lost some sales perhaps on the left, but we've gained them on the right,"" Musk said in an interview Tuesday at Bloomberg's Qatar Economic Forum in Abu Dhabi, referring to left-wing and ring-wing consumers. ""The sales numbers at this point are strong and we see no problem with demand.""

Tesla stock has a 21-day average true range of 5.46%. The ATR metric is available on IBD's MarketSurge charting tool that gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock's behavior. Stocks that tend to make large jumps or dives in daily action, the kind that can trigger sell rules and shake investors out of a stock, have a high ATR. Stocks that tend to make more incremental moves have lower ATRs.

With the S&P 500 and Nasdaq now in a power trend, investors can buy stocks with ATRs up to 8%, though they should be wary of being too concentrated in high-octane names.

Tesla stock has a 79 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Shares also have a 92 Relative Strength Rating and a 59 EPS Rating.

About Lightstar Renewables Founded in 2019 and headquartered in Boston, Lightstar Renewables is a trailblazer in the development of community solar solutions.","Mayor Duggan's Vision Transforms Vacant Land into Renewable Energy with Community Benefits

DETROIT, May 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Detroit is setting the standard for urban revitalization and sustainable development. Spearheaded by Mayor Mike Duggan's visionary leadership, the City of Detroit has taken another significant step towards combating climate change and empowering its neighborhoods. Lightstar Renewables is proud to collaborate with the City of Detroit on the Phase 2 Solar Neighborhoods initiative, turning long-vacant land into state-of-the-art solar fields and delivering exceptional benefits to the community.

Building on the success of Phase 1, which brought solar fields to three neighborhoods, Phase 2 introduces 61 acres of solar infrastructure in the Houston-Whittier/Hayes and Greenfield Park neighborhoods. Together, these efforts contribute to a total of 165 acres of solar fields across Detroit, generating 31 megawatts of renewable energy—enough to power 127 municipal buildings, including police stations, recreation centers, and transit hubs.

""The Solar Neighborhoods initiative has been very much a community driven process that is taking blighted vacant land and turning it into a productive and attractive new use while providing direct benefit to homeowners,"" said Mayor Mike Duggan. ""Residents of these neighborhoods designed the landscaping for their new solar arrays and homeowner occupants are receiving energy efficiency upgrades to their homes to increase their value and lower their utility costs.""

Direct Benefits for Detroit Communities

The Solar Neighborhoods initiative is more than an energy project; it's a testament to the power of partnerships and community-centered development.

Energy Efficiency Upgrades: Over 106 local homeowners will receive a minimum of $15,000 worth of energy efficiency improvements, reducing energy costs and enhancing the quality of life.

Community-Driven Design: Residents played an instrumental role in shaping the landscaping design of solar sites, ensuring these projects reflect their vision. Ornamental trees, perennial gardens, and flowering meadows will bring new life to previously neglected open spaces.

Support for Urban Agriculture: Through innovative agrivoltaic solutions, designated solar sites will also support local farmers, enabling them to grow crops sustainably with less water use and frost protection.

""This initiative goes far beyond renewable energy,"" said Owen Deitcher of Lightstar Renewables. ""It's a holistic vision for sustainable urban development that combines energy innovation, community empowerment, and environmental stewardship. At Lightstar, we couldn't be more honored to partner with the City of Detroit and our incredibly engaged neighborhood partners to make this vision a reality.""

A National Model for Innovation and Collaboration

The bold roadmap set by Mayor Duggan's administration showcases what's possible when municipalities and private sector leaders join forces. The commitment from the Mayor's Office, the Department of Public Works, Planning and Development, and the Office of Sustainability underscores how collaboration drives lasting impact.

Victoria Hicks, a Greenfield Park resident, shared her excitement about this transformation, saying, ""The Solar Neighborhoods program has turned blighted land into something truly beautiful and beneficial, while also improving the lives of residents. This is the progress we've been waiting for.""

The initiative also highlights Lightstar's leadership in solar development, merging cutting-edge technology with community-focused solutions. From agrivoltaic designs to providing stipends and training for local farmers, Detroit's Solar Neighborhoods serve as a national model for integrating renewable energy into urban revitalization.

Together for a Cleaner, Stronger Future

This achievement is only the beginning. With Phase 2 Solar Neighborhoods underway, Detroit is proving that renewable energy can go hand-in-hand with neighborhood empowerment and economic growth. Lightstar remains committed to supporting Detroit's green energy future, ensuring that every project brings tangible benefits to the people, environment, and economy.

What Happened to All the Supposed ...,"Dan Gearino, Arcelia Martin",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22052025/inside-clean-energy-republican-ira-repeal/,"Early this morning, the House voted 215-214 to pass a sweeping budget reconciliation bill with provisions that include a cancellation or phaseout for just about everything that was in the Inflation Reduction Act.
A brief aside about the merits of the bill: Energy researchers are describing it as an economic and environmental disaster.

Four Senate Republicans have raised concerns about the phaseout of energy tax credits.","Early this morning, the House voted 215-214 to pass a sweeping budget reconciliation bill with provisions that include a cancellation or phaseout for just about everything that was in the Inflation Reduction Act.

The measure, which now heads to the Senate, is being described by clean energy and environmental groups as a monumental betrayal of the country that will cost jobs and increase electricity bills.

But during the floor debate overnight, the energy parts of the bill were an afterthought to higher priority issues for members of both parties, such as tax cuts, revisions to Medicaid and a desire to support or oppose the agenda of President Donald Trump.

Two months ago, 21 House Republicans sent a letter to the chair of the House Ways & Means Committee about the need to preserve the IRA tax credits, warning against “premature credit phase outs or additional restrictive mechanisms.”

House leadership was able to assuage some of those concerns when the draft of the bill showed that tax credits for biofuels would be preserved, among other changes.

But some House Republicans still objected. Last week, 14 of the signers of the previous letter issued a joint statement affirming their support for the credits. This was a smaller number than the March letter, but it was more than enough to sink the bill if even a few of them held firm.

So how many of them ended up voting against the bill? Zero.

Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) missed the vote, but had intended to vote for the bill. The other 13 people who issued the statement last week all voted “yes.”

Before the vote, I spoke with David Spence, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, to try to get a sense of the factors that were most likely to influence each member.

A brief aside about the merits of the bill: Energy researchers are describing it as an economic and environmental disaster. The think tank Energy Innovation said this week that the bill would lead to the loss of 830,000 jobs by 2030 and increase consumer energy costs by $16 billion in 2030. Any discussion of who voted for it in the House and who might in the Senate may sound like a parlor game, but the stakes are incredibly high when it comes to shaping the world of future generations.

Spence made a chart showing each of the members who signed the two letters, along with factors that may shape their views, such as the partisan lean of their districts and the extent of IRA projects there.

Of the 38 people calling for a full repeal, 28 represent districts with a Republican lean of at least 10 points, which means their district favored the GOP by at least 10 percentage points more than the country as a whole did in the 2024 general election, according to Cook Political Report. These members have a much higher risk of losing in a primary challenge from another Republican than of losing in a general election.

Among the 38 are some of the House’s most outspoken budget hawks, who are so committed to their ideology that they have been willing to go against the House leadership and the Trump administration on issues related to spending. Examples include Reps. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia and Ralph Norman of South Carolina.

Only 10 of the 38 have IRA-funded projects in their districts, based on data from E2, a clean energy business group. Among them is Norman, whose district has six such projects that have led to commitments for 1,933 jobs.

One of those projects, a solar panel plant planned by Silfab Solar of Canada, has been controversial. Some residents have said they are alarmed about chemicals that would be used to make solar equipment.

Norman said on Wednesday that his main concern is that he doesn’t like subsidies.

“Embracing an ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy is crucial, and solar plays a role in that mix,” Norman said in a statement. “But let me be clear—that does not mean we support endless subsidies. The real value of energy production lies in strengthening our infrastructure, streamlining permitting, and reducing our dependence on foreign suppliers. We need to rely on what works where it works, without burdening taxpayers to prop up any one industry.”

Based on the outcome, the House members who really hate the IRA were able to win the internal debate over those who wanted to preserve some parts of the law—and it wasn’t even close.

The final negotiations were more about making the bill palatable to budget hardliners, which involved making the IRA provisions even more onerous for energy companies and implementing faster phaseouts.

Among the potential holdouts that voted for the bill was Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who was re-elected despite his district favoring Democrats by a narrow margin in the presidential election. He was part of both the letter and the joint statement calling for tax credits to be maintained.

Others who said they supported tax credits come from heavily Republican districts that have major projects funded in part by the IRA. This includes Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, who has seven projects and 4,462 jobs in his district related to the law, and still voted for the bill.

“This is a once-in-a-generation bill that will unlock President Trump’s full domestic agenda, which Georgians voted for overwhelmingly back in November,” Carter said in a statement after the vote. “With the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act we are unleashing our nation’s energy dominance, securing the border, putting more money back into hardworking Americans’ wallets, kicking illegal immigrants off Medicaid so that it is available for those who need it, and ending the waste, fraud, and abuse that risks sending our country into economic ruin.”

The larger lesson was that the power of partisanship overwhelmed just about everything else.

This gives credence to a view I hear a lot from grassroots environmental advocates: The only way to pass and maintain strong climate and energy policies is to elect Democrats because even the Republicans who care about those topics will be marginalized and ultimately run over by their leadership.

But this isn’t over yet. Four Senate Republicans have raised concerns about the phaseout of energy tax credits. If the Senate makes any changes, the House will need to vote again.

In the meantime, entire industries—including solar, wind, batteries, EVs and energy efficiency—may need to throw out their business plans, scrap investments and prepare for a challenging near future.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

Empire Wind Is Back on Track After Trump Administration Reversal: Work can begin again on New York’s Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project after the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management lifted a stop work order that it had issued last month, as my colleague Carrie Klein reports for ICN. The project was 30 percent complete when it was paused. The Trump administration said it ordered the pause because the approval process for the project was flawed, but the government has not shared details. Clare Fieseler of Canary Media reported this week that the supposed evidence involving Empire Wind 1 had not been shared even within government agencies involved with the project, which raised questions about whether the stop work order was justified.

The World’s Largest Battery Maker Has a Successful Stock Offering in Hong Kong: Shares in Contemporary Amperex Technology, or CATL, surged in value by 18 percent this week as the company made its debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange, as John Liu reports for CNN. The China-based company is the world’s largest manufacturer of EV batteries. Its stock offering is part of a greater integration with global financial markets at a time when trade tensions are high between the United States and China.

TVA Is the First U.S. Utility to Seek a Permit for a Small Modular Reactor: The Tennessee Valley Authority, the federally owned power company, this week said it had applied to federal nuclear regulators for a permit to build a small, modular nuclear reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as Jennifer McDermott reports for The Associated Press. While companies have spent years working to develop small modular reactors and the nuclear industry views this type of plant as the future of nuclear power, the plans have always been several steps from reality. This application is no guarantee that a plant will be built, and the approval process will likely take years, but the fact that a company has applied for a permit is still significant.

Higher Solar Tariffs Are Coming: The U.S. International Trade Commission voted this week to accept findings that solar panel manufacturers in this country have been harmed or threatened by inexpensive imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, a key step toward the United States placing higher tariffs on solar products from those countries, as Nichola Groom reports for Reuters. The result is likely to be higher costs to develop solar projects, which is why U.S. solar industry groups have warned that an increase in tariffs will lead to a loss of jobs and investment. These tariffs are in addition to the duties that the Trump administration has imposed as part of its trade policies.

The clean energy tax credits have already saved 41,000 Nevada families more than $151 million on clean energy and energy efficiency upgrades.
If clean energy tax credits and key pollution regulations are repealed, Nevada households are expected to see an increase in total annual energy costs of $289 in 2030.
But if the federal clean energy tax credits are repealed by Trump and congressional Republicans, these opportunities will disappear, and 21,000 new clean energy jobs in Nevada could be at risk.
Gutting the clean energy tax credits would destroy our growing industry as it's finally starting to scale, while destroying trust among businesses and homeowners alike.","For more than a decade, I’ve been working in home electrification, long before most people had heard of things like heat pumps or heat pump water heaters. In 2013, I studied how to better design all-electric buildings. Back then, it was a tight-knit, early-stage field focused on solutions that solve energy problems and decarbonize our lives.

For the first time in my career, the field is scaling, thanks to the clean energy tax credits. But the Republican tax bill would roll back years of progress by eliminating these programs.

Over the past few months, Trump’s federal funding cuts, mass layoffs and tariff threats have caused chaos and uncertainty. Businesses are spooked and contractors are unsure whether to invest in new workers or tools. I’ve lost three major clients to this chaos — these were businesses looking to bring the benefits and savings of electrification to thousands of homes in several states. This kind of whiplash is devastating for planning and erodes trust in the markets and our government.

This tax bill basically repeals tax credits for commercial and utility-scale solar, imposing retroactive tax increases and shortening timelines, adding impossible red tape and eliminating key financing tools. For households, the bill would gut tax credits for home upgrades, including 30% on solar panels, insulation and more energy-efficient windows and doors.

This is a huge mistake. The clean energy tax credits have already saved 41,000 Nevada families more than $151 million on clean energy and energy efficiency upgrades. If clean energy tax credits and key pollution regulations are repealed, Nevada households are expected to see an increase in total annual energy costs of $289 in 2030. Higher bills are the last thing we need.

This kind of uncertainty is bad for businesses and bad for homeowners trying to plan for their future. The Republican tax bill will make things infinitely worse — harder for businesses to grow and for Nevadans to electrify their homes and save money on energy bills.

Trust takes years to build. I’ve spent years doing that — working one-to-one with homeowners, helping guide them through complex decisions like outdated HVAC systems or switching from gas to electric appliances. For families, the IRA tax credits were the piece that made electrification financially possible for them.

I see a lot of opportunity in Reno alone, where many older homes have inefficient HVAC units and insufficient insulation. Replacing them with a heat pump can help cut costs substantially, especially in a place like Nevada, home to two of the fastest-warming cities in the country.

Clean energy also creates good-paying jobs, not just in blue districts. Since 2022, over half of the 400,000 new clean energy jobs landed in Republican districts. Here in Nevada, eight of Nevada’s 21 projects announced since 2022 are in Rep. Mark Amodei’s district, representing $11.1 billion in investment and 15,010 new jobs.

While running for office, Trump and Republicans promised to lower costs and revitalize the economy. Instead, this bill undermines America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources, hurting our economy and environmental health in the process.

The more clean energy that comes online, the cheaper it’s going to become. Solar, wind, and battery storage accounted for 93% of all new American energy supply in 2024. Solar, especially, has taken off in Nevada, powering the state and bringing down energy costs.

But if the federal clean energy tax credits are repealed by Trump and congressional Republicans, these opportunities will disappear, and 21,000 new clean energy jobs in Nevada could be at risk. This would be a disaster for our state’s economy: one estimate shows that repealing clean energy tax credits would lead to Nevada’s GDP decreasing by $95 million in 2030 and $38 million in 2035.

I remember the time when there were only a few folks in the building electrification industry. Now, we’re growing, training new workers, and solving big energy problems. But we can’t keep growing if we’re constantly bracing for attacks.

Rep. Amodei and members of Congress must do everything they can to keep producing made-in-America energy. Gutting the clean energy tax credits would destroy our growing industry as it's finally starting to scale, while destroying trust among businesses and homeowners alike.

Announced on May 21, the new two-million-square-foot hub, set to open in 2027, will sit on a 350-acre property and will deploy an AutoStore automation to boost parts delivery speed, accuracy, and sustainability. According to the company, the facility is expected to support 488 UAW-represented jobs as it consolidates operations from existing locations in Center Line, Warren, and Milwaukee. Stellantis recently sold these sites under a sale-leaseback agreement to maintain support until the transition is complete.

However, UAW leadership expressed strong concerns that the consolidation could ultimately reduce the Mopar workforce. Kevin Gotinsky, UAW’s Stellantis department director, said the company is currently below the staffing levels agreed upon in the 2023 collective bargaining contract.

The 2023 contract between Stellantis and the UAW followed targeted strikes at parts facilities and resulted in the elimination of tiered wages at Mopar and wage increases of up to 76%. Mopar employment levels and job security became central issues during those negotiations.

The Megahub’s AutoStore system will use compact robots to retrieve items from a high-density grid and deliver them to employees at workstations for packing and shipment, enhancing operational efficiency and storage capacity. The automaker says the project reflects a long-term strategy to modernize its parts network while improving delivery speed and sustainability.

The new bill also would keep the tax credits for advanced nuclear projects and expanding existing plants if construction starts by the end of 2028.
The changes would come on top of limitations on the energy credits that were estimated to save $560 billion in cuts in Inflation Reduction Act spending and could cripple the clean energy industry.","Subsidies for clean power would end years earlier in a giant tax and spending bill narrowly passed by the Republican-led House of Representatives early Thursday, driving down shares of solar companies including Sunrun Inc.

It now moves to the Senate, where key Republicans have already balked at some of the House’s plans. Some wanted longer transition times before the latest House bill cut those even further.

The House bill is “worse than feared” for clean energy, analysts at Jeffries said in a research note Thursday. They added, however, that “we don’t expect this to last into Senate draft.”

Shares of Sunrun fell 44% in early trading Thursday. SolarEdge Technologies Inc. sank 17%.

The revised text released Wednesday night marked an extended effort to win over Republican dissidents, including fiscal hardliners who wanted deeper cuts to a series of tax credits created under former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law.

The revisions would include ending technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits for sources like wind and solar starting in 2029 and requiring those projects to commence construction within 60 days of the legislation becoming law. The initial version proposed by House Republicans had a longer phase-out time, allowing many of the credits to exist until 2032.

“They would probably amount to a hard shutdown of the IRA,” said James Lucier, managing director at research group Capital Alpha Partners, referring to Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. “The initial version of the Ways and Means bill gave investors some hope they could live under the old regime for another couple of years, but now no more.”

The House bill would also hasten more stringent restrictions that would disqualify any project deemed to benefit China from receiving credits. Under the new version, those restrictions, which some analysts have said could render the credits useless for many projects, would kick in next year.

At the same time, the revised bill would restore “transferability” of a nuclear production tax credit, which would allow a project sponsor to sell tax credits to a third party, according to a summary of the changes. It also lengthens the among of time the credit remains in place by allowing projects that have started construction but aren’t yet operating to be eligible to receive them, the summary said.

The new bill also would keep the tax credits for advanced nuclear projects and expanding existing plants if construction starts by the end of 2028. It also would phase out a consumer tax incentive of as much as $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles.

The changes would come on top of limitations on the energy credits that were estimated to save $560 billion in cuts in Inflation Reduction Act spending and could cripple the clean energy industry.

The legislation is the centerpiece of President Donald Trump’s second term agenda. However it faces a delicate path to become law, and may still be altered further.

Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski and three colleagues have vowed to defend the credits and called for a “targeted, pragmatic approach.”

“I am watching right now to see how far the House goes,” Murkowski said in an interview on Tuesday.

With last-minute concessions and stark warnings from Trump, the Republican holdouts largely dropped their opposition to salvage the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that's central to the GOP agenda. The House launched debate before midnight and by dawn the vote was called, 215-214, with Democrats staunchly opposed. It next goes to the Senate.

The Michigan delegation voted along party lines.

“To put it simply, this bill gets Americans back to winning again,"" said Johnson, R-La.

The outcome caps an intense time on Capitol Hill, with days of private negotiations and public committee hearings, many happening back-to-back, around-the-clock. Republicans insisted their sprawling 1,000-page-plus package was what voters sent them to Congress — and Trump to the White House — to accomplish. They believe it will be “rocket fuel,” as one put it during debate, for the uneasy U.S. economy.

Trump himself demanded action, visiting House Republicans at Tuesday's conference meeting and hosting GOP leaders and the holdouts for a lengthy session Wednesday at the White House. Before the vote, the administration warned in a pointed statement that “failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.”

Central to the package is the GOP's commitment to extending some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks they engineered during Trump’s first term in 2017, while temporarily adding new ones he campaigned on during his 2024 campaign, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay, car loan interest and others.

To make up for some of the lost tax revenue, the Republicans focused on changes to Medicaid and the food stamps program, largely by imposing work requirements on many of those receiving benefits. There's also a massive rollback of green energy tax breaks from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

Additionally, the package tacks on $350 billion in new spending, with about $150 billion going to the Pentagon, including for the president’s new “Golden Dome” defense shield, and the rest for Trump’s mass deportation and border security agenda.

All told, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 8.6 million fewer people would have health care coverage and 3 million less people a month would have SNAP food stamps benefits with the proposed changes.

The CBO said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the changes to Medicaid, food stamps and other services would tally $1 trillion in reduced spending. The lowest-income households in the U.S. would see their resources drop, while the highest ones would see a boost, it said.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York read letters from Americans describing the way the program cuts would hurt them. ""This is one big ugly bill,” he said.

As the minority, without the votes to stop Trump's package, Democrats instead offered up impassioned speeches and procedural moves to stall its advance. As soon as the House floor reopened for debate, the Democrats forced a vote to adjourn. It failed.

In “the dark of night they want to pass this GOP tax scam,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.

Other Democrats called it a “big, bad bill” or a “big, broken promise.”

Pulling the package together and pushing it to passage has been an enormous political lift for Johnson, with few votes to spare from his slim GOP majority whose rank-and-file Republicans have conflicting priorities of their own.

Conservatives, particularly from the Freedom Caucus, held out for steeper spending cuts to defray costs piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt.

At the same time, more moderate and centrist GOP lawmakers were wary of the changes to Medicaid that could result in lost health care for their constituents. And some worried the phaseout of the renewable energy tax breaks will impede businesses using them to invest in green energy projects in many states.

One big problem had been the costly deal with GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states to quadruple the $10,000 deduction for state and local taxes, called SALT, to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, which was included in the final product.

For every faction Johnson tried to satisfy, another would roar in opposition.

Late in the night, GOP leaders unveiled a 42-page amendment with a number of revisions.

The changes included speedier implementation of the Medicaid work requirements, which will begin in December 2026, rather than January 2029, and a faster roll back of the production tax credits for clean electricity projects, both sought by the conservatives.

Also tucked into the final version were some unexpected additions — including a $12 billion fund for the Department of Homeland Security to reimburse states that help federal officials with deportations and border security.

And in a nod to Trump's influence, the Republicans renamed a proposed new children’s savings program after the president, changing it from MAGA accounts — money account for growth and advancement — to simply “Trump” accounts.

Rep. Erin Houchin, R-Ind., said Americans shouldn’t believe the dire predictions from Democrats about the impact of the bill. “We can unlock the ‘Golden Age’ of America,” she said, echoing the president’s own words.

By early morning hours, the chief holdouts appeared to be falling in line. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said they “got some improvements.”

But two Republicans voted against the package, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a deficit watcher who had been publicly criticized by Trump, remained unmoved. “This bill is a debt bomb ticking,” he warned.

And Rep. Andy Harris, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus who wanted more time, voted present. Some others did not vote.

Final analysis of the overall package's costs and economic impacts are still being assessed.

Along with extending existing tax breaks, it would increase the standard income tax deduction, to $32,000 for joint filers, and boost the child tax credit to $2,500. There would be an enhanced deduction, of $4,000, for older adults of certain income levels, to help defray taxes on Social Security income.

To cut spending, those seeking Medicaid health care, who are able-bodied adults without dependents, would need to fulfill 80 hours a month on a job or in other community activities.

Similarly, to receive food stamps through SNAP, those up to age 64, rather than 54, who are able-bodied and without dependents, would need to meet the 80 hours a month work or community engagement requirements. Additionally, some parents of children older than 7 years old would need to fulfill the work requirements.

Republicans said they want to root out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal programs.

Growing up in the heart of Hudson County, New Jersey, Carolina Ramos always felt a connection to her community and a desire to make a difference. Her path led her from college studies to hands-on experience in local government and, ultimately, to a career in the growing energy sector. But what stands out most in her story is how she turned her passion into opportunity – and how others can do the same.

A personal mission to create change

After studying environmental sciences at Rutgers University, Carolina joined the AmeriCorps VISTA program in Jersey City, where she worked on recycling initiatives before transitioning to the city’s sustainability department.

[CEJ] helped me figure out exactly what kind of work I was looking for.”

– Carolina Ramos, Clean Energy Jobs program graduate

“That’s where I did what I really loved, giving back to my community and being a civil servant,” she said.

But Carolina knew there was more to learn, and as the clean energy industry rapidly expanded, she wanted to be part of it in a bigger way.

In addition to taking data science courses, connecting with industry leaders and learning from seasoned professionals, she became involved with “Latinx in Sustainability.” As part of its leadership team, Carolina helped develop mentorship programs, professional development stipends and webinars to make the clean energy industry more accessible.

“We wanted to let people know that there is space for everyone in this industry,” she explained.

The right connections, the right opportunities

Through her network, Carolina was introduced to the Clean Energy Jobs Program, an initiative that helps New Jersey residents access training and career opportunities in the clean energy sector. CEJ works with the state’s Department of Labor and numerous public and private partners, including PSE&G, to connect job seekers with real-world opportunities, from skilled trades to professional roles in energy consulting.

Carolina shared her career goals with CEJ, and they helped her refine her resume, identify job openings and navigate the hiring process.

“They helped me figure out exactly what kind of work I was looking for,” she said.

A career with purpose and growth

Thanks to the support and resources available through CEJ, Carolina landed a position at an energy consulting firm, where she now works on projects that improve efficiency, assess energy usage and help companies – including PSE&G – implement smart solutions.

“It’s been great to get all the technical skills I wanted, to challenge myself and to learn more about the industry,” she said. “I’ve always advocated for myself, wanting to contribute to different communities – especially Spanish-speaking communities – while building a strong technical skill set.”

Even as she builds her career, Carolina is focused on helping others find their path in the clean energy sector. She volunteers at resume workshops and speaks to students and job seekers about the variety of opportunities available.

“I know there are so many people who think they can’t be part of this industry because they don’t have a four-year degree or they’re still in community college,” she said. “But there are so many different opportunities, whether you want to go into the trades, pursue certifications or work in analysis like I do. It’s a booming industry, and there’s room for so many more voices.”

Powering the future – together

Carolina’s journey is a testament to what’s possible when ambition meets opportunity. With the right support and access to resources like the Clean Energy Jobs Program, more people can step into rewarding careers in the energy industry.

For those looking to make a career move, whether in the trades, technology or analysis, now is the time. The industry is growing, the opportunities are real, and, like Carolina, you might just find the perfect fit.

The SMR construction permit application to the NRC is the first by a U.S. utility. Federal utility agency TVA plans to install the GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 reactor technology at its Clinch River site near Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Other SMR startups such as X-energy and NuScale Power have submitted permit applications to the NRC. No small nuclear reactor project has been built or even started construction in the U.S. so far.

""This is a significant milestone for TVA, our region and our nation because we are accelerating the development of new nuclear technology, its supply chain and delivery model to unleash American energy,” Don Moul, TVA president and CEO, said in a statement. “TVA has put in the work to advance the design and develop the first application for the BWRX-300 technology, creating a path for other utilities who choose to build the same technology. TVA looks forward to working with the (Trump) Administration to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that are key to our nation's energy security. We believe deploying new nuclear is essential to providing American families and businesses affordable and abundant electricity for decades to come.""

Nuclear reactor-generated power is carbon-free and baseload electricity which can provide high-capacity factor generation. The nation’s conventional nuclear reactors currently account for about 18% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity and more than half of its carbon-free power generated.

SMRs are envisioned as the next generation of nuclear technology, with passive safety features, smaller footprints and more scalable, less expensive designs. Opponents say that even SMRs are still too expensive, potentially hazardous and create radioactive waste.

But the nation is in an electric power quandary with artificial intelligence training and cloud-based data center capacity rising exponentially and stressing future utility-scale delivery. Some forecasters, such as Goldman Sachs, are predicting at least a doubling of data center capacity and perhaps another 50 GW needed.

Tech giants such as Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon Web Services and Google all are pursuing or have signed power agreements with SMR and conventional nuclear producers.

TVA gained an early site permit for the Clinch River SMR plan several years ago. The plan is to install two or more BWRX-300 reactors, each of which are being designed to generate about 300 MW of around-the-clock, carbon-free power.

Industrial firm Dow recently submitted its construction permit application to the NRC for an X-energy SMR site planned to power operations at Dow’s Seadrift manufacturing facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. The NRC agreed to review the construction permit application by Long Mott Generating, the Dow company which is operating the currently gas-fired industrial power plant. The Long Mott gas plant is due to be retired soon.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy and TVA entered into their SMR agreement in 2022 to build the SMR at Clinch River. Canadian utility Ontario Power Generation also has accepted the BWRX-300 as part of its SMR plans.

SMR nuclear will not be cheap to build, with some estimates at $7 billion for the first commissioned reactor. Proponents say the cost will come down and no other resource offers baseload and carbon-free energy required to power data centers, industrial and other mission-critical operations.

Nuclear energy reactors are built for longer lifetimes than most electricity generation technology. Numerous utilities have successfully licensed some plants to run as long as 89 years.

The TVA is among numerous entities seeking an $800 million U.S. Department of Energy grant to accelerate BWRX-300 deployment. Most industry leaders predict the first SMRs will be built in the U.S.. by the early to mid 2030s.

(CNN) — House Republicans gutted energy savings and clean energy tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill — taking aim at funds that are creating thousands of jobs in GOP states and saving homeowners money on their bills.

It’s all on the chopping block. The House GOP passed Trump’s tax package on a narrow vote Thursday morning. The bill now heads to the Senate.

The bill would end tax credits that helped lower the cost of electric vehicles, energy efficient appliances, rooftop solar and insulation. In last-minute changes to the bill, Republicans sped up the timelines for phasing out key clean energy tax credits.

They also put in a new restrictions for energy companies building solar, wind, battery or geothermal to generate electricity. The only carve-out was for nuclear energy. Even though nuclear doesn’t generate planet-warming pollution, it is much more expensive and time-intensive to build than solar and wind. Under the bill, nuclear companies can claim a tax break if they start construction on their projects by 2028.

The bill could cost the US more than 830,000 jobs that would otherwise be created in the coming years, the think tank Energy Innovation found. The impacted jobs are mostly in construction and manufacturing, building factories and components for EVs, wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and other clean energy products — the vast majority of which are in GOP states and districts.

It also threatens an eye-popping amount of investment from companies that piggybacked on the passage of the 2022 clean energy bill, also known as the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We’re talking about an awful lot of money — approaching a trillion dollars in private sector investment that’s either been made or has been planned — that is at risk,” said Robbie Orvis, Energy Innovation’s senior director of modeling and analysis.

The threatened funds are in the same places the jobs are at risk; nearly 80% of the investment sparked by the law is in Republican areas, according to data from the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bottom line, that’s what the new tax bill is, essentially: a repeal of the clean energy provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, according to independent analysis from the two nonpartisan think tanks.

“It’s functionally equivalent to a full-out repeal,” Orvis said, adding the current bill proposed by House Republicans is a “sledgehammer on steroids.”

It would hurt Republicans the most.

Republicans represent 14 of the top 20 congressional districts that are on the cusp of gaining the most jobs from the law, which was championed by former President Joe Biden.

Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas, among others, have gained most of the new jobs in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing and could stand to lose the most if tax credits disappear.

Rep. Mark Amodei, whose Nevada district alone is poised to gain more than 20,000 jobs in mining, refining and processing lithium for EVs and batteries, previously told CNN that continuing to fund these facilities in his district is “fundamental.” Nevertheless, Amodei voted yes for the House bill on Thursday.

Orvis said the Republican tax bill could not only hurt future projects, it will likely hurt existing manufacturing facilities as well.

“Some of the proposed language in the (bill) text actually puts existing facilities at risk because they will no longer qualify to receive some of the tax credits that they got financing on,” Orvis said.

The cost of electricity for everyday Americans and businesses would also go up; Energy Innovation found wholesale electricity prices would increase by 50% by 2035. This is in large part because solar and wind energy are cheaper than fossil fuels.

Rhodium’s analysis found the GOP bill would slash the amount of new clean energy on the US electric grid by 57-72% through 2035.

Cutting cheaper wind and solar will raise American’s energy bills, analysts said.

“You don’t worry about (price volatility) with wind and solar; the sun is still free,” Rhodium analyst Ben King told CNN. “By shifting away from renewables and back to natural gas, you are exposing yourself to price volatility as well.”

Some Republican lawmakers previously voiced concerns that repealing the tax credits could hurt electricity generation at a time when the US needs more power than ever. The AI boom is gobbling up electricity for data centers, and companies are on the hunt for electrons wherever they can find them.

That’s the central argument solar CEOs have been making to Republican lawmakers as they’ve pleaded with them to keep the credits intact.

“Solar is the most effective form of energy going forward; it’s the fastest and cheapest to market,” said Zaid Ashai, CEO of solar company Nexamp. “The reality is we’re in this economic competition with China. The only way to win the technology and AI race is to be energy independent, and solar is a really key component of that.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association — a trade group representing solar companies — blasted the bill on Thursday.

“Americans’ electric bills will soar,” Abigail Ross Hopper, the group’s president and CEO said in a statement. “If this bill becomes law, America will effectively surrender the AI race to China and communities nationwide will face blackouts.”

The revised text marked an extended effort to win over party dissidents, including fiscal hardliners who wanted deeper cuts to a series of tax credits created under former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law.

The revisions include ending technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits for sources like wind and solar starting in 2029 and requiring those projects to commence construction within 60 days of the legislation becoming law. The initial version proposed by House Republicans had a longer phase-out time, allowing many of the credits to exist until 2032.

“They would probably amount to a hard shutdown of the IRA,” said James Lucier, managing director at research group Capital Alpha Partners, referring to Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

The revised draft also hastens more stringent restrictions that would disqualify from the credits any project deemed to benefit China. Under the new version, those restrictions, which some analysts have said could render the credits useless for many projects, would kick in next year.

At the same time, the revised bill restores “transferability” of a nuclear production tax credit, a move that would allow a project sponsor to sell tax credits to a third party, according to a summary of the changes. It also lengthens the among of time the credit remains in place by allowing projects that have started construction but aren’t yet operating to be eligible to receive them, the summary said.

The new bill also keeps the tax credits for advanced nuclear projects and expanding existing plants if construction starts by the end of 2028. It also would phase out a consumer tax incentive of as much as $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles.

The changes come on top of limitations on the energy credits that were estimated to save $560 billion in cuts in Inflation Reduction Act spending and could cripple the clean energy industry.

The legislation is the centerpiece of President Donald Trump’s second term agenda. However it faces a delicate path to become law, and may still be altered further.

In the House, Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose three votes assuming all Democrats vote against the measure.

Meanwhile in the Senate, key Republicans have already balked at some of the House’s plans, saying they want longer transition times and other changes, even before the latest version cut those even further.

In a letter to leadership last month, Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski and three colleagues vowed to defend the credits and called for a “targeted, pragmatic approach.”

“I am watching right now to see how far the House goes,” Murkowski said in an interview on Tuesday.

The new version of the House measure doesn’t include a proposal to raise billions of dollars in revenue through the sales of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in Nevada and Utah. The idea had come under fire from Representative Ryan Zinke, a Montana Republican, who said the issue was a red line for him.

The measure would eliminate incentives for clean energy, electric vehicles, manufacturing, hydrogen, and more, while giving industry free rein over public lands.

The following is a statement from Christy Goldfuss, executive director of NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“In a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands.

“These credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy—investments that are creating jobs, lowering energy costs, and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves. At a time when electricity demand is skyrocketing, this is the exact opposite of what is needed—and what this administration has promised.

“This bill also contains the most dangerous attack on public lands in a generation. It guts environmental safeguards, shuts out the public from decision making, and turns over millions of acres to drillers, miners, and loggers. It even would allow them to pay to get their project rubber-stamped. That’s not just wrong, it’s un-American.

Some 70% of the rooftop solar industry now uses lease arrangements, making the bill disastrous for companies like Sunrun, Guggenheim analyst Joseph Osha told clients.

Enphase and SolarEdge plummeted about 16% and 24%, respectively, as sales of their inverters would take a hit from lower demand for rooftop solar.

The bill also ends the investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities that begin construction 60 days after the legislation is enacted or enter service after Dec. 31, 2028. Those credits have played a key role in the rapid expansion of utility-scale solar projects in the U.S.

If they’re placed in service by 2028, they could still claim the clean electricity tax credit, so that is a little bit better than the full repeal scenario we look at.
Jenkins: It’s decimating for that whole effort to build out a U.S. battery supply chain.
Jenkins: It’s one of the most important shifts out there, so we’ll keep a close eye on it.
What the FEOC does is it basically, I think, kills these tax credits because— Jenkins: It’s a poison pill.","Jesse Jenkins: Oh God, this sucks.

Meyer: And let’s start there. Hi, I’m Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap News.

Jenkins: And I’m Jesse Jenkins, a professor of Energy Systems Engineering at Princeton University.

Meyer: And you are listening to SHIFT KEY, Heatmap’s weekly podcast on decarbonization and the shift away from fossil fuels. On this week’s show, we are looking at what the House budget bill will mean for the energy transition, the U.S. energy economy, and the emissions profile. You know, last week, while we were recording SHIFT KEY, as you may have heard, House Ways and Means Committee released its first crack at the text for its big partisan reconciliation bill, the big piece of legislation that this Republican Congress wants to do that includes really taking a sledgehammer to a ton of parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. Since then, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted yes on that proposal. We are recording this on the afternoon of Monday, May 19th. Last night, the House Budget Committee also voted yes on the proposal.

So in the next few days, this House budget bill will move to the floor, and I should say we don’t know exactly what policies are going to be in it when it gets there, but today on this show, we want to give you some tools for thinking about what the options are — first of all, for the final bill. And second of all, what that will mean in the real world. What will that mean for the energy economy? And to do it, we have one of the best guests I can think of to help us do that, and that guest is my very own co-host, Jesse Jenkins.

So Jesse, as some of you may know, runs the REPEAT project at Princeton University, which does exactly this kind of rapid energy policy analysis that looks at what policies under consideration might mean for the energy economy. And he has, we have today, Jesse’s new and at the time we’re recording this, exclusive new findings on just the different set of options that could result from the House Republican bill, and that’s what we’re going to talk about today. So Jesse, welcome to SHIFT KEY.

Jenkins: It’s great to be back, Rob. So yeah, I’m excited and a bit terrified to share the results from this round of modeling from the REPEAT project, which, as Rob mentioned, we’ve been running since all the way back in 2021 as an effort to try to keep tabs on changes in federal energy and climate policy, and to use our energy system modeling tools to try to put a quantitative spin on what those changes might entail for the U.S. energy transition, for greenhouse gas emissions, for energy costs across the country, and those kinds of major salient points.

We did this, of course, all throughout the development of the Democrats’ budget bill, which became the Inflation Reduction Act in 2021 and 2022, assessed also the impacts of federal regulations that were completed over time by the Biden administration before the end of Biden’s term. And now, of course, we’re looking at what happens if and when the Trump administration and the congressional Republicans start to dismantle that existing policy framework that was established as of the end of last year.

Meyer: So I think maybe the best place to start is the way this works, right? The way that modeling like this works is you look at a number of scenarios, look at a number of assessments of what could happen. And I want to get into those assessments in a second. But first I want to ask, on the whole, we may not know exactly what House Republicans are going to do and what Republicans in Congress are going to do especially, but, like, when you look at the set of possibilities encapsulated by the Republican bill, what does this mean for the energy system and for the climate? Is it good?

Jenkins: Uh, no, it is not good. And I wish I had some silver linings to pull out here, but they are non-existent — or few and far between, if there are any we can find. Dismantling the current policy trajectory would result in a substantial increase in greenhouse gas emissions, on the order of half a gigaton, 500 million tons, by 2030, rising to over a billion metric tons, or a gigaton by 2035.

And at the same time it would, of course, slow the energy transition. So less deployment of clean electricity technologies, a slower uptake of electric vehicles, and other impacts across the economy. And all that also translates to higher energy costs for Americans, for households, for businesses as we do two things. One is we remove tax credits and subsidies that are currently lowering the cost of investing in all of this new infrastructure, whether it’s new power generation or storage or new vehicles for fleets or households.

So those subsidies shift some costs out of household and business budgets right onto the federal tax code. And by slowing down measures like energy efficiency, electrification, EVs, measures that reduce fossil energy consumption, we’re also likely to see fossil fuel prices go up as demand rises. So relative to a world where we’re reducing demand for these fuels, if we slow down that process and we consume more fossil fuels overall, that’s also going to translate through the law of supply and demand into higher costs for Americans.

So that’s, I think, the top line: Higher emissions, slow down — although not halt — the energy transition, and higher energy costs for most Americans and for our businesses around the country. It’s not quite our frozen policy scenario from the beginning of January, 2021. But not surprisingly, a scenario where we dismantle the entirety of the Biden-era policy apparatus does revert us pretty close to where we would be if those laws had not passed. Not entirely. There’s some momentum that will continue. But a full repeal scenario, which is maybe where the House is trending, would mean that we’re going to see half-a-gigaton-scale increase in emissions from our current trajectory in 2030, and about a gigaton or more in 2035.

Meyer: I realize that there’s a tendency for numbers, especially gigatons, these numbers attached to giant units, to slide by and kind of be like, Oh, that’s a number. But that is staggering. U.S. energy emissions are about five gigatons. I think global energy emissions are 38 gigatons …

Jenkins: Yeah, close to 40. Exactly.

Meyer: This is a sizable increase compared to baseline in carbon emissions.

Jenkins: I mean, yeah, it is huge. It leaves us pretty comparable to current emissions levels in 2035, if we see a full repeal of all of the regulations and tax credits and spending that are on the books now. Emissions actually go up in the near term as demand growth per electricity exceeds our ability to add new renewables in a repeal scenario. And so there’s an increase in the near term in emissions that actually takes us back towards 2022 levels, and then a slow decline at a similar trajectory that we saw really in the pre-Inflation Reduction Act, which is less than 1% per year decline in U.S. emissions.

In contrast, if we stayed on the current policy trajectory, we would close about half of the distance between that benchmark, the repeal scenario, and where we would want to be if we’re on track to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, which would be even deeper reductions than we’re currently on track for. So if you’re concerned about climate change, we should be accelerating, not decelerating, the transition, and this bill is slamming on the brakes.

Meyer: So you’ve referenced a few times, the way that you conduct this study, right, is you look at a number of scenarios. And so can you give us a sense, what scenarios did you look at to try to just begin to get a handle on what these different policies could do? And based off the text that’s out there, the Republican proposal that’s out there, which scenario are we closest to?

Jenkins: Yeah. So we have a continued policy scenario that assumes continuation of the full suite of policies in place at the beginning of January, 2025, legislative and executive. So the full suite of measures implemented by the Biden administration and the Democratic Congress through the infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Then we have an executive-repeal-only scenario, and so that scenario contemplates the Trump administration repealing all of the EPA greenhouse gas emissions regulations — that’s on power, on transportation, and on oil and gas methane pollution, as well as DOE efficiency standards and Department of Transportation fuel economy standards, and rescinding all unspent grant funding at the executive agencies.

And of course, we’ve seen those types of actions already from the Trump administration. They’ve not completed the rescission of those rules because it takes a bit of time to work through the administrative process of repealing existing regulation, but they have made very clear their intention to roll back all of those regulatory policies as soon as they’re able to. And they, as we’ve talked about in the past on the show, are going far beyond what we expected in terms of trying to block spending of not just unobligated funds that hadn’t been awarded to recipients yet, but even grant funding that’s going out to recipients under existing contracts. They’re also doing everything they can to roll that money back. So I’d say that scenario is our current path. We’re on the executive-repeal-only scenario.

And then the remaining question is, what happens in the legislature? What happens in the House and Senate as they craft this budget bill — that was our subject last week — that may, or is likely to, further repeal incentives for clean electricity, for electric vehicles, for energy efficiency, for nuclear power, for hydrogen, et cetera. All of the measures on the tax code to support the energy transition and support the development of a cleaner energy infrastructure — all those could be repealed as well.

And so we also have a full repeal scenario, which would basically include the end of all tax credits established by the IRA at the end of this calendar year. So beginning, you know, January 1, 2026 — no more credits. And unfortunately, it looks like that might be the direction we’re trending in the House bill, as well.

Meyer: That feels like the one we’re moving close to.

Jenkins: Yeah, so we didn’t model exactly every piece of detail in the House bill. We haven’t done that yet. We will, once the House passes something final. If it’s necessary, it may look exactly like the repeal scenario. We’ll see. We saw in the draft we discussed last week that there were a few credits that had a few more years of life in them, but the details are important. The clean electricity tax credits, for example, under the House Ways and Means Committee bill that passed out of committee on Sunday, does allow a few more years of deployment of carbon-free electricity technologies through 2028. If they’re placed in service by 2028, they could still claim the clean electricity tax credit, so that is a little bit better than the full repeal scenario we look at.

But we’ve also heard from Representative Chip Roy, who led efforts to block the budget committee vote over the weekend, that in order to extract further reductions in spending, that we can expect further reductions in the subsidies for clean electricity, thanks to his and his conservative budget hawk caucus efforts to further constrain spending in the House bill.

Meyer: Yeah,and I was going to say, I don’t want to delve into … There’s a lot of tea leaf reading you can do right now, especially around the gap between what House Freedom Caucus members say that they want out of this bill and what House IRA Caucus folks say they want out of this bill. And the gap has only grown. Especially the gap between that and then what senators say they will accept, all of which has contributed to a very confusing information environment.

Jenkins: Bottom line, full repeal is awfully darn close to what the House is trying to do.

Meyer: Exactly. I think we’re so much closer to a full repeal than people would have been willing to bet earlier this year.

Jenkins: Yeah, it’s a lot worse than I expected it to be, because I of course, posited that the economic constituencies out there that are benefiting from these current policies would be more effective at mounting an opposition. And at least at this point in the House side, that doesn’t seem to be the case. You know, just contrast the way that the budget hawks were willing to basically say, “We’re going to hold this bill hostage if we don’t get our way.”

Well, look, they got their way, whereas the House Republicans who have spoken up in the past in public in support of a more tapered or surgical approach to amending the clean electricity credits and others. You know, they wrote a nice letter to the Speaker saying, “Pretty please. We’d like you to do this, if you don’t mind.” But when push comes to shove, none of them seem to be willing to stand up and demand the changes they want to see.

It would only take four of them, or six of them, right? Only take a small cadre of that 21 to be willing to say, “Look, this is really bad for my constituents, and I don’t want to see it. Can we strip this stuff out and work on a bill that we can all support?” But they’re not willing to go to bat at that level, given the challenging politics they face within their own party and the backlash they’re likely to face from President Trump and whatever else that’s just keeping them afraid to actually stick their necks out here.

Meyer: Let’s get into some of the sector-by-sector findings. I think the biggest one, in terms of where we see the biggest emission cuts from the Inflation Reduction Act, is in the power sector. It’s where we have these big, powerful, tech-neutral tax credits that in the law as written and in the law as enacted, are meant to stay on the books for a really long time. They’re meant to stay on the books basically until we decarbonize the power sector, and certainly for decades. That changes in the House Republican proposal — under the best version of the proposal that we have right now, there are rumored worse versions out there, but in the version of the text we have, these tax credits start phasing out in 2029 and they’re gone entirely by the early 2030s.

In your assessment, what does it do to the emissions impact of the electricity sector? And then what does it do in terms of even just what kind of resources are generating electricity for us?

Jenkins: Yeah. So there’s two really big wedges that we see in our modeling scenarios that are differences from repeal efforts. The first is the executive action to repeal the EPA power plant regulations, which have no impact through 2030 because they have very little impact in the early years, because they don’t come into effect until the early 2030s. But by 2035, they have a substantial impact on the power sector, effectively eliminating coal from the portfolio, and further constraining the role of natural gas — although in some weird ways, that actually drive more gas capacity on the grid, even though the power plants are used less because of restrictions on how often the new capacity can run.

That is a big factor. In 2035, that’s the biggest single policy change probably we see in terms of moving the emissions needle, is repeal of the 111(d) standards. Those increase emissions in 2035 by just shy of half a gigaton. But then it all compounds with the repeal of the clean electricity or tech-neutral tax credits, which add another 300 or so million metric tons of emissions by 2035, with a growing impact from 2028 on. So it does start to bite even in 2030 with about 100 million tons more emissions then — this is all round numbers — but growing to something like 300 million tons, even on top of the EPA repeal. So those two together are the biggest chunk of the emissions increase, but there are some other substantial ones in the mix as well.

Meyer: You mentioned this earlier, but I thought one of the most interesting findings in your report was that in almost any scenario, emissions from the power sector actually, and emissions across the economy, increase slightly over the next few years. And I think that’s all driven by stuff in the power sector. Why is that happening, number one? And number two, what happens — let’s say just between now and 2028, or between now and 2030 — in the power sector, in these different scenarios?

Jenkins: So in the near term, we basically, and this is the longer term story indeed, is that we are, we have a race in the power sector between growing demand for electricity and growing shares of clean electricity. If you look at what’s getting built in the United States, it is mostly wind, solar, and batteries. That’s the vast majority of the capacity that’s come online over the last couple of years, and it’s also the vast majority of what is expected to come online over the next couple of years. But because of, particularly, delays and challenges in interconnecting wind power, we’re seeing deployment rates for wind really lag quite substantially. Even the record rates that we’ve seen in the U.S. in the past, where we built about 15 gigawatts of wind per year in 2020, 2021.

Right now we’re running at seven or eight gigawatts a year of deployment, and under continued policies, we expect that to accelerate back towards and beyond that record rate over time. But it’s constrained by our ability to interconnect wind resources to the grid, to get them permitted, to expand transmission into the areas where we need to tap the best wind resources. And in a full repeal scenario, that pace just never hits the accelerator. So it continues to bump along at a few gigawatts per year.

Solar, under a current policy scenario, does grow quite substantially, continuing to set new record growth rates, as we’ve seen each year over the last several years. Solar is a lot easier to cite, faster to complete projects, less dependent on existing grid infrastructure or expansion of existing grid infrastructure to connect. And so we see in a continued policies case that eventually that pace of growth from solar and wind outpaces the increase in demand for electricity. But it doesn’t do so in the full repeal scenario. We do still see a bit more wind and solar built in 2025, 2026, but then the pace collapses, and the growth of demand swamps the additions of new supply.

And so what that means is the power sector leans more in the near term on coal, existing coal fired power plants, than we would otherwise see. And, of course, coal is highly emissions-intensive, and so not even, not very large changes in the amount of coal in the energy mix have a huge impact on our total emissions.

Meyer: Did you see this study that came out over the weekend that was like, recessions, which have previously been thought to have this big public mortality effect, now seem to be life expectancy-improving on the margin, entirely accounted for by the air pollution effects?

Jenkins: I didn’t see that!

Meyer: Fewer people drive and there’s less power use during recessions, and that makes air pollution go down, and that means actually people live longer, even though there’s a lot of public health impacts from the economic effects of recessions, which are unemployment and underemployment.

Jenkins: I mean, I think as Americans, we just routinely underestimate the continued mortality and morbidity impacts, public health impacts, of air pollution in the country. Yes, it’s gotten way better than it was in the past, thanks to regulations like the ones the Trump administration is currently trying to undo. But it’s still bad, particularly in the most heavily populated parts of the country, whether that’s Southern California or where I live here in New Jersey. So yeah, where you got a lot of people driving around and burning power, turns out to be not so good for our health, and there’s a lot more progress we could make on that front if we could accelerate the growth of clean electricity.

Meyer: So one argument that I’ve heard from more IRA-skeptical folks is that if we’re building so much solar and batteries especially, if wind and solar and batteries are the easiest technologies to add to the grid right now, why should we be spending money to subsidize them, given that they seem to be winning on their own as is? Why is that important, either from an economic standpoint, and also, why is it a good use of public funds?

Jenkins: Yeah, it’s a great question. And I should be clear, we do see continued deployment of wind and solar, even in a policy repeal scenario, and storage as well, just at a much slower pace. There are parts of the country where wind and solar are subsidy-independent, where they can just beat out natural gas plants and existing coal on the margins, on economics alone. But that is a restricted portion of the country, and if we want to be able to deploy these American energy resources broadly, all across the country, then we need to do something to value the contributions they’re making to the country. That includes clean air, that includes emissions reductions, that includes lower energy costs, and our ability to keep up with rapid demand growth. It includes economic benefits in a wide range of districts, from employment and local tax revenue and spending.

We have historically subsidized lots of energy technologies. We continue to offer long term subsidies for oil and gas production, lower per unit rates than we provide for wind and solar, but large in aggregate. The question is, do you want to taper these things out over time? That could make sense, but ending them precipitously, especially after they were just extended, it’s a whipsaw kind of effect, right? Any large changes in policy are bad for business, because it means projects that looked like they were going to move forward because of the current policy environment — thought they had visibility to be completed, to get financing, to line up long lead time items, et cetera — are going to have the rug pulled out from them.

So this is where this kind of discussion about where exactly the House and/or Senate bills land in terms of phase-out of these credits, I think is really important. Maybe they don’t need to run ’till 2040 but if you don’t, if you sunset them very rapidly — say by the end of this year — then there’s lots of projects that are already pretty well under development that will no longer be able to claim those credits and may no longer be financially solvent. That creates stranded costs on costs, and projects that get scrapped, companies that go bankrupt, lay people off, et cetera. And so the smoother way to do that would be to have some longer-term runway in which projects can commence construction and lock in the kind of tax credit that they’re eligible for, and move to completion, even as you step down the level over time. That’s where I thought they were headed, but it looks like they may be headed in the opposite direction under the current House discussion.

Meyer: Let’s finish up with a few more sectors. So in transportation, it looks like your results for all scenarios, there’s a reduction in emissions, but the size of that reduction changes a lot based on which policies we happen to follow. What stuck out to you there?

Jenkins: Yeah, that’s right, and we should remember that U.S. transportation emissions peaked a long time ago, and they have been falling since, I think, around 2006, which is when U.S. emissions as a whole peaked, actually. And that’s because of an increase in fuel efficiency over time, right? That increase in energy efficiency in the transportation sector has been enough to offset the growth in vehicle-miles-traveled that we’re seeing across both personal vehicles and freight on private vehicles.

That trend continues under current policies, we see continued growth of hybrid electric vehicles, for example, which are on quite a tear lately, as increasing their market share. And we see continued growth of electric vehicles, because they are still attractive vehicles for many consumers out there across the country, and increasingly more so as their costs fall. But just like in the power sector, that pace drops dramatically, and so we basically see about a 40% reduction in annual sales of electric vehicles by 2030. Cumulatively between now and 2030, it’s something like 8 million less electric vehicles on the roads of the United States, and that does have a measurable impact on total gasoline consumption and therefore emissions and energy costs.

It’s, in some ways, it’s sort of wild. It’s kind of a backdoor gas tax. You know, if you remove these incentives to improve the efficiency of the U.S. fleet and to electrify the U.S. fleet and shift away from gasoline and diesel fuel, you’re going to see a much higher demand for gasoline and diesel, and higher demand translates to higher prices at the pump. You wouldn’t see House Republicans caught dead voting for a gas tax, right? But actually, by removing these subsidies for electric vehicles, that’s effectively what they’re doing to everybody else. By increasing the total consumption of gasoline quite substantially, we’re going to be paying higher prices at the pump across the country.

Meyer: In a world where we’re selling 8 million fewer EVs, what does that do to the EV factories and battery factories and critical mineral supply chains that are being supposedly built all around the country at this moment? And that also supposedly at least on the critical mineral side, the Trump administration is quite keen to expand?

Jenkins: It’s decimating for that whole effort to build out a U.S. battery supply chain. I mean, we are seeing right now a huge amount of investment in projects that are not yet complete to manufacture batteries, to build battery components, upstream projects like mines and processing of critical minerals and components for batteries and, of course, final vehicle assembly. We find that if we look upstream, the current pipeline of both electric vehicle assembly and battery manufacturing capacity is pretty on track to meet where demand would be if we didn’t repeal these scenarios, these policies.

Meyer: So we’ve invested for a non-repeal.

Jenkins: Yeah, the market was anticipating a continuation of policies. It started developing manufacturing plants and making investments and planning investments in accordance to that. If we repeal the tax credits for EVs immediately, or by 2030 even, what we’re doing is making those vehicles more expensive. That means they’re going to sell less of them. If they sell less of them, they of course need to manufacture and assemble less vehicles. And then that permeates all the way up the supply chain, which means less demand for vehicles, for batteries and for critical minerals and for components as well.

And so what we find is that if we do see that contraction in demand for electric vehicles, about 40%, even if the U.S. maintains the same market share as it does today, in terms of assembly of cells and vehicles, that would basically render most all of the planned capacity additions in vehicle assembly redundant. We have enough already under construction, with a couple more, that we would not need any additional capacity. It’s even worse on the battery side, we would have more than enough capacity from projects that are complete by the end of this year to meet the expected demand in that scenario.

And there’s reason to believe that that market share, that U.S. market share, won’t remain the same. It’s likely to fall as well, because the 30D tax credit, that’s the personal vehicle tax credit, is part of an overall strategy to basically onshore and friendshore this supply chain. And so it has a set of requirements that to get the full vehicle subsidy, you have to source, you have to assemble the vehicle in North America, you have to source battery components and assemble those in North America, and the materials that go into them have to come from North America or from our former Free Trade Agreement partners.

So that was sort of the demand side pull that was driving a lot of incentives to produce these in the U.S. There’s also a direct subsidy, 45X, that’s also on the chopping block in the House bill, that was directly subsidizing battery manufacturing in the U.S. And those two together have driven the battery boom that we’re seeing right now, which, by the way, is massive in Georgia and North Carolina and South Carolina and Tennessee and Kentucky and a number of other Republican states.

If you remove either one of those, the supply-side push from 45X, the advanced manufacturing subsidy, or this sort of demand pull that you get from 30D, it’s likely that U.S. market share would fall. And in that case, we’re going to see not only all currently unfinished projects be redundant, likely scrapped, but we’re also going to see, we would have a large amount of over-capacity already operating, and that means that factories would be idled or have to be repurposed to build internal combustion cars. Investments that were just made in new product lines and new assembly lines and robotics and everything else would be wasted. It would really be quite disastrous for the battery boom.

So yeah, I guess I should have put that in my top-line. In addition to increasing energy costs and emissions, it will decimate the U.S. battery manufacturing sector, which is just starting to explode across the country, in mostly Republican districts.

Meyer: How sensitive are your models to oil prices? Because I think one thing we’ve seen in other models is like, well, there’s actually a lot of year-to-year variation in what emissions do based on how high fuel prices get. Like, when you look at your scenarios, is there a way that, say, maybe the parts of the IRA stay on the books, but fuel gets cheaper? Or parts of the IRA go off the books, but fuel gets really expensive? What’s the relationship between fuel prices and emissions in your model?

Jenkins: No, that’s a great question. I should say that’s an area where our particular suite of models is not the strongest. That’s one of our limitations, is that we don’t include a general equilibrium market effect for fuel prices as a function of demand. And so when we calculate, for example, the increase in energy expenditures that we see under repeal, that doesn’t account for a further increase you would see from increased gasoline prices and natural gas prices.

So that is something that the Rhodium Group, who uses the NEMS model — that’s the same model that the U.S. Energy Information Administration uses — and is much better designed to capture these oil and gas supply chain dynamics, I’d say much less well designed to capture electricity sector transition dynamics, which is why we don’t use it. But it is good, in particular at this, which is capturing oil and gas supply chain impacts. What they find is that under a full repeal scenario, by 2035, it would amount to a 1% to 5% increase in retail motor gasoline prices across the country. So that’s like a $0.05 to $0.15 per gallon increase in the cost of gasoline. So it’s like a gas tax of $0.05 to $0.15, right? You get pollution and less exports of oil. Yeah, not great.

And I can’t imagine Chip Roy, again, or his friends voting for a $0.15 gas tax, but that’s effectively what it would do. We would also see an increase in the cost of natural gas by about 2% to 7% in their estimates that natural gas cost drives up the cost of industrial energy expenditures by on the order of $10 billion per year. So it’s making our businesses less competitive, our industries in the global landscape. It would increase industrial electricity rates by 7% to 12% in 2035 and of course, it would also increase our household costs as well. Our estimates from REPEAT Project, even without accounting for that bump in prices, just the fact that we’re shifting costs off of the tax base and back onto household energy budgets, and that we’re going to see more consumption of fuel overall because of less EVs and less heat pumps and less energy efficiency, et cetera, we estimate that total annual expenditures on energy across the U.S. go up by $25 billion In 2030 and by over $50 billion in 2035.

So you’re right, though, to point out that while there is this increase in household costs and reduced competitiveness of American industries and higher cost of gasoline, all that might have a countervailing impact on emissions. That means, all else equal, just considering that change alone, EVs are slightly more attractive when gasoline costs 15 cents more, I just don’t think that’s likely to be as salient to consumers as losing a $7,500 tax credit, which drops the cost of a new vehicle by 25%, or drops the cost of a lease almost in half, because of the way that the tax credits enter into leases.

Meyer: Totally. Though I do feel like one thing we still really don’t understand in the current car and oil market together as linked, is how much if we were to see a 2007 or 2006 oil price surge, which doesn’t seem to be in the cards at this particular moment, but I guess could be if enough supply got lost, and whatever. How much there’s, like, now a ceiling on oil, because consumers can just be like, “Well, screw OPEC, you know, I’m gonna go buy an EV!”

Jenkins: Yeah, that’s true, although it is a slow impact on total consumption, because vehicle turnover is small, like, we only sell, what, 15 million vehicles a year, and we have a fleet of 300 million. And so it does take time for these impacts to mount. That’s why we don’t see any substantial impacts on energy prices in, say, 2026 or 2027, it mounts over time as those 8 million additional EVs that would otherwise have been on the road by 2035 are not there, or by 2030 are not there. So it’s these cumulative impacts over time that will help constrain energy costs.

For an individual household, you can opt out of oil whenever you want. That’s good. So you know, if oil prices go up and you want to say, “I’m done paying at the pump, I’m going to go buy an EV,” that helps you. But in terms of the overall economy, it’s not as quick a transition as we’d like, which is why having long term policy certainty and driving this transition over time would probably be a good idea.

We talked about this a bit with Ellen Hughes-Cromwick when she was on to talk about the impacts of tariffs on the automotive sector. She’s the former chief economist at Ford Motor Company and a Department of Commerce official. She noted that the future of the automotive sector is electric, whether you like it or not. Whether you’re MAGA or not! And the reason we can say that with confidence is that you already look in the U.S. market at what’s growing in terms of vehicle segments, and what’s shrinking. What’s shrinking is conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, and what’s growing are hybrids, plug-in hybrids and EVs.

Beyond that, if the future of automotive is autonomous vehicles, which anybody who’s ridden a Waymo in San Francisco recently, of which Rob and I are both part — we should have an episode on this. So there’s a reason that all of those Waymos are running on Jaguar EVs, not because they’re Jaguars, but because they’re EVs. You can’t have the kind of sensors and compute power that you need onboard a fully autonomous vehicle without an electric vehicle platform.

There’s a reason that Ford launched its BlueCruise, hands-off, hands-free driving that I have in my Mustang Mach-E, for the Mustang Mach-E, in the Ford F-150 Lightning first, because they have the power onboard to power these devices. So if you think long-term about the future of the sector, and you think the two big growth trends globally, right, are electrification and autonomous vehicles, and that those two go hand in hand, because even if you don’t care about the electrification part from an emissions perspective, or oil reduction, or whatever, you just like the autonomous vehicle part, you need electric vehicles.

And you start to see why the current industrial policy that we have in place to support this transition for our automakers is so important to their future. You rip all that away, and we could very well be left with a set of failing automakers who are able to produce large SUVs and trucks that run on internal combustion engines the way they always have, and therefore have a shrinking share of a North America or U.S.-only market at their disposal, having seeded all of the growth markets around the world and their ability to keep up in autonomous vehicles. And that’s just, like, disastrous right? To see that kind of outcome.

So I just, what I hate about this whole debate is how it’s all about “owning the libs,” right, and unwinding any of Biden’s achievements, right? And all that ends up doing is seeding all of these industries to others. You want to own the libs? Great, well, now we just lost nuclear power, we lost EVs, we lost autonomous vehicles, and we’ll probably lose AI too, because we can’t keep up with the demand growth.

Meyer: Well, but it’s incoherent. I mean, this is what’s kind of flummoxing me, is that the day one Donald Trump executive order declared the lack of energy resources in the country, specifically the lack of electricity, but also the lack of critical mineral capacity, to be national emergencies. And we see a huge focus from the Trump administration, at least so far, in trying to shore up critical mineral resources. Now, has that been unified with their trade policy? No, not at all. But they talk about the importance of critical minerals, and how improving and increasing critical mineral extraction and refining is so crucial to the long-term wellbeing of the country.

There’s three industries that produce downstream demand for critical minerals, right? They’re EVs, they’re wind turbines — because you need the magnets for rare earths in the wind turbines — and they’re electronics, consumer electronics. Well, they’re destroying the EV industry. They’re really obliterating the wind industry. They want nothing to do with the wind industry. One thing we see in the House Ways and Means proposal is that they phase out the subsidies for producing wind equipment way earlier than they phase out anything else.

Jenkins: Right, almost immediately.

Meyer: Almost immediately! And then there is basically no serious interest in developing a downstream consumer electronics market. I mean, we have the CHIPS Act, right, but there’s no—

Jenkins: Well, the tariffs! The tariffs are going to bring it all back, Rob.

Meyer: We’ve already relented on tariffs. And even with the tariffs set at 164%, even then, it seemed like we were unlikely to fully decouple from the Chinese electronic manufacturing industry. And also, by the way, you produce a rival to the Chinese electronic manufacturing industry. Number one, it would be unlikely to happen here. But number two, if you wanted to do it here, you pursue a set of policies meant to create an American Shenzhen in like Houston or something. You wouldn’t do it through tariffs and minerals — it’s a bizarre way to do it. Anyway, and you’d need more workers, but not gonna get into that.

So it’s just this bizarre, incoherent policy, right, of like, “We want critical minerals. We need critical minerals. Biden was failing the country by ignoring critical minerals,” while destroying any place where demand for those minerals would come from in the economy, which means there’s no economic impetus to produce them in the first place! But anyway, I repeat myself. There’s one more place I want to talk about, which is when you look at the, in your modeling about what IRA repeal would look like, it looks like a lot of the emissions impacts are coming from, let’s say, like a category that’s neither power nor transportation. It’s buildings, but it’s also kind of a wild card.

It seems like a huge amount of emissions increases, or at least a lack of emissions reductions, comes from the non-CO2 greenhouse gas category. So like, what’s driving the rest of the increase or lack of decrease that we’re seeing here?

Jenkins: Yeah, that big shift is from the repeal of the EPA methane regulations on oil and gas. This was a huge low-hanging fruit for cost effective emissions reductions. Methane, as I’m sure most of our listeners know, is a very potent greenhouse gas. It causes a lot more warming, pound for pound, than CO2, even though it lives in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time, so it has a more immediate impact on temperatures. But you know—

Meyer: Most of the warming we’re seeing right now is from methane, I believe.

Jenkins: Right, because of its immediate impact, exactly. And so we leak a lot of methane from across the oil and gas supply chain, a lot more than we need to, using best practices and cost-effective techniques that are already available to the industry. The large players in the oil and gas industry supported the EPA methane regulations and the fee that the Inflation Reduction Act established on methane pollution from the oil and gas sector. So there’s this one-two combo of a fee on, or really a carbon fee, a methane fee on emissions in the oil and gas supply chain, and a set of regulations that would require their reductions. There were some grant funding as well for those who wanted to access it to tackle emissions. So the major players in the sector were perfectly happy with this. They saw it as very cost-effective. When you avoid leaking methane, you have more methane, a.k.a. natural gas, to sell to the market. So it’s very cost-effective and very achievable. And again, just because it happened under Biden and regulation equals bad under any context, they’re moving to repeal both the methane fee and the EPA regulations. Ballpark, that leads to an increase of about 100 million metric tons of emissions of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in 2030 and about 70 million tons in 2035.

So that’s a big chunk, right? 100 million tons is, you know, in a 5000 ton, or 5 billion ton total, is a lot. There are also impacts in industry and residential sectors from reduced energy efficiency and in industry from reductions in carbon capture and hydrogen deployment, which would just again be totally decimated by these repeals. It’s unlikely we’d see any deployment in those sectors if those credits phase out soon.

Meyer: One thing that’s interesting to me about your results is that electricity demand under your modeling, if I’m reading the charts right, and at the time I’m reading this, there’s no report yet. There’s only the charts. And so—

Jenkins: Your graph comprehension skills are being put to the test.

Meyer: I know, exactly. One thing that stuck out to me is that in the scenario where the IRA stays on the books, in 2035, electricity demand is higher than it would be if repeal happens, but electricity costs are lower. And that’s because the IRA works to both increase demand for electricity via electrification of home appliances and electrification of transportation, while at the same time working to get more electricity supply on the market via the tech-neutral tax credits, winds and solar, batteries, et cetera, et cetera.

And so in 2035, in a world where you repeal the IRA, there’s this kind of counterintuitive combination of the U.S. power grid is both smaller, it’s delivering less electricity, and—

Jenkins: It’s bigger than it is today.

Meyer: It’s smaller than it is in the counterfactual, and electricity is also more expensive. It’s a real testament, I think, to the importance of policy that works to increase supply as much as possible in order to lower costs across the economy, which is what the IRA does.

Jenkins: Yeah. I mean, we are sitting here at this moment where we’re coming out of a period of flat demand for electricity, right? It’s been basically stagnant since 2005. Into a period of accelerating growth. In our scenario, or scenarios, including even the repeal side, we’re seeing demand growing at a sustained rate of over 2.5% per year, and under current policies, it could be as high as 3.7% per year. We haven’t seen rates like that since the 1970s or 60s. That’s enough to grow electricity demand anywhere from about a third to half again, current levels by 2035. So the growth is coming, and it’s coming whether or not the IRA credits persist.

What the current policy environment is trying to do, as you said, is to try to rapidly expand our supply of electricity. And the fastest way to do that, the best way to do that under current environments, is with wind, solar and batteries. They’re, you know, again, 98% of what is in the queue, or what’s been built recently. We will add some new gas capacity, I’m sure, to keep up with some of that demand growth. But as your reporting has shown, Rob, there’s just a limit to the amount of new gas turbines that the OEMs are willing to build, and it is not at all sufficient to keep up with demand growth.

So in a world where we do anything to impede the growth of renewables and storage, which is exactly what completely blowing up the current tax credit environment would do, we’re going to simply see demand growth start to outstrip supply increases. And anytime that happens, energy costs go up along with emissions, because we’re going to be reliant. The only slack we have then in the system is to lean into existing power plants that are underutilized. That mostly means coal-fired power plants that are currently not being used much and will ramp back up to fill the slack. So, higher emissions, higher prices for everyone, and less ability to power data center demand growth and everything else that’s coming.

Meyer: One thing that sticks out to me is that in 2022 when the IRA was passed, and you can correct me here, but my memory is that we didn’t foresee this bulge in electricity demand growth coming.

Jenkins: Well, we didn’t foresee the data center part of the story, which is big. I mean, we’ve successively updated our REPEAT analyses over the last couple of years to try to factor in the latest estimates, which, of course, have a nice error bar around them as well, of data center demand growth. We did have a large growth in electricity demand just due to electrification already, when we were modeling the IRA’s impacts in 2022. But since 2022 what we’ve seen is an accelerated growth in manufacturing. A lot of the Battery Belt stuff we talked about, right? All those are tens of megawatt-scale electricity consumers for the most part. And we now have all these tens to hundreds of megawatts, even gigawatt-scale data centers, popping up across the country.

So that adds in another one percentage point a year, or something like that, of growth on top of what was already a 2% to 3% per year story, just from electrification. And just to put things into scale, it is important to note that while data centers are big, our estimates on the order of 250 to 400 terawatt hours, or billion kilowatt hours of additional consumption per year in 2030 and 2035, so 250 billion kilowatt hours in 2030, 400, say, in round numbers in 2035. Electric vehicle growth combined, both medium and heavy and light-duty vehicles, are likely to be 400 to 500 terawatt hours, or billion kilowatt hours in 2035. So on the same order of magnitude as data centers, and that’s including in the repeal scenario, right, where we see a slower but still real increase in the amount of electric vehicles on U.S. roads.

Meyer: Well, I guess this is my question, though, in some ways, the IRA seems very well-timed in retrospect. Sometimes you look back at a law and you’re like, you know, at the time that law was passed, the economy was already kind of, through some automatic process that we don’t really understand, like, dealing with the issue, or the global economy was reshuffling in a way that was becoming less of an issue. The IRA was the opposite of that. It was actually really well-timed and anticipated in a way that I don’t think even the bill authors realized necessarily at the time. The coming surge in electricity demand, especially from data centers. And so it was discussed as a climate bill and an economic development bill, but it has really become essential to the AI story. It’s in some ways a more important law now than it was when it was passed. And I think people might be overlooking that. I do wonder, you know—

Jenkins: I think they are overlooking that, and who needs to go in and tell them that right now and help them understand that, are all of the data center and AI companies. They know better than anybody that the ability to add new electricity supply and connect to the grid fast enough is part of the story of their ability to compete in a global race to develop and shape and ultimately control this next generation of technology.

Oh, look at China, where there is absolutely no constraint on their ability to add renewables at the pace needed, right? And if we are in an environment where we’re slowing down our pace of electricity demand growth, it will absolutely impede our competitiveness in the AI race. And I think that’s a message that policymakers on the Hill need to hear very quickly, or they’re about to make a very counterproductive intervention in the market.

Meyer: Yeah. I mean, I had one more question here, which is, let’s say there’s another bulk of data center activity, or, I don’t know, some other big new source of electricity demand that comes online in the 2030s, like this could all potentially be even worse, right? We’re modeling the technologies that we understand and the economic impulses that we understand, but the further this gets out in time, the more potential draws of energy there are, right, that we don’t even anticipate today.

Jenkins: Absolutely. It’s a good example of the limits of our crystal ball, right? Here’s this huge meta-trend that kind of snuck up on a lot of us, even those closely analyzing the power sector. I’m sure there were people anticipating this in 2021, 2022 but it was definitely not part of the conversation around these bills on the Hill. It was not the primary focus. Whereas today, it’s all about AI, right? Everybody’s talking about data centers everywhere I go.

Meyer: And then one last thing, which is, when we talk about electricity prices going up for consumers, I just want to draw out exactly why that would happen.

Jenkins: Yep.

Meyer: And make sure I understand correctly here what’s happening. Because electricity markets are unusual markets. They don’t work exactly like how people necessarily think. So, the idea here is that, if I’m a developer, the existence of these tax credits, or the fact that these tax credits are as potent as they are, I’m able to transfer them to other companies, maybe get 90 or 90 cents on the dollar of every tax credit I claim, as opposed to how it used to be, which was 80 to 85 cents on the dollar, right? That’s bringing, that’s allowing more projects to pencil out. And so I’m able to build that extra 10% of projects. There’s a number of projects, so to speak, that I can now build, that I didn’t used to be able to build, that didn’t make financial sense.

Jenkins: Yeah, a lot more than 10%. It’s probably more like 100% more projects, roughly, yeah.

Meyer: And so that means a lot more new capacity is coming onto the grid, and then it’s being dispatched in power auctions — largely, there’s some, obviously not in vertically integrated monopolies — but in most of the country, it’s being dispatched in power auctions, either when the sun is up and it has a zero marginal cost, or the batteries are activating when it makes sense economically. And that is through the existence of more supply on the market, and the greater amount of supply on the market that was brought onto the market by the existence of these tax credits lowering costs, which means that the cost effect of repealing the IRA actually grows over time, as we continue to lose the supply and the cheap electricity that would have once helped the economy. Is that all correct?

Jenkins: That’s exactly right. We estimate that average household energy costs would increase in 2030 by about $110 to $180 per household for the average household. But that grows to like $275 to $400 per year by 2035. And a big part of that is the increase in electricity price differences. There’s really three effects here, I think that are important to call out. One is the one you’re talking about, which is just more supply in the electricity sector means lower electricity costs, all else equal. And that’s a big lever, because it isn’t just a 10% increase in deployment. It’s more like a doubling of the amount of new wind and solar and batteries that we can bring onto the grid in a cost-effective manner.

The second issue is that there are subsidies here, which are basically transfers of cost out of your pocketbook as a household or a business and onto the federal tax code. Now, somebody’s got to pay for that cost eventually, maybe it’s going to the deficit. But the way the Inflation Reduction Act tried to pay for that was by increasing corporate minimum taxes, by expanding IRS enforcement, by reducing the cost of prescription drug purchases for Medicare, Medicaid, right? So it’s trying to raise revenues in a pretty progressive way, right? In a fair way, I would argue, to try to pay for these costs of subsidies that ended up lowering pocketbook expenses for all Americans, right, across the country. That’s the part of the name, the Inflation Reduction part of it was it was driving down costs, both through this supply effect and the direct transfer of subsidies.

And then the third effect is that a lot of what we’re talking about, whether it’s EVs or heat pumps or industrial efficiency, is substitution of upfront capital costs for reduced fuel use. Right? I’m paying more for a more efficient heat pump, or I’m paying more for an electric vehicle than an internal combustion car at the lot, or I’m paying more for an efficient boiler in my industrial process. All of that is upfront cost that then, over time, reduces the amount of fuel we consume across the economy. And that also, that reduction in demand, in addition to the supply on the power side also drives down consumption. And so when you roll that back, we see higher consumption of fossil fuels — gasoline, diesel, natural gas, coal — which is going to drive up their cost too.

So it’s really those three effects. It’s the increased supply. You’re slowing down the addition of supply in the power sector. You’re increasing consumption, in households and businesses and industry, of fossil fuels. And you’re removing taxpayer subsidies that are taking money out of household pockets, putting on the tax code. You’re reversing that, you’re putting them right back in your household pocketbook. So you have to spend more on your vehicle. You have to spend more to heat your home. You have to spend more to weatherize your house, whatever it is.

Meyer: Man.

Jenkins: So of those three effects, right — this is where it’s tricky when we talk about an average household impact because if you’re a recipient of those subsidies directly — like you bought an EV and you got a subsidy, right, whether a new or used one, or you’re a business that got the funding — that transfer goes directly to you on some of those purchases. And so there, it’s less about the average household. It’s more about households who adopt these technologies and benefit from that capital subsidy by reducing the cost of purchase versus those who don’t.

But if we’re talking about the other two effects, the effect of more electricity supply and less fuel consumption, those effects benefit everybody by lowering prices for all Americans, not just those who buy the EV, right? So there’s 8 million less EVs on the road. That means more expenses for the people who would have otherwise bought those 8 million EVs, but it also means 15 cents more at the gas pump for all Americans. And that adds up when you start to multiply that by 360 million people, or whatever it is.

Meyer: You know, it’s funny, Jesse, what I was going to say is that between this tax bill, which is just going to blow up the deficit even more than it’s already been, and the fact that rates are creeping higher, this recent debt downgrade of the U.S., and the fact that renewable energy benefits so much, either from, as you were saying, or electrification benefits either from these higher upfront costs that then get you lower energy costs over time, or from installing a solar project that has a high upfront cost and then zero marginal operating costs, you can see the return of deficit hawk Democratic politics on the horizon. You can see President Ossoff promoting his five years to a balanced budget. You know, 2028 to 2032, I don’t know. I just feel like it’s coming.

Jenkins: The deficit is not a trivial thing. It is an important challenge that needs to be addressed. The question is, how do we want to address that? Do we want to address that by repealing subsidies that are expanding electricity supply, helping power American industries and data centers, lowering costs for households and businesses, et cetera, lowering emissions, lowering air pollution. Or we could increase tax cuts or make permanent tax cuts for very wealthy people in corporations, either. One of those has a very small impact on the deficit, right, the total score that they’re saving from the IRA repeal is on the order of $500 billion over 10 years, whereas the total budgetary impact of making the tax cuts for corporations and individuals permanent is something like four and a half trillion dollars over 10 years. So you know, nine times bigger.

Meyer: From Climate Hawk to Deficit Hawk: The College Educated Millennial Story, coming soon, to Pelican Books. You heard it here first. Okay, we’re going to take a break, and then we’re going to come back with Upshift/Downshift right after this.

Every week. Jesse Jenkins, my co-host, and I like to find one piece of news that has really caught our attention and that is either making us feel more upbeat about the energy transition that week or more downbeat. Now, of course, as you might guess, if it’s making us feel more upbeat, it is an Upshift. If it’s making us feel more downbeat, it’s a Downshift. Jesse Jenkins, what do you have for us today?

Jenkins: Well, since we’ve been delivering a lot of Downshifts in our main segments here, I keep trying to look out for important Upshifts. And there’s not too many more important than what happens to greenhouse gas emissions in China, the world’s largest emitter. Back in December, we had Lauri Myllyvirta on to talk about the big structural shifts that might be happening in China’s economy that contribute to a potential peak in emissions years ahead of their schedule. The Chinese national goal is to have their emissions peak by 2030. It looks like it’s possible that over the last 12 months that peak has arrived, at least for now, we’ll see if it is sustained and if it can turn into a downturn.

But data is now out for the first quarter of 2025 that finds that China’s total CO2 emissions are down 1.6% year on year for that first quarter. And over the last 12 months, trailing through end of March, emissions are down by a full 1% relative to the previous 12 months. Back in December, I think when we recorded that episode, it aired early after the new year. We were still at this point where we weren’t quite sure, you know, are emissions going to be up or flat or down a little bit? It looks like they, in fact, are down. Couple major drivers there, the most important of which is just that power sector clean electricity additions are now fast enough to outpace demand growth, right?

It’s the same race that we were just talking about for the U.S., where the fate of the tech-neutral clean electricity tax credits will play a big role in which pulls ahead: demand or clean electricity. Historically, China’s been setting record growth rates for wind and solar, year after year, but it’s not been quite enough to keep up with their massive increases in electricity demand. Until now, where we’ve actually seen emissions from the power sector fall by somewhere on the order of 40 million tons per year — not a huge shift, but enough to drop total emissions down across the country and offset small increases in the other sectors, like chemicals and metallurgy, steel production, iron steel production, in particular.

This is exactly the kind of trend that we need to see for China to turn emissions around, is that the growth of clean electricity, wind and solar and nuclear and others, need to outpace their growth in electricity demand and other structural changes across the economy, like the slowdown in the construction sector, which also contributed, we saw a decline in cement related emissions over the last 12 months. Those are also helping contribute to declining emissions and are offsetting the growth in emissions in petrochemicals, plastic production, et cetera, and in metallurgy, iron and steel in particular.

Meyer: It’s so funny, because I think that big question of, “Is there going to be a major economy that sees clean energy supply exceed the growth in demand?” was actually, like, a major question last year. People asked that question about the United States. They asked about Europe. We’ve seen other economies achieve it, but there’s been this question of, does clean energy just ultimately add to supply, or does it start to bite into fossil supply over time? And for China, the milestone is just huge, arguably the biggest news event to happen so far this year, right?

Jenkins: It’s one of the most important shifts out there, so we’ll keep a close eye on it. But for now, it’s trending in the right direction, which is at least a bit of comfort given the way things are trending here at home. So Rob, what do you have for us this week?

Meyer: Well, I have a downshift for us. So last week, when we were going over the parts of the House Republican Ways and Means Committee proposal that effectively guts the IRA, we left one part not really discussed, and this was the foreign entities of concern clause. As folks who’ve been following the IRA for a long time will remember, there’s always been a foreign entities of concern clause attached to some parts of the IRA. It was attached specifically to the $7,500 tax credit for buying a personal EV. And the way that clause worked was basically that over time to qualify for this tax credit, automakers and battery makers had to raise the amount of non-Chinese source materials in their battery or car.

And this was meant to slowly encourage, slowly but confidently encourage battery part makers, critical mineral refiners, critical mineral mines, to shift or build new facilities outside of Chinese control. That it would gradually friendshore the EV supply chain. It was not instant. It was like, this is a long term impetus to build a parallel supply chain, because right now, China, or Chinese-controlled entities control some vast amount, I think, more than 80% of almost every supply chain that feeds into modern EVs. And if you’re an American policy maker, this would seem suboptimal.

The Republican proposal to reform or change or essentially gut the IRA, retains a foreign entity of concern clause, but it changes it so substantially that it’s almost not worth calling it by the same policy. So what this clause does, and the clause is attached to almost every tax credit in the IRA, including, I should add, to the carbon capture tax credit, to the personal EV tax credit, to the tech-neutral tax credit, every tax credit except to the biofuel, the ethanol tax credit—

Jenkins: As usual, ethanol gets its way.

Meyer: —Has a new foreign entity of concern clause, and what it says is that the tax credit cannot flow to a Chinese company. It can’t flow to a company that is majority or partially-controlled by someone with connections to China. And crucially, that it can’t — and this is where it really matters — that it can’t receive material support from a Chinese-linked entity. Now you may think that sounds very reasonable, right? We don’t want material support coming to these American energy projects. But what they mean by material support is material. Like, any kind of material.

Jenkins: Stuff. Cement or electrical wire or anything.

Meyer: The way the law is written, is that any part, in my reading and the reading of folks I’ve talked to, any part, any component, any piece of equipment, no matter how insubstantial, if it is found to be linked or come from China or was made by a Chinese-controlled company, automatically disqualifies the entire project from receiving the tax credit.

So what that means is that, let’s say you have some steel in a steel frame for solar panels that was made in a Chinese foundry — whole project loses qualification. Let’s say that there’s like a gram of graphite that, through the global market, has worked its way into your battery supply chain — whole vehicle loses qualification. Let’s say that there’s a little copper in a wire that you use to power a direct air capture product, and that copper has come from a Chinese mind somewhere — your whole project, again, loses the tax credit. So in effect, what this new clause does is it says, if there is any Chinese part, even if it’s one little bolt, and yes, the law is written to fully countenance the idea that it could be really, really insubstantial, one little bolt of Chinese source material in your project disqualifies it entirely from receiving a tax credit.

And the issue is that lots of parts that do not reflect, like, best-in-class technology, that are just kind of commodity parts on the market, intermingle in the global market. And right now there’s no way for energy developers or construction companies to know when they’re buying something that it comes from China or that it comes from Europe or that it comes from Southeast Asia. It’s totally unclear. You don’t really—

Jenkins: It’s impossible to verify this.

Meyer: Yeah, exactly. And so what this FEOC clause would mean is, number one, it would render many of these tax credits totally unworkable. And in fact, we’ve seen House Republican moderates already say that they need these, they want this particular clause to be changed in an eventual final version of the law. We’ll see if they succeed. But even Republican House moderates are saying this is totally unworkable. What the FEOC does is it basically, I think, kills these tax credits because—

Jenkins: It’s a poison pill.

Meyer: It’s a poison pill, and it’s meant to make, what’s going to have to happen is that the Treasury Department is going to have to go in and rewrite tax guidance for this new statutory text. And I would bet that by the time the Treasury Department finally gets around to writing that text, we’ll have hit the sunset deadlines for these tax credits, and these tax credits will have been effectively killed. And so you’ll hear sunset dates. You’ll hear, “Oh, House Republicans extended this date to 2028, it was supposed to be in 2033 and now companies can only claim until 2028 or 2029 or 2030.” And you might think, well, 2029 is an election away. Maybe there’ll be a different Congress by then, and they’ll repeal this law, and they’ll send the tax credits again. But what is actually going to happen is that between now and 2028, at least, the tax credit will not be, will not exist, it will not be usable, because the FEOC clauses are such a poison pill. Now, maybe they’ll change this. Maybe they’ll put in some safe harbor clauses, maybe some texts that they’ve put in there that ambiguously could be a safe harbor clause. Today they’ll clear it up so that it becomes clear if you’re using a Chinese-made bolt or a Chinese made washer that, like, you don’t lose tens of millions of dollars of tax credit support for your nuclear plant, for instance.

But as of today, my read of this clause is that it is a major, major poison pill, and that, to me, is a big old Downshift.

Jenkins: Yeah, I think it’s a huge downshift, Rob. Whether they resolve this to clarify that a few bolts or whatever don’t count or not, the simple idea of material assistance, materials of any sort, right, in your supply chain pushes this clause and the effort to sort of excise China so far back up the supply chain to the third tier of suppliers of whatever, that it will always be impossible to verify that, right? That you’re ever in compliance with that, because you would have to have provenance for every single part in the entire supply chain. And that’s just not feasible. This debate came up when the original FEOC rules were written. Where do we draw the line? How far up can we go to balance the legitimate interest in trying to build a China-resilient or China-independent supply chain and the need to actually make these tax credits usable and bankable?

And the reality is, if a project developer is going to the bank, right? Literally, a bank, to get debt finance for a project that they’re going to build 18 months from now, or 36 months from now, or whatever in the future. They don’t even know where all the parts are coming from yet when they’re going to the bank. And if the bankers have no confidence that you’re going to be able to demonstrate with 100% assurance your compliance with the tax credits, they will heavily, if not entirely, discount the value of those tax credits when figuring out your project economics. So they might say, “Well, there’s an upside scenario where you happen to qualify, and then our returns are great,” but they’re not going to loan on that scenario, right? They’re not going to factor it in. And if your project economics don’t work without the tax credit, they won’t loan to you. And so this is called bankability. If the tax credits are not bankable, which means they’re not certain at the time that you go in to finance a project. They’re just useless.

And that’s the key thing we have to watch out for, if there’s an opportunity to make any nuanced changes to the statute here is whatever they do, whatever the policy objective is, it needs to actually be usable, or it just amounts to a poison pill like you said.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTg2MTI1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDA5NDI5MH0.QKEQVpFhKz3ec12g71fN7OW88qvSnENz63BUPb0H_II/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-22 10:15:05.518277

It’s wrong and they know it — which is why they planned to pass it in the middle of the night.","The House passed a bill extending tax cuts, altering environmental subsidies, and changing Medicaid requirements.

It eliminates EV incentives and adds tax deductions for overtime pay, tips, and new car loan interest.

The bill faces Senate review and potential changes before reaching President Trump.

In an early morning vote, the U.S. House of Representatives passed sweeping legislation that extends and increases tax cuts, gets rid of many environmental subsidies and puts additional limits on Medicaid coverage for low-income adults.

The legislation isn't final: It still must be considered in the Senate, where there will likely be changes, and then any changes will have to be reconsidered in the House before being sent to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.

But if the result looks like that passed by a 215-214 margin in the House just before 7 a.m. on May 22, it will have significant effects in Michigan, including measures that:

Require able adults to prove they spent at least 80 hours a month working or attending education or training classes to maintain Medicaid coverage. More than 2.6 million Michigan residents are currently insured by the program.

Eliminate measures put in place by Congress under former President Joe Biden that are intended to encourage the production and sale of electric vehicles (EVs) by American automakers based in Michigan, including those subsidies to spur consumers to install EV chargers and save up to $7,500 on the cost of a new EV.

Add to tax cuts passed by Congress and signed by Trump in 2017 on individuals and businesses, which would be extended past their expiration at the end of the year, by adding new deductions on overtime pay (for individuals making less than $160,000 this year), on tips (for people in certain industries, like restaurants) and, of particular interest in Michigan, on interest of up to $10,000 a year on new car loans (for American-made personal vehicles). Those reductions would only be available over the next three years under the legislation as currently written, however.

The legislation also increases the amount of state and local taxes families can deduct from their income when reporting their taxes each year, increases the child care deduction by $500 to $2,500 for three years and adds a $4,000 deduction to the standard deduction for senior citizens for three years.

That's a small sample of what's included in what Trump has called his ""big, beautiful bill"" and which Republicans, who hold slim majorities in the House and Senate, hope to pass through a process known as reconciliation, which would allow them to approve budgetary measures without needing a 60-vote margin to overcome a filibuster threat in the Senate.

Democrats, meanwhile, have decried the hit the legislation promises to lower-income Americans, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimating it will have a much harsher impact on them while putting more money in the pockets of wealthier Americans. A nonpartisan Washington-based watchdog group, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, has also found it could add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit and more than $3 trillion to the nation's debt over the coming decade.

Trump has demanded passage of the bill, with the White House putting out a statement that it viewed any effort by Republicans to block the legislation — with some conservatives initially raising concerns about the costs — as the ""ultimate betrayal.""

Ultimately, only two Republicans voted against the bill, Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio. As with the rest of the House, the Michigan delegation voted along party lines to advance the legislation ahead of the Memorial Day recess, with the state's seven Republicans voting for it and six Democrats voting against.

That includes several members vying for higher office: U.S. Rep. John James, R-Shelby Township, who is running for governor, voted for the legislation. U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Birmingham, who is running for an open U.S. Senate seat, voted against it.

Republican members praised the legislation, with U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte, who represents a swing district in mid-Michigan, saying his constituents ""sent me to Congress to do the hard work necessary to lower the cost of living, secure our border, and unleash American energy. The legislation we passed today makes good on those promises and more."" He added that on the subject of Medicaid reforms, Democrats are trying to ""scare people into believing the sky is falling.""

U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Tipton, said, ""Today, House Republicans passed historic legislation which delivers on President Trump's mandate to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington ...The Senate must pass this bill to codify President Trump and the American people's full agenda.""

Democrats excoriated the legislation.

“Republicans need to stop lying,"" said U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit. ""They just voted for the largest cuts to Medicaid and food assistance (the legislation puts additional restrictions on eligibility under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, by limiting it to people in the country legally, among other measures) in the history of our country ... This budget makes $880 billion in cuts that will decimate Medicaid, nearly $300 billion in cuts to food assistance, but increases the Pentagon war machine by $150 billion.""

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, called it ""one of the most consequential bills the Congress has passed in this century.""

""It is going to rip health care away from almost 14 million people, make the biggest cuts to food assistance in history, and raise prices across the board,"" she said. ""People will die, children will go hungry, and working Americans will continue to struggle to make ends meet, all so Republicans can give another tax break to billionaires. It’s wrong and they know it — which is why they planned to pass it in the middle of the night. The fight isn’t over, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to defeat this cruel, dangerous bill.”

Meyer: And let’s start there. Hi, I’m Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap News.

Jenkins: And I’m Jesse Jenkins, a professor of Energy Systems Engineering at Princeton University.

Meyer: And you are listening to SHIFT KEY, Heatmap’s weekly podcast on decarbonization and the shift away from fossil fuels. On this week’s show, we are looking at what the House budget bill will mean for the energy transition, the U.S. energy economy, and the emissions profile. You know, last week, while we were recording SHIFT KEY, as you may have heard, House Ways and Means Committee released its first crack at the text for its big partisan reconciliation bill, the big piece of legislation that this Republican Congress wants to do that includes really taking a sledgehammer to a ton of parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. Since then, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted yes on that proposal. We are recording this on the afternoon of Monday, May 19th. Last night, the House Budget Committee also voted yes on the proposal.

So in the next few days, this House budget bill will move to the floor, and I should say we don’t know exactly what policies are going to be in it when it gets there, but today on this show, we want to give you some tools for thinking about what the options are — first of all, for the final bill. And second of all, what that will mean in the real world. What will that mean for the energy economy? And to do it, we have one of the best guests I can think of to help us do that, and that guest is my very own co-host, Jesse Jenkins.

So Jesse, as some of you may know, runs the REPEAT project at Princeton University, which does exactly this kind of rapid energy policy analysis that looks at what policies under consideration might mean for the energy economy. And he has, we have today, Jesse’s new and at the time we’re recording this, exclusive new findings on just the different set of options that could result from the House Republican bill, and that’s what we’re going to talk about today. So Jesse, welcome to SHIFT KEY.

Jenkins: It’s great to be back, Rob. So yeah, I’m excited and a bit terrified to share the results from this round of modeling from the REPEAT project, which, as Rob mentioned, we’ve been running since all the way back in 2021 as an effort to try to keep tabs on changes in federal energy and climate policy, and to use our energy system modeling tools to try to put a quantitative spin on what those changes might entail for the U.S. energy transition, for greenhouse gas emissions, for energy costs across the country, and those kinds of major salient points.

We did this, of course, all throughout the development of the Democrats’ budget bill, which became the Inflation Reduction Act in 2021 and 2022, assessed also the impacts of federal regulations that were completed over time by the Biden administration before the end of Biden’s term. And now, of course, we’re looking at what happens if and when the Trump administration and the congressional Republicans start to dismantle that existing policy framework that was established as of the end of last year.

Meyer: So I think maybe the best place to start is the way this works, right? The way that modeling like this works is you look at a number of scenarios, look at a number of assessments of what could happen. And I want to get into those assessments in a second. But first I want to ask, on the whole, we may not know exactly what House Republicans are going to do and what Republicans in Congress are going to do especially, but, like, when you look at the set of possibilities encapsulated by the Republican bill, what does this mean for the energy system and for the climate? Is it good?

Jenkins: Uh, no, it is not good. And I wish I had some silver linings to pull out here, but they are non-existent — or few and far between, if there are any we can find. Dismantling the current policy trajectory would result in a substantial increase in greenhouse gas emissions, on the order of half a gigaton, 500 million tons, by 2030, rising to over a billion metric tons, or a gigaton by 2035.

And at the same time it would, of course, slow the energy transition. So less deployment of clean electricity technologies, a slower uptake of electric vehicles, and other impacts across the economy. And all that also translates to higher energy costs for Americans, for households, for businesses as we do two things. One is we remove tax credits and subsidies that are currently lowering the cost of investing in all of this new infrastructure, whether it’s new power generation or storage or new vehicles for fleets or households.

So those subsidies shift some costs out of household and business budgets right onto the federal tax code. And by slowing down measures like energy efficiency, electrification, EVs, measures that reduce fossil energy consumption, we’re also likely to see fossil fuel prices go up as demand rises. So relative to a world where we’re reducing demand for these fuels, if we slow down that process and we consume more fossil fuels overall, that’s also going to translate through the law of supply and demand into higher costs for Americans.

So that’s, I think, the top line: Higher emissions, slow down — although not halt — the energy transition, and higher energy costs for most Americans and for our businesses around the country. It’s not quite our frozen policy scenario from the beginning of January, 2021. But not surprisingly, a scenario where we dismantle the entirety of the Biden-era policy apparatus does revert us pretty close to where we would be if those laws had not passed. Not entirely. There’s some momentum that will continue. But a full repeal scenario, which is maybe where the House is trending, would mean that we’re going to see half-a-gigaton-scale increase in emissions from our current trajectory in 2030, and about a gigaton or more in 2035.

Meyer: I realize that there’s a tendency for numbers, especially gigatons, these numbers attached to giant units, to slide by and kind of be like, Oh, that’s a number. But that is staggering. U.S. energy emissions are about five gigatons. I think global energy emissions are 38 gigatons …

Jenkins: Yeah, close to 40. Exactly.

Meyer: This is a sizable increase compared to baseline in carbon emissions.

Jenkins: I mean, yeah, it is huge. It leaves us pretty comparable to current emissions levels in 2035, if we see a full repeal of all of the regulations and tax credits and spending that are on the books now. Emissions actually go up in the near term as demand growth per electricity exceeds our ability to add new renewables in a repeal scenario. And so there’s an increase in the near term in emissions that actually takes us back towards 2022 levels, and then a slow decline at a similar trajectory that we saw really in the pre-Inflation Reduction Act, which is less than 1% per year decline in U.S. emissions.

In contrast, if we stayed on the current policy trajectory, we would close about half of the distance between that benchmark, the repeal scenario, and where we would want to be if we’re on track to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, which would be even deeper reductions than we’re currently on track for. So if you’re concerned about climate change, we should be accelerating, not decelerating, the transition, and this bill is slamming on the brakes.

Meyer: So you’ve referenced a few times, the way that you conduct this study, right, is you look at a number of scenarios. And so can you give us a sense, what scenarios did you look at to try to just begin to get a handle on what these different policies could do? And based off the text that’s out there, the Republican proposal that’s out there, which scenario are we closest to?

Jenkins: Yeah. So we have a continued policy scenario that assumes continuation of the full suite of policies in place at the beginning of January, 2025, legislative and executive. So the full suite of measures implemented by the Biden administration and the Democratic Congress through the infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Then we have an executive-repeal-only scenario, and so that scenario contemplates the Trump administration repealing all of the EPA greenhouse gas emissions regulations — that’s on power, on transportation, and on oil and gas methane pollution, as well as DOE efficiency standards and Department of Transportation fuel economy standards, and rescinding all unspent grant funding at the executive agencies.

And of course, we’ve seen those types of actions already from the Trump administration. They’ve not completed the rescission of those rules because it takes a bit of time to work through the administrative process of repealing existing regulation, but they have made very clear their intention to roll back all of those regulatory policies as soon as they’re able to. And they, as we’ve talked about in the past on the show, are going far beyond what we expected in terms of trying to block spending of not just unobligated funds that hadn’t been awarded to recipients yet, but even grant funding that’s going out to recipients under existing contracts. They’re also doing everything they can to roll that money back. So I’d say that scenario is our current path. We’re on the executive-repeal-only scenario.

And then the remaining question is, what happens in the legislature? What happens in the House and Senate as they craft this budget bill — that was our subject last week — that may, or is likely to, further repeal incentives for clean electricity, for electric vehicles, for energy efficiency, for nuclear power, for hydrogen, et cetera. All of the measures on the tax code to support the energy transition and support the development of a cleaner energy infrastructure — all those could be repealed as well.

And so we also have a full repeal scenario, which would basically include the end of all tax credits established by the IRA at the end of this calendar year. So beginning, you know, January 1, 2026 — no more credits. And unfortunately, it looks like that might be the direction we’re trending in the House bill, as well.

Meyer: That feels like the one we’re moving close to.

Jenkins: Yeah, so we didn’t model exactly every piece of detail in the House bill. We haven’t done that yet. We will, once the House passes something final. If it’s necessary, it may look exactly like the repeal scenario. We’ll see. We saw in the draft we discussed last week that there were a few credits that had a few more years of life in them, but the details are important. The clean electricity tax credits, for example, under the House Ways and Means Committee bill that passed out of committee on Sunday, does allow a few more years of deployment of carbon-free electricity technologies through 2028. If they’re placed in service by 2028, they could still claim the clean electricity tax credit, so that is a little bit better than the full repeal scenario we look at.

But we’ve also heard from Representative Chip Roy, who led efforts to block the budget committee vote over the weekend, that in order to extract further reductions in spending, that we can expect further reductions in the subsidies for clean electricity, thanks to his and his conservative budget hawk caucus efforts to further constrain spending in the House bill.

Meyer: Yeah,and I was going to say, I don’t want to delve into … There’s a lot of tea leaf reading you can do right now, especially around the gap between what House Freedom Caucus members say that they want out of this bill and what House IRA Caucus folks say they want out of this bill. And the gap has only grown. Especially the gap between that and then what senators say they will accept, all of which has contributed to a very confusing information environment.

Jenkins: Bottom line, full repeal is awfully darn close to what the House is trying to do.

Meyer: Exactly. I think we’re so much closer to a full repeal than people would have been willing to bet earlier this year.

Jenkins: Yeah, it’s a lot worse than I expected it to be, because I of course, posited that the economic constituencies out there that are benefiting from these current policies would be more effective at mounting an opposition. And at least at this point in the House side, that doesn’t seem to be the case. You know, just contrast the way that the budget hawks were willing to basically say, “We’re going to hold this bill hostage if we don’t get our way.”

Well, look, they got their way, whereas the House Republicans who have spoken up in the past in public in support of a more tapered or surgical approach to amending the clean electricity credits and others. You know, they wrote a nice letter to the Speaker saying, “Pretty please. We’d like you to do this, if you don’t mind.” But when push comes to shove, none of them seem to be willing to stand up and demand the changes they want to see.

It would only take four of them, or six of them, right? Only take a small cadre of that 21 to be willing to say, “Look, this is really bad for my constituents, and I don’t want to see it. Can we strip this stuff out and work on a bill that we can all support?” But they’re not willing to go to bat at that level, given the challenging politics they face within their own party and the backlash they’re likely to face from President Trump and whatever else that’s just keeping them afraid to actually stick their necks out here.

Meyer: Let’s get into some of the sector-by-sector findings. I think the biggest one, in terms of where we see the biggest emission cuts from the Inflation Reduction Act, is in the power sector. It’s where we have these big, powerful, tech-neutral tax credits that in the law as written and in the law as enacted, are meant to stay on the books for a really long time. They’re meant to stay on the books basically until we decarbonize the power sector, and certainly for decades. That changes in the House Republican proposal — under the best version of the proposal that we have right now, there are rumored worse versions out there, but in the version of the text we have, these tax credits start phasing out in 2029 and they’re gone entirely by the early 2030s.

In your assessment, what does it do to the emissions impact of the electricity sector? And then what does it do in terms of even just what kind of resources are generating electricity for us?

Jenkins: Yeah. So there’s two really big wedges that we see in our modeling scenarios that are differences from repeal efforts. The first is the executive action to repeal the EPA power plant regulations, which have no impact through 2030 because they have very little impact in the early years, because they don’t come into effect until the early 2030s. But by 2035, they have a substantial impact on the power sector, effectively eliminating coal from the portfolio, and further constraining the role of natural gas — although in some weird ways, that actually drive more gas capacity on the grid, even though the power plants are used less because of restrictions on how often the new capacity can run.

That is a big factor. In 2035, that’s the biggest single policy change probably we see in terms of moving the emissions needle, is repeal of the 111(d) standards. Those increase emissions in 2035 by just shy of half a gigaton. But then it all compounds with the repeal of the clean electricity or tech-neutral tax credits, which add another 300 or so million metric tons of emissions by 2035, with a growing impact from 2028 on. So it does start to bite even in 2030 with about 100 million tons more emissions then — this is all round numbers — but growing to something like 300 million tons, even on top of the EPA repeal. So those two together are the biggest chunk of the emissions increase, but there are some other substantial ones in the mix as well.

Meyer: You mentioned this earlier, but I thought one of the most interesting findings in your report was that in almost any scenario, emissions from the power sector actually, and emissions across the economy, increase slightly over the next few years. And I think that’s all driven by stuff in the power sector. Why is that happening, number one? And number two, what happens — let’s say just between now and 2028, or between now and 2030 — in the power sector, in these different scenarios?

Jenkins: So in the near term, we basically, and this is the longer term story indeed, is that we are, we have a race in the power sector between growing demand for electricity and growing shares of clean electricity. If you look at what’s getting built in the United States, it is mostly wind, solar, and batteries. That’s the vast majority of the capacity that’s come online over the last couple of years, and it’s also the vast majority of what is expected to come online over the next couple of years. But because of, particularly, delays and challenges in interconnecting wind power, we’re seeing deployment rates for wind really lag quite substantially. Even the record rates that we’ve seen in the U.S. in the past, where we built about 15 gigawatts of wind per year in 2020, 2021.

Right now we’re running at seven or eight gigawatts a year of deployment, and under continued policies, we expect that to accelerate back towards and beyond that record rate over time. But it’s constrained by our ability to interconnect wind resources to the grid, to get them permitted, to expand transmission into the areas where we need to tap the best wind resources. And in a full repeal scenario, that pace just never hits the accelerator. So it continues to bump along at a few gigawatts per year.

Solar, under a current policy scenario, does grow quite substantially, continuing to set new record growth rates, as we’ve seen each year over the last several years. Solar is a lot easier to cite, faster to complete projects, less dependent on existing grid infrastructure or expansion of existing grid infrastructure to connect. And so we see in a continued policies case that eventually that pace of growth from solar and wind outpaces the increase in demand for electricity. But it doesn’t do so in the full repeal scenario. We do still see a bit more wind and solar built in 2025, 2026, but then the pace collapses, and the growth of demand swamps the additions of new supply.

And so what that means is the power sector leans more in the near term on coal, existing coal fired power plants, than we would otherwise see. And, of course, coal is highly emissions-intensive, and so not even, not very large changes in the amount of coal in the energy mix have a huge impact on our total emissions.

Meyer: Did you see this study that came out over the weekend that was like, recessions, which have previously been thought to have this big public mortality effect, now seem to be life expectancy-improving on the margin, entirely accounted for by the air pollution effects?

Jenkins: I didn’t see that!

Meyer: Fewer people drive and there’s less power use during recessions, and that makes air pollution go down, and that means actually people live longer, even though there’s a lot of public health impacts from the economic effects of recessions, which are unemployment and underemployment.

Jenkins: I mean, I think as Americans, we just routinely underestimate the continued mortality and morbidity impacts, public health impacts, of air pollution in the country. Yes, it’s gotten way better than it was in the past, thanks to regulations like the ones the Trump administration is currently trying to undo. But it’s still bad, particularly in the most heavily populated parts of the country, whether that’s Southern California or where I live here in New Jersey. So yeah, where you got a lot of people driving around and burning power, turns out to be not so good for our health, and there’s a lot more progress we could make on that front if we could accelerate the growth of clean electricity.

Meyer: So one argument that I’ve heard from more IRA-skeptical folks is that if we’re building so much solar and batteries especially, if wind and solar and batteries are the easiest technologies to add to the grid right now, why should we be spending money to subsidize them, given that they seem to be winning on their own as is? Why is that important, either from an economic standpoint, and also, why is it a good use of public funds?

Jenkins: Yeah, it’s a great question. And I should be clear, we do see continued deployment of wind and solar, even in a policy repeal scenario, and storage as well, just at a much slower pace. There are parts of the country where wind and solar are subsidy-independent, where they can just beat out natural gas plants and existing coal on the margins, on economics alone. But that is a restricted portion of the country, and if we want to be able to deploy these American energy resources broadly, all across the country, then we need to do something to value the contributions they’re making to the country. That includes clean air, that includes emissions reductions, that includes lower energy costs, and our ability to keep up with rapid demand growth. It includes economic benefits in a wide range of districts, from employment and local tax revenue and spending.

We have historically subsidized lots of energy technologies. We continue to offer long term subsidies for oil and gas production, lower per unit rates than we provide for wind and solar, but large in aggregate. The question is, do you want to taper these things out over time? That could make sense, but ending them precipitously, especially after they were just extended, it’s a whipsaw kind of effect, right? Any large changes in policy are bad for business, because it means projects that looked like they were going to move forward because of the current policy environment — thought they had visibility to be completed, to get financing, to line up long lead time items, et cetera — are going to have the rug pulled out from them.

So this is where this kind of discussion about where exactly the House and/or Senate bills land in terms of phase-out of these credits, I think is really important. Maybe they don’t need to run ’till 2040 but if you don’t, if you sunset them very rapidly — say by the end of this year — then there’s lots of projects that are already pretty well under development that will no longer be able to claim those credits and may no longer be financially solvent. That creates stranded costs on costs, and projects that get scrapped, companies that go bankrupt, lay people off, et cetera. And so the smoother way to do that would be to have some longer-term runway in which projects can commence construction and lock in the kind of tax credit that they’re eligible for, and move to completion, even as you step down the level over time. That’s where I thought they were headed, but it looks like they may be headed in the opposite direction under the current House discussion.

Meyer: Let’s finish up with a few more sectors. So in transportation, it looks like your results for all scenarios, there’s a reduction in emissions, but the size of that reduction changes a lot based on which policies we happen to follow. What stuck out to you there?

Jenkins: Yeah, that’s right, and we should remember that U.S. transportation emissions peaked a long time ago, and they have been falling since, I think, around 2006, which is when U.S. emissions as a whole peaked, actually. And that’s because of an increase in fuel efficiency over time, right? That increase in energy efficiency in the transportation sector has been enough to offset the growth in vehicle-miles-traveled that we’re seeing across both personal vehicles and freight on private vehicles.

That trend continues under current policies, we see continued growth of hybrid electric vehicles, for example, which are on quite a tear lately, as increasing their market share. And we see continued growth of electric vehicles, because they are still attractive vehicles for many consumers out there across the country, and increasingly more so as their costs fall. But just like in the power sector, that pace drops dramatically, and so we basically see about a 40% reduction in annual sales of electric vehicles by 2030. Cumulatively between now and 2030, it’s something like 8 million less electric vehicles on the roads of the United States, and that does have a measurable impact on total gasoline consumption and therefore emissions and energy costs.

It’s, in some ways, it’s sort of wild. It’s kind of a backdoor gas tax. You know, if you remove these incentives to improve the efficiency of the U.S. fleet and to electrify the U.S. fleet and shift away from gasoline and diesel fuel, you’re going to see a much higher demand for gasoline and diesel, and higher demand translates to higher prices at the pump. You wouldn’t see House Republicans caught dead voting for a gas tax, right? But actually, by removing these subsidies for electric vehicles, that’s effectively what they’re doing to everybody else. By increasing the total consumption of gasoline quite substantially, we’re going to be paying higher prices at the pump across the country.

Meyer: In a world where we’re selling 8 million fewer EVs, what does that do to the EV factories and battery factories and critical mineral supply chains that are being supposedly built all around the country at this moment? And that also supposedly at least on the critical mineral side, the Trump administration is quite keen to expand?

Jenkins: It’s decimating for that whole effort to build out a U.S. battery supply chain. I mean, we are seeing right now a huge amount of investment in projects that are not yet complete to manufacture batteries, to build battery components, upstream projects like mines and processing of critical minerals and components for batteries and, of course, final vehicle assembly. We find that if we look upstream, the current pipeline of both electric vehicle assembly and battery manufacturing capacity is pretty on track to meet where demand would be if we didn’t repeal these scenarios, these policies.

Meyer: So we’ve invested for a non-repeal.

Jenkins: Yeah, the market was anticipating a continuation of policies. It started developing manufacturing plants and making investments and planning investments in accordance to that. If we repeal the tax credits for EVs immediately, or by 2030 even, what we’re doing is making those vehicles more expensive. That means they’re going to sell less of them. If they sell less of them, they of course need to manufacture and assemble less vehicles. And then that permeates all the way up the supply chain, which means less demand for vehicles, for batteries and for critical minerals and for components as well.

And so what we find is that if we do see that contraction in demand for electric vehicles, about 40%, even if the U.S. maintains the same market share as it does today, in terms of assembly of cells and vehicles, that would basically render most all of the planned capacity additions in vehicle assembly redundant. We have enough already under construction, with a couple more, that we would not need any additional capacity. It’s even worse on the battery side, we would have more than enough capacity from projects that are complete by the end of this year to meet the expected demand in that scenario.

And there’s reason to believe that that market share, that U.S. market share, won’t remain the same. It’s likely to fall as well, because the 30D tax credit, that’s the personal vehicle tax credit, is part of an overall strategy to basically onshore and friendshore this supply chain. And so it has a set of requirements that to get the full vehicle subsidy, you have to source, you have to assemble the vehicle in North America, you have to source battery components and assemble those in North America, and the materials that go into them have to come from North America or from our former Free Trade Agreement partners.

So that was sort of the demand side pull that was driving a lot of incentives to produce these in the U.S. There’s also a direct subsidy, 45X, that’s also on the chopping block in the House bill, that was directly subsidizing battery manufacturing in the U.S. And those two together have driven the battery boom that we’re seeing right now, which, by the way, is massive in Georgia and North Carolina and South Carolina and Tennessee and Kentucky and a number of other Republican states.

If you remove either one of those, the supply-side push from 45X, the advanced manufacturing subsidy, or this sort of demand pull that you get from 30D, it’s likely that U.S. market share would fall. And in that case, we’re going to see not only all currently unfinished projects be redundant, likely scrapped, but we’re also going to see, we would have a large amount of over-capacity already operating, and that means that factories would be idled or have to be repurposed to build internal combustion cars. Investments that were just made in new product lines and new assembly lines and robotics and everything else would be wasted. It would really be quite disastrous for the battery boom.

So yeah, I guess I should have put that in my top-line. In addition to increasing energy costs and emissions, it will decimate the U.S. battery manufacturing sector, which is just starting to explode across the country, in mostly Republican districts.

Meyer: How sensitive are your models to oil prices? Because I think one thing we’ve seen in other models is like, well, there’s actually a lot of year-to-year variation in what emissions do based on how high fuel prices get. Like, when you look at your scenarios, is there a way that, say, maybe the parts of the IRA stay on the books, but fuel gets cheaper? Or parts of the IRA go off the books, but fuel gets really expensive? What’s the relationship between fuel prices and emissions in your model?

Jenkins: No, that’s a great question. I should say that’s an area where our particular suite of models is not the strongest. That’s one of our limitations, is that we don’t include a general equilibrium market effect for fuel prices as a function of demand. And so when we calculate, for example, the increase in energy expenditures that we see under repeal, that doesn’t account for a further increase you would see from increased gasoline prices and natural gas prices.

So that is something that the Rhodium Group, who uses the NEMS model — that’s the same model that the U.S. Energy Information Administration uses — and is much better designed to capture these oil and gas supply chain dynamics, I’d say much less well designed to capture electricity sector transition dynamics, which is why we don’t use it. But it is good, in particular at this, which is capturing oil and gas supply chain impacts. What they find is that under a full repeal scenario, by 2035, it would amount to a 1% to 5% increase in retail motor gasoline prices across the country. So that’s like a $0.05 to $0.15 per gallon increase in the cost of gasoline. So it’s like a gas tax of $0.05 to $0.15, right? You get pollution and less exports of oil. Yeah, not great.

And I can’t imagine Chip Roy, again, or his friends voting for a $0.15 gas tax, but that’s effectively what it would do. We would also see an increase in the cost of natural gas by about 2% to 7% in their estimates that natural gas cost drives up the cost of industrial energy expenditures by on the order of $10 billion per year. So it’s making our businesses less competitive, our industries in the global landscape. It would increase industrial electricity rates by 7% to 12% in 2035 and of course, it would also increase our household costs as well. Our estimates from REPEAT Project, even without accounting for that bump in prices, just the fact that we’re shifting costs off of the tax base and back onto household energy budgets, and that we’re going to see more consumption of fuel overall because of less EVs and less heat pumps and less energy efficiency, et cetera, we estimate that total annual expenditures on energy across the U.S. go up by $25 billion In 2030 and by over $50 billion in 2035.

So you’re right, though, to point out that while there is this increase in household costs and reduced competitiveness of American industries and higher cost of gasoline, all that might have a countervailing impact on emissions. That means, all else equal, just considering that change alone, EVs are slightly more attractive when gasoline costs 15 cents more, I just don’t think that’s likely to be as salient to consumers as losing a $7,500 tax credit, which drops the cost of a new vehicle by 25%, or drops the cost of a lease almost in half, because of the way that the tax credits enter into leases.

Meyer: Totally. Though I do feel like one thing we still really don’t understand in the current car and oil market together as linked, is how much if we were to see a 2007 or 2006 oil price surge, which doesn’t seem to be in the cards at this particular moment, but I guess could be if enough supply got lost, and whatever. How much there’s, like, now a ceiling on oil, because consumers can just be like, “Well, screw OPEC, you know, I’m gonna go buy an EV!”

Jenkins: Yeah, that’s true, although it is a slow impact on total consumption, because vehicle turnover is small, like, we only sell, what, 15 million vehicles a year, and we have a fleet of 300 million. And so it does take time for these impacts to mount. That’s why we don’t see any substantial impacts on energy prices in, say, 2026 or 2027, it mounts over time as those 8 million additional EVs that would otherwise have been on the road by 2035 are not there, or by 2030 are not there. So it’s these cumulative impacts over time that will help constrain energy costs.

For an individual household, you can opt out of oil whenever you want. That’s good. So you know, if oil prices go up and you want to say, “I’m done paying at the pump, I’m going to go buy an EV,” that helps you. But in terms of the overall economy, it’s not as quick a transition as we’d like, which is why having long term policy certainty and driving this transition over time would probably be a good idea.

We talked about this a bit with Ellen Hughes-Cromwick when she was on to talk about the impacts of tariffs on the automotive sector. She’s the former chief economist at Ford Motor Company and a Department of Commerce official. She noted that the future of the automotive sector is electric, whether you like it or not. Whether you’re MAGA or not! And the reason we can say that with confidence is that you already look in the U.S. market at what’s growing in terms of vehicle segments, and what’s shrinking. What’s shrinking is conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, and what’s growing are hybrids, plug-in hybrids and EVs.

Beyond that, if the future of automotive is autonomous vehicles, which anybody who’s ridden a Waymo in San Francisco recently, of which Rob and I are both part — we should have an episode on this. So there’s a reason that all of those Waymos are running on Jaguar EVs, not because they’re Jaguars, but because they’re EVs. You can’t have the kind of sensors and compute power that you need onboard a fully autonomous vehicle without an electric vehicle platform.

There’s a reason that Ford launched its BlueCruise, hands-off, hands-free driving that I have in my Mustang Mach-E, for the Mustang Mach-E, in the Ford F-150 Lightning first, because they have the power onboard to power these devices. So if you think long-term about the future of the sector, and you think the two big growth trends globally, right, are electrification and autonomous vehicles, and that those two go hand in hand, because even if you don’t care about the electrification part from an emissions perspective, or oil reduction, or whatever, you just like the autonomous vehicle part, you need electric vehicles.

And you start to see why the current industrial policy that we have in place to support this transition for our automakers is so important to their future. You rip all that away, and we could very well be left with a set of failing automakers who are able to produce large SUVs and trucks that run on internal combustion engines the way they always have, and therefore have a shrinking share of a North America or U.S.-only market at their disposal, having seeded all of the growth markets around the world and their ability to keep up in autonomous vehicles. And that’s just, like, disastrous right? To see that kind of outcome.

So I just, what I hate about this whole debate is how it’s all about “owning the libs,” right, and unwinding any of Biden’s achievements, right? And all that ends up doing is seeding all of these industries to others. You want to own the libs? Great, well, now we just lost nuclear power, we lost EVs, we lost autonomous vehicles, and we’ll probably lose AI too, because we can’t keep up with the demand growth.

Meyer: Well, but it’s incoherent. I mean, this is what’s kind of flummoxing me, is that the day one Donald Trump executive order declared the lack of energy resources in the country, specifically the lack of electricity, but also the lack of critical mineral capacity, to be national emergencies. And we see a huge focus from the Trump administration, at least so far, in trying to shore up critical mineral resources. Now, has that been unified with their trade policy? No, not at all. But they talk about the importance of critical minerals, and how improving and increasing critical mineral extraction and refining is so crucial to the long-term wellbeing of the country.

There’s three industries that produce downstream demand for critical minerals, right? They’re EVs, they’re wind turbines — because you need the magnets for rare earths in the wind turbines — and they’re electronics, consumer electronics. Well, they’re destroying the EV industry. They’re really obliterating the wind industry. They want nothing to do with the wind industry. One thing we see in the House Ways and Means proposal is that they phase out the subsidies for producing wind equipment way earlier than they phase out anything else.

Jenkins: Right, almost immediately.

Meyer: Almost immediately! And then there is basically no serious interest in developing a downstream consumer electronics market. I mean, we have the CHIPS Act, right, but there’s no—

Jenkins: Well, the tariffs! The tariffs are going to bring it all back, Rob.

Meyer: We’ve already relented on tariffs. And even with the tariffs set at 164%, even then, it seemed like we were unlikely to fully decouple from the Chinese electronic manufacturing industry. And also, by the way, you produce a rival to the Chinese electronic manufacturing industry. Number one, it would be unlikely to happen here. But number two, if you wanted to do it here, you pursue a set of policies meant to create an American Shenzhen in like Houston or something. You wouldn’t do it through tariffs and minerals — it’s a bizarre way to do it. Anyway, and you’d need more workers, but not gonna get into that.

So it’s just this bizarre, incoherent policy, right, of like, “We want critical minerals. We need critical minerals. Biden was failing the country by ignoring critical minerals,” while destroying any place where demand for those minerals would come from in the economy, which means there’s no economic impetus to produce them in the first place! But anyway, I repeat myself. There’s one more place I want to talk about, which is when you look at the, in your modeling about what IRA repeal would look like, it looks like a lot of the emissions impacts are coming from, let’s say, like a category that’s neither power nor transportation. It’s buildings, but it’s also kind of a wild card.

It seems like a huge amount of emissions increases, or at least a lack of emissions reductions, comes from the non-CO2 greenhouse gas category. So like, what’s driving the rest of the increase or lack of decrease that we’re seeing here?

Jenkins: Yeah, that big shift is from the repeal of the EPA methane regulations on oil and gas. This was a huge low-hanging fruit for cost effective emissions reductions. Methane, as I’m sure most of our listeners know, is a very potent greenhouse gas. It causes a lot more warming, pound for pound, than CO2, even though it lives in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time, so it has a more immediate impact on temperatures. But you know—

Meyer: Most of the warming we’re seeing right now is from methane, I believe.

Jenkins: Right, because of its immediate impact, exactly. And so we leak a lot of methane from across the oil and gas supply chain, a lot more than we need to, using best practices and cost-effective techniques that are already available to the industry. The large players in the oil and gas industry supported the EPA methane regulations and the fee that the Inflation Reduction Act established on methane pollution from the oil and gas sector. So there’s this one-two combo of a fee on, or really a carbon fee, a methane fee on emissions in the oil and gas supply chain, and a set of regulations that would require their reductions. There were some grant funding as well for those who wanted to access it to tackle emissions. So the major players in the sector were perfectly happy with this. They saw it as very cost-effective. When you avoid leaking methane, you have more methane, a.k.a. natural gas, to sell to the market. So it’s very cost-effective and very achievable. And again, just because it happened under Biden and regulation equals bad under any context, they’re moving to repeal both the methane fee and the EPA regulations. Ballpark, that leads to an increase of about 100 million metric tons of emissions of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in 2030 and about 70 million tons in 2035.

So that’s a big chunk, right? 100 million tons is, you know, in a 5000 ton, or 5 billion ton total, is a lot. There are also impacts in industry and residential sectors from reduced energy efficiency and in industry from reductions in carbon capture and hydrogen deployment, which would just again be totally decimated by these repeals. It’s unlikely we’d see any deployment in those sectors if those credits phase out soon.

Meyer: One thing that’s interesting to me about your results is that electricity demand under your modeling, if I’m reading the charts right, and at the time I’m reading this, there’s no report yet. There’s only the charts. And so—

Jenkins: Your graph comprehension skills are being put to the test.

Meyer: I know, exactly. One thing that stuck out to me is that in the scenario where the IRA stays on the books, in 2035, electricity demand is higher than it would be if repeal happens, but electricity costs are lower. And that’s because the IRA works to both increase demand for electricity via electrification of home appliances and electrification of transportation, while at the same time working to get more electricity supply on the market via the tech-neutral tax credits, winds and solar, batteries, et cetera, et cetera.

And so in 2035, in a world where you repeal the IRA, there’s this kind of counterintuitive combination of the U.S. power grid is both smaller, it’s delivering less electricity, and—

Jenkins: It’s bigger than it is today.

Meyer: It’s smaller than it is in the counterfactual, and electricity is also more expensive. It’s a real testament, I think, to the importance of policy that works to increase supply as much as possible in order to lower costs across the economy, which is what the IRA does.

Jenkins: Yeah. I mean, we are sitting here at this moment where we’re coming out of a period of flat demand for electricity, right? It’s been basically stagnant since 2005. Into a period of accelerating growth. In our scenario, or scenarios, including even the repeal side, we’re seeing demand growing at a sustained rate of over 2.5% per year, and under current policies, it could be as high as 3.7% per year. We haven’t seen rates like that since the 1970s or 60s. That’s enough to grow electricity demand anywhere from about a third to half again, current levels by 2035. So the growth is coming, and it’s coming whether or not the IRA credits persist.

What the current policy environment is trying to do, as you said, is to try to rapidly expand our supply of electricity. And the fastest way to do that, the best way to do that under current environments, is with wind, solar and batteries. They’re, you know, again, 98% of what is in the queue, or what’s been built recently. We will add some new gas capacity, I’m sure, to keep up with some of that demand growth. But as your reporting has shown, Rob, there’s just a limit to the amount of new gas turbines that the OEMs are willing to build, and it is not at all sufficient to keep up with demand growth.

So in a world where we do anything to impede the growth of renewables and storage, which is exactly what completely blowing up the current tax credit environment would do, we’re going to simply see demand growth start to outstrip supply increases. And anytime that happens, energy costs go up along with emissions, because we’re going to be reliant. The only slack we have then in the system is to lean into existing power plants that are underutilized. That mostly means coal-fired power plants that are currently not being used much and will ramp back up to fill the slack. So, higher emissions, higher prices for everyone, and less ability to power data center demand growth and everything else that’s coming.

Meyer: One thing that sticks out to me is that in 2022 when the IRA was passed, and you can correct me here, but my memory is that we didn’t foresee this bulge in electricity demand growth coming.

Jenkins: Well, we didn’t foresee the data center part of the story, which is big. I mean, we’ve successively updated our REPEAT analyses over the last couple of years to try to factor in the latest estimates, which, of course, have a nice error bar around them as well, of data center demand growth. We did have a large growth in electricity demand just due to electrification already, when we were modeling the IRA’s impacts in 2022. But since 2022 what we’ve seen is an accelerated growth in manufacturing. A lot of the Battery Belt stuff we talked about, right? All those are tens of megawatt-scale electricity consumers for the most part. And we now have all these tens to hundreds of megawatts, even gigawatt-scale data centers, popping up across the country.

So that adds in another one percentage point a year, or something like that, of growth on top of what was already a 2% to 3% per year story, just from electrification. And just to put things into scale, it is important to note that while data centers are big, our estimates on the order of 250 to 400 terawatt hours, or billion kilowatt hours of additional consumption per year in 2030 and 2035, so 250 billion kilowatt hours in 2030, 400, say, in round numbers in 2035. Electric vehicle growth combined, both medium and heavy and light-duty vehicles, are likely to be 400 to 500 terawatt hours, or billion kilowatt hours in 2035. So on the same order of magnitude as data centers, and that’s including in the repeal scenario, right, where we see a slower but still real increase in the amount of electric vehicles on U.S. roads.

Meyer: Well, I guess this is my question, though, in some ways, the IRA seems very well-timed in retrospect. Sometimes you look back at a law and you’re like, you know, at the time that law was passed, the economy was already kind of, through some automatic process that we don’t really understand, like, dealing with the issue, or the global economy was reshuffling in a way that was becoming less of an issue. The IRA was the opposite of that. It was actually really well-timed and anticipated in a way that I don’t think even the bill authors realized necessarily at the time. The coming surge in electricity demand, especially from data centers. And so it was discussed as a climate bill and an economic development bill, but it has really become essential to the AI story. It’s in some ways a more important law now than it was when it was passed. And I think people might be overlooking that. I do wonder, you know—

Jenkins: I think they are overlooking that, and who needs to go in and tell them that right now and help them understand that, are all of the data center and AI companies. They know better than anybody that the ability to add new electricity supply and connect to the grid fast enough is part of the story of their ability to compete in a global race to develop and shape and ultimately control this next generation of technology.

Oh, look at China, where there is absolutely no constraint on their ability to add renewables at the pace needed, right? And if we are in an environment where we’re slowing down our pace of electricity demand growth, it will absolutely impede our competitiveness in the AI race. And I think that’s a message that policymakers on the Hill need to hear very quickly, or they’re about to make a very counterproductive intervention in the market.

Meyer: Yeah. I mean, I had one more question here, which is, let’s say there’s another bulk of data center activity, or, I don’t know, some other big new source of electricity demand that comes online in the 2030s, like this could all potentially be even worse, right? We’re modeling the technologies that we understand and the economic impulses that we understand, but the further this gets out in time, the more potential draws of energy there are, right, that we don’t even anticipate today.

Jenkins: Absolutely. It’s a good example of the limits of our crystal ball, right? Here’s this huge meta-trend that kind of snuck up on a lot of us, even those closely analyzing the power sector. I’m sure there were people anticipating this in 2021, 2022 but it was definitely not part of the conversation around these bills on the Hill. It was not the primary focus. Whereas today, it’s all about AI, right? Everybody’s talking about data centers everywhere I go.

Meyer: And then one last thing, which is, when we talk about electricity prices going up for consumers, I just want to draw out exactly why that would happen.

Jenkins: Yep.

Meyer: And make sure I understand correctly here what’s happening. Because electricity markets are unusual markets. They don’t work exactly like how people necessarily think. So, the idea here is that, if I’m a developer, the existence of these tax credits, or the fact that these tax credits are as potent as they are, I’m able to transfer them to other companies, maybe get 90 or 90 cents on the dollar of every tax credit I claim, as opposed to how it used to be, which was 80 to 85 cents on the dollar, right? That’s bringing, that’s allowing more projects to pencil out. And so I’m able to build that extra 10% of projects. There’s a number of projects, so to speak, that I can now build, that I didn’t used to be able to build, that didn’t make financial sense.

Jenkins: Yeah, a lot more than 10%. It’s probably more like 100% more projects, roughly, yeah.

Meyer: And so that means a lot more new capacity is coming onto the grid, and then it’s being dispatched in power auctions — largely, there’s some, obviously not in vertically integrated monopolies — but in most of the country, it’s being dispatched in power auctions, either when the sun is up and it has a zero marginal cost, or the batteries are activating when it makes sense economically. And that is through the existence of more supply on the market, and the greater amount of supply on the market that was brought onto the market by the existence of these tax credits lowering costs, which means that the cost effect of repealing the IRA actually grows over time, as we continue to lose the supply and the cheap electricity that would have once helped the economy. Is that all correct?

Jenkins: That’s exactly right. We estimate that average household energy costs would increase in 2030 by about $110 to $180 per household for the average household. But that grows to like $275 to $400 per year by 2035. And a big part of that is the increase in electricity price differences. There’s really three effects here, I think that are important to call out. One is the one you’re talking about, which is just more supply in the electricity sector means lower electricity costs, all else equal. And that’s a big lever, because it isn’t just a 10% increase in deployment. It’s more like a doubling of the amount of new wind and solar and batteries that we can bring onto the grid in a cost-effective manner.

The second issue is that there are subsidies here, which are basically transfers of cost out of your pocketbook as a household or a business and onto the federal tax code. Now, somebody’s got to pay for that cost eventually, maybe it’s going to the deficit. But the way the Inflation Reduction Act tried to pay for that was by increasing corporate minimum taxes, by expanding IRS enforcement, by reducing the cost of prescription drug purchases for Medicare, Medicaid, right? So it’s trying to raise revenues in a pretty progressive way, right? In a fair way, I would argue, to try to pay for these costs of subsidies that ended up lowering pocketbook expenses for all Americans, right, across the country. That’s the part of the name, the Inflation Reduction part of it was it was driving down costs, both through this supply effect and the direct transfer of subsidies.

And then the third effect is that a lot of what we’re talking about, whether it’s EVs or heat pumps or industrial efficiency, is substitution of upfront capital costs for reduced fuel use. Right? I’m paying more for a more efficient heat pump, or I’m paying more for an electric vehicle than an internal combustion car at the lot, or I’m paying more for an efficient boiler in my industrial process. All of that is upfront cost that then, over time, reduces the amount of fuel we consume across the economy. And that also, that reduction in demand, in addition to the supply on the power side also drives down consumption. And so when you roll that back, we see higher consumption of fossil fuels — gasoline, diesel, natural gas, coal — which is going to drive up their cost too.

So it’s really those three effects. It’s the increased supply. You’re slowing down the addition of supply in the power sector. You’re increasing consumption, in households and businesses and industry, of fossil fuels. And you’re removing taxpayer subsidies that are taking money out of household pockets, putting on the tax code. You’re reversing that, you’re putting them right back in your household pocketbook. So you have to spend more on your vehicle. You have to spend more to heat your home. You have to spend more to weatherize your house, whatever it is.

Meyer: Man.

Jenkins: So of those three effects, right — this is where it’s tricky when we talk about an average household impact because if you’re a recipient of those subsidies directly — like you bought an EV and you got a subsidy, right, whether a new or used one, or you’re a business that got the funding — that transfer goes directly to you on some of those purchases. And so there, it’s less about the average household. It’s more about households who adopt these technologies and benefit from that capital subsidy by reducing the cost of purchase versus those who don’t.

But if we’re talking about the other two effects, the effect of more electricity supply and less fuel consumption, those effects benefit everybody by lowering prices for all Americans, not just those who buy the EV, right? So there’s 8 million less EVs on the road. That means more expenses for the people who would have otherwise bought those 8 million EVs, but it also means 15 cents more at the gas pump for all Americans. And that adds up when you start to multiply that by 360 million people, or whatever it is.

Meyer: You know, it’s funny, Jesse, what I was going to say is that between this tax bill, which is just going to blow up the deficit even more than it’s already been, and the fact that rates are creeping higher, this recent debt downgrade of the U.S., and the fact that renewable energy benefits so much, either from, as you were saying, or electrification benefits either from these higher upfront costs that then get you lower energy costs over time, or from installing a solar project that has a high upfront cost and then zero marginal operating costs, you can see the return of deficit hawk Democratic politics on the horizon. You can see President Ossoff promoting his five years to a balanced budget. You know, 2028 to 2032, I don’t know. I just feel like it’s coming.

Jenkins: The deficit is not a trivial thing. It is an important challenge that needs to be addressed. The question is, how do we want to address that? Do we want to address that by repealing subsidies that are expanding electricity supply, helping power American industries and data centers, lowering costs for households and businesses, et cetera, lowering emissions, lowering air pollution. Or we could increase tax cuts or make permanent tax cuts for very wealthy people in corporations, either. One of those has a very small impact on the deficit, right, the total score that they’re saving from the IRA repeal is on the order of $500 billion over 10 years, whereas the total budgetary impact of making the tax cuts for corporations and individuals permanent is something like four and a half trillion dollars over 10 years. So you know, nine times bigger.

Meyer: From Climate Hawk to Deficit Hawk: The College Educated Millennial Story, coming soon, to Pelican Books. You heard it here first. Okay, we’re going to take a break, and then we’re going to come back with Upshift/Downshift right after this.

Every week. Jesse Jenkins, my co-host, and I like to find one piece of news that has really caught our attention and that is either making us feel more upbeat about the energy transition that week or more downbeat. Now, of course, as you might guess, if it’s making us feel more upbeat, it is an Upshift. If it’s making us feel more downbeat, it’s a Downshift. Jesse Jenkins, what do you have for us today?

Jenkins: Well, since we’ve been delivering a lot of Downshifts in our main segments here, I keep trying to look out for important Upshifts. And there’s not too many more important than what happens to greenhouse gas emissions in China, the world’s largest emitter. Back in December, we had Lauri Myllyvirta on to talk about the big structural shifts that might be happening in China’s economy that contribute to a potential peak in emissions years ahead of their schedule. The Chinese national goal is to have their emissions peak by 2030. It looks like it’s possible that over the last 12 months that peak has arrived, at least for now, we’ll see if it is sustained and if it can turn into a downturn.

But data is now out for the first quarter of 2025 that finds that China’s total CO2 emissions are down 1.6% year on year for that first quarter. And over the last 12 months, trailing through end of March, emissions are down by a full 1% relative to the previous 12 months. Back in December, I think when we recorded that episode, it aired early after the new year. We were still at this point where we weren’t quite sure, you know, are emissions going to be up or flat or down a little bit? It looks like they, in fact, are down. Couple major drivers there, the most important of which is just that power sector clean electricity additions are now fast enough to outpace demand growth, right?

It’s the same race that we were just talking about for the U.S., where the fate of the tech-neutral clean electricity tax credits will play a big role in which pulls ahead: demand or clean electricity. Historically, China’s been setting record growth rates for wind and solar, year after year, but it’s not been quite enough to keep up with their massive increases in electricity demand. Until now, where we’ve actually seen emissions from the power sector fall by somewhere on the order of 40 million tons per year — not a huge shift, but enough to drop total emissions down across the country and offset small increases in the other sectors, like chemicals and metallurgy, steel production, iron steel production, in particular.

This is exactly the kind of trend that we need to see for China to turn emissions around, is that the growth of clean electricity, wind and solar and nuclear and others, need to outpace their growth in electricity demand and other structural changes across the economy, like the slowdown in the construction sector, which also contributed, we saw a decline in cement related emissions over the last 12 months. Those are also helping contribute to declining emissions and are offsetting the growth in emissions in petrochemicals, plastic production, et cetera, and in metallurgy, iron and steel in particular.

Meyer: It’s so funny, because I think that big question of, “Is there going to be a major economy that sees clean energy supply exceed the growth in demand?” was actually, like, a major question last year. People asked that question about the United States. They asked about Europe. We’ve seen other economies achieve it, but there’s been this question of, does clean energy just ultimately add to supply, or does it start to bite into fossil supply over time? And for China, the milestone is just huge, arguably the biggest news event to happen so far this year, right?

Jenkins: It’s one of the most important shifts out there, so we’ll keep a close eye on it. But for now, it’s trending in the right direction, which is at least a bit of comfort given the way things are trending here at home. So Rob, what do you have for us this week?

Meyer: Well, I have a downshift for us. So last week, when we were going over the parts of the House Republican Ways and Means Committee proposal that effectively guts the IRA, we left one part not really discussed, and this was the foreign entities of concern clause. As folks who’ve been following the IRA for a long time will remember, there’s always been a foreign entities of concern clause attached to some parts of the IRA. It was attached specifically to the $7,500 tax credit for buying a personal EV. And the way that clause worked was basically that over time to qualify for this tax credit, automakers and battery makers had to raise the amount of non-Chinese source materials in their battery or car.

And this was meant to slowly encourage, slowly but confidently encourage battery part makers, critical mineral refiners, critical mineral mines, to shift or build new facilities outside of Chinese control. That it would gradually friendshore the EV supply chain. It was not instant. It was like, this is a long term impetus to build a parallel supply chain, because right now, China, or Chinese-controlled entities control some vast amount, I think, more than 80% of almost every supply chain that feeds into modern EVs. And if you’re an American policy maker, this would seem suboptimal.

The Republican proposal to reform or change or essentially gut the IRA, retains a foreign entity of concern clause, but it changes it so substantially that it’s almost not worth calling it by the same policy. So what this clause does, and the clause is attached to almost every tax credit in the IRA, including, I should add, to the carbon capture tax credit, to the personal EV tax credit, to the tech-neutral tax credit, every tax credit except to the biofuel, the ethanol tax credit—

Jenkins: As usual, ethanol gets its way.

Meyer: —Has a new foreign entity of concern clause, and what it says is that the tax credit cannot flow to a Chinese company. It can’t flow to a company that is majority or partially-controlled by someone with connections to China. And crucially, that it can’t — and this is where it really matters — that it can’t receive material support from a Chinese-linked entity. Now you may think that sounds very reasonable, right? We don’t want material support coming to these American energy projects. But what they mean by material support is material. Like, any kind of material.

Jenkins: Stuff. Cement or electrical wire or anything.

Meyer: The way the law is written, is that any part, in my reading and the reading of folks I’ve talked to, any part, any component, any piece of equipment, no matter how insubstantial, if it is found to be linked or come from China or was made by a Chinese-controlled company, automatically disqualifies the entire project from receiving the tax credit.

So what that means is that, let’s say you have some steel in a steel frame for solar panels that was made in a Chinese foundry — whole project loses qualification. Let’s say that there’s like a gram of graphite that, through the global market, has worked its way into your battery supply chain — whole vehicle loses qualification. Let’s say that there’s a little copper in a wire that you use to power a direct air capture product, and that copper has come from a Chinese mind somewhere — your whole project, again, loses the tax credit. So in effect, what this new clause does is it says, if there is any Chinese part, even if it’s one little bolt, and yes, the law is written to fully countenance the idea that it could be really, really insubstantial, one little bolt of Chinese source material in your project disqualifies it entirely from receiving a tax credit.

And the issue is that lots of parts that do not reflect, like, best-in-class technology, that are just kind of commodity parts on the market, intermingle in the global market. And right now there’s no way for energy developers or construction companies to know when they’re buying something that it comes from China or that it comes from Europe or that it comes from Southeast Asia. It’s totally unclear. You don’t really—

Jenkins: It’s impossible to verify this.

Meyer: Yeah, exactly. And so what this FEOC clause would mean is, number one, it would render many of these tax credits totally unworkable. And in fact, we’ve seen House Republican moderates already say that they need these, they want this particular clause to be changed in an eventual final version of the law. We’ll see if they succeed. But even Republican House moderates are saying this is totally unworkable. What the FEOC does is it basically, I think, kills these tax credits because—

Jenkins: It’s a poison pill.

Meyer: It’s a poison pill, and it’s meant to make, what’s going to have to happen is that the Treasury Department is going to have to go in and rewrite tax guidance for this new statutory text. And I would bet that by the time the Treasury Department finally gets around to writing that text, we’ll have hit the sunset deadlines for these tax credits, and these tax credits will have been effectively killed. And so you’ll hear sunset dates. You’ll hear, “Oh, House Republicans extended this date to 2028, it was supposed to be in 2033 and now companies can only claim until 2028 or 2029 or 2030.” And you might think, well, 2029 is an election away. Maybe there’ll be a different Congress by then, and they’ll repeal this law, and they’ll send the tax credits again. But what is actually going to happen is that between now and 2028, at least, the tax credit will not be, will not exist, it will not be usable, because the FEOC clauses are such a poison pill. Now, maybe they’ll change this. Maybe they’ll put in some safe harbor clauses, maybe some texts that they’ve put in there that ambiguously could be a safe harbor clause. Today they’ll clear it up so that it becomes clear if you’re using a Chinese-made bolt or a Chinese made washer that, like, you don’t lose tens of millions of dollars of tax credit support for your nuclear plant, for instance.

But as of today, my read of this clause is that it is a major, major poison pill, and that, to me, is a big old Downshift.

Jenkins: Yeah, I think it’s a huge downshift, Rob. Whether they resolve this to clarify that a few bolts or whatever don’t count or not, the simple idea of material assistance, materials of any sort, right, in your supply chain pushes this clause and the effort to sort of excise China so far back up the supply chain to the third tier of suppliers of whatever, that it will always be impossible to verify that, right? That you’re ever in compliance with that, because you would have to have provenance for every single part in the entire supply chain. And that’s just not feasible. This debate came up when the original FEOC rules were written. Where do we draw the line? How far up can we go to balance the legitimate interest in trying to build a China-resilient or China-independent supply chain and the need to actually make these tax credits usable and bankable?

And the reality is, if a project developer is going to the bank, right? Literally, a bank, to get debt finance for a project that they’re going to build 18 months from now, or 36 months from now, or whatever in the future. They don’t even know where all the parts are coming from yet when they’re going to the bank. And if the bankers have no confidence that you’re going to be able to demonstrate with 100% assurance your compliance with the tax credits, they will heavily, if not entirely, discount the value of those tax credits when figuring out your project economics. So they might say, “Well, there’s an upside scenario where you happen to qualify, and then our returns are great,” but they’re not going to loan on that scenario, right? They’re not going to factor it in. And if your project economics don’t work without the tax credit, they won’t loan to you. And so this is called bankability. If the tax credits are not bankable, which means they’re not certain at the time that you go in to finance a project. They’re just useless.

And that’s the key thing we have to watch out for, if there’s an opportunity to make any nuanced changes to the statute here is whatever they do, whatever the policy objective is, it needs to actually be usable, or it just amounts to a poison pill like you said.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDMwMDU0OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwMjQ2MTM4MH0.S-BOJAKz29URkcaUabS_IuKKWt7rNYCiCDk0Z4N_Iq4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-22 10:14:00.445977

Senator Fabiano Contarato (Workers’ Party, PT, of Espírito Santo) expressed opposition to the expanded use of the LAC.
Despite his remarks, the senator, who chairs the Environment Commission (CMA), did not impede the bill’s progress in the committee.
According to the senator, the new rule contradicts the understanding of the Federal Supreme Court (STF).
The bill permits the use of the LAC for basic sanitation projects.","Amid ongoing tensions with Environment Minister Marina Silva over oil exploration in Brazil’s Equatorial Margin, Senate President Davi Alcolumbre (Brazil Union of Amapá) successfully introduced an amendment to the proposed new environmental licensing framework that could, in practice, relax regulations and expedite authorization for oil drilling in the region. The amendment was incorporated into the latest version of the report by Senator Tereza Cristina (Progressive Party, PP, of Mato Grosso do Sul). The bill was approved by 54 votes to 13 and will now return to the Chamber of Deputies.

Prior to the report’s presentation, Mr. Alcolumbre stated that Ms. Cristina would provide “several clarifications, including debunking lies that have been raised regarding this text and this bill.” The proposal has faced criticism from environmentalists.

The legislation introduces a new category of authorization called the Special Environmental License (LAE) for projects deemed strategic, even if they have significant potential for environmental degradation, such as oil exploration in the Amazon estuary. The classification of strategic projects will be determined by presidential decree, based on biennial recommendations from the Government Council.

Mr. Alcolumbre’s amendment simplifies the licensing process, making it single-phased with prioritized processing. The licensing authority—either the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) for federal cases or state and municipal environmental agencies—will have up to 12 months to issue an LAE decision. The license will be valid for five to ten years, similar to other permits.

Before the LAE is issued, the project must undergo six stages: drafting the Terms of Reference, submitting environmental studies, obtaining input from relevant agencies, technical analysis (with potential requests for adjustments), technical opinion, and finally, the granting or denial of the license.

In another change directly impacting oil exploration in the Equatorial Margin, Tereza Cristina, who served as Agriculture Minister under President Jair Bolsonaro (Liberal Party, PL), accepted a proposal allowing companies to request a review by an internal board if a license is denied—as was the case with Petrobras and Ibama in the Amazon estuary. This board would comprise directors and include input from the company, the responsible ministry, and a representative appointed by the president.

Oil exploration in the Equatorial Margin—an offshore oil province which includes the states of Amapá, Pará, Maranhão, Piauí, Ceará, and Rio Grande do Norte—is a priority for Mr. Alcolumbre but faces resistance from Ms. Silva and Ibama. The presidential office viewed Mr. Alcolumbre’s support for advancing the environmental licensing bill as retaliatory.

During the vote, Ms. Cristina, vice president of the Agribusiness Parliamentary Front (FPA), defended the proposal’s progress. “What we are doing now with this new law is giving legal effect to the 2011 legislation. Basically, we aim to license with more clarity, efficiency, and fairness. The current tangled web of overlapping rules among various agencies and levels of government hinders important initiatives, generates unnecessary litigation, and discourages responsible investments,” she argued.

The proposal was approved by 54 votes to 13 and will return to the Chamber of Deputies.

Ms. Cristina also accepted an amendment from Senate Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) leader Eduardo Braga (Amazonas) stipulating that maintenance services and works on existing, previously licensed infrastructure—such as paved roads and transmission lines—will not require new authorization. Sources indicate this provision affects BR-319, another point of contention between Congress and Ms. Silva.

The bill also expands the use of the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), a self-declaratory license currently limited to low-impact activities, to include small and medium-sized projects classified as having light or moderate impact.

Senator Fabiano Contarato (Workers’ Party, PT, of Espírito Santo) expressed opposition to the expanded use of the LAC. Despite his remarks, the senator, who chairs the Environment Commission (CMA), did not impede the bill’s progress in the committee.

According to the senator, the new rule contradicts the understanding of the Federal Supreme Court (STF). He also linked the self-licensing of midsize polluters to the risk of disasters like those in Mariana and Brumadinho.

The bill permits the use of the LAC for basic sanitation projects. In a victory for the Agribusiness Parliamentary Front, the Chamber’s stance exempting the sector from environmental licensing—provided the requirements of the Forest Code are met—was maintained. Conversely, the bill reinstates large-scale, high-risk mining under the new regulations. Previously, such activities were subject only to resolutions from the National Environment Council (Conama) until specific legislation on the matter was approved.

The bill also includes strategic projects for national energy security among activities entitled to prioritized processing and simplified procedures in environmental licensing. To qualify, projects must be formally incorporated into sectoral energy plans and policies. This priority was already granted to basic sanitation works under the legal framework for sanitation.

As reported by Valor, the bill repeals provisions of the Atlantic Forest Law that require the removal of primary and secondary vegetation in advanced regeneration stages to be authorized only in cases of public utility or social interest, with approval from state environmental agencies and, in some situations, Ibama.

Driving the point home In an industry sector where safety, performance, and longevity are paramount, rigorous mechanical testing of materials used in EV battery systems is not optional—it’s essential.","As the demand for electric vehicles(EV) and hybrid cars continues to rise, the automotive industry is being required to shift emphasis to the quality and integrity of these battery components. The step change in moving from the internal combustion engine (ICE) to battery power introduces very different challenges as the industry is driven in this new direction.

Automotive batteries must meet stringent performance, safety, and durability standards to ensure long-term reliability and efficiency. Increasingly, this requirement has a knock-on effect on the second life of batteries as sustainability in the sector is improved.

This article explores the critical role of how materials used in automotive battery manufacturing—which includes metals, polymers, and adhesives—undergo rigorous mechanical testing to verify their quality and to maintain industry standards.

The importance of testing materials for automotive batteries

Automotive battery final assemblies are surprisingly complex, comprising multiple components from cell internal electrodes, separators, casings and terminals to interconnects and current collectors up to modules and packs and their physical containment structures.

Each component must withstand mechanical, thermal, and environmental stresses throughout its lifecycle.

Key mechanical tests for automotive battery raw materials and components and assemblies

Quality testing of components in the ‘tank-to-wheels’ phase helps manufacturers assess the strength, durability, and consistency of materials, ensuring compliance with international regulations such as ISO 12405 and SAE J2929. Safety is the cornerstone of many regulations, with tests to mitigate against the potential dangers of the electro-chemical nature of battery power—thermal runaway and the potential escalation to fire or explosion being a prime concern.

Mechanical testing adds impact, vibration and shock considerations (in-service or abuse) augmented by variations in environmental conditions.

Tensile testing of electrodes to current collector interconnects

Electrodes and current collectors play a crucial role in battery efficiency by facilitating electron flow. These components are often made from materials such as aluminum (for cathode) and copper (for anode) foils, which require precise mechanical properties to maintain electrical conductivity while withstanding mechanical stress. The bonding between the electrode plate and the terminal tab or [bond] wire interconnect is also checked in this procedure, which highlights the weakest link in either raw material or joint.

A pull-off tensile test on the terminal interconnect tab at the cathode (positive) end of a cylindrical cell battery. The axial force is consistently increased until failure, which may be the tab material itself or its welded joint to the casing, and the peak load is recorded. Efficiency and repeatability of testing a batch of battery samples is enhanced by use of a custom-built fixture to load, secure and release the cell. A serrated-toothed jaw self-tightening wedge grip ensures the metal tab does not slip.

Torque testing of electrodes to current collector interconnects

A twist on the mechanical integrity test of current collector tab manufacture is to again test to failure but by the application of a torque rather than an axial force. The vibration experienced by the battery pack in service will be random in nature and manufacturers take advantage of software-controlled systems to implement a variety of loadings in order to thoroughly test a component’s resilience.

A twist-off test measures the torque required to make the electrode tab fail. An adjustable clamping fixture grips the cell’s exact geometry enabling meaningful comparative testing of batches.

Peel and adhesion strength testing of coated battery components

The internal components of a battery are largely comprised of thin, coated sheets densely packed within the casing—the cathode, anode and separator elements. Efficiency is heavily dependent on the effectiveness of the chemistry inside the cell and these components are coated with films to maximize these reactions and optimize charging performance. The bonding of the coatings is tested to quantify the ability of the adhesion agent (slurry) to remain in place and perform over the lifetime of the battery.

Standard peel tests are used, of which there are several, to provide a range of data to benchmark a particular formulation’s suitability. A peel test applies pull to one substrate at a controlled angle, typically 180°, 90° and the Z direction (effectively 0°).

A 180° peel test on metallic film. In this version one substrate is adhered to the vertical plate fixture and the other is peeled by the upper grip of the UTM. By gripping the edges of both films with a similar vice grip in the lower fixture another 180° peel may be performed. The 90° test places the test sample on a horizontal bed which moves in the lateral direction at the same rate as the upper fixture pulls the film vertically, thus maintaining the appropriate angle.

A universal testing machine (UTM) implements specific procedures by means of fitting fixtures to hold and apply forces to a test specimen. Thus, the same machine may also perform the Z-direction test, whereby one substrate specimen (cut to certain dimensions) is subjected to a pulling force evenly over its cross-section, pulling apart—not a ‘peel’ motion in the conventional sense but a universally implemented and valuable measure of bond strength.

Universal testers for puncture and compression

Test standards for automotive EV batteries often focus on the deterioration in electrical or thermal states as a result of the test. A comprehensive and relevant standard is SAE J2464 which deals with procedures replicating ‘abuse.’ In addition to testing methods which subject the DUT (Device Under Test, which may be at cell, module or pack level) to certain environmental conditions, there are mechanical tests which are used to determine the effect on electrical performance, or some physical failure which raises the significant likelihood of hazards—electrical, chemical or thermal.

UTMs can aid the mechanical ‘penetration’ and ‘crush’ abuse, with the use of appropriate fixtures. These cell-level and above procedures ultimately apply to final product assemblies; however, the physical strength of the materials used in the cell, module or pack enclosure is pivotal to the overall performance against these standards.

Dedicated dynamic testers for shock, drop and vibration

Further mechanical testing of these products and assemblies considers the added safety risks afforded by transportation conditions. Vibration, shock, impact and drop conditions form a comprehensive range of real-world external factors that must be guarded against with hazardous products. Dedicated machines—often of very large capacity, for complete battery packs—are required to subject the test specimen to these dynamic loads and record the desired data. These same conditions are also representative of the inputs that an assembled EV battery pack will experience under its intended driving conditions and OEMs can leverage the testing equipment to implement their own in-house quality assurance regime.

Raw materials characterization

Chemistry is key for improving the efficiency of EV batteries. Developing compounds and alloys to retain core properties that meet fundamental objectives whilst endeavoring to add charge-to-charge distance to counter range anxiety is the desired roadmap for manufacturers in this industry.

Measuring the stress-strain behavior to the point of failure of a standard dumbbell-shaped material test piece is the fundamental method of determining a raw material’s physical strength. The specimen is put under tension and calculations based on the load-elongation curve is used to quantify benchmark properties. Understanding how a new material with improved electrical efficiency might be impacted in terms of mechanical strength is a vital insight. Changes to the structure to elicit gains in conductivity, ductility, ease-of-bonding or thermal behavior must be evaluated against any significant loss in robustness.

As seen earlier, battery terminal tabs and current collectors are also checked in their final form by tensile testing. Their performance is greatly influenced by the inherent strength of the metal from which they are made and as a result, the weakest link may be within the joint rather than the tab itself.

A software-controlled UTM easily facilitates similar tests on other EV battery components such as the electrode separator, which is usually a polymeric material, providing useful economies of scale.

Driving the point home

In an industry sector where safety, performance, and longevity are paramount, rigorous mechanical testing of materials used in EV battery systems is not optional—it’s essential. From raw materials to assembled packs, understanding and verifying the mechanical properties of every component ensures batteries can withstand real-world stresses while delivering the reliability and efficiency consumers expect if they are to adopt this form of propulsion in the numbers that are needed to meet fossil fuel reduction ideals. As electric vehicles continue to evolve, so too must the quality standards and testing practices that support them—paving the way for safer, longer-lasting, and more sustainable battery-powered transport.",https://www.qualitymag.com/ext/resources/Issues/2025/06-June/Features/QM0625-FEAT-Auto_p1FT-On-the-road-to-vehicle-battery-materials-quality-testing.jpg?height=635&t=1747892966&width=1200,N,,2025-05-22 12:23:21.429316

She described the waivers as a “quadruple win”, benefiting public health, air quality, drivers’ pockets and the economy as a whole.
More than a dozen states follow California’s lead on emissions standards, according to the California air resources board.
Harris said she recently pulled up pictures of what air quality looked like in cities around the country in the 1960s before the Clean Air Act, the seminal environmental law that regulates the nation’s air quality, was in effect.
The American Lung Association also found last month that Los Angeles remained the country’s smoggiest city for the 25th time in 26 years of tracking, despite decades of improvements in air quality.","California has long been one of the nation’s pre-eminent eco-warriors, enacting landmark environmental standards for cars and trucks that go much further than those mandated by the federal government. Vehicles across the country are cleaner, more efficient and electric in greater numbers because of it.

But that could all change if Donald Trump and his Republican allies manage to revoke the state’s ability to set its own, stricter emissions standards amid a White House crusade to combat climate-friendly policies.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets and updates its own federal standards for all states on smog and emissions from cars and trucks, which the Biden administration made even stricter last year, saying they will save American drivers thousands in fuel costs and maintenance over the life of a vehicle.

But for decades, California has been granted the ability to make those rules even stricter to help address some of the worst smog and air quality issues in the nation, which are linked to a host of health effects that disproportionately affect people of color.

Lawmakers in the House of Representatives recently voted to reverse those waivers granted to California. And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate moved forward with efforts to dismantle California’s stricter air quality rules using a mechanism known as the Congressional Review Act, which usually allows lawmakers to overturn actions by federal agencies with a simple majority vote. That power allows decisions under the CRA to avoid a filibuster from the minority party.

The plan has prompted fury from Democrats who call it a “nuclear” option, saying it is an unprecedented, and illegal, use of the statute. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian have agreed, saying EPA waivers are not subject to the review law.

“This move will harm public health and deteriorate air quality for millions of children and people across the country,” said senators Alex Padilla, Sheldon Whitehouse and the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer in a statement.

Kathy Harris, director of clean vehicles at the Natural Resources Defense Council, emphasized California’s ability to mandate strict emissions standards for cars, trucks and buses had existed for nearly 60 years, noting the state has been granted more than 75 waivers under Republican and Democratic presidents.

Among the waivers include rules to increase the share of electric vehicles each year among all new car and truck sales, as well as mandates that auto companies introduce progressively cleaner vehicles.

She described the waivers as a “quadruple win”, benefiting public health, air quality, drivers’ pockets and the economy as a whole.

“These waivers are not new or novel,” Harris said in an interview. “California has historically been innovators in systems to help produce cleaner air and stymying California’s ability is a direct attack on our ability to limit pollution and health harming pollutants in the air.”

She added revoking the waivers would immediately lead to an increase in pollution on the nation’s roadways.

More than a dozen states follow California’s lead on emissions standards, according to the California air resources board. The standards now cover nearly 40% of new light-duty vehicle registrations and more than a quarter of heavy-duty vehicles like trucks across the entire US.

Automakers have largely followed California’s emissions standards as well so they can continue to sell cars there, as the state equates to the fourth-largest economy on the planet.

California’s governor Gavin Newsom upped the ante in the nation’s environmental future in 2020, declaring his state would ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Eleven states have also joined California’s plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by the 2035 deadline, a reality that has spooked major car companies.

Joe Biden’s administration approved the plan at the end of his term. Trump, however – a vehement opponent to many of the nation’s climate efforts – has vowed to see them reversed.

“California has imposed the most ridiculous car regulations anywhere in the world, with mandates to move to all electric cars,” Trump said during his campaign last year. “I will terminate that.”

Newsom on Wednesday cast the battle as a nail in the coffin for the American car industry and decades of public health advancements.

“The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean-air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,” he challenged Republicans in a statement. “Will you side with China or America?”

The Senate’s decision on Wednesday to move forward with its plan to restrict California, which came in a winding series of procedural votes that went late into the evening, may have sweeping effects far beyond the state’s borders.

Harris said she recently pulled up pictures of what air quality looked like in cities around the country in the 1960s before the Clean Air Act, the seminal environmental law that regulates the nation’s air quality, was in effect. She described normal levels of smog in California as blanketing the state similar to the apocalyptic clouds of wildfire smoke that have descended during recent fire seasons.

The American Lung Association also found last month that Los Angeles remained the country’s smoggiest city for the 25th time in 26 years of tracking, despite decades of improvements in air quality.

“I think we have forgotten about what our air used to look like,” Harris said. “We take it for granted because it’s a policy that’s been around for so long we don’t really recognize those direct benefits.”

“There is still a long way to go, we have not succeeded in fully cleaning up our air yet,” she added. “These types of policies help ensure we are moving in a positive direction.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ba468ccd9b44a159856c856148c9b36c1d97cc2/211_0_4710_3769/master/4710.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b17462dc80b1a3a55716a589e21d45a6,N,,2025-05-22 09:10:35.166457

The measure now heads to the Senate, where Republicans are eyeing changes to the legislation and hoping to pass it by July 4. The GOP is using the filibuster-proof budget reconciliation process to avoid having to compromise with Democrats.

“We’re delivering, and we’re doing it in a big way,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, Louisiana Republican, said. “To our friends in the Senate I would just say the president is waiting with his pen. The American people are waiting for this relief.”

Mr. Trump urged the Senate to get the bill to his desk “AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!”

“This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!” he posted on social media.

The 215-214 House vote capped a week of uncertainty as more than a dozen Republicans threatened to oppose the bill over various concerns when GOP leaders could afford to lose no more than three.

In the end, only two Republicans voted against the bill — Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — and one, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, voted “present.” All three were concerned about the measure’s impact on the deficit, with Mr. Massie panning it as a “debt bomb ticking.”

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.8 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, which most Republicans argue significantly undercounts the economic growth it will spur from tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks.

The White House Council of Economic Advisors is projecting the bill will generate 3% economic growth, which would lead to $4 trillion in additional revenue that would ultimately pay for the deficit spending.

Mr. Johnson said the vote tally should have been 217 because two Republicans who supported the bill missed the vote. Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York fell asleep and Rep. David Schweikert of Arizona arrived just after the vote closed, the speaker said.

Democrats were united in opposition to the measure, arguing it would cut critical benefits like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.

“This is one big, ugly bill,” Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, New York Democrat, said. “The GOP tax scam represents an assault on the economy, an assault on health care, an assault on nutritional assistance, an assault on tax fairness and an assault on fiscal responsibility.”

Republicans counter that the bill only targets waste, fraud and abuse in the social safety net and cuts taxes for people of all income levels.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Louisiana Republican, accused Democrats of engaging in “class warfare, dividing Americans” to try to get more power in Washington.

“How about we give people in America more power, take it away from Washington, empower the people in this country who have been struggling for too long?” he said.

While House Republicans ultimately unified around the bill, the months-long process was full of intraparty fights, mainly over how far to go in cutting spending on Medicaid and other programs.

Mr. Johnson had remained confident throughout the process that he would secure the needed votes to meet his self-imposed deadline of passing the bill by Memorial Day.

He received an assist from President Trump during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday with a group of holdouts from the House Freedom Caucus.

The Freedom Caucus members had threatened to block the bill unless provisions were added to further reduce federal spending on Medicaid coverage for able-bodied adults and to accelerate the repeal of clean energy tax credits.

The meeting ended with no additional concessions in the bill, although Mr. Johnson said there would be attempts to address the conservatives’ concerns through executive actions and future legislation.

The bill is built around a permanent renewal of Mr. Trump’s first-term tax cuts for individuals, families and small businesses that are set to expire at the end of the year.

It also expands upon those policies with new tax breaks the president campaigned on, like no tax on tips and overtime pay and deductions for seniors on Social Security and interest on auto loans.

“The one big, beautiful bill gives America a big, beautiful raise with the average American household seeing real take-home pay go up by as much as $13,300,” House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, Missouri Republican, said. “We will save or create 7.4 million jobs and 1 million new small business jobs annually.”

To win over a contingent of blue-state Republicans from New York, New Jersey and California, the bill quadruples the $10,000 cap on the federal deduction on state and local taxes, known as SALT.

The SALT deduction is prized by residents in high-tax states because they can recoup some of their money from the federal government. The deduction was created in 1913 when the federal income tax was established. The idea was to prevent double taxation.

As part of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, Republicans capped the SALT deduction at $10,000 to help pay for the broader tax breaks.

After weeks of negotiations with pro-SALT Republicans, GOP leaders agreed to lift the cap to $40,000 for most taxpayers, with a $500,000 income limit before the amount is reduced.

The cap and income limit will each rise 1% annually over 10 years, a cost-controlled effort to guard against inflation.

The package also contains sweeping changes to social safety net programs, including implementing work requirements for able-bodied adults on Medicaid and strengthening existing work requirements for SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.

The bill would ban illegal immigrants from accessing Medicaid, SNAP and a host of other government benefits.

Republicans included a new cost-sharing arrangement for SNAP in which states would have to fund 5% of benefits, beginning in fiscal 2028. States that have high rates of overpayments and underpayments will have to contribute more.

Conservatives pushed for a major overhaul to the federal-state cost sharing arrangement for Medicaid, but moderates balked and the final bill leaves that formula largely untouched while finding savings from the government health care program in other ways.

Medicaid was created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson to provide health insurance for low-income people, but it was limited to mothers and children, pregnant women and people with disabilities.

The program expanded under Obamacare to include low-income, able-bodied adults without dependents earning up to 138% of the poverty level. The law directed every state to expand the program, but the Supreme Court in 2012 ruled it optional. Currently, 40 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansions.

In addition to Medicaid work requirements, the measure would require states to conduct eligibility checks for the expansion population every six months, instead of the current one-year requirement.

It would also ban Medicaid funds from being spent on gender transition procedures and Planned Parenthood and crack down on fraud.

Another significant chunk of savings in the bill come from overhauling student loan programs.

Collectively, the spending cuts in the bill exceeded the House’s $1.5 trillion floor for savings. But the cost of the tax cuts, coupled with new spending far exceeds that amount, resulting in higher deficits, especially in the first few years.

The measure includes a $4 trillion increase in the statutory debt limit, which needs raised by August to ensure the government does not default on its borrowing obligations.

Among the new spending is $150 billion for defense priorities, including $34 billion for shipbuilding and other maritime infrastructure, $25 billion for a “Golden Dome” missile defense system and $21 billion to restock America’s munitions arsenal.

The legislation includes $46.5 billion to complete Mr. Trump’s border wall and erect other barriers along the southern border with Mexico, along with technological enhancements to support real-time monitoring and response.

The Customs and Border Patrol agency would see a funding boost, including $5 billion to improve facilities, $4.1 billion to hire more than 8,000 new employees and $2 billion for retention and signing bonuses.

Other immigration enforcement funding in the bill includes $45 billion to expand detention capacity, $14.4 billion for transportation and removal operations, $8 billion to hire Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and personnel and $1.25 billion to hire immigration judges and support staff.

And a last-minute add would provide $12 billion for the Homeland Security Department to give grants to states for costs associated with enforcing federal immigration laws and supporting “federal border security missions” since the beginning of the Biden administration.

Texas has requested the federal government reimburse the state for $11 billion in costs spent on Operation Lone Star, which Gov. Greg Abbott launched because, he said, the Biden administration wasn’t taking enough action to secure the border.

Energy provisions in the bill would reinstate quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales; expedite permitting for natural gas exploration and carbon dioxide, oil, or hydrogen pipeline projects; and establish a process for project sponsors to pay a fee to ensure delivery of environmental reviews in under a year.

Various energy and immigration fees in the bill raise new revenue, as would provisions requiring federal employees to contribute more to their retirement.

House Republicans have passed their massive bill to enact the heart of President Trump's domestic agenda, overcoming deep divisions inside the party to advance legislation that would cut trillions of dollars in taxes while scaling back safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP.

The final vote was 215-214.

The new legislation aims to satisfy competing demands from fiscal hawks looking to reduce the deficit to blue state Republicans looking to lock in more favorable taxes for their constituents.

The Thursday vote followed a day of near-constant negotiations within the GOP. The talks included a White House meeting between Trump, Johnson, R-La., and several holdouts and skeptics.

Johnson entered the vote needing near unanimous support from his members for the bill to pass. House passage is one step in a lengthy process. Republicans still face more challenges in the Senate where lawmakers have already signalled reservations about key elements of the plan.

The sweeping piece of legislation runs more than 1,000 pages long. Here's a brief look at what's inside the latest version.

Note: This is a partial list that will be updated.

Extending the Trump tax cuts

The Republican plan calls for roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts — the bulk of which would come by extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts. Those cuts are due to expire at the end of the year, so without an extension, most households would see their taxes go up.

No taxes on tips or overtime

The bill includes temporary changes designed to make good on several of Trump's campaign pledges, including no taxes on overtime earned between 2026 and 2028. The plan would also allow Americans to deduct interest on car loans — but only if the car is made in the U.S. It would increase the child tax credit to $2,500 until 2028 — but only for people with Social Security numbers. After that, it would drop to $2,000 and grow with inflation. It would allow for a higher standard deduction through 2028, and to deliver on Trump's pledge not to tax Social Security benefits, the bill would allow for an extra $4,000 deduction for people over the age of 65, but it phases out for people at higher incomes.

More SALT

One of the thorniest issues during negotiations has been the state and local tax deduction, also known as SALT. The deduction is hugely important to a small number of GOP lawmakers from blue states with high taxes, like California and New York. The 2017 tax cuts capped the SALT deduction at $10,000. The House plan would lift the cap to $40,000 for married couples with incomes up to $500,000.

Work requirements for Medicaid

The bill includes several proposed changes to Medicaid — the joint federal/state health care program for low-income, elderly and disabled Americans. It's remained one of the most divisive issues throughout GOP negotiations, but lawmakers argue that changes introduced by the bill will bring in hundreds of billions in necessary savings through the introduction of new work requirements. Beginning at the end of 2026, childless adults without disabilities would be required to work 80 hours per month to qualify for benefits.

The legislation also zeroes in on what Republicans characterize as ""waste fraud and abuse"" within the program by shifting the enrollment period from once a year to every six months and adding additional income and residency verifications for enrolled individuals.

Changes to SNAP

The Republican legislation also outlines reforms for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which benefits more than 40 million low-income Americans. The bill increases the amount states contribute to the program and mandates work requirements for able-bodied SNAP enrollees who don't have dependents. Independent estimates suggest these changes could result in many people losing coverage. Like with Medicaid talks, some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against massive changes to SNAP given its wide reach and the millions enrolled in the program.

Lift the debt ceiling

The House bill would raise the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion. Lifting the debt limit doesn't authorize new spending. Instead, it allows the government to pay for programs that Congress has already authorized. If the cap isn't lifted and the government can't meet its obligations, then it will be at risk of default – a scenario that economists say would be catastrophic not just for the U.S., but the global financial system as a whole. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has told Congress that without action, the U.S. will run out of money to pay its bills as soon as August, which means the clock is ticking.

The American people have a right to clean air, clean water, and a safe and healthy future for their children and grandchildren.
This bill puts all of that at risk.” ###","Washington, DC – Early this morning, House Republicans voted to advance Donald Trump’s massive budget reconciliation package that would endanger our clean air and water, fast-track reckless oil and gas leasing and development, and raise costs on working families—all to give more tax cuts and handouts to billionaires and corporate polluters. The bill passed by a single vote, 215-214, and now heads to the Senate where it faces an uncertain fate.

As currently written, the bill would repeal most Inflation Reduction Act clean energy tax credits and investments, expand and expedite approvals for on- and off-shore oil and gas drilling, kneecap important environmental protections and public health safeguards by killing pollution standards for cars and trucks and methane pollution. Final House language also includes “pay to pollute” provisions that would allow corporate polluters to pay a fee to skirt long-standing environmental laws and review processes, and have those permits automatically approved.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released an analysis just this week confirming that the bill would also end lifesaving health care coverage for more than 13 million Americans on Medicaid, raise the deficit by $2.3 trillion over a decade, and automatically trigger more than $500 billion in cuts to the Medicare program that senior citizens rely on.

In response, Sierra Club Legislative Director Melinda Pierce released the following statement:

“This bill is a disaster for working Americans. It endangers our clean air and water, will devastate our growing economy and the manufacturing jobs that are powering it, and opens up our precious lands and waters to even more reckless oil and gas drilling—all to reward Trump and Republicans’ billionaire buddies and corporate polluter pals. This budget package is the sad result of a process that has truly been a race to the bottom as Congressional Republicans make demand after demand to make the bill more cruel and even more disruptive to working families at every turn. The Senate cannot and should not advance this bill. The American people have a right to clean air, clean water, and a safe and healthy future for their children and grandchildren. This bill puts all of that at risk.”

Republican leaders late Wednesday released considerable changes to their massive party-line tax, energy and border package meant to appease different factions and meet Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) goal of passing the megabill before the Memorial Day recess. It passed 215-214, with Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) voting present, and Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) joining Democrats in voting no.

The legislation would now enact even steeper restrictions on Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives, including quicker phase downs of “technology neutral” production and investment credits. Nuclear energy, however, emerged a big winner in the negotiations.

The updated text also scrapped GOP-friendly provisions, including language to sell or swap hundreds of thousands of acres in Utah and Nevada. Also gone is language on regulations, a mining road in Alaska and drilling in the Arctic’s National Petroleum Reserve.

Republicans appeared poised to release a so-called manager’s amendment with the latest changes Wednesday morning, but a revolt from conservatives sent leaders scrambling. A meeting with President Donald Trump and White House aides appeared to change the dynamics. Trump also visited the Capitol earlier this week to urge Republicans to set their differences aside.

“That was a very productive meeting at the White House. It’s great to have a president who is directly engaged with what happens in the other branch of government,” Johnson said.

The sprawling legislation also includes provisions to accelerate National Environmental Policy Act reviews and other permitting for companies willing to pay, new fees on electric vehicles and hybrids, cuts to climate grants and other spending, and expanded drilling and mining.

Johnson on Thursday morning said, “We’re accomplishing a big thing here today, but we know this isn’t the end of the road just yet. We’ve been working closely with [Senate Majority] Leader [John] Thune [R-S.D.] and our Senate colleagues, the Senate Republicans, to get this done and delivered to the president’s desk by Independence Day.”

Tax credit rollbacks

After firing off numerous letters and statements, the group of Republicans wanting to save at least some climate law incentives are divided about the result, and they are now looking to the Senate for improvements.

House leaders have spent days trying to balance demands from lawmakers wanting to increase state and local tax deductions, change Medicaid, and either gut or protect Inflation Reduction Act credits. Clean energy incentives appeared to have gotten the shortest end of the stick.

The latest bill — crafted with input from Energy Secretary Chris Wright — has new restrictions and faster phase downs of “technology neutral” production and investment credits. Projects would need to be plugged into the grid by the end of 2028, rather than 2031, to qualify.

But the updated bill includes a generous carve-out for nuclear. The industry would continue to qualify for production tax credits for projects that start construction by 2031.

And nuclear would be the only sector able to access the practice known as “transferability,” which allows project sponsors to transfer tax breaks to third parties.

By the end of 2025, the House package would implement requirements intended to disallow Chinese companies from accessing Inflation Reduction Act credits. The climate law also has sourcing restrictions, but Democrats included flexibility to allow U.S. supply chains for minerals and other components to develop.

Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, said he was “not happy” with the new language and didn’t cast a vote on final passage Thurday. “It is not what I had hoped it would be,” he said.

Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), however, called the changes a “compromise.” She had previously looked to the Senate to help protect some of the climate law credits.

Even though Trump has been demanding full repeal of what he calls the “Green New Scan,” Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.) said GOP leaders hesitated to fully repeal Inflation Reduction Act credits out of concern that projects already under development could be harmed, and that those costs would ultimately be felt by the ratepayers.

‘My San Juan Hill’

Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) prevailed in his efforts to strip public land sales from the package after threatening to vote against the bill.

The land sales, inserted into the measure through a committee amendment from Reps. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) and Celeste Maloy (R-Utah), would have ordered the sale or swap of roughly 450,000 acres across Nevada and Utah.

While Amodei and Maloy framed the sales as minor transactions to facilitate the development of affordable housing, it lit a fire under Zinke, Democrats and conservation groups, who argued the sales would circumvent the normal process for selling federal lands.

“This was my San Juan Hill; I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a statement.

“Public access, sportsmanship, grazing, tourism … our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands. I don’t yield to pressure; I only yield to higher principle.”

Conservation groups — and even some Democrats — were quick to laud both the land sale removal and Zinke himself Wednesday night.

“This is the right decision,” said Rep Dina Titus (D-Nev.). “The Amodei amendment would have created an additional burden on taxpayers who would have ultimately had to front the costs of infrastructure improvements needed for developments in distant areas.”

Jessica Turner, president of the the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, said Congress “avoided setting a dangerous precedent that lands can be sold anytime the U.S. Treasury needs a budget ‘pay-for.’”

David Willms, associate vice president for public lands at the National Wildlife Federation, thanked “Zinke and his colleagues who listened to their constituents and worked with House leaders to eliminate the provision from the budget reconciliation bill.”

Other groups, however, warned that more proposals for land sales could be coming and vowed to keep pushing back.

“Our fight is far from over. … To every lawmaker who supported this dangerous amendment, or who believes our public lands are for sale, we’ll never forget, and we’re just getting started,” said Land Tawney, co-chair of American Hunters and Anglers. “You kicked the hornets’ nest and we ain’t going away.”

Alaska provisions, regulations

Two Natural Resources Committee provisions relating to oil and gas drilling and mining were also sliced out from the final package.

Leaders cut language that would have smoothed approval for the contentious Ambler mining road in Alaska. They also axed a section to push oil and gas leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.

It’s unclear why the sections — popular with Republicans and members of the Alaska delegation — were removed. The Senate could add them back into the bill.

Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) said the bill’s passage “marks a historic day for America as the House took action to provide tax relief for working Americans, make generational investments in the American economy and unleash the full potential of America’s natural resources.”

The legislation still includes expanded offshore and onshore drilling, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Gulf of Mexico, and language to promote coal mining.

“The Natural Resources title of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ will generate billions of dollars in new revenue for the federal government, restore American energy dominance, turbocharge critical mineral development, streamline permitting processes and promote an all-of-the-above energy future,” Westerman said.

Republicans appear to have scaled back language — popular with conservatives — that would require congressional approval of major rules. Aides say the goal was to address issues with the Senate.

Pipelines

Republicans did not add back a previously struck measure that would have allowed hydrogen and carbon dioxide pipeline developers to receive expedited permitting.

Leaders stayed the course even though Trump specifically told Republicans to add the provision back in. Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) also said he was supportive of the measure following Trump’s comments earlier this week.

The section would have specifically allowed developers of oil, carbon dioxide and hydrogen pipelines to receive an “expedited permitting process” if applicants pay $10 million, or 1 percent, of the project’s anticipated cost.

“Who the hell in here is against pipelines?” the president said, according to a lawmakers in the room. But hydrogen and CO2 pipelines have been unpopular in some communities.

The bill still retains a similar provision that would allow natural gas pipeline developers to pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting. It did, however, receive technical modifications to avoid Senate procedural issues.

And the bill would require the Department of Energy to deem a potential liquefied natural gas export facility to be in the “public interest” — normally a key regulatory hurdle — if the applicant pays a one-time fee of $1 million.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/cb/7f/04e7d13141619d91e4c0720d70f8/u-s-congress-30887.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 11:05:23.863319

Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who has a reputation for working as a bipartisan negotiator, may think that the EPA’s budget is bloated, as he put it, but he’s focused on making sure resources for his district remain in place. He has said he successfully negotiated with DOGE and the administration to prevent cuts at a Social Security office, an Indian Health Services office and a National Weather Center office.

At a House Appropriations hearing last week, Cole pressed the EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, over deep cuts that could affect the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Research Center in Ada. The center researches groundwater and soil quality, and the administration plans to cut funding for research not required by Congress, reduce personnel and dissolve the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, the arm that oversees the facility.

“It’s a premier groundwater research facility, not just for the EPA, but arguably, in the United States,” Cole said. “That’s where about half of the country gets its water, is actually groundwater, it’s not surface water, so we don’t want to lose that capacity. And I just wanted to make sure [Zeldin] was aware of that.”

In the hearing Thursday, Cole asked Zeldin to discuss how the research from the center is used to meet congressionally passed requirements.

“Can you take a moment to discuss how the research carried on at Kerr actually would inform some of the EPA statutory functions and decisions that you have to make, as well as assist rural communities around the country?” Cole asked Zeldin.

Zeldin described the work done at the lab as important and said the investment should increase. He emphasized that a number of staff at the EPA are from Oklahoma and tribal communities.

“They have a strong and passionate fighter on their behalf in you, Chairman Cole,” Zeldin said of the lab. (The EPA referred NOTUS back to the exchange when asked to comment.)

As of Monday, Cole said he wasn’t actively negotiating with Zeldin about funds for the research center, but Cole wanted to make sure Zeldin was paying attention.

“We just kind of put a thought in his head, and we’ll see where we go,” Cole said. “We haven’t had a chance to visit or follow up about it since the meeting.”

Solar power has been by far the fastest growing new source of power in many parts of the country.
Texas alone added enough solar power last year to power roughly 8 million homes.
PJM states could not approach the solar power potential of the Sun Belt, but renewable energy’s prices were competitive in PJM’s power market.
The prediction didn’t factor in the near-paralysis in the PJM interconnection queue as project proposals poured in.","Second in an occasional series on PJM. Read the first here.

Seven years ago, RWE, a multibillion-dollar German clean energy builder, launched a bold solar power program aimed at American farmlands.

It proposed 28 solar and storage projects totaling 2,700 megawatts of new capacity. To move that electricity to cities and suburbs, RWE had to tie onto the mid-Atlantic region’s interstate grid, PJM Interconnection.

But RWE soon found itself caught in a Bermuda Triangle of delay — PJM’s “interconnection queue” — where solar, wind and gas projects wait for years for technical analysts to assess how the new power supply will affect the carefully balanced regional grid.

The regional transmission organization responsible for coordinating flows and managing the power market across a 13-state region from Illinois to Virginia saw its requests to tie onto the grid quadruple between 2015 and 2020 and continue to rise. In 2022, PJM stopped accepting project proposals to attack the backlog.

By the end of 2023, according to a review by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, half of those projects were shelved by their developer.

RWE shared that fate. It is still waiting for PJM to complete the approval process on 13 of the 28 projects, PJM’s data shows. On 15 others, it has simply given up, withdrawing the projects after spending nearly five years waiting for final decisions.

Unless the trends change, PJM — serving 20 percent of the U.S. population — will end this decade as a case study of a wasted opportunity to deploy mature, carbon-free solar technology.

Solar power production is up dramatically from a year ago, but it remains a bit player inside PJM, contributing to just over 2 percent of the power generated in 2024, according to Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent market monitor.

“Why are all those projects in the queue?” said Abraham Silverman, former general counsel of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. “Because there was consumer demand to buy clean energy. Those projects all thought that they had a market opportunity in PJM.”

The slow work of PJM as a gatekeeper for entry onto the grid is now colliding with skyrocketing electricity demand set for states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. As a result, old coal plants primed for closure may run for longer, and a rush to plan for more natural gas generation to power the tech industry’s data centers could cement fossil fuel use for decades longer.

PJM Chief Executive Manu Asthana has faced withering questions from Washington and state capitals about why PJM had not acted with greater urgency to shift into higher gear when it was clear electricity supply and demand were out of sync, with one eye on getting more of that potential solar power built.

PJM has made strides in overhauling its interconnection policy and hiring staff, cutting into the queue backlog, Asthana told Congress. “We had a queue of about 200,000 megawatts of generation,” he said in March. “We have whittled that down to 67,000 megawatts, an incredible amount of progress.”

But most new solar projects with interconnection agreements from PJM never started construction. Project financing became wobbly. Landowner agreements ran out. Supply chain issues cropped up. Plans changed during their time in the queue, according to an analysis by POLITICO’s E&E News.

PJM and MISO, operator of the central U.S. grid that stretches from Canada to the Gulf Coast, are pushing to narrow the gap between the number of projects entering their queues and the number that make it out with any hope of being fully developed.

Solar power has been by far the fastest growing new source of power in many parts of the country. It can be deployed relatively fast and at a lower cost than gas plants. Texas alone added enough solar power last year to power roughly 8 million homes. And solar and battery storage were expected to be more than 80 percent of the new utility-scale electricity added across the nation in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated in February.

‘Imagine how projects deteriorate’

The whipsaw effect of American politics and the relentless upping of future power projections are rapidly changing renewable energy’s prospects, building the case for gas power now and nuclear power after 2030.

Under former President Joe Biden, 15,000 megawatts worth of offshore wind projects were green-lighted along the Atlantic Coast. Democratic governors inside PJM counted on those projects to meet clean energy goals and power economic development. Their fate today is clouded at best, confronted by President Donald Trump’s fossil energy “dominance” agenda.

Under Trump and in PJM, coal is getting a new lease on life. But it’s also a result of deepening concerns about whether enough power will be running across PJM wires in 2028 to ensure (with room to spare) that the lights stay on and factories keep humming.

With the extraordinary rise in projected power demand, PJM CEO Asthana, who has said he will leave PJM at the end of the year, told lawmakers coal has to keep burning.

“We must keep the supply that we have today,” he said, going one step further. “We must try to bring back what we can from retirement.”

RWE, the third-largest U.S. solar energy developer, has pulled back into a more conservative, risk-wary investment plan that may foreshadow a slower path for new renewable power in this country.

“President Donald Trump has set a new course for the country’s energy and climate policy,” RWE observed in its just-issued 2024 annual report. “It is impossible to predict the consequence of the change of course in U.S. energy policy for the expansion of renewable energy in the U.S. at this time.”

A company spokesperson declined to discuss strategy but pointed to RWE AG Chief Executive Markus Krebber’s remarks prepared for the company’s annual meeting last month. There, Krebber outlined a policy to move away from competitive energy markets like PJM, which supply two-thirds of U.S. electricity by taking bids from generators’ to fill each’s day’s supply. (The rest of the U.S. is served by traditional regulated utilities.)

Given Trump’s policy and tariff whipsaws, the company has said RWE’s solar and wind deals will require data centers, utilities and other customers to pay up front for clean power.

“Only if these conditions are met will further investments be possible, given the political environment,” Krebber said.

His caution around new development is echoed by Mark Rostafin, co-chief executive of Texas-based Vesper Energy. Vesper just opened a 600-megawatt solar farm in the Texas Panhandle.

“You’ll wait till the permitting is done and you have good visibility into equipment supply,” Rostafin said. A customer commitment will be part of the final financing agreements.

Just four years ago, PJM’s cluster of states seemed ready to host a sharp expansion of solar and wind energy to back Biden’s aspirational goals for a carbon-free power grid. PJM states could not approach the solar power potential of the Sun Belt, but renewable energy’s prices were competitive in PJM’s power market. And many of the states had renewable energy targets.

PJM’s Grid of the Future report in 2022 predicted a bright future for carbon-free power. “PJM’s fuel mix will drastically change due to state and corporate clean energy policy targets, with solar and wind generation increasing and replacing coal and natural gas generation.”

The report expected wind and solar resources to grow between three and eight times over the next 15 years. The prediction didn’t factor in the near-paralysis in the PJM interconnection queue as project proposals poured in.

“Let’s call it sort of a slow-motion car pileup,” said Kent Chandler, former chair of the Kentucky Public Service Commission. PJM has tended to react to problems, not get ahead of them, added Chandler, who led the Organization of PJM States, a sounding board for state interests in the regional grid.

“It seems like PJM management fixes issues with a ‘squeaky wheel gets the grease’ mindset,” Chandler added. “Whatever issue poses the biggest risk, that’s the one they go to next.”

Jeff Shields, PJM senior manager of external communications, asked to respond to such criticism, said the organization has had to deal with costs of new generation that are higher than consumers want to pay. That has led to some “piecemeal” policy changes, he said.

PJM saw project applications accelerate in 2020 and had its new strategy in place in 2022, he said. “We have processed two-thirds of our backlog and will be fully through our backlog next year.”

New projects will be accepted in 2026 and decisions made in two years, he added. “[We] expect them to be a high percentage of renewable and batteries.”

PJM’s leadership is squeezed by conflicting climate policies in its domain, where blue states with strict clean energy mandates sit alongside red states that share Trump’s romance with coal. When Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro threatened this year to pull his state out of PJM over rising energy prices, PJM listened.

Would-be developers faced detailed analyses by PJM to make sure the new generation wouldn’t overload the grid, notes University of Wisconsin, Madison, assistant professor Sarah Johnston. In PJM’s case, three increasingly complex and expensive studies were required. Only at the end of the process did developers learn whether they would need to build new power lines or even substations to prevent possible overloading.

“Interconnection costs can be very high and are hard to predict,” Johnston and colleagues wrote in a 2023 analysis, with high-end charges reaching $41 million for a 100 MW plant. That is roughly one-quarter of the typical installation costs for a wind or solar generator plant, they said.

“Over half of the developers who reported withdrawing, suspending or pausing projects identified interconnection upgrade costs as a significant concern,” concluded Silverman, the former New Jersey regulatory counsel, and research colleagues who surveyed developers in the PJM queue for a 2024 report for the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy.

Agreements with landowners are only good for one or two years typically. “And then you have to start the whole process over again,” Silverman noted. “You can imagine how the projects deteriorate.”

AI stunner

If the backlog was a surprise, the generative artificial intelligence blockbuster stunned PJM and the rest of the industry.

In just the past two years, private-sector and government projections of power demand across the country through 2030 have changed a lot. Six months after the release of the Grid of the Future report in 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT, triggering what is now a relentless drive by big tech companies to secure electricity supply. PJM’s estimate of future peak demand skyrocketed.

PJM leadership is now riveted on the risk that existing coal- and older gas-fired power plants will retire faster than they can be replaced. Today, according to PJM, the grid has a comfortable level of spare capacity to meet the top demand forecast for this summer of 154 gigawatts.

By 2030, however, PJM predicts maximum demand could exceed 180 GW if enough power can be brought on line to satisfy data center developers. At the same time, today’s peak capacity of 183 GW could drop by 40 GW if plant retirements go as planned, leaving PJM’s market far short of supply.

To replace shuttered coal and gas plants with variable renewable power would require at least building 83 GW of wind, solar and storage, according to PJM.

Now, with energy scarcity dominating the outlook, the value of around-the-clock gas-fired and nuclear generation appears to have vaulted ahead of renewable power in PJM.

Evidence of this shift was the organization’s decision this year to offer fast-track reviews to “shovel ready” power plant projects that could have the biggest impact on future supply shortages. PJM’s criteria favored gas plants, which ended up by far the biggest source of proposals, offering more than 16 GW of potential new capacity. Just one small solar project asked to be included in the process.

This month, PJM announced it had selected 51 of the projects, and natural gas unsurprisingly dominated the list. Storage projects were chosen, but the solitary solar proposal wasn’t picked.

Opportunity lost

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved major changes in the interconnection process proposed by PJM that can help future solar, wind and storage projects, industry leaders and energy analysts say.

But many wish it had come sooner.

For example, PJM has scrapped a “first-come, first-served” policy that considered projects as they arrived and now prioritizes proposals that are closest to construction. Many of the renewable energy projects that piled up in the queue previously were speculative, but they still took the time of PJM analysts. The new policy should help the strongest applicants, including renewable projects, advocates say.

Another proposed change, not yet approved by FERC, would make it easier for new generators to take over the grid connection of a closed-down coal or gas plant as long as the total power output didn’t increase. A relatively simple, speedier review would replace the yearslong queue analyses.

“That’s a really important piece of creativity that PJM has embraced in order to move things along more quickly,” Andrew Levitt, senior consultant at the Brattle Group and former PJM market expert, said in an interview.

“I don’t know why it took them a while to get there,” he said.

“If these changes had been available three or four years ago, it would have been much easier to bring solar and battery storage on using the grid connections of retiring fossil plants,” said Hannes Pfeifenberger, a Brattle Group principal, in the same interview. “It would have made a big difference.”

“The human condition can be summarized as we ought to, but we don’t,” Pfeifenberger added.

“We would all say, ‘How come it took so long?’’ said George Hershman, chief executive of SOLV Energy, one of the largest U.S. solar project builders.

“We should have solar plants and storage plants at every decommissioned power plant in the country,” he said. “It should have been a quick study.”

PJM, a nonprofit with more than 500 energy sector voting members — who can leave the organization if they choose — deserves great credit for managing a secure, competitive power market, says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a research and analysis firm. But the members aren’t looking for more competition, he added.

“It doesn’t help that probably the stakeholders in PJM — the incumbent companies — tend to benefit from high prices,” Gramlich said, adding that a jammed-up interconnection queue that blocks new entrants serves that goal. “That’s not PJM staff’s fault, but sort of the structure of the situation.”

Hershman and other clean energy advocates hold on to hopes for solar power’s future in PJM despite the darkening present.

Looking ahead, if Congress cancels the clean energy tax benefits in the Inflation Reduction Act, “that is whole new kettle of fish that developers would have to look at very carefully” Silverman said.

“But in an alternative universe where PJM’s interconnection queue is a predictable, two-year process,” Silverman said, “I don’t think there’s any reason why you wouldn’t see solar projects flooding back in to PJM. The economics are all there.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/92/30/8a6ba4da4f429b94d5bfcc0a4390/ew-0826-iaconangelo-environmentaljustice-1160-01.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 09:10:31.028139

A further $522bn in investment is in the pipeline but is now menaced by the Republican bill’s removal of tax incentives.
And the legislation will as written cost the US 830,000 jobs by 2030 compared with the status quo, Energy Innovation found.
“Killing the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act is a direct attack on working Americans.” Other experts have also warned about the devastating consequences of the legislation.
Warring blocs in the GOP have fought for months over the fate of the IRA’s green incentives.","A Republican push to dismantle clean energy incentives threatens to reverberate across the US by costing more than 830,000 jobs, raising energy bills for US households and threatening to unleash millions more tonnes of the planet-heating pollution that is causing the climate crisis, experts have warned.

A major tax bill passed by the Republican-held House of Representatives on Thursday morning will, as currently written, demolish key components of climate legislation signed by Joe Biden that has spurred a record torrent of renewable energy and electric vehicle investment in the US.

Under the reconciliation bill, tax credits for cleaner cars will end this year, with incentives for wind, solar and even nuclear energy projects scaled down and then eliminated by 2032. Clean energy manufacturing tax credits will be axed by 2031, while Americans seeking to upgrade their homes to cleaner or more energy efficient appliances will get no further subsidy after the end of this year.

“This bill is worse than what people envisioned – it pulls the rug out from facilities banking on these incentives, it raises everyday household costs by hundreds of dollars and undercuts any sort of action on climate change,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan climate policy thinktank.

“You can’t overstate how significant this will be in weakening the US’s position. With inflation, tariffs and rising electricity use, it really couldn’t come at a worse time. It’s a really damaging bill.”

Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, more than $320bn has flowed mostly to Republican-held districts in the form of new clean energy development and electric car construction. A further $522bn in investment is in the pipeline but is now menaced by the Republican bill’s removal of tax incentives.

“You’re talking about half a trillion dollars of investment at risk from these changes,” said Orvis. “Over 10 years, we found that these changes would reduce US GDP by over $1tn.”

The legislation also follows months of attacks on green spending from the Trump administration, including the end of energy efficiency programs and climate-focused grantmaking and loans.

“If you take all of that together, all of these pieces have the same effect: it’s going to increase prices on everybody,” one former senior Department of Energy official said.

Republicans are currently wrangling over how far to slash the IRA’s tax credits, but the bill as it stands, as passed by the House’s ways and means committee, would cause Americans’ energy bills to spike by stymying new renewable energy – often the cheapest form of new electricity generation – the non-partisan thinktank Energy Innovation calculated. The average household would see their bills rise by more than $230 by 2035. This comes on top of the cost of tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, who has attempted to aggressively push the US to “drill, baby, drill” for more oil and gas at the expense of solar and wind, which he has called “ugly” and “disgusting” and barred from federal lands and waters.

“This will all come at the expense of the environment,” said Orvis.

The new bill will also cause the US to emit 260m tonnes more pollution than it would’ve otherwise in 2035, which is more than the entire annual emissions of Spain. While emissions would still decline overall, the US is cutting pollution far too slowly to avert the worst impacts from the heatwaves, floods, drought and other disasters fueled by global heating.

And the legislation will as written cost the US 830,000 jobs by 2030 compared with the status quo, Energy Innovation found. That includes the direct loss of jobs in fields such as solar panel manufacturing and electric vehicle production, indirect job loss from the decreased investments and lower clean energy demand, and induced cuts resulting from consumer spending cuts attributable to layoffs, higher fuel costs, and other third-order effects.

“The Inflation Reduction Act was carefully crafted to create good-paying jobs in deindustrialized communities, underserved communities, and coal communities. We have seen that it is doing just that, creating good jobs you don’t need a college degree to get and opening up pathways to the middle class across the nation,” said Ted Fertik, vice-president of manufacturing and industrial policy at climate and labor advocacy group Blue Green Alliance. “Killing the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act is a direct attack on working Americans.”

Other experts have also warned about the devastating consequences of the legislation. By 2028, the reconciliation bill would kill approximately 300,000 jobs in the solar and energy storage sectors, found an analysis from the industry group Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) released on Monday.

Organized labor is increasingly speaking out against the megabill. This week, the president of the North America’s Building Trades Unions said: “Job cuts for blue-collar Americans should not foot the bill for billionaire tax cuts.” And last week, the president of an electrical worker union in Washington state wrote an op-ed defending the IRA.

Warring blocs in the GOP have fought for months over the fate of the IRA’s green incentives. While some moderate, IRA-defending Republicans floated reconciliation language aimed at preserving its green credits, a handful of hardliners are demanding an even quicker phaseout of clean energy programs.

The latter faction has critiqued the IRA on the grounds that it is anti-populist, with Oklahoma congressperson Josh Brecheen deeming it “nothing more than a massive, taxpayer-funded gift to green energy lobbyists and their leftist billionaire employers” and Texas congressperson Chip Roy critiquing calling it the “green new scam”.

But the rich are expected to benefit most from the reconciliation bill’s tax cuts, while the rollback of IRA credits is expected to raise household costs and slash employment – particularly in red districts, which have enjoyed the vast majority of investment spurred by the IRA.

The Republican legislation, which would act as an effective repeal of the climate bill, is compounded by the actions of the Trump administration, which has set about eviscerating rules limiting pollution from cars, trucks and power plants and sought to halt other efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

The combined impact of all these actions is set to exact a greater toll than the bill itself, resulting in as much as 730m tonnes of extra pollution over the next decade, a separate study by Rhodium, another energy research group, has found.

“This is just about as bad as it gets,” said Ben King, associate director at Rhodium. “If you’re a solar or wind developer, there’s no reason you’d choose the US rather than China after this. The proposals are cutting off the nose to spite the face, it’s unclear what the policy objectives are other than they don’t like the policies.

In 2023, some staff garden volunteers branched off and established Cadillac Urban Gardens as an independent nonprofit.
While some Detroit farms implement a pay-what-you-can policy, Cadillac Urban Gardens has removed the cost completely.
Cadillac Urban Gardens changes perspectives at the intergenerational level, he said.","A parking lot-turned-garden in Southwest Detroit is growing several tons of free produce each year for residents in a neighborhood with some of the highest rates of food insecurity in the city.

And the May addition of a new greenhouse and electricity at the lot at 4601 Merritt St. will allow the garden to grow to new heights and serve more neighbors.

Purple basil, salad mix, tomatoes, squash, and potatoes are among the herbs and vegetables grown in shipping containers repurposed from General Motors Co. at Cadillac Urban Gardens. Forty-one percent of residents in the census tract surrounding the urban farm live below the poverty line, according to census data – double the rate for Wayne County residents overall.

“We don’t charge for any of our produce, which is a little bit crazy,” said Dolores Perales, co-executive director of Cadillac Urban Gardens, noting the garden typically grows around 5,000 pounds of food between May and October.

“What we believe is to have true food equity, you have to take the price out of the equation,” she said.

Cadillac Urban Gardens was first established in 2012 by Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision, the Ideal Group, General Motors, residents, nonprofits, businesses, schools, and other community groups. In 2023, some staff garden volunteers branched off and established Cadillac Urban Gardens as an independent nonprofit.

While some Detroit farms implement a pay-what-you-can policy, Cadillac Urban Gardens has removed the cost completely. The new greenhouse will scale the operations up even more, extending the garden’s growing season and allowing it to grow microgreens and other foods inside.

Residents can visit the farm between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday and every other Saturday and, alongside a staff member, can harvest whatever they want.

In addition to an open-door policy, the garden partners with local centers to distribute produce, like the Perry Outreach Center, which provides food, health, and education services to residents of the Boynton neighborhood.

Randall Mosley, director of the Perry Outreach Center, said 100 families visit the center each month, and partnering with Cadillac Urban Gardens is a winning collaboration to offer fresh produce.

“A lot of the people that just go to food pantries, rarely do they get meat or vegetables or fruit – or they get just six apples and that’s it. That’s not enough to sustain a family,” he said. “It’s a wonderful thing for people to get fresh fruit, fresh vegetables. There’s not even a supermarket in the Boynton neighborhood.”

The Boynton neighborhood, in 48217, Michigan’s most polluted ZIP code, earned the moniker for 42 area industrial facilities that release hazardous air pollutants. But Mosley said the industry, like the Marathon Petroleum Corporation oil refinery, gets too much of the attention for the issues afflicting the community.

“The diet of people in the Boynton neighborhood, Melville, Ecorse – is part of the

problem. It’s not just Marathon,” he said.

In many Detroit neighborhoods, grocery stores tend to be stocked with canned, boxed, frozen and/or highly processed foods, not fresh foods, according to the Detroit Food Policy Council. Efforts like Cadillac Urban Gardens fill the gaps.

Food insecurity rates in the 48217 neighborhood and the 48209 ZIP code, where Cadillac Urban Gardens is located, decreased between 2014 and 2021, according to a citywide analysis by Data Driven Detroit.

Beyond the fresh produce, Mosley appreciates the urban garden’s programming for kids and teens. Sometimes, Mosley said, food pantry visitors are resistant to taking fresh vegetables, because they may be unfamiliar with them and how to cook them, or think they don’t like them. Cadillac Urban Gardens changes perspectives at the intergenerational level, he said.

The garden provides summer jobs and training to youth ages 14 to 24 related to environmental research, sustainable food systems, or media and development, as well as a six-week STEM camp. The garden also takes weekly volunteers and teaches them about urban farming, and cultivating young people into leaders and uplifting community elders as teachers.

“They get kids involved planting the food, tending the garden and harvesting the food. First of all, children enjoy that. Second of all, now they start to eat the food that comes out of the garden. They’ll eat the carrots and tomatoes, and they’ll find that they enjoy them. In the next generation, you won’t see this love for processed food, and you’ll see more of a yearning for fresh fruits and vegetables,” said Mosley.

Perales, the co-executive director, got her start at the garden as a teenager when she began volunteering more than a decade ago.

“Growing up in Detroit, I was always used to seeing truck traffic and having issues with my asthma because of air pollution,” she said. “The garden was the catalyst that really got me interested in the environmental field. It was the first time I was actually able to experience something that was something positive that related back to the environment.”

In addition to leading Cadillac Urban Gardens, Perales is a planner for Detroit’s City Planning Commission. There, she works on projects like an ordinance to allow for urban livestock keeping in Detroit and an ordinance to support more composting in the city. Working for the city allows her to help Detroiters in their quest for environmental justice from both the grassroots level, and the institutional level.

“Being able to work on the opposite end and finding ways to ensure that especially items that pertain more to the environmental field, like growing your own food, allowing certain uses on your property that promote food equity or sustainable food systems, is really impactful for me,” she said. “We want to use it as a seed starting station to grow – especially in the wintertime -microgreens, as well as shallow root plants so that we can continuously hopefully harvest throughout the winter time.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.bridgedetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1281.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-22 07:06:31.399348

Sniffer Robotics, an Ann Arbor-based company, developed the only EPA-approved drone for landfill methane detection.
“Once enough landfill gas is generated, it will follow the path of least resistance to escape,” he said.
“We’re the sixth-largest producer of landfill methane emissions, even though we’re only the 10th or 11th most populous state,” said Mike Garfield, executive director of the Ecology Center.
The economics of food waste disposal Food waste is the largest single component of Michigan’s municipal waste stream by weight.","Darwin Baas surveys Kent County’s landfill from the cab of a county truck, watching the steady arrival of waste-hauling vehicles dumping drywall, sofas, home clean-outs, and bagged leftovers tumbling out by the ton. An average of 800 of these trucks arrive every day. The South Kent Landfill — just outside Grand Rapids — is now about 95% full.

“Everything up here is going to try to kill you,” he tells visitors, gesturing toward the trash compactors and bulldozers weaving between soft spots of shifting debris. But it’s not just the machinery that makes this place dangerous — it’s the system itself, designed to make waste disappear with maximum convenience and minimum cost.

Baas, director of Kent County’s Department of Public Works, has spent the last 11 years trying to bend that system in a new direction. Under his leadership, Kent County has voluntarily captured methane from its landfill, continued to operate Michigan’s only municipal waste-to-energy incinerator, and proposed an ambitious Sustainable Business Park to divert food and yard waste, recover recyclables, and incubate circular economy businesses.

But most of the county’s 600,000 tons of annual municipal solid waste still ends up here.

Kent County is among a minority of counties in Michigan managing waste through a publicly operated system. The vast majority of landfills statewide — 49 of 60 — are privately owned and profit-driven, further reinforcing the incentive to bury. Baas sees this as a structural barrier to meaningful change.

“We need public-private partnerships,” he said. “The investments that need to be made are long-term — that’s not something the private sector is going to do on its own.”

The challenge Baas faces isn’t just operational — it’s systemic. As Michigan works to meet its climate goals, one of the most potent sources of greenhouse gas emissions is hiding in plain sight: landfills.

When food, yard waste, and other organic materials are buried, they decompose without oxygen and produce methane — a greenhouse gas that traps more than 80 times as much heat as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period. Though less visible than smokestacks or tailpipes, landfills are among the state’s largest sources of methane emissions, trailing only the fossil fuel sector.

Michigan recently overhauled its solid waste law, in part to address methane leaks. But even with new rules on the books, economic incentives still favor the cheapest option: burying waste.

Baas sees this as a core flaw in how Michigan manages its garbage — and a missed opportunity. In Kent County, he’s built an integrated system that prioritizes material recovery, energy generation, and composting over landfilling.

However, those systems are more expensive upfront and require initial and ongoing investment, which means aligning public infrastructure, private capital and long-term planning in ways Michigan’s current system doesn’t support.

At the heart of the issue is a tension between innovation and inertia — between new solutions and a regulatory and economic system still structured around cheap disposal. Michigan has the opportunity to lead on waste recovery, Baas argues, but doing so will require more than technical upgrades. It will demand a fundamental rethinking of how the state handles waste — and who bears the burden.

A new regulatory push

Michigan overhauled its solid waste law in 2022, in part to address methane leaks. The updated Part 115 requires all landfills — regardless of age or size — to self-monitor methane emissions and fix leaks through patching or installing gas collection systems if they exceed thresholds. New technologies, including satellite mapping and drones, offer more precise ways to detect emissions than traditional walkover surveys — but adoption remains slow.

Sniffer Robotics, an Ann Arbor-based company, developed the only EPA-approved drone for landfill methane detection. Its technology, already in use at Arbor Hills Landfill, can locate leaks faster and more accurately than older methods. Yet despite promising results, cost barriers and procurement hurdles have limited uptake across the state.

Michigan’s new rules also impose faster compliance timelines: sites must correct surface emissions within 90 days or begin designing a full gas collection system. Currently, Michigan landfills use a mix of active and passive gas systems — active systems vacuum methane to flares or energy generators. In contrast, passive systems may vent it directly into the air. Sites without active collection may eventually be forced to upgrade.

Tim Unseld, a solid waste engineer with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), said two landfills without gas systems have already detected surface emissions and made repairs. But those fixes may not last. “Once enough landfill gas is generated, it will follow the path of least resistance to escape,” he said. Ongoing repairs can become costly — pushing operators toward installing full recovery systems, particularly if they can sell the captured methane as energy.

Environmental advocates argue the reforms don’t go far enough. “We’re the sixth-largest producer of landfill methane emissions, even though we’re only the 10th or 11th most populous state,” said Mike Garfield, executive director of the Ecology Center. “The basic reason is simple: We’ve made it too easy and too cheap to landfill waste.”

Garfield wants the state to adopt enforceable best practices across the board — including tighter flare controls, real-time monitoring, and mandatory adoption of tools like Sniffer’s — and points to the 2022 Arbor Hills consent judgment as a model. Garfield wants the state to adopt enforceable best practices across the board — including tighter flare controls, real-time monitoring, and mandatory adoption of tools like Sniffer’s — and points to the 2022 Arbor Hills consent judgment as a model.

Arbor Hills, owned by GFL Environmental, is the largest landfill in the state in terms of the amount of waste in place, according to EPA. It has faced years of complaints and violations tied to odor, gas migration, and leachate issues. So far, however, EGLE has not moved to apply those stricter terms statewide.

“The Part 115 amendments of 2023 include what EGLE considers best practices,” said agency spokesperson Josef Greenberg, adding that the state’s current focus is on implementation.

The economics of food waste disposal

Food waste is the largest single component of Michigan’s municipal waste stream by weight. Yet efforts to keep it out of landfills face a steep uphill climb — in large part because the system is built to reward the opposite.

“Most communities are finding participation in recycling programs to have plateaued,” said Debora Johnston, a Michigan-based environmental engineer with Waste Management and technical standards committee chair for the Michigan Waste & Recycling Coalition. “And new organics collection and drop-off sites face many of the same challenges.” Waste Management owns and operates dozens of landfills across Michigan.

Disposal fees are typically based on weight, creating a strong financial incentive for landfills owners to accept heavier materials like food waste. “This is really carbon-rich material — it generates methane, and they can use that methane to drive biogas-based processes,” Desirée Plata, an environmental engineer at MIT.

It’s a perverse incentive, she noted, especially as Michigan aims to reduce methane emissions. Instead of rewarding diversion, the current system reinforces disposal. “We’re paying for disposal by the ton, not by environmental outcome,” she said. According to EPA data, 35 out of 60 landfills in Michigan — nearly 60% — have landfill gas-to-energy projects.

That tension sits at the heart of Baas’s frustration. He’s spent years trying to reorient the local waste system around recovery. “I’ve been told I’m an oddity in the waste industry,” Baas said. “Most people don’t see the system this way.”

Waste recovery adds expense and faces adoption challenges, said Johnston. “Capturing landfill gas generates revenue to help operators keep disposal costs down, helps protect our environment, and creates a renewable energy source for our local community,” she said.

“But separating out organics like food waste is expensive.” Indeed, the estimated cost for Kent County to meet the needs of a community of 640,000 to process 400,000 tons of mixed waste would exceed $400 million.

Plata said one of the most effective actions municipalities can take today is to fund composting. “Every municipality on the planet should be funding compost programs,” she said. “It’s one of the easiest things we can do to fight climate change — and it works.”

But Johnston points out the challenge of getting people to change their ways.

“Most communities are finding participation in recycling programs to have plateaued,” Johnston said. “And new organics collection and drop-off sites face many of the same challenges.”

That’s why Baas sees single-stream processing — separating out organics like food waste and recoverable items like recyclables and metals after pickup — as the path forward.

Despite setbacks, including the withdrawal of a private-sector partner, Kent County is moving forward with its Sustainable Business Park — a proposed 250-acre campus on county-owned farmland next to the nearly full South Kent Landfill.

The county has made a deliberate decision not to site a new landfill there and instead repurpose the land for recovery infrastructure that could process food and yard waste — which has been banned from landfills in Michigan since 1993.

“We’re past the point of building another landfill,” Baas said. “We’re trying to do something different.” Still, he acknowledges the economics won’t shift without public investment and new rules.

“We’ve determined that the highest, best use for these organics was mission critical,” he said. “But unless you change policy and infrastructure to make it go somewhere else, food waste will keep going to landfills — the lowest hanging fruit economically.”

This series, produced as part of the MIT Climate Solutions Journalism Fellowship, investigates how Michigan’s food waste system contributes to climate change through landfill methane emissions—and explores the local solutions that could turn the tide. From farm to fridge to landfill, we examine how wasted food impacts our environment, economy, and communities, and highlight the people working to build a more sustainable, climate-friendly future.

Then there’s the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems.","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Helio Castroneves felt an immediate difference — a subtle but noticeable uptick in speed — the first time he utilized the boost of horsepower offered by IndyCar’s novel hybrid engines around the imposing oval of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The question now facing the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, along with the rest of the drivers on the 33-car starting grid for the 109th running on Sunday, is how best to capitalize on the hybrid over 200 laps spent entirely on edge.

Empty it entirely and then wait for it to recharge, which might take several laps? Save it for short bursts for passes or to defend? Perhaps use it slowly to run down the leader or build a big advantage once out front?

“There is so much more that goes into this than I think people realize or recognize,” acknowledged Indy 500 veteran Graham Rahal, whose father Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race. “It’s an interesting thing. I mean, the hybrid, it’s quite powerful here. On a single lap if you utilize it correctly, it does make a hell of a difference in lap time or lap speed.”

The genesis of the hybridization began years ago, when IndyCar manufacturers Chevrolet and Honda wanted to better align their racing programs with a shift in consumer demand toward hybrid and electric vehicles. But the project was beset by delays as engineers struggled to fit a bespoke hybrid unit into the IndyCar chassis designed more than a decade ago, and that had to meet certain requirements for weight and safety, among other things.

The result was finally unveiled before last year’s Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries. It provides a quick boost to the existing 2.2-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 engines before recharging to be used again.

The system was introduced at Mid-Ohio midway through last year’s IndyCar season and has been in use ever since.

But it has never been used somewhere like Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds at the end of each straight can hit 240 mph, and the difference between winning and losing can be measured in thousandths of a second.

“I’ve had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it’s going to be at Indianapolis,” IndyCar president Doug Boles said. “I asked why and they say, ‘Well, you think about Indianapolis, how trimmed out we are — especially in qualifying — any incremental difference in horsepower makes a difference.

“We’re going to see some exciting racing,” Boles continued, “and the strategies that I have heard from drivers in terms of talking about how to deploy the hybrid vary wildly. It’s going to be fascinating to watch how this goes.”

It hasn’t gone without its share of problems, either, dating to an open test last month and right through practice Monday.

For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600. And all of that weight is in the back of the car, which has dramatically altered the way they are balanced and ultimately perform.

“That’s a lot of mass percentage-wise you are adding,” two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden said. “It’s almost like adding 200, 250 pounds to a stock car. If you said, ‘Hey, guys, we’re going to bolt 250 pounds to these stock cars, see what you think,’ I bet they would all go, ‘OK, this drives differently.’ And now we have to counteract it.”

Andretti Global driver Kyle Kirkwood is among many who believe the additional weight makes cars harder to drive, and Meyer Shank Racing’s Marcus Armstrong said, “I do believe the window is considerably smaller, the balance window.”

Armstrong crashed in practice last Saturday and had to squeeze into the field in a backup car on Sunday.

Then there’s the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems. Rinus Veekay’s hybrid didn’t work at all during his first qualifying run for the final row of the starting grid, while 2008 winner Scott Dixon had his practice Monday cut short after just six laps when a warning light blinked for an overheating issue.

Nevertheless, the hybrid technology will play a part in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” on Sunday. And if it comes down to the final laps, it could be a big part, as the leader tries to hold on and the chasers try to time their boost for a winning pass.

“I think it definitely adds some variables,” said Dixon, who will start on the second row. “If you’re sitting out front, you could be a bit of a sitting duck, especially if everybody is kind of recharged and ready to go behind you.

“I think the biggest thing that we’ve probably all learnt so far, you’ve got to be ready for change, is probably the biggest thing,” he added. “But I think it could ultimately change how the end of the race plays out.”

Household Energy Bills Impact on Households: Republicans are raising electricity costs for American households by more than $110 next year (2026).
That’s according to analysis from the Clean Energy Buyers Association, modeling the GOP's de facto repeal of clean energy tax credits in the bill.","House Republicans and President Trump are trying to jam through a disastrous tax bill in the coming days. If passed, this extreme legislation would take a sledgehammer to lifesaving programs and tax credits that create jobs and provide healthcare, food assistance, and affordable clean energy to everyday Americans.

Make no mistake: The GOP’s bill is designed to give massive tax breaks to billionaires by taking money out of the pockets of everyday Americans. Here are seven ways the Republicans’ sweeping tax bill is expected to drive up costs and eliminate economic opportunities for average Americans.

7 Ways Republicans' Tax Bill Will Drive Up Household Costs

1. Transportation Costs

Impact on Households: This bill will raise the price of gasoline by 37 cents per gallon—over $200 per year for the average gas vehicle. Costs for new electric vehicles will go up by $7,500, plus a $250 annual fee.

Republicans will increase oil demand by eliminating federal electric vehicle (EV) affordability programs, fuel economy standards, and tailpipe emission standards. Decreased efficiency and increased demand for gasoline will raise costs for everyone. Republicans are also repealing incentives for EVs, raising the price of new EVs by $7,500 and used EVs by $4,000. So, whether you drive a gas-powered or electric car, Republicans are jacking your costs up.

2. Household Energy Bills

Impact on Households: Republicans are raising electricity costs for American households by more than $110 next year (2026).

That’s according to analysis from the Clean Energy Buyers Association, modeling the GOP's de facto repeal of clean energy tax credits in the bill. Meanwhile, the latest modeling from Rhodium Group also finds that energy costs for American households could rise by as much as 7 percent—that’s $290—in 2035.

At a time when Americans are already struggling to keep up with high electricity and gas utility bills, it is outrageous that Republicans would rip away programs that would drive those costs down (PDF). As electricity demand continues to grow, clean energy is the fastest and most affordable way to get more power on the grid. If Republicans cared about driving down energy costs, this is the last thing they would do.

3. Gas Bills

Impact on Households: Households could pay $100 more by 2050 if Republicans rubberstamp an unconstrained amount of liquefied “natural” gas (LNG) exports.

The Republican bill allows corporations to simply cut a check to declare their LNG exports in the ""public interest,"" practically guaranteeing more gas exports. But recent studies from the Department of Energy project that unconstrained LNG exports could cost the average household an additional $100 per year by 2050. These rising costs would also extend to electricity generation and manufacturing.

4. Home Energy Efficiency Upgrades

Impact on Households: Hoping to save money by making your home more efficient? The GOP is making that more expensive, too.

Right now, households can leverage the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit (25C) for home improvements like heat pumps or water heaters, saving up to $990 each year on utility bills. But the GOP’s bill eliminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit at the end of this year.

5. Insurance and Housing Damages

Impact on Households: Insurance premiums will skyrocket, and people will lose their homes due to the worsening climate crisis.

The clean energy tax credits and other historic programs in the Inflation Reduction Act were designed to drive down climate pollution. But the GOP’s law would increase climate pollution and functionally repeal much of the largest climate investment package in U.S. history.

Climate change already poses a serious threat to housing markets: New analysis from First Street predicts insurance premiums will rise drastically and that foreclosures caused by extreme weather linked to climate change could spike by 380 percent in the next ten years, meaning hundreds of thousands more people could lose their homes. Repealing clean energy tax credits that are key to slashing climate pollution would only heighten the financial risk to homeowners caused by increased fires, floods, and skyrocketing premiums.

6. Groceries

Impact on Households: The GOP is trying to cut $300 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which currently helps over 42 million people across the country afford groceries.

Republicans are taking a wrecking ball to the nation’s largest anti-hunger program (PDF). These drastic cuts would result in people losing food assistance and push many additional households into hunger. It comes right as families are struggling with already high prices for groceries.

7. Health Care and Medicaid Access

Impact on Households: The GOP will kick an estimated 10.3 million people off their health coverage and leave 7.6 million Americans uninsured, raising costs for everyone.

That’s according to recent data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). In what would amount to the largest Medicaid cut in the program’s history, the GOP is pushing to deny coverage to millions of Americans by imposing burdensome, bureaucratic reporting rules, stricter, more onerous work requirements, and new eligibility restrictions. When people go uninsured, it raises health care costs for everyone, as hospitals try to recoup costs from those who can’t pay. In short, the reignited Republican war on healthcare would devastate millions of families across the country.

Further Harms to Households

Environmental Injustices

Impact on Households: More local air pollution means 350 additional premature deaths each year, and nearly 670 by 2035.

That’s according to the latest analysis from Energy Innovation (PDF), which finds that the GOP’s sweeping tax bill will worsen both climate and air pollution, particularly from power plants and vehicles. The bill also gets rid of key pollution monitoring programs, including those located in communities near polluting facilities and schools in low-income and disadvantaged communities. Cutting these programs means we lose vital tools to measure the pollution poisoning our communities, effectively hindering our ability to act. It's a green light for corporations to continue their long history of disproportionately harming communities of color and low-income communities, unchecked and unchallenged.

This tax bill will worsen the climate crisis, particularly for low-income communities. The costs of extreme weather and other climate-related harms are disproportionately leveled at working-class households, who typically have the fewest financial resources to respond to its devastating impacts.

Job Loss

Impact on Households: This Republican bill is a job killer, costing 830,000 American jobs in 2030.

As the GOP agenda drives prices higher across the country, hundreds of thousands of families will be hit with a second economic blow. New modeling from Energy Innovation (PDF) finds that the GOP’s tax bill would cost more than 830,000 American jobs in 2030 compared to current policy. Even this figure is a conservative estimate because passing this bill is likely to lead many companies to cancel clean energy manufacturing projects that are already underway.

US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pushes back the submission period under the TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule by nine months to allow modifications and the full development of reporting software.

On September 28, 2023, the EPA signed into effect the ‘Toxic Substances Control Act Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances’ (‘TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule’, SG 133/23). This rule requires businesses that have manufactured or imported PFAS, including PFAS containing articles, for commercial purposes between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2022, to report designated PFAS compounds to the EPA. The original submission period under the law was from November 12, 2024, to May 8, 2025, with an additional six months for small businesses.

On September 5, 2024, the EPA issued a direct final rule (DFR) which delayed reporting time frames by eight months (SG 142/24). The final rule pushed back the general submission period from July 11, 2025, to January 11, 2026.

On May 12, 2025, the EPA announced a second delay to the reporting window. Per the interim final rule, the start of the submission period has been pushed back by another nine months. Per the agency’s announcement, this additional delay will, “help to develop and test the software being used to collect the data from manufacturers.”

While the delay to the submission period is effective immediately, the EPA will accept public comments on the change until June 12, 2025.

In a recent note, the investment bank argues that the launch of Xiaomi’s new SU7—which it describes as an “electric Ferrari at a Volkswagen price”—is a watershed moment. The SU7, and now the similarly styled YU7, blend premium design cues reminiscent of the Ferrari Purosangue and Aston Martin DBX with pricing closer to a Volkswagen ID.3 or Tesla Model Y, fundamentally raising the competitive bar for every global carmaker targeting the US$30,000–40,000 segment.

The speed and scale at which Chinese tech firms are combining high performance with affordability is forcing Tesla to shift its value proposition:

If China has already won the EV hardware race, the next battlefield—and margin pool—is full self-driving software and data

Tesla’s pivot from “best car” to “best autonomy stack” is seen as a direct response to the shrinking defensibility of its traditional EV advantage

Xiaomi’s breakneck pace is especially notable. The YU7 is only its second model, but even Ford’s CEO has admitted that U.S. legacy automakers are years away from fielding a comparable offering. By the time they catch up, Xiaomi’s third-generation vehicles will likely have moved the goalposts again.

Morgan Stanley projects Xiaomi’s EV business could generate RMB 233 billion (around US$32 billion) in revenue by 2027—roughly matching Tesla’s total automotive sales from 2020. That level of scaling in just three model generations compresses what used to take incumbent carmakers a decade or more.

While Western governments may use tariffs to slow the tide, Morgan Stanley warns that top-tier Chinese EVs are likely to find their way to premium buyers regardless. In fact, some global automakers are already exploring joint ventures or tech licensing deals with Chinese firms to gain access to critical EV and autonomy expertise while limiting capital expenditure and execution risk.

In the bank’s view, equity markets are placing too much emphasis on Tesla’s near-term vehicle margins, underestimating the impact of incoming low-cost Chinese competition. The note underscores Tesla’s strategic shift toward autonomy as the company’s next defensible growth engine—spanning robo-taxis, logistics, and other mobility platforms—as it braces for a future shaped increasingly in Beijing, not Detroit or Silicon Valley.",https://images.forexlive.com/images/china%20nev%2010%20November%202023_id_680f48d6-bd14-4f6e-bd6a-4d4511af4232_size975.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 10:14:58.096670

Could that raise costs for Canadians? | CBC News,"Emily Chung, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/energy-star-canada-1.7540205,"Energy Star is a symbol and label that highlights energy efficiency under a program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since 1992.
How Energy Star Canada works Energy Star Canada, introduced in 2001, is technically administered by Natural Resources Canada.
To get an Energy Star Canada certification, products register with the U.S. agency, and are tested in EPA-certified labs to see if they meet Energy Star standards, Natural Resources Canada says – in other words, it's usually identical to Energy Star certification, and Canadian certification is automatic for U.S.-certified products.
If the U.S. cancels Energy Star, how will Canadians be affected?
""So it's very promising, showing what Canada's able to do with Energy Star even without the U.S.,"" Riddell said.","Energy Star, a popular program that highlights energy-efficient appliances from furnaces to dishwashers, is reportedly on the chopping block in the U.S.

It and other divisions that oversee climate change and energy efficiency would be eliminated as part of the Trump administration's reorganization of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Washington Post and the New York Times reported earlier this month.

That could affect the labels Canadians rely on to know what products will help them save on energy bills, say observers such as Sarah Riddell, policy research associate with the non-profit Efficiency Canada.

""They can see … just with that one symbol that it's going to be one of the top performers in terms of energy efficiency,"" she said.

But will that symbol still exist after the U.S. program is gone?

While Energy Star Canada is administered by the Canadian government, it relies on U.S. standards, certification and testing for many products — and it's not clear how it will operate without the U.S. program.

What is Energy Star?

Energy Star is a symbol and label that highlights energy efficiency under a program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) since 1992. Its goal was to identify and promote energy-efficient products to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The label is applied to:

Products such as appliances, windows and doors.

Buildings, including homes, offices and industrial plants.

To qualify, products must be tested by certified third-party labs and found to meet a certain energy efficiency standard. Some are also audited and re-tested regularly.

For buildings, a free online tool called Energy Star Portfolio Manager helps measure and track energy performance in commercial buildings, and certifies those that perform among the top 25 per cent of similar buildings across the U.S. Certified homes must be at least 10 per cent more efficient than those built to code.

According to the program's website, Energy Star has so far saved an estimated 5 trillion kWh of electricity, $500 billion in energy costs and 4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.

How Energy Star Canada works

Energy Star Canada, introduced in 2001, is technically administered by Natural Resources Canada. But it's a collaboration with the U.S. EPA.

To get an Energy Star Canada certification, products register with the U.S. agency, and are tested in EPA-certified labs to see if they meet Energy Star standards, Natural Resources Canada says – in other words, it's usually identical to Energy Star certification, and Canadian certification is automatic for U.S.-certified products.

Riddell's job is to see how Canada's standards for appliances and equipment compare to international benchmarks, and to lobby for higher standards in Canada.

She said there are two areas where Canada's program is independent of the U.S. program, and sets its own standards:

A few product categories, such as heat and energy recovery ventilators (which bring fresh air into an energy efficient building without losing heat in the process), which the U.S. doesn't certify.

Energy Star certification for new homes.

Why it matters

A 2022 Ipsos survey commissioned by the federal government found 86 per cent of Canadian respondents knew about Energy Star and 75 per cent think Energy Star - certified homes offer better value than uncertified homes.

According to the most recent Energy Star in Canada report, in 2022, over 3,500 new homes in Canada got Energy Star certification, and those homes were, on average, 20 per cent more efficient than other new homes, saving their residents up to $300 a year in utility costs.

Riddell said the program is simple and essential for understanding the efficiency of different products.

While some products also have to meet minimum energy efficiency standards, not all do. And while other energy efficiency labels such as EnergyGuide exist for some products, Riddell said they tend to be more complicated.

Meanwhile, for some kinds of products such as doors, windows, pool pumps and EV chargers that aren't covered by Energuide, Riddell said, ""Energy Star labelling is really the only way to know in the store that the product that you're buying is energy efficient.""

Buildings are the third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada by economic sector, after oil and gas and transportation. And buildings' emissions come almost entirely from space heating, water heating and other appliances in that order.

Besides helping consumers choose money-saving homes and products, certification is used by green rebate programs across Canada to determine which products are efficient enough to be eligible.

While the federal Greener Homes Grant is over, Riddell said there are still 64 different rebate and incentive programs across the country (e.g. from provincial governments and utilities) that rely on Energy Star.

""Energy efficiency is really essential as we electrify Canada towards net zero,"" she said, adding that it can both cut Canadians' utility bills, and reduce the need to build more expensive electricity.

If the U.S. cancels Energy Star, how will Canadians be affected?

When asked about this, Natural Resources Canada responded by email, ""We are assessing the potential impacts on operations in Canada.""

Riddell said in the short run, there's a possibility that the department could continue to run the program in Canada without the EPA, if the EPA allows it to use the Energy Star name and symbol, which are trademarked by the EPA.

""In the longer run,"" she added, ""there is the question of whether Natural Resources Canada would have the capacity to regularly update the Energy Star efficiency specifications for the more than 80 different types of products that are eligible for Energy Star in Canada.""

She added that only nine of the energy efficiency testing labs are in Canada, while 60 are in the U.S.

That said, Canada has managed to run the program independently for some entire product categories such as energy and heat recovery ventilators. ""So it's very promising, showing what Canada's able to do with Energy Star even without the U.S.,"" Riddell said.

If Canada can't keep the program up, she thinks that could make it hard for green rebate programs to determine what products are eligible.

The loss of the Energy Star Portfolio Manager online tool to evaluate the energy efficiency of commercial buildings, including for green building certification programs such as LEED and BOMA BEST, could also be a problem, Riddell said.

""That's very widely used across Canada to monitor, rate and optimize more than 40,000 commercial and industrial buildings energy use, and it's been doing so for the past 12 years.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7540223.1747853431!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/power-saver-aplliances.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-05-22 09:10:47.553994

The EPA, under the Trump administration, cancelled the grant as part of a broader termination of environmental justice and DEI programs.

KDHE spokesperson Jill Bronaugh criticized the ""abrupt termination"" and its impact on vulnerable Kansans.

The grant was intended to support climate resiliency and adaptation through public education and community revitalization planning, with a focus on sustainable food systems.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has lost another federal grant due to cancellations by the Department of Government Efficiency.

The DOGE ""savings"" website shows an Environmental Protection Agency grant to KDHE for $1 million was canceled May 7. DOGE claims a savings of $957,738.

Jill Bronaugh, a KDHE spokesperson, said the agency was ""formally notified of the abrupt termination"" on May 7.

""This unexpected action taken by the Trump administration, which does not allow for the recovery of previously committed funds, has had an immediate and significant impact on KDHE's ability to carry out vital public health work directly benefiting Kansans in rural communities,"" Bronaugh said in a May 21 email.

EPA cuts environmental justice grants

The grant was under the EPA's Government-to-Government Program. That G2G Program was part of the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, which was created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act.

The EPA in March announced it would end the ""Environmental Justice and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion arms of the agency"" that were established under President Joe Biden. The EPA cited President Donald Trump's executive order on DEI.

""President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people. Part of this mandate includes the elimination of forced discrimination programs,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said March 12. ""Under the Trump Administration, EPA is affirming our commitment to serve every American with equal dignity and respect.

""Some believe that so-called 'environmental justice' is warranted to assist communities that have been left behind. This idea sounds good in theory and receives bipartisan support. But in reality, 'environmental justice' has been used primarily as an excuse to fund left-wing activists instead of actually spending those dollars to directly remediate environmental issues for those communities.""

Meg McCollister, who the administrator of the Lenexa-based EPA Region 7 when KDHE was awarded the grant, said at the time that ""environmental justice is at the heart of everything we do.""

What Kansas was doing with $1 million grant from EPA

Bronaugh told The Capital-Journal the $1 million grant was to address food insecurity in Labette and Montgomery counties, which have ""poverty rates above the state average and a higher population of individuals who lack secure access to sufficient amounts of food.""

A federal government description of the grant said the ""project focuses on climate resiliency and adaptation through public education and community revitalization planning"" with an emphasis on ""addressing sustainable food systems in public green spaces.""

That description indicated Cherokee County was also part of the project, which involved working with the The Healthy Bourbon County Action Team. That action team previously said it was working with the University of Kansas Medical Center

When the EPA announced the award in October 2023, it said the funding would go toward activities like ""education/health promotion activities and community-driven strategies to promote food equity and environmental justice through engagement and community placemaking interventions, such as edible landscapes on main streets and raised-bed garden kits for families.""

Bronaugh said funding also went to school gardens, among other activities.

""The abrupt termination of this funding has had a significant impact on vulnerable Kansans who rely on these services to feed themselves and their families,"" she said. ""The loss of federal funds due to the Trump administration's mass cuts severely hurts KDHE's ongoing efforts and jeopardizes future work addressing food insecurity, specifically in rural communities.

""KDHE deeply regrets the disruption caused by the Trump administration's decision to terminate the G2G grant.

It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.
Without access to China's significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The world's sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China, leaving the global economy vulnerable to supply cutoffs that could disrupt industry and hit consumers with higher prices, a report said Wednesday.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency's report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity -- but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.

It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86 percent in 2024 from 82 percent in 2020.

China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75 percent. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.

The current trend toward export restrictions and trade disputes increases concerns, the IEA said.

""Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,"" said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. ""The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.""

Birol cited the energy crisis in Europe after Russia cut off natural gas supplies over the invasion of Ukraine. Another cautionary tale is the global shortage of silicon-based computer chips during and after the pandemic, which disrupted auto production.

""The golden rule of energy security is diversification,"" Birol told The Associated Press in an interview. ""And it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.""

Market forces are important in developing new sources but won't be enough. ""There is a need for well-designed government policies"" in the form of financing and other measures, he said.

China is a massive global source of critical minerals required for a wide range of goods that includes computer chips, robots, electric autos, batteries, drones, and military equipment. It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.

China has placed export limits of many of these key products and tightened controls on others as President Donald Trump's trade negotiations escalate, stifling U.S. industry and the nation's ability to find quick alternatives. Without access to China's significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.

Trump has made reducing U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals a core tenet of his first 100 days back in office as part of a national security and economic resilience agenda.

This goes beyond China; the Trump administration finalized a rocky deal with Ukraine granting American access to the nation's vast mineral resources earlier this month.

Trump is also looking to expedite deep-sea mining in international waters, much to the chagrin of environmental groups. He called for a boost in the domestic copper industry in a February executive order alongside other calls for the federal government to fast-track new mine permits; has reviewed a minerals proposal from Congo, a conflict-riddled nation also rich with mineral reserves; and attempted to strong-arm Greenland into providing more of its minerals to the U.S.

The IEA report said global markets were well supplied at the moment and that prices in general have fallen. It warned, however, that planned production of copper, which is essential for electric wiring and power grids, would not keep pace with demand and predicted a 30 percent shortfall by 2030.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/05/22/210173905_210173905-efdc8ed0c8d04a9f98cb7420fb828ad4_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-05-22 07:06:39.886984

Repealing these credits could lead to job losses in the clean energy sector and hinder the adoption of clean energy technologies.

Clean energy tax credits contribute to job growth, help meet rising energy demands, and lower electricity costs.

The proposed legislation contradicts the need for more clean energy sources, especially given increasing energy consumption and the closure of facilities like the Indian Point Energy Center.

As soon as May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote on a massive piece of legislation that would repeal federal tax credits essential to expanding America’s clean energy industry. To thousands of businesses across the country — including my father-daughter geothermal business — this bill appears unmoored from economic reality and devoid of any grasp of America’s complex energy system.

If these credits are repealed or rolled back, my Westchester-based company in business for more than two decades would shutter. I’d be forced into an early retirement, and the 18 local employees and subcontractors my business relies upon would probably be out of a job, too.

While the bill in its current form confounds me, I’m heartened U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-Pearl River, has consistently voiced support for federal clean energy tax credits. Indeed, the clean energy industry needs the support of Republicans like Lawler now more than ever.

There are three reasons why these tax credits make sense for New York: jobs, energy supply and demand and energy costs.

Since 2000, my company has installed more than 600 geothermal systems at homes and businesses in Westchester and Fairfield counties. Two years ago, we completed 42 installations, a record for us. Tax credits for geothermal and other clean energy technologies help homeowners and businessowners realize a return on their investment in as little as six years. As demand for geothermal systems grow, tax credits are broadening access to the technology and afford businesses like mine the market certainty we need to hire more workers, make capital investments, and meet growing demand.

Right now, we have 70 customers lined up who say they want geothermal. Changes to energy tax credits would have a chilling effect on this demand, likely causing these potential customers to rethink whether or not to move forward.

What could that mean for us? Our large Ingersoll Rand rock drill rig and three smaller drill rigs would sit idle, with no operators in the cab or behind the controls. My middle daughter would have to find a new job right in the middle of her career. And some 173,000 other clean energy workers in New York State — including nearly 10,000 in Westchester alone — would be at risk of losing their jobs, too.

Repealing or rolling back the tax credits also makes no sense in a county scrambling to replace the loss of the Indian Point Energy Center. When the Hudson River nuclear facility shut down four years ago this spring, the region lost the provider of about 25% of its electricity, just as energy demand started reaching record levels.

Fueled by the rise of A.I. and growth in data centers, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that nationwide energy use reached record levels in 2024; this year, the EIA forecasts a record yet again. Against this backdrop, why would we even think about pulling the rug out from under companies that are getting more energy online quickly and cheaply? It doesn’t make any sense.

Finally, weakening federal clean energy incentives would raise residential electricity bills in New York State by more than 6% by 2030. For two decades after that, an Integrated Planning Model of the power sector shows prices would remain around 6% higher when compared to a scenario where the federal clean energy tax credits remain in place. Why? Because clean energy is cheap.

According to Lazard’s industry standard report on energy costs, utility-scale solar PV arrays and onshore wind farms are now the cheapest sources of power in the U.S. Geothermal isn’t too far off, and in many instances it beats fossil fuels including coal and gas peaker plants.

With the House voting on tax legislation language soon and the Senate shortly after that, Congress is about to play a critical role in shaping U.S. energy policy.

Some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, are considering repealing the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy incentives. Supporters of the measure say cuts would threaten jobs in Alaska. The efforts come as Alaska's liquid natural gas supplies will not be enough to meet demand in the state. That means the state may have to begin importing gas causing prices to rise.

Jennifer Hyde, federal infrastructure coordinator at the Alaska Center, hoped clean energy projects could begin benefitting the state before the crisis takes hold.

""We're hoping that communities can seize on IRA funds in order to actualize on solar projects, on wind projects, on hydro projects, on a number of other alternatives before this crisis happens,"" she explained.

Begich and other Republicans signed a letter arguing that the clean energy subsidies in the IRA will undermine America's energy dominance - and inflate energy costs. But Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has supported the clean energy incentives.

Anchorage business owner Ben Kellie is concerned about the impacts of the possible repeal of clean energy incentives on Alaska's economy, and said the incentives can mean major savings for Alaska families.

""This isn't just saving a few cents off of a bill. A lot of these projects are in communities where people are paying over a thousand dollars to heat and light small homes off the road system,"" Kellie said. ""This is real money that not only stays in the community and circulates, but helps families make ends meet through cold winters.""

In 2023, about a quarter of all Alaska energy came from renewable sources.

A bill before Indiana legislators that would have prevented city officials from requesting energy information from large commercial buildings failed in this year's legislative session.

One nonprofit believes if Senate Bill 197/House Bill 1389 had become law, Hoosiers would have faced higher utility bills. The Thriving Buildings Program relies on utility usage data gathered between 2021 and 2025 to help lower utility bills.

Paula Brooks, justice director for the nonprofit Hoosier Environmental Council, said conversations between community stakeholders, public officials and residents about building environments are key to the program's success.

""It gave building owners the opportunity to benchmark -- which is, make comparisons of their energy and water usage -- to be able to identify ways to save money on utility costs and most importantly, improve the air quality, reduce carbon emissions,"" she explained.

A building environment consists of building and construction materials and is a major contributor to global gas emissions. With the program's collected data, it is predicted that public health savings in Indianapolis could reach $77 million by 2030. Indianapolis is responsible for 66% of community-wide greenhouse gas emissions.

Brooks applauds the Thriving Buildings Program because residents feel their voices are being heard as their communities develop. But these voices also oppose President Donald Trump's recent executive orders to build more coal plants to boost electricity generation, and to ensure the EPA is assisting in promoting America's energy security.

Brooks believes there is another alternative to using coal as a power source.

""Renewables is not only the future, but it's happening now. This distribution model that we have now, where the energy companies hold all the power, it's only about 75 years old,"" she continued.

Renewable energy creates opportunities to look at new energy delivery models or ""energy democracy,"" with solar for microgrids. So, rather than having a huge power plant somewhere, she noted, the electricity could be in a community and owned by the community, while contributing to the electric generation for industrial use.

The San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper filed suit against Calhoun County Independent School District, claiming it gave only 14 days’ notice — short of the 15-day legal requirement — and buried meeting details deep in its website.

The lawsuit challenges the district’s April 29 decision to grant ExxonMobil a 50% property tax break on a $10 billion plastics plant that could save the company $242 million over a decade.

Plaintiff Diane Wilson, a longtime environmental advocate, warns the plant's runoff would drain into waterways undergoing a multimillion-dollar cleanup following a 2019 settlement from her earlier lawsuit against Formosa Plastics.

Key quote:

“This wasn’t just a flaw in the process. We feel it was a deliberate attempt to avoid public opposition.”

— Diane Wilson, executive director of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper

Why this matters:

Tax abatements for petrochemical projects are increasingly common in rural Texas, where local governments face pressure to stimulate economic growth but often lack the legal infrastructure or public engagement to fully evaluate long-term impacts. When public notice laws are ignored or skirted, communities lose their ability to participate in decisions that could reshape their environment for decades. The ExxonMobil plastics plant in question could produce three million tons of polyethylene annually, adding to the region's legacy of industrial pollution. The area’s waterways, already subject to plastic waste and chemical runoff, risk further contamination. These waters feed into ecosystems and fishing grounds vital to both local livelihoods and biodiversity. Plastics production also brings air emissions, energy use, and microplastics that can infiltrate soils and bodies.

In short:

Atmospheric monitoring reveals that global HFC-23 emissions in 2023 were five times higher than what countries reported to the United Nations, with 40% traced to eastern China.

The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol mandates the destruction of HFC-23, but vague language like “to the extent practicable” and weak enforcement mechanisms have allowed continued emissions.

While China installed incinerators to destroy HFC-23 with help from UN subsidies, new draft rules remain unenforced, and emissions persist from both known and possibly untracked sources.

Key quote:

“There is a powerful greenhouse gas that countries are, for whatever reason, not destroying, even though they should and have the means to, and that’s quite concerning.”

— Ben Adam, researcher, University of Bristol and lead author of the study

Why this matters:

Trifluoromethane, or HFC-23, is an industrial byproduct thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. It’s largely produced during the manufacture of HCFC-22, a chemical once widely used in refrigeration and now being phased out due to its ozone-depleting effects. Although technologies exist to eliminate HFC-23 emissions almost entirely, lax enforcement and vague language in international treaties have allowed substantial emissions to continue, especially from factories in China. Poor monitoring capacity in regions like central China, India, and Russia compounds the issue. Meanwhile, U.S. agencies like NASA, which support global air monitoring efforts, face budget cuts, threatening critical data collection. Without independent verification, nations can underreport emissions without consequence.

In short:

Despite Colorado’s 2022 law banning PFAS use and mandating full chemical disclosure within 150 days of fracking operations, more than 60% of wells fracked since July 2023 lack required filings. Chevron, operating over 375 such wells, is the largest non-compliant operator.

A blowout at Chevron’s Noble Bishop site in April released toxic chemicals into the air near Galeton, exposing residents to benzene levels up to 10 times the safety threshold. Students measuring air quality at the site described overwhelming fumes and health effects.

Environmental and public health advocates say the lack of transparency hampers medical care, exposes communities to toxic substances, and undermines state efforts to protect water, air, and health. Enforcement of disclosure rules remains weak nearly two years after the law took effect.

Key quote:

“This just kind of proves that you need to be transparent about what you’re putting in those wells. Because when incidents like this happen, people don’t know what they’re breathing, they don’t know what’s going into the air.”

— Jared Stickney, graduate student, Colorado State University

Why this matters:

Colorado’s attempt to lead the nation with stricter transparency laws was meant to pierce the veil of “trade secret” protections that have long shielded the oil and gas industry from scrutiny. But the weak enforcement of these new rules leaves many residents vulnerable to unknown exposures. PFAS and other persistent chemicals used in drilling fluids can contaminate drinking water, linger in the environment, and accumulate in the human body over time. Even short-term exposure to substances like benzene is linked to leukemia and other health problems. And when spills and blowouts occur, the lack of chemical disclosure means first responders and medical professionals are left guessing about what people were exposed to.

In short:

A new report from Global Energy Monitor warns that India’s coal-reliant steel expansion could double the sector’s carbon emissions within five years, threatening its own climate targets and global decarbonization milestones.

India plans to boost steel capacity from 200 million to over 330 million tonnes per year by 2030, with more than half of the new capacity relying on coal-based technologies.

While much of this capacity is still on paper, analysts say India has a narrow window to pivot toward cleaner production methods like electric arc furnaces and scrap-based steelmaking.

Key quote:

“India is now the bellwether of global steel decarbonization. If the country does not increase its plans for green steel production, the entire sector will miss an important milestone. So goes India, so goes the world.”

— Astrid Grigsby-Schulte, project manager, Global Iron and Steel Tracker at GEM

Why this matters:

Steelmaking is one of the world’s most polluting industries, accounting for nearly 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. India’s deepening reliance on coal in this sector puts it at odds with climate goals it helped shape, including net-zero pledges and clean energy targets. As the second-largest steel producer, India wields outsized influence over whether the global industry can decarbonize quickly enough to avoid the worst climate impacts. The environmental stakes go beyond CO₂: steel plants are major sources of air and water pollution, with documented effects on respiratory health and local ecosystems. Coal combustion also emits toxic substances like mercury and fine particulate matter, contributing to premature deaths and chronic illnesses. India’s decision to greenlight massive coal-based capacity now could lock in emissions for decades.

In short:

Nearly seven million hectares of primary tropical forest were lost in 2024, with almost half due to wildfires, according to data from the World Resources Institute and the University of Maryland.

Fires also devastated boreal forests in Russia and Canada, contributing to 30 million hectares of tree cover loss worldwide and releasing 4.1 gigatons of greenhouse gases.

The EU postponed the start of its anti-deforestation law to 2025, with conservative lawmakers pushing further delays and exemptions for European producers, citing red tape and economic impacts.

Key quote:

“This is a dangerous feedback loop we cannot afford to trigger further.”

— Peter Potapov, research professor at the University of Maryland

Why this matters:

Wildfires — worsened by climate change — are now turning forest carbon sinks into carbon bombs. When trees burn, they release stored carbon back into the atmosphere, amplifying global warming and increasing the chances of future fires. The loss of tropical forests in places like Brazil, Colombia, and the Congo Basin also threatens biodiversity, water cycles, and the livelihoods of Indigenous and local communities. Delaying regulations that hold companies accountable for deforestation-linked supply chains risks undermining global pledges to reverse forest loss by 2030. As political momentum stalls in Brussels, every scorched acre makes it harder to meet climate goals and protect critical ecosystems.

In short:

Subnational leaders from tropical regions are spearheading forest conservation and climate action efforts, often outpacing national governments in ambition and execution.

U.S. governors, united in the U.S. Climate Alliance, represent over half the nation’s population and economy as they enact emissions-cutting policies despite federal rollbacks.

Programs in places like Ecuador, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia are reducing deforestation through community partnerships, carbon markets, and sustainable economies.

Key quote:

“It’s no wonder that philanthropic and business leaders from many sectors are turning to state and provincial policymakers, rather than national governments.”

— Mary Nichols, distinguished counsel, Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles

Why this matters:

The planet’s tropical forests, including the Amazon and rainforests in Indonesia and Central America, are vital to regulating the global climate, soaking up carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Yet they are rapidly disappearing. With national governments often mired in political gridlock or reversing course on climate commitments — as seen with the U.S. exit from the Paris Agreement — states and provinces have emerged as unlikely climate leaders. These subnational entities, closer to the consequences of climate disasters and equipped with real authority over land use and development, are showing that targeted policies and local collaboration can slow forest loss. Their work offers a roadmap for how climate resilience and economic development might go hand in hand, even in regions under tremendous environmental pressure.

In short:

Burgum defended steep budget cuts to environmental programs during his congressional testimony, arguing that national security concerns take precedence over climate action.

The proposed budget slashes $5 billion from the Interior Department, including funding for national parks, renewable energy programs, and Biden-era clean energy tax credits, while prioritizing defense and AI investments.

Critics, including Representative Chellie Pingree and the advocacy group Public Citizen, condemned the move, warning it would gut the department’s capacity and favor oil, gas, and mining industries over public lands and environmental protection.

Key quote:

“In just four months, the department has been destabilized, and there’s been a stunning decline in its ability to meet its mission.”

— U.S. Rep. Chellie Marie Pingree of Maine, the ranking member of the House appropriations committee

Why this matters:

The Trump administration’s pivot away from climate action comes at a time when scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows the Earth is warming faster than anticipated. A rollback in federal environmental funding risks worsening the impacts of extreme weather that are already disrupting communities and economies. With the Interior Department overseeing vast stretches of public lands its diminished focus on climate and prioritization of fossil fuel production is likely to mean more drilling, mining, and habitat destruction. Burgum’s comments reflect a broader shift in federal priorities that sidelines the climate crisis, with consequences for public health and safety. These moves leave states and local governments with the burden of responding to the climate emergency without sufficient federal support.

Ford is licensing some technology made by Chinese battery maker CATL for use in American-made vehicles.
Ahead of the auto show, CATL announced that it, too, is rolling out ultra-fast-charging car batteries.","Lithium-ion batteries were invented in the United States. But years ago, as part of a push toward electric vehicles, China took the lead in mass-producing them.

Now there’s a great race underway to see who will dominate the future of EV batteries.

Chinese automakers are announcing newer, better batteries at a breakneck speed, including vehicles promising 5-minute “flash charge” times first demonstrated this spring. And, not coincidentally, more than half of new cars sold in China come with a plug.

In the U.S., plug-in sales are lower and policies promoting EVs are politically divisive. The Trump administration has started the process of rolling back incentives, infrastructure and requirements encouraging them.

But globally, battery-powered cars remain a crucial part of plans to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change, thanks to their smaller carbon footprint. They’re also widely believed to be the technology of the future, and companies want to make sure they can compete in tomorrow’s auto market as well as today’s. So U.S. companies are still feeling intense pressure to improve their battery offerings. Last week, General Motors engineers in Detroit announced a cheaper long-range battery, and work is frantically underway to unlock even more dramatic innovations.

“Unquestionably, the Chinese are ahead in manufacturing technology,” says Bob Galyen, a retired executive whose long career in automotive batteries spanned both GM and the Chinese battery giant CATL. Today, profits from making batteries are being poured back into R&D in China, he says. “Clearly, the U.S. is lagging behind.”

But, he says, American labs are still coming up with new ideas: “There is hope for us.”

In Shanghai, a futuristic auto show

To enter the Shanghai Auto Show this spring, first visitors had to pass through facial recognition scanners. It was a taste of the technology on display inside, one of the main reasons why thousands of people, like Shanghai resident Dai Yiyao, flocked to the event.

Dai was accompanied by his 12-year-old son. “I brought my kid to see the development, to see what this era is like,” Dai said. “He can’t be ignorant of it.”

Booth after booth, car company after car company, there was a lot to absorb. Cars that can pivot on the spot. Cars that can operate in water, like a boat. Concept cars with quadcopter rotors. BYD, the world’s biggest EV maker by sales and China’s top brand, put on display a drone pod that attaches to the roof of a car and opens automatically.

A salesman called it “the world’s first drone system only designed for the vehicle.” The drone, made by the Chinese company DJI, can follow the car automatically, or it can be controlled from inside the car — if there’s a traffic jam, the salesman said, you can deploy it to see what’s going on ahead of you.

A few steps away, BYD was demonstrating what is perhaps a more consequential development: “flash charging.” It’s car battery charging at 1 megawatt (1,000 kW) — far more power than competitors — with batteries designed to be so efficient that they don’t overheat under the high power load.

“How fast is it? It can add two kilometers of range per second, or 400 kilometers in five minutes,” said an engineer on site who declined to be named, citing company policy.

That’s more than three times faster than U.S. market leader: Tesla’s Supercharger.

“Charging a mobile phone is slower. We’re faster,” the engineer said.

BYD says it’s pioneering fast charging to eliminate anxiety about charge times and limited vehicle range, a major concern for EV owners. It’s planning to install 4,000 fast charging stations across China.

None, however, will be installed in the United States. Chinese cars are largely absent from U.S. roads, thanks to a combination of heavy tariffs and U.S. restrictions on web-enabled Chinese car tech.

As a result, U.S. consumers can’t buy any of the buzzy Chinese EVs on the market — at least, for now.

In Detroit, remixing the battery “recipe”

But while Chinese EVs aren’t on U.S. streets, they’re very much on automakers’ minds.

Executives from multiple companies have publicly acknowledged that trade barriers can only go so far. Eventually, companies will have to be able to go toe-to-toe with Chinese counterparts on their merits, or risk being relegated to irrelevance on the global market. And that means better EV batteries.

No American company has announced anything like five-minute charging. But companies are very focused on bringing down battery costs to make EVs more affordable — without sacrificing the long range and large vehicles that American buyers prefer.

GM’s new battery chemistry, announced last week, is designed to do just that. It’s a “lithium manganese-rich,” or LMR, battery, to be produced in partnership with LG Energy Solutions and deployed in vehicles starting in 2028.

Lithium-ion batteries are made up of alternating layers of different chemicals, some of which are more expensive than others. GM says its new battery uses a lot more manganese — which is cheap — and less of pricey materials like nickel and cobalt.

GM says the battery can store almost as much energy as today’s most expensive EV batteries, but at a cost comparable to the cheapest version, without compromising on lifespan. It’s a little bit like if you made a cake cheaper by cutting back on expensive ingredients, like eggs and butter — but changed how you mixed and baked the cake to keep it just as tasty.

“It’s all about: How much of each ingredient, how do you process it, how do you mix it?” says GM battery engineer Andy Oury. He points out that starting with eggs, milk and butter, you could wind up with anything from scrambled eggs to popovers. The steps you follow determine the final product.

In GM’s research and development labs north of Detroit, scientists have been working on this new battery recipe for years. Engineers say they’ve cracked the right one, and now it’s about figuring out how to efficiently produce the battery in huge quantities. That’s its own kind of challenge, a little bit like scaling up cake production from a home kitchen to Costco.

Leading journalists on a tour of GM’s battery labs, Shriram Santhanagopalan, the company’s senior manager of advanced battery cell development, pointed through a window into a sealed, humidity-controlled room featuring a waist-high silver metal device with tubes running in and out. It blends chemicals together, kind of like an oversized KitchenAid mixer, he said.

The chemicals do indeed have the texture of batter. They were about to go on a sheet of foil, get baked, then stacked up like a layer cake. (Tesla’s process, by contrast, is to roll up the layers like a jelly roll.)

Santhanagopalan laughed. “When we hire people, we say that good cooks make good batteries,” he said.

Bigger breakthroughs are on the horizon

The recipe that GM has cooked up is “exciting,” says Evelina Stoikou, with the research company BloombergNEF. It should translate directly into longer range, she says, “which is quite important for consumers.”

Sam Abuelsamid, a longtime auto analyst now with the strategic communications firm Telemetry, says it has other benefits too. For one thing, while China dominates existing battery supply chains, using more of a cheaper input like manganese can make it easier to find alternative supplies, he says: “You get that lower cost, but also you’ve got the ability to source the materials from more places.” (GM has invested in a company called Element 25 that plans to build a U.S. refinery for Australian-sourced manganese.)

At the same time, they both point out, GM’s announcement is essentially a tweak to today’s battery recipes, offering higher performance at lower cost. It’s “more about optimizing,” Abuelsamid says, rather than being a “next-generation” battery — a radical change in chemistry or design that would lead to dramatically improved performance.

Companies around the world are racing to build those, too. They include batteries based on sodium, for instance, which is cheaper and more abundant than lithium. Or “solid-state” batteries, entirely made from solid components instead of the liquid electrolyte used in today’s batteries. These have gotten particular attention from the industry and the press because of their potential to be safer and cheaper while storing more energy. A variety of companies are trying to perfect one that’s ready for use in a mass-market EV.

No one has nailed it yet — although many companies say they’re only a few years away.

Kurt Kelty is GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, after an influential career at Panasonic, Tesla and the battery start-up Sila. He says GM is talking with start-ups about their solid-state technology and continuing to research other radically different battery recipes, while also rolling out more incremental improvements.

He acknowledges in the race for new battery tech, China has an advantage. “Some of these Chinese companies have massive R&D teams and they’re getting a lot of funding from their governments,” he says. “It’s hard to compete against that, but we’ve got quite a good, nimble team here.”

At the same time, he points out that the types of batteries that Chinese companies make so well today were developed in the U.S. before being scaled up in Asia, where the companies buying them were located.

Things could work out differently this time, he says — if American scientists can keep innovating new battery tech, and big companies can figure out how to commercialize them here and there’s enough domestic demand. “We can build an amazing battery industry here,” he says. “We have the opportunity here to really, really accelerate.”

And it’s worth noting that while the U.S. and China are competing, there could be room for collaboration, too. Ford is licensing some technology made by Chinese battery maker CATL for use in American-made vehicles. And many battery experts see the potential for more cooperation, when it makes business sense — even if political tensions and trade wars are a major barrier.

In Shanghai, a sense of confidence

Meanwhile China, which has already built up its domestic battery industry, is in the process of a global expansion.

At the Shanghai auto show, reporters and bloggers were flown in from around the world. Bloomberg reported that BYD alone “hosted some 150 journalists and influencers from Latin America.”

Geo Taveras, an influencer from the Dominican Republic who makes videos about cars and said he had been flown, all expenses paid, to the show by BYD, was filming a demonstration of flash charging. “This is happening in real time,” he said. “I mean, the technology is already developed. You took the same time when you go to the gas station to put gas in your car.”

Chinese EV and battery companies, like BYD, have grown quickly on the back of strong government investment and subsidies. Years ago, the government recognized that batteries were going to be a key sector and made development of a battery supply chain, among other industries, a strategic priority.

The massive subsidies that followed are one reason they’ve built such enormous success — although Bob Galyen, who worked for years in China, said it’s not the only reason. He said China’s experience building consumer electronics for the rest of the world also positioned it for success in batteries — and the “development and education of the people that go into building batteries,” including scientists, engineers and factory workers, was also crucial.

Ahead of the auto show, CATL announced that it, too, is rolling out ultra-fast-charging car batteries. It’s also launching a battery powered by sodium.

Dai, the Shanghai resident who brought his son to the car show, said China’s world-leading technologies are now the envy of the world.

“I told my son, it used to be that we were the ones with our pens out evaluating the cars. Now [foreigners] are taking out cameras, pens, color charts to evaluate our cars,” he said. “The times have changed.”

In short:

A new report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) finds that 200 clean energy factories across 38 states generate $33 billion in annual economic activity and support 122,000 jobs.

Over 70% of these facilities are in states that voted for Donald Trump in 2024, where tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act have driven a surge in solar, wind, and battery manufacturing.

Proposed cuts to clean energy tax credits by Republicans in Congress could undermine future growth, with the ACP warning that current plans could lead to factory closures and job losses.

Key quote:

“If they are implemented as currently drafted, which we certainly hope they are not, we will see factories shutting down.”

— MJ Shiao, vice president of supply chain and manufacturing, American Clean Power Association

Why this matters:

Clean energy manufacturing isn’t just a climate solution — it’s an economic engine that’s transforming local economies, especially in conservative-leaning states. Factory jobs in solar, wind, and battery production pay well above the national average and help anchor small towns and mid-sized cities left behind by globalization. These factories generate ripple effects through construction, logistics, hospitality, and materials supply chains. In Texas, Georgia, and elsewhere, this activity helps stabilize local economies and give young workers reasons to stay close to home. Proposals to weaken the tax credits that undergird this sector — many introduced by Republican lawmakers whose districts benefit most — could slow or reverse this momentum.

A handful of states are looking at spending their own money to boost industrial decarbonization.
But widespread industrial decarbonization won’t take off unless companies are confident that the investments they’re making will eventually pencil out financially.","The Trump administration appears poised to cancel billions of dollars of federal funding meant to help U.S. industries convert to cleaner alternatives to burning fossil fuels.

States can’t match the federal government’s spending power, but there are steps they can take to reduce industry’s emissions, support jobs and economic growth in places burdened by industrial pollution, and help prepare U.S. companies for global markets increasingly demanding lower-carbon commodities and products.

So says a March report from think tank RMI and environmental advocacy organization Evergreen Action that examined the industrial decarbonization plans of 25 states and Puerto Rico. The authors came up with a list of recommendations — and warnings — for states aiming to keep up the momentum on industrial decarbonization.

To be clear, ​“states can’t just look at what other states are doing and copy it,” said Molly Freed, RMI senior associate and co-author of the report. ​“What works in a steel and cement state is not going to be effective somewhere that’s canning and bottling stuff.”

But some common lessons can be drawn, she said. The first is not to try and recreate the federal government’s ​“massive capital grants,” namely, the $6 billion awarded to sites from steel mills to snack factories under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Industrial Demonstrations Program, which is now potentially on the Trump administration’s chopping block.

“States don’t have the initial funding to do that — and they have to balance their budgets every year, so it’s fundamentally not a good format for them,” Freed said.

That’s too bad, because many industrial companies rely on ​“first mover” public financing to lower the risk of making big investments, said Melissa Hulting, director of industrial decarbonization at the think tank Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. ​“Early adopters want help with these initial capital costs.” That’s particularly true of certain heavy industries like steel and cement, which have massive capital assets like blast furnaces and cement kilns that will need to be replaced or significantly retrofitted to cut emissions.

But other strategies represent lower-hanging fruit — in particular, replacing fossil-fueled boilers with industrial heat pumps and electric boilers, said Jeffrey Rissman, industry program director at the think tank Energy Innovation.

These technologies are well-suited to electrifying steam heating for food and beverage processing, chemicals production, pulp and paper mills, and other low-temperature processes that make up roughly 30% of U.S. industrial thermal energy demands.

Heat pumps, especially, are far more efficient at converting energy into heat than fossil-fueled boilers, Rissman said. These technologies are already being deployed today and can save companies money compared to fossil-fueled systems in some applications.

“It’s not like we need to solve fundamental engineering challenges here,” he said.

Finding the money to decarbonize industry

Putting some public money into the up-front costs of electrification could certainly help move things forward, Rissman said. And in some cases, states may still have access to federal dollars to make that happen.

Take the $4.3 billion issued to 25 state, local, and tribal governments through the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program. That’s one of many Inflation Reduction Act initiatives that had funding frozen in the early weeks of the Trump administration but which have since seen dollars begin flowing again after court orders demanded a restart.

The largest of the industrial decarbonization projects funded by those grants is Pennsylvania’s $396 million Reducing Industrial Sector Emissions program, which is currently accepting applications for everything from electrification, energy efficiency, and process-emissions reductions to on-site renewable energy, low-carbon fuels, and efforts to cut fugitive methane emissions.

Industry is Pennsylvania’s top-emitting sector, responsible for about 30% of statewide emissions, Louie Krak, infrastructure implementation coordinator at the state Department of Environmental Protection, said at a January webinar hosted by the policy institute Center for American Progress.

About 60% of that industrial climate pollution comes from the iron and steel industry, which is a much tougher sector to cut emissions from than lower-heat industrial processes, RMI and Evergreen Action’s report notes. ​“My advice is, take advantage of federal resources while they’re still around,” Krak said.

That includes smaller-scale federal funding sources, he added. For example, the Department of Energy’s Industrial Training and Assessment Centers program provides grants of up to $300,000 to help small and medium-sized manufacturers implement energy-efficiency projects. That’s ​”not an insignificant amount,” Krak said.

A handful of states are looking at spending their own money to boost industrial decarbonization. One way to do that is to tap into state and regional programs that collect fees from polluting industries, such as California’s greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative encompassing 11 Northeastern states, and Washington state’s cap-and-invest program, RMI and Evergreen Action’s report notes.

In California, lawmakers are considering the state’s greenhouse gas reduction fund as a source of money for AB 1280, a bill that proposes expanding programs that support factory electrification and thermal energy storage. One existing initiative that the bill would extend has already directed about $90 million to such projects over the last few years, said Teresa Cheng, California director at Industrious Labs, an advocacy group that supports the legislation.

“This is even more necessary now that federal support has backslid,” Cheng said. Roughly 35,000 polluting industrial facilities now pay into the greenhouse gas fund, and ​“that money should go back into cleaning up those facilities, commensurate with their polluting profile,” she said.

Another funding avenue proposed by AB 1280 is low-interest loans from the state’s Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, Cheng said. RMI and Evergreen Action’s report highlights the role that state-backed ​“green banks” — entities tasked with lending to projects that reduce carbon emissions and air pollution — could play in reducing capital costs for industrial decarbonization.

That could eventually include part of the $20 billion in green bank funding created by the Inflation Reduction Act that has been frozen by the Trump administration and is now being fought over in court. Regardless of the outcome of that dispute, state green banks still have their own money to lend, Rissman noted.

“Buy clean” mandates now in place in nine states, which require state agencies to purchase concrete, steel, and other industrial outputs that are made via lower-carbon processes and using lower-carbon inputs, can further incentivize industries to invest in decarbonization, Rissman said.

Those programs can also provide reporting and compliance structures that companies will need to meet demands for lower-carbon products from corporate buyers, he said. And U.S. firms that export to Europe will be looking to avoid the looming Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism fees on high-carbon imports, set to go into effect in the coming years.

Adding the regulatory ​“sticks” to the policy ​“carrots”

States have regulatory ​“sticks” they can use to back up the ​“carrots” of grants, loans, and other incentives for industrial decarbonization. Cap-and-trade or cap-and-invest programs impose costs on polluting industries, for example. Or states can implement rules like the ones passed by Southern California air regulators, which require industrial and commercial customers to replace fossil-fueled water heaters, boilers, and process heating with electric systems within the next decade, Cheng said.

Colorado has both carrots and sticks in place, Wil Mannes, senior program manager of industrial decarbonization initiatives for the Colorado Energy Office, said during January’s webinar. The state passed a climate law in 2021 that set emissions limits on industrial facilities, with rules mandating a 20% reduction in those emissions by 2030 compared to 2015 levels. But it has also opened a $168 million competitive tax credit program and a $25 million grant program for industrial facilities to install improvements that reduce greenhouse gases, which means Colorado is ​“not heavily dependent on federal support for what we already have in the works,” Mannes said.

“Future of gas” proceedings are another way to spur industrial electrification, said Yong Kwon, senior policy advisor for the Sierra Club’s Living Economy program. California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York are among the states that have launched these discussions to craft long-term plans for reducing customers’ reliance on fossil gas delivered through utility pipelines.

In Illinois, state regulators and other stakeholders are considering proposals for industrial pilot projects that try out different rate structures for companies that switch from gas to electricity, Kwon said. ​“What if we selected a demonstration site and funded the facility to adopt the technologies, and also worked with utilities to provide them with preferential rates based on studies we’ve done? What would be the result of that, both on public health and on the cost to the industrial user?”

A key to decarbonization? Ensuring long-term benefits for companies

Regulations and up-front financing are both important policy levers. But widespread industrial decarbonization won’t take off unless companies are confident that the investments they’re making will eventually pencil out financially.

“The operational costs are really key,” Hulting said. ​“If we can get those down, I think we’ll see a lot of implementation happening because these electrified technologies are largely more efficient. It’s an energy-efficiency boost.”

Electric industrial heating faces a core challenge in the U.S. — the spark gap, or the cost difference between fossil gas and electricity. Cheap domestic gas supplies have undercut the economics of industrial electrification over the past two decades, and while gas prices have been rising over recent months, so have electricity costs.

Underneath these broad averages lie significant regional differences, however. Low spark gaps have spurred electric industrial heating investments in certain parts of the country, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which tracks such projects across the U.S. And most utilities offer industrial rates and pricing structures that can shift the balance toward electrification.

Narrowing the spark gap down to where it encourages industrial electrification relies on two important variables, Kwon said — ​“making electricity cheaper and making gas more expensive.” Policies that drive up gas costs aren’t exactly a political winner, however. So industrial electrification advocates have focused on making electricity cheaper.

One way to do that is to ​“give industry access to wholesale electricity rates,” he said. Over the long run, increasingly cheaper renewable energy will drive down electricity costs at large, he explained. But power generated by solar and wind is already quite cheap when it exceeds grid demand. In fact, grid operators are being forced to curtail excess renewable energy at certain times of the year in sun- and wind-rich parts of the country, which sometimes see wholesale electricity prices drop into negative territory.

That’s why industrial electrification proponents are eager for states to create routes for industrial customers to access these cheap wholesale prices, rather than remaining on the retail utility rates that shield customers from these price swings. Access to bulk electricity price differentials is particularly essential for making the business case for thermal-energy storage technologies, which convert electricity to heat and store it for long durations.

In return, big industrial customers can act similarly to utility-scale batteries on the grid, Kwon said — storing excess power when prices are low and using it to reduce their grid demands when power is scarce. That’s already happening in Northern European countries such as Denmark, where variable electricity rates that offer inexpensive off-peak pricing encourage industries to use and store ample wind power, he said. ​“That’s essential — and that’s a place where we hope states will pick up.”

Just how this concept can be applied depends on what kind of utility rates and energy market structures different states have, Rissman said. For decades, utilities have negotiated special rate structures with particularly large and power-hungry facilities, such as steel furnaces and aluminum smelters. And competitive energy markets like those in Texas, or across some Northeastern and Midwestern states, allow large customers to contract with retail energy providers in ways that let them access wholesale energy market prices, he said.

But these arrangements are largely kept private since they constitute a competitive advantage for the industries that are getting them, he noted. What’s more, rate programs still need to protect factories or facilities from being exposed to the enormous price spikes that can occur at times of power shortage or grid emergency — at least, for all but the handful of industrial players willing to take the risks involved. At the same time, wholesale pricing structures shouldn’t allow industrial customers to avoid paying their fair share of power grid investments or other costs that are bundled into retail rates.

In California, advocates have proposed regulations to allow industrial decarbonization projects to access low-cost renewable energy through some kind of exposure to or pass-through of the state’s wholesale energy market, Cheng said. Last year, state regulators launched a proceeding to explore the potential for such ​“flexible” rate structures for large industrial companies, she noted. But ​“it’s pretty early on — we don’t have the answers yet.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Heinz-factory.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=9ee2cd81cfad02147b0ef1a3521d3697,N,,2025-05-22 10:14:12.756289

The move could have serious economic consequences.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit cuts 30% of the cost of new insulation, doors, windows, water heaters, and heat pump heater/​ACs from households’ federal tax bills, with an annual maximum of $3,200. The Residential Clean Energy Credit gives households a federal tax break worth 30% of the price of installing solar panels, batteries, geothermal heat pumps, and other energy-producing and -saving systems. Its value is uncapped, but in 2023, the more than 1.2 million American families who claimed the credit each received an average of roughly $5,000.

U.S. lawmakers first passed the two tax credits in 2005 under the Energy Policy Act — signed by Republican President George W. Bush — and most recently expanded and extended them with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act to last until 2032. Republicans are now aiming to eliminate the tax credits at the end of this year, part of a broader push to gut the landmark legislation.

Chucking the incentives could cause far-reaching damage. These tax breaks allow Americans to unlock thousands of dollars in annual savings on their energy bills, support nearly half a million jobs, and can help the grid meet growing energy demand for manufacturing and data centers, according to recent analyses by electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.

“The findings are so significant,” said Kevin Kircher, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University who studies home energy systems and was not involved in Rewiring America’s analyses. ​“We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of American jobs. I think it’s hard to deny the importance of something like that.”

Using federal home-energy modeling tools, Rewiring America found that single-family households who use the energy-efficiency credit, also known as 25C, to install heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters and make weatherization upgrades save $990 on annual energy costs on average. The savings from those combined changes would be enough to offset the impact of the last four years of energy cost hikes, the organization found.

Add on solar panels with support from the Residential Clean Energy Credit, or 25D, and households can slash their annual energy bills by more than 70%, or $2,240 per year, Rewiring America says.

“Politicians have talked about reducing energy prices,” said Kristin Eberhard, head of policy at Rewiring America. ​“But [killing the tax credits] is going to do exactly the opposite.”

To be sure, more efficient systems, which also boost comfort and indoor air quality, can cost more up front. But for millions of households, these upgrades more than pay for themselves over the appliance’s lifetime, according to Rewiring America. And when consumers are able to finance these systems, they can start to see net savings much sooner — or in some cases, immediately.

The tax credits also drive consumer spending that supports around 460,000 jobs, per the nonprofit. That figure includes direct jobs to install home-energy equipment, indirect jobs to manufacture and transport it, and induced local jobs spurred by worker spending, like at the restaurants where they stop for lunch.

The findings come as the Trump administration attacks popular energy-efficiency programs that have helped households save billions of dollars and reduced the use of planet-warming fossil fuels. The administration’s moves to dismantle programs like Energy Star have met industry opposition — as has Congress’ plan to eliminate the energy-efficiency tax credits.

More than 1,100 businesses across heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration, water heating, insulation, and home performance sectors signed a letter last month urging Congress to leave the 25C tax credit intact.

Members of Air Conditioning Contractors of America are also throwing their support behind the tax incentive, which is ​“simple, fuel neutral, and available nationwide” — in contrast to the Inflation Reduction Act’s more complex home energy rebates, Sean Robertson, the association’s vice president of membership, advocacy, and events, recently told Air Conditioning, Heating & Refrigeration News. The industry is encouraging contractors and their customers to reach out to their congressional representatives to defend the tax credits.

The sudden disappearance of such incentives can wreak havoc on an industry.

In 2017, geothermal heat pumps got cut from eligibility for the 25D tax credit. As a result, sales dropped by 50% that year, Ryan Dougherty, president of the nonprofit trade association Geothermal Exchange Organization, told the HVAC industry news outlet. ​“We cannot let that happen again.”

The tax credits also bolster the grid because in boosting efficiency, they reduce home energy use on the hottest and coldest days of the year. Not only is that good for reliability, but it also creates new economic opportunities by making room on the grid that could facilitate a rapid build-out of AI data centers and onshore manufacturing, according to Rewiring America.

Seven states would see annual peak demand fall by more than 1 gigawatt if all single-family, owner-occupied households were to install heat pumps and the weatherization upgrades incentivized by 25C, the nonprofit found. Texas alone could save nearly 7 gigawatts, equivalent to the amount needed to power more than 170 data centers.

The proposed federal budget is still evolving, and some Republicans — including a potentially majority-busting four senators of the chamber’s 53 — have signed letters in support of safeguarding Inflation Reduction Act energy tax credits to at least some degree. In a March letter to the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, 21 House Republicans emphasized ​“the importance of prioritizing energy affordability for American families.” Others, however, have said cuts to the Biden-era law’s tax credits don’t go far enough.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he aims to pass the budget legislation and send it to the Senate by May 26. Republican factions are sparring over Medicaid cuts, the cap on a deduction that constituents can take for state and local taxes, and whether to supersize the deficit — and sparing comparatively little attention for the consequences of scrapping the two home-energy tax credits.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2216078378.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f57c5a17560bf9a491ab8a1464624e09,N,,2025-05-22 06:04:57.495773

The measure cleared a critical hurdle — a procedural vote to begin debate on the massive budget package. A vote on the bill could follow later in the morning.

The legislation, which addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities, has overcome several setbacks since the beginning of the year after GOP leadership made repeated assurances to holdouts that their concerns would be addressed later if they kept the legislation moving forward.

But as Speaker Mike Johnson's self-imposed deadline to get the measure across the finish line in the House by Memorial Day quickly approached, the Louisiana Republican was facing increasing opposition from several factions of his party to parts of the bill involving Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction and other provisions.

A 42-page managers amendment released by House GOP leaders late Wednesday includes changes to win over both the budget hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and blue-state Republicans pressing to ease the tax burden on their constituents. The new version would, among other things, move up the implementation of Medicaid work requirements from Oct. 1, 2027 to Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners.

Another change to the bill would more quickly end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service no later than Dec. 31, 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by Dec. 31, 2028.

Johnson can only afford three defections if all members are present and voting, given his slim majority. All Democrats are expected to oppose it.

Right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.

Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn't optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was ""pretty confident"" it could be passed within 10 days.

But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.

During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation — which House GOP leaders have named ""The Big, Beautiful Bill"" — and suggested that those who don't could face primary challenges.

In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it ""reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,"" adding, ""failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.""

The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.

Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.

GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said Wednesday night that, with the increase, he believed all those opposed to the original provision were now on board.

But even if Johnson is able to shepherd the legislation through the lower chamber, it's expected to face resistance in the Senate — where numerous Republicans have said they'll seek changes to the bill.

Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the speaker would ""like to see as little change to the product as possible, because they cobble together a very delicate balance over there."" But Thune said ""the Senate will have its imprint on it.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/22/db06b7f9-6d4a-406b-8f2e-a81bac8fd44f/thumbnail/1200x630g6/98fb2e21fcbd9ab237ceaf3413a40d51/gettyimages-2183627510.jpg?v=f80504b4a2a31dbf7fe3bb9ae688e3d2,N,,2025-05-22 04:05:41.428679

The principle is, on its own, that one big lithium-ion battery can supply power to a home in case of a power failure. Linking a bunch of those batteries together on a block, however, turns them into a source of electricity for a neighbourhood to draw on when demand surges.

Article content

Article content

And B.C. Hydro has embarked on a test of this concept by installing 200 battery systems at homes in two locations: Sun Peaks near Kamloops and Harrison Mills outside Mission.

Article content

“In a nutshell, it is kind of leveraging the behind-the-meter or customer side of any (power) storage, any generation,” said Altaf Hussain.

Article content

So, while B.C. Hydro is installing 14 kWh and 5 kWh batteries from the Calgary firm Eguana Technologies as part of the test, it could also tie in rooftop solar units, electric vehicle chargers or other computerized home devices such as load limiters or smart thermostats.

Article content

For batteries, the idea is that they charge when demand is low and then supply power to the grid when demand surges to help reduce the peak load that B.C. Hydro is trying to produce electricity for.

Article content

Hydro will link the batteries over a computerized network on its side of the system with what Hussain referred to as distributed-energy resource management tools.

In February, the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) announced its preliminary determination asserting that China suppressed the establishment of the graphite industry in the United States (and elsewhere) by exporting artificially cheap graphite which is a key component of lithium-ion batteries.1

Michael O’Kronley, CEO of NOVONIX, stated, ""We are encouraged by the decision of the Department of Commerce today. This decision is an important step in supporting the United States’ goal of developing critical mineral supply domestically for increased energy independence.”

Commerce is also conducting its own antidumping duty (“AD”) investigation. Any additional AD tariff imposed by Commerce will stack onto the CVD tariffs announced today. The final determinations for both investigations are expected to be issued around December 5, 2025.

This trade case was filed by the American Active Anode Material Producers, which is comprised of four members of the North American Graphite Alliance, (“NAGA”), including NOVONIX, and two additional graphite anode material producers in the United States. NAGA represents American and Canadian producers of battery-grade natural and synthetic graphite, both of which are used to create anode material for lithium-ion batteries.

NOVONIX’s Riverside facility is poised to become the first large-scale production site dedicated to high-performance synthetic graphite for the battery sector in North America. To meet increasing customer demand, the Company previously announced the execution of a definitive agreement to purchase a 182-acre parcel in the Enterprise South Industrial Park in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the future location of its second high-performance, synthetic graphite manufacturing plant. With this initial capacity at Enterprise South and its existing Riverside facility, which is scaling up to 20,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”), NOVONIX will have total production capacity of over 50,000 tpa in Chattanooga.

This announcement has been authorised for release by Admiral Robert J Natter, USN Ret., Chairman.

“Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,” he said in a statement announcing the vote.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration doubles down on fossil fuels.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California’s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.

Thune said California’s “are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation’s energy supply.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.

Here’s what to know:

Why can California set its own standards?

The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions standards for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.

California has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.

Trump rescinded California’s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden’s administration restored it in 2022.

What do the standards do?

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.

The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.

The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.

New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.

What do the auto and trucking industries say?

Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state’s tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars if it gets blocked and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate’s upcoming vote.

The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.

“Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,” Mike Stanton, the group’s president and CEO, wrote in a letter.

The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.

“While transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,” said Josh Lovelace, the group’s national director.

Can the grid handle more electric vehicles?

Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation’s grid can’t handle California’s plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California’s struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.

“Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,” he said in a statement announcing the vote.

Newsom’s administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.

But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state’s growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state’s electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state’s transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an “unprecedented rate.”

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California’s plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state’s previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California’s, saying the pace wasn’t realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state’s EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

Since the mid-1950s, South Dakota has generated significant energy from its four hydroelectric power plants on the Missouri River.
At the end of 2024, South Dakota was home to 1,417 turbines able to generate about 3,600 MW of energy.
“We’ve had just a tremendous expansion of wind energy in South Dakota,” said Chris Nelson, a PUC commissioner.
“The amount of energy companies coming in looking for workers is crazy, and you can’t really grasp how many companies are looking for energy students,” he said.","This story is part of a collaboration between the Institute for Nonprofit News’ Rural News Network and Canary Media, South Dakota News Watch, Cardinal News, The Mendocino Voice and The Maine Monitor, with support from Ascendium Education Group.

MITCHELL, S.D. — Matthew Pearson found a successful career in the wind energy industry purely by chance.

After graduating from high school in Vermillion, Pearson knew he didn’t want to pursue a four-year degree and instead scrolled through the list of majors offered at Mitchell Tech, one of the state’s four technical colleges.

“When I came to the wind energy program, I thought, ‘Well, that sounds kind of cool,” Pearson, 28, recalled during a recent interview at Mitchell Tech, the only South Dakota college with a designated wind energy major.

He didn’t know it at the time, but he had stumbled into one of the fastest-growing, highest-paying trade fields in the state and nation.

While workforce shortages plague many industries and employers in the Rushmore State, great opportunities abound for skilled workers to build, operate and maintain renewable energy facilities, including at wind farms. Meanwhile, strong partnerships between technical colleges, employers and the Build Dakota Scholarship program have forged a ready pathway to quickly and effectively fill the need for energy workers.

Pearson obtained a Build Dakota Scholarship that paid all his tuition for a two-year wind technology degree, then spent about $15,000 to complete another two-year major in electrical construction.

After graduation, he quickly landed a job wiring wind towers at locations around the country. He was initially paid about $80,000 a year, and after six years was making $127,000 plus a daily living fee of $140.

But now, with a fiancee and two children, Pearson is completing a circle by leaving field work and returning to Mitchell Tech to become its only wind energy program instructor.

Pearson said that in addition to teaching the skills needed to thrive in the renewable energy field, he’ll also share the good news about their job prospects.

“There’s been a steady uptick in the need for workforce,” he said. “When I would get to a jobsite, there would be three or four companies there, and they’d always come over and ask, ‘Hey, you want to come work for us instead?’”

South Dakota is among the top three states nationally in percentage of energy generated from renewable sources, leaving it well positioned to provide both jobs in the field and trainers like Pearson who will help meet demand for workers.

About 77 percent of the power used in the state comes from non-fossil-fuel sources, largely from water and wind, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Since the mid-1950s, South Dakota has generated significant energy from its four hydroelectric power plants on the Missouri River.

And over roughly the past 15 years, the state has seen a tenfold increase in wind energy production, according to the state Public Utilities Commission. That growth has created a healthy number of construction and maintenance jobs.

In 2009, the state had 190 turbines capable of producing about 350 megawatts (MW) of electricity. At the end of 2024, South Dakota was home to 1,417 turbines able to generate about 3,600 MW of energy. The PUC also approved a 68-turbine project with a capacity of 260 MW and a $621 million price tag near Clear Lake in March.

“We’ve had just a tremendous expansion of wind energy in South Dakota,” said Chris Nelson, a PUC commissioner. “Today, though, we’re in a little bit of a lull.”

The expected slowdown is due to a lack of transmission lines capable of carrying more power, most of which heads east out of the state, Nelson said. And while the state has three solar farms, it does not currently have plans to build more.

Despite the infrastructure challenges, renewable energy still has a bright future, he said. Two nonprofit energy consortiums that manage the power grid in the upper Midwest plan to spend a combined $37 billion to expand transmission capacity, including in South Dakota, over roughly the next decade.

At Lake Area Technical College in Watertown, students are offered two energy-related degree tracks, said president Tiffany Sanderson.

The energy technology major provides training in development and maintenance of energy systems, and the energy operations degree is aimed at managing an energy facility.

“In our energy programs, those are students interested in working with their hands and solving engineering or process-oriented problems,” she said. “They’re very mechanically minded and can figure out how to make sure power is produced reliably so people don’t have delays in service.”

During a recent tour of the technology labs, students used 3D printers, developed and analyzed system efficiency and worked on unique projects like a solar-powered ice fishing shanty.

The two programs have about two dozen students combined, Sanderson said. In the 2023 graduating class, 100 percent of all graduates were employed within six months, with average salaries of $65,000 a year in the technology major and $69,000 a year in operations.

“That is for their first jobs in the industry, so those are tremendous opportunities for a brand-new graduate with two years of college education,” she said.

In May, Nathaniel Bekaert will become one of those new graduates from Lake Area tech.

Bekaert, 28, grew up on a farm and came to the college after six years in the U.S. Army, which paid for almost all of his tuition, fees and equipment costs.

After touring the Gavins Point Dam hydroelectric plant in Yankton on the Nebraska border and interning at the Big Stone Power Plant near the Minnesota border, Bekaert was sold on the idea of working as a mechanic in the energy field.

“The more you learn, the more you want to dive into it,” he said.

With his anticipated degree and work experience, Bekaert said he was recruited extensively by energy companies.

“The amount of energy companies coming in looking for workers is crazy, and you can’t really grasp how many companies are looking for energy students,” he said. “There are a dozen or more companies within 45 minutes from here that are actively looking for technicians and operators or people with some type of energy degree.”

As a native of the Watertown area, Bekaert has accepted a job close to home as a wind technician at the Crowned Ridge wind farm northeast of the city, where he will make $29 an hour plus a $5,000 signing bonus and a $200 annual stipend for work boots.

Crowned Ridge is operated by NextEra Energy, a Florida-based company that runs wind farms across the country. A recent check of NextEra’s website revealed 396 job openings, with 185 related specifically to wind energy.

“No matter what happens with fossil fuels, we can keep going (with renewable energy) and live off that, and it will benefit everybody in the world. And we won’t have to rely on another country,” Bekaert said of his career choice.

The South Dakota technical school system, which also includes campuses in Sioux Falls and Rapid City, has developed a close working relationship with the energy industry to ensure students learn the right skills and employers can tap into a pipeline of well-trained workers.

Lake Area Tech officials visit local public schools to promote energy and other trade jobs starting in elementary grades, Sanderson said.

At Mitchell Tech, vice president for enrollment services Clayton Deuter said the college now offers a one-year wind energy degree instead of a two-year program, a change made after energy companies said some skills taught in the longer program could be obtained on the job instead.

Deuter said the energy programs at Mitchell Tech are an easy sell to students and their parents due to the low cost compared to a four-year college and the availability of Build Dakota scholarships in which students get tuition paid if they work in South Dakota for three years after graduation.

Mitchell Tech also offers a dual-enrollment program to high school students so they can have a wind energy degree from the college in hand by the time they graduate.

“You think about return on investment, and here you can take one year in the wind turbine program and you can graduate and make $80,000 to $100,000 a year,” Deuter said. “With student loan debt being so crazy, you don’t have to bankrupt yourself financially and be tethered to a student loan payment when you’re trying to buy a house and start a family.”

One of the state’s biggest renewable energy employers is Marmen Energy in Brandon. The Canadian-owned company has 285 employees who build wind towers up to 300 feet tall that are shipped to wind farms nationwide.

Aimee Miritello, human resources manager, said the company’s relationships with high schools and technical colleges form a pillar of the company’s worker recruitment strategy to overcome a nagging lack of workers in the trade fields.

“Historically, for us that has been one of our best ways of getting qualified employees,” she said.

Marmen has expanded its South Dakota plant to accommodate what Miritello said has been a steady increase in demand for wind towers across the country.

Marmen workers, who include welders, painters and other construction tradespeople, make a good wage, are offered one of the best benefit packages in the region and have strong opportunities for internal advancement, she said.

“Plus, they’re a part of making huge wind towers, so their pride in that is pretty big,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/hechingerreport.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Liz-Willen-5sd-clean-energy-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-22 04:05:02.145977

The court also found that Healthy Gulf and Alliance for Affordable Energy's alleged injuries were too speculative and attenuated to meet the requirements of imminence and traceability. The court emphasized that the petitioners' theories of injury relied on a chain of speculative events that were not certainly impending.

Among the transition industries, other weapons for fighting back Trump’s energy policies are the threats of lost investments and, of course, jobs.
Hiller’s statement about the expansion of wind, solar, and battery storage is telling.
Wind and solar industries really did boom during the Biden administration.
Now, wind and solar are being exposed to free market rules—the same that govern most other industries.","As soon as the November 2024 election results were in, proponents of the energy transition started warning the end of their industries was nigh. They weren’t wrong. Trump has wasted no time clipping the wings of wind, solar, EVs, and related industries that have enjoyed years of generous financial support—from taxpayers’ money. This is now over, and these industries will need to learn to survive on their own.

Republican legislators are busy drafting ways to slash billions in subsidies that have contributed significantly to the thriving of solar and wind businesses, encouraged billions in pledged investments from battery makers, for example, and cushioned the blow of EV sales losses for the Big Three as they struggle to make the shift to EVs that Americans don’t really want to buy. The targeted industries are, naturally, not happy about it.

“While American businesses are demanding more energy to compete against our adversaries, and consumers are turning to clean energy to hedge against rising electricity prices, these proposals will undermine our nation’s efforts to achieve President Trump’s American energy dominance agenda,” the president of the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement in response to the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s reconciliation bill proposal, released earlier this month.

This is perhaps one way of putting things, even though high electricity prices appear to be inextricably linked to wind and solar proliferation—and the link appears to be direct and causal. Among the transition industries, other weapons for fighting back Trump’s energy policies are the threats of lost investments and, of course, jobs. Furthermore, some are arguing that these energy policies of the current federal government are about to disrupt a “booming business”.

“Developers have built $145 billion in solar, wind and battery-storage projects since expanded federal tax credits were approved in 2022, while manufacturers have invested $73 billion in 94 factories that are now operating,” Jennifer Hiller from the Wall Street Journal wrote this week, noting that what the House lawmakers are doing with the budget reconciliation bill could put an end to all this, threatening the survival of these industries.

Not only this, but state governments are appearing to turn on wind, solar, EV batteries, and anything else transition-related, tightening rules for capacity buildouts and getting more selective with the permitting. It sounds really bad for the industries concerned. However, the alarm among them begs one question: if they are, indeed, thriving, can they not keep thriving in a less-subsidized environment?

Hiller’s statement about the expansion of wind, solar, and battery storage is telling. That $145 billion worth of capacity was built in the two years since the Biden administration supercharged subsidy support with some $400 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act and the Chips and Science Act. And even with that level of support, as much as 40% of projects announced following the IRA got delayed, some of them indefinitely, as the Financial Times reported last year.

These facts do not paint the picture of a “booming business”. Rather, they paint the picture of a business environment carefully crafted and nourished selectively to survive against competition that obeys market conditions. Wind, solar, EVs, and batteries were picked as the winners in a race where all other participants followed one set of rules while the chosen ones followed their own special set of rules, involving pretty much unconditional support, while others became subjects of increasingly tighter regulation.

What is happening now is the pendulum swinging back, plain and simple. Local communities across the United States are fighting back against wind turbines and solar panels on their lands, and state and local governments are running out of money to subsidize EV sales or solar installations. Meanwhile, the drawbacks of alternative energy sources have become more obvious now that there is so much capacity around.

Last year’s crash in wind and solar stocks was evidence enough that even with subsidies, these technologies can and do have trouble, such as the impossibility of delivering electricity on demand, the need for costly battery backup to have a chance at delivering electricity on demand, and the increasingly high costs of construction and operation—because inflation does not spare wind and solar. There is also the issue of negative prices due to overproduction of wind and solar electricity during periods of low demand and, on top of all this, too many wind turbines in one place lead to lower wind speeds and lower electricity output in a very special case of self-cannibalization.

Wind and solar industries really did boom during the Biden administration. The reason for this boom was the constant and growing financial assistance they were getting from the federal government, and a lot of state and local governments determined to build a next-era energy system—based on the arguments of people with a solid vested interest in such a system even if it would ultimately prove unworkable. Now, wind and solar are being exposed to free market rules—the same that govern most other industries. That’s a great opportunity to prove they can survive on their own without hundreds of billions in subsidies.

The auto industry has been pushing for Republicans to revoke California's waivers.","The Senate is expected to vote Thursday to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a controversial move that the chamber's parliamentarian says Republican lawmakers may not have the right to make.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the planned vote ""the nuclear option.""

The three waivers the Senate is looking to revoke set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations. Two waivers relate to reducing tailpipe emissions from medium and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as limiting smog pollution from trucks.

The last is what's frequently called California's ""EV mandate,"" a rule that aims to phase-out gas powered cars and require all new vehicle sales in California be zero emissions by 2035. The rule to phase out gas powered vehicles goes into effect in 2026.

California was granted the ability to enact stricter vehicle emissions standards than the federal government under the Clean Air Act in a process that involves receiving a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency if the regulations meet certain requirements. The three waivers in question were approved by the Biden administration's EPA in 2024.

Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act gives Congress the ability to overturn rules passed by federal agencies — including the waivers — by a simple majority vote, but nonpartisan government watchdogs do not agree. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian found that the Congressional Review Act could not be used to vote down California's waivers because the waivers are not the same as rules, according to Senate Democrats.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who supports revoking the waivers, said in remarks Tuesday on the Senate floor that ""the EPA has submitted the waivers to Congress as rules – which is all that Congress has ever needed to decide to consider something under the Congressional Review Act.""

But Democrats say such a vote is illegal, and argue overruling the Parliamentarian and bypassing the filibuster sets a dangerous precedent.

""If they invoke this nuclear option now, they should expect that a future Democratic government will have to revisit decades worth of paltry corporate settlements, deferred prosecution agreements, and tax rulings that were overly favorable to multinationals and ultra-wealthy individuals,"" said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, in a statement.

The California Air Resources Board, a state body that designed the vehicle emissions regulations and requested the waivers, measures and sets pollution standards in California to comply with the Clean Air Act. It claims that the state has applied for over 100 waivers that have resulted in vehicles being 99% cleaner in terms of pollution, compared to vehicles from 1970. The board says they have never had a waiver revoked in the 50 years it has had the ability to enact them.

""The law is that the Clean Air Act says California can set its own standards if they are more stringent, more environmentally protective than whatever the federal government standard is,"" said Mary Nichols, who was the California Air Resources Board chairwoman from 1975-1982 and then from 2007-2020. Nichols told CBS News that if Congress uses Congressional Review to revoke the waivers, the state of California will sue the federal government.

California state Attorney General Rob Bonta told Politico in March that his office is prepared for a legal fight and said, ""We don't think it's an appropriate use of the Congressional Review Act, and we're prepared to defend ourselves if it's wrongfully weaponized.""

Voting down California's waivers is expected to impact cities and states around the country, as 16 additional states and the District of Columbia have adopted California's vehicle standards.

Republicans have staunchly criticized California's emissions rules, especially the one aimed at driving the auto industry toward electric vehicles.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican who chairs the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, said this week the rules amount to ""forcing certain states and certain consumers to purchase a vehicle that they may not want or that they can't find.""

The auto industry has been pushing for Republicans to revoke California's waivers. The Speciality Equipment Market Association represents the automotive aftermarket industry where a third of its businesses are dependent on internal combustion engines and see the waivers and expansion of electric vehicles as a threat to business.

""The death of California's waiver will give life to more than 330,000 American jobs and preserves over $100 billion of economic impact to the nation's economy,"" the association said in a statement.

But environmental groups are alarmed by the unprecedented use of the Congressional Review Act to revoke the waivers. The Environmental Defense Fund said in a statement that a vote by Congress would undermine California's ability to address pollution.

Read highlights below: Rep. Pfluger: We were very pleased that Mr. Mason, the Region Six Administrator, came and visited the Permian Basin. One of the things we talked about was, with regard to methane, the monitoring that is being done. And to incentivize that good behavior, we have reduced the intensity of methane in the Permian Basin by almost 30%, and that's happened in the last 10 to 15 years, while also increasing the amount of barrels produced from 1 million barrels a day back in 2010 to 6 million barrels a day. And that complexity that goes on to reduce that intensity. We want to work with you. I encourage that to work. Do you have any ideas on where the previous administrator was looking at the Permian Basin in general, to place it into a state of non-attainment with regard to the ozone reporting? Any updates on that for us? This was something that interjected a lot of chaos into that region. Administrator Zeldin: It's a very important pillar of the power in the great American comeback initiative to advance cooperative federalism. Part of that with the reorganization is creating an office for state air partnerships. Inside the Office of Air and Radiation, we have approved 25 state implementation plans, including a 16-hour backlog from the last administration. We are working through these non-attainment requests and issues, including inside the Permian Basin. We want to be a partner at the EPA for Texas and the local community. Rep. Pfluger: Well, thank you. It was very apparent to my constituents that the EPA had become weaponized, and working in partnership is exactly the key word. We appreciate that.",Not Available,https://sanangelolive.com/sites/default/files/styles/og/public/2025-05/untitled-1_37.jpg?h=11f65397&itok=KUBwM-_1,N,,2025-05-22 07:06:27.797532

Arizona Moves Toward Full UIC Primacy for Class VI Wells Arizona has likewise made significant progress toward obtaining primacy for all UIC well classes, including Class VI wells, under the UIC program.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to take steps to expand state primacy for the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Class VI well program, established under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Class VI wells, added as a distinct category in 2010, are used to inject carbon dioxide into deep rock formations for the purpose of long-term geologic carbon sequestration.

Initially, EPA retained exclusive authority to administer the Class VI program. However, since 2018, the agency has granted states the ability to assume primary enforcement responsibility — referred to as “primacy.” Wyoming became the first state to obtain primacy for Class VI wells in 2018, followed by North Dakota in 2020 and, most recently, Louisiana in 2024. This trend reflects growing federal support for state-led implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure.

As of May 2025, three additional states — West Virginia, Texas, and Arizona — are in various stages of obtaining or finalizing Class VI primacy. Securing EPA approval could significantly accelerate the permitting process for CCS projects in those states, which to date have moved very slowly through EPA review.

West Virginia’s Successful Transition to Class VI Primacy

In a key regulatory milestone, West Virginia received full EPA approval for Class VI well primacy in February 2025. Following a public comment period and review process, the state’s Department of Environmental Protection can now issue permits for geologic carbon sequestration and ensure compliance within the state for Class VI wells. This decision enables West Virginia to take a leading role in issuing CCS project permits.

Texas Closer to Obtaining Full Primacy for Class VI Wells

Texas is moving forward with its bid to obtain full primacy for all UIC well classes, including Class VI wells. EPA has granted primacy for multiple well classes in Texas, and now the state is working through EPA’s process to obtain approval for Class VI wells. The state’s Railroad Commission (RRC) has been at the forefront of these efforts, as seen by a recent Memorandum of Agreement that the RRC has signed with EPA Region 6 on April 29, 2025. This agreement paves the way for Texas to assume responsibility for Class VI well permitting by laying out the RRC’s proposed implementation of the Class VI program. As the next step, EPA plans to solicit public comments on a proposed rule that would grant Class VI program authority to the RRC.

Arizona Moves Toward Full UIC Primacy for Class VI Wells

Arizona has likewise made significant progress toward obtaining primacy for all UIC well classes, including Class VI wells, under the UIC program. On May 19, 2025, EPA published a proposed rule to approve Arizona’s primacy application. EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on June 25, 2025, and accept comments on its proposal through July 3. Should Arizona’s application be finalized, the state will assume full responsibility for permitting and enforcing all UIC wells, including those used for carbon sequestration. This move represents a critical step for Arizona’s growing CCS industry, positioning the state to manage projects more efficiently.

Impact on CCS Projects and Stakeholders

For stakeholders in the CCS sector, the movement of these states toward primacy is a welcome development. Gaining state-level control over the permitting process for Class VI wells should streamline permitting processes and allow for more tailored regulatory approaches in approved states.

As these states advance through the final stages of the primacy process, companies involved in CCS projects should remain engaged and prepared to navigate the shifting regulatory landscape. The public comment periods for Arizona and Texas provide important opportunities for industry feedback.",https://environmentalenergybrief.sidley.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/MN-18268-Updated-Environmental-and-Energy-Brief-Blog-STORAGE-TANKS-2.jpg,N,,2025-05-22 01:04:50.086611

The decision follows weeks of negotiations involving federal, state, and local officials, as well as labor and industry leaders.

“We appreciate the fact that construction can now resume on Empire Wind, a project which underscores our commitment to deliver energy while supporting local economies and creating jobs,” said Anders Opedal, president and CEO of Equinor ASA.

Opedal credited President Donald Trump, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and several members of Congress for facilitating a solution that will preserve more than 1,500 jobs and ensure ongoing investments in renewable energy infrastructure. He also acknowledged international support from Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and Minister of Finance Jens Stoltenberg.

The stop work order, issued April 16 by the U.S. Department of the Interior, paused progress on the Empire Wind 1 project, which had already secured federal environmental approvals and financing and was more than 30 percent completed.

The offshore wind farm is expected to provide clean energy to more than 500,000 homes in New York and remains on track for commercial operation by 2027, according to Equinor.

Gov. Hochul praised the decision as a victory for workers and clean energy.

“I knew this critical project needed to move forward and have spent weeks pushing the federal government to rescind the stop work order to allow the workers to return and ensure this important source of renewable power could come to fruition,” she said. “After countless conversations with Equinor and White House officials, bringing labor and business to the table to emphasize the importance of this project, I’m pleased that President Trump and Secretary Burgum have agreed to lift the stop work order and allow this project to move forward.”

Hochul said she also reaffirmed that New York will work with the Trump administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law.

“In order to ensure reliability and affordability for consumers, we will be working in earnest to deliver on these objectives,” said the governor.

Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, applauded the administration’s action, saying it’s the right decision for American workers, consumers, and the reliability of the nation’s electric grid.

The 2024 LNG Study was released last December during the Biden administration, with a public comment period through March 20. Based on the study and the public comments received, DOE has made several key findings.

Among them, it found that the United States has a robust natural gas supply that is sufficient to meet growing levels of exports while minimizing impacts to domestic prices. It also said that growing the LNG exports increases the nation’s gross domestic product and expands jobs while improving our trade balance. Further, the DOE response stated that increasing U.S. LNG exports enhances domestic and international global security with no discernable impact to global greenhouse gas emissions.

“President Trump was given a mandate to unleash American energy dominance, and that includes U.S. LNG exports,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said. “The facts are clear: expanding America’s LNG exports is good for Americans and good for the world. Today, the Department of Energy is following the facts, closing the door on the Biden administration’s failed policies, and putting America’s energy future on stronger footing.”

This action marks the completion of the final hurdles left over from the Biden administration’s pause on LNG export permits. Thus, it signals a critical step toward returning to regular order on liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. In summary, DOE concludes that the complete record from the 2024 LNG Export Study, inclusive of the study, the comments received, and this Response to Comments, supports the proposition that exports of LNG from the United States are in the best interest of the American public.

“The 2024 Study confirms what our nation always knew—LNG supports our economy, strengthens our allies, and enhances national security. Biden’s opposition defied reason and reality and hurt American progress. We are pleased to issue the Response to Comments on the 2024 LNG Export Study, which will allow DOE to close out this chapter and fully return to regular order on LNG exports,” Tala Goudarzi, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, said.

The DOE will now proceed with issuing final orders on pending applications to export U.S.-sourced natural gas as LNG to non-free trade agreement countries.

In their letter, the Senators highlight the cost-saving benefits of the program, which is projected to save the average American household $450 on utility bills each year simply by choosing ENERGY STAR certified products.

Since 1992, ENERGY STAR has reduced energy costs for American families and businesses by $500 billion, including $42 billion worth of savings in 2020 alone. For every federal dollar spent on ENERGY STAR, Americans have enjoyed $350 in savings.

“For over three decades, the ENERGY STAR program has lowered Americans’ energy bills by informing consumers about energy efficient products. The program has enjoyed bipartisan support since its creation under authority of Section 103 of the Clean Air Act, most recently receiving $35.7 million in fiscal year 2025 appropriations,” wrote the Senators. “Reporting has indicated, however, that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to eliminate ENERGY STAR without Congressional approval. Not only is the program protected under federal statute and thus illegal for the Administration to terminate unilaterally, but this decision also lacks basic economic sense. We write to urge you to immediately reverse course.”

The Senators continued: “ENERGY STAR is the epitome of an effective public-private partnership. As the program’s administrators, EPA and the Department of Energy set qualifying energy efficiency standards for products. EPA also protects the integrity of the ENERGY STAR brand, ensuring it remains well-known, trusted, and indicative of a quality product. Appliance manufacturers then voluntarily display the ENERGY STAR label, notifying consumers that a product will reduce their energy consumption and lower utility bills. The program strengthens consumer choice by sharing critical product information.”

“Eliminating the ENERGY STAR program will not only raise energy costs for American families and businesses, but also inflict far-reaching economic harms, threatening industry jobs and the reliability of the grid at a time of growing demand. We again urge you to immediately reconsider eliminating this popular and effective Congressionally authorized program,” the Senators concluded.

County commissioners voted at Tuesday night's meeting to get involved.

The county applied for the grant last December and was approved for it in January. Its funds were frozen shortly thereafter as the Trump administration issued executive orders freezing federal funds.

Crime:

Kalamazoo County's Climate Sustainability Coordinator Taylor VanWinkle said the EPA told them the grant was no longer aligned with EPA priorities.

""We were confused by that reasoning, but that's what they gave us,"" VanWinkle told News Channel 3.

The grant provided the county with nearly $19 million that it planned to dedicate towards contractors and suppliers.

$2.1 million was set aside for the training of highly-skilled labor jobs.

Police:

As the county wants to continue to increase climate resiliency in Kalamazoo, especially after another severe storm, the cuts come at an inopportune time.

""There's lots of benefits that are really, really relevant right now, especially when you see increased tornadoes, increased storm damage, increased severity of winds and how that impacts our existing infrastructure,"" VanWinkle said.

In a statement, Kalamazoo County issued concern with the grant's termination.

The statement, in part, is as follows:

The grant was entirely consistent with the EPA’s mission of protecting human health and the environment. Kalamazoo County has operated in good faith, meeting all expectations and preparing to deliver the promised benefits of this program. This decision is a violation of our contractual agreement and undermines the investments made in our workforce and community.

VanWinkle hopes for a positive outcome from the suit so the county can continue to study the ever-changing climate and continue economic growth for Kalamazoo.

The message they’ve gotten instead: When it comes to winning on clean energy, Trump just isn’t interested.
Trump’s zero-sum assessment of the clean energy market has forged an energy strategy even more reliant on fossil fuels than he pursued in his first term.
That vision is coming to a head in Congress, where Republicans are working to slash the clean energy incentives created by Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.
China is the biggest,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.","WASHINGTON — Donald Trump wants to beat China in just about every market — but he’d rather take the loss on clean energy.

In his second term, the U.S. president has returned more committed than ever to promoting fossil fuels and crushing clean, renewable power sources that don’t burn the planet.

Trump’s view is that China has already won the clean energy race, due in part to practices such as forced labor, massive subsidies and intellectual property theft. Trying to compete with Beijing would just make the United States the loser. The president wants the U.S. to focus on energy sources it already dominates, including oil, natural gas and coal.

That represents a complete break from Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, who sought to go toe-to-toe with China in a race for clean energy dominance. Not only that, it contrasts with Trump’s first term, when the White House took an all-you-can-eat-buffet approach to energy and clean power.

The new stance could present America’s competitors with a multibillion-dollar opportunity. And in Washington, it’s opening up a fundamental divide within Trump’s Republican Party as it works through spending talks.

“The second administration is really not about taking half-measures,” said Daniel Simmons, who ran the Energy Department’s energy efficiency and renewable energy office in Trump’s first term. “To all appearances, it is not a battlefield that they care about.”

GOP fissures

Not all Republicans are ready to let China, Europe and other nations win the clean energy race by default.

That intra-GOP division is boiling underneath one of the biggest political controversies in Washington right now: the complicated passage of Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending megabill.

Hard-line conservatives are demanding that the bill include a wholesale gutting of hundreds of billions of dollars in Biden-era clean energy tax incentives, which were aimed at juicing U.S. competitors to Chinese and European manufacturers.

That push threatens to alienate moderate Republicans whose communities stand to gain from factories and other projects enabled by the tax breaks — and who had hoped they could win Trump to their side by framing the incentives as the key to edging out China.

The message they’ve gotten instead: When it comes to winning on clean energy, Trump just isn’t interested.

Trump’s Energy Department confirmed as much in a statement to POLITICO that focused largely on oil — an energy source that the U.S. produces more of than any other country.

“Thanks to President Trump, America is leading the way in lowering costs by removing red tape and unleashing affordable, abundant, and reliable American energy,” the department said Friday. “As the world’s largest oil producer, the United States welcomes a secure and stable global supply of oil that promotes economic prosperity at home and promotes peace and stability around the world.”

The White House referred questions about its clean energy worldview to the Energy Department.

Drilling to beat China?

Trump officials have argued that putting any money into green technology boosts China, which dominates major slices of the global battery, electric vehicle, solar and wind energy supply chains.

Trump’s zero-sum assessment of the clean energy market has forged an energy strategy even more reliant on fossil fuels than he pursued in his first term. Following this approach would jeopardize a U.S. clean energy manufacturing industry that is just beginning to sprout — and, green tech advocates say, all but ensure that China will command the global sector.

That vision is coming to a head in Congress, where Republicans are working to slash the clean energy incentives created by Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. While not proposing to erase the tax breaks altogether, GOP lawmakers in the House have floated tight restrictions outlawing Chinese sourcing in the supply chains of energy projects. Those limits would render most of the tax credits unusable for projects that have not yet been built, effectively squelching the nascent U.S. clean manufacturing sector.

The changes remain in limbo as part of the broader budget reconciliation bill, the legislative vehicle for green-lighting Republicans’ and Trump’s policy agenda that can pass with a simple majority vote in Congress. House Republicans are trying to forge a compromise among fiscal conservatives and blocs of GOP lawmakers that want to preserve clean energy credits and raise tax deduction caps for state and local taxes.

Trump’s presence looms over the negotiations. He has repeatedly vowed to end Biden’s programs — the nation’s largest-ever investment in clean energy and fighting climate change — while labeling them the “green new scam.” Cutting many of those policies, such as consumer credits to purchase electric vehicles, would fund a small portion of his administration’s other priorities, including trillions of dollars in tax breaks.

“They don’t see climate change as a problem,” George David Banks, who ran Trump’s first-term climate portfolio, said of the current team’s outlook. He added: “They don’t want to essentially create a jobs program for China.”

Defenders of the IRA tax credits say wiping them out would wipe out an American jobs program, one whose benefits would flow to heavily Republican communities as well as Democratic strongholds. Private sector manufacturing projects seizing on Biden’s incentives had been projected to create roughly 160,000 jobs, according to analyses published late last year.

Overturning the subsidies would eliminate a potential U.S. export market for solar modules and batteries that could be worth as much as $50 billion by 2030, according to another analysis by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Other countries would fill an $80 billion investment gap left by shuttered U.S. solar facilities, electric vehicle shops and battery gigafactories.

Many countries stand to benefit from the U.S. vacating the space, the Johns Hopkins researchers wrote. But governments outside the U.S. would face risks as well: Those that fail to encourage cleantech investments at home may fall even further behind China, which would likely benefit in every industrial category.

The researchers also raised the prospect of a transition of intellectual property to China. As U.S. businesses shuttered, they said, foreign companies could purchase their technical knowledge at fire-sale prices.

Trump’s barrage of tariffs against nations worldwide would limit some of the advantage countries could gain by selling clean technology to the U.S., said Tim Sahay, one of the authors of the study. Still, he said, the upshot from Trump’s policies was clear — including for European allies that had erupted in fury over Biden’s use of protectionist tax breaks to move clean energy manufacturing to the United States.

“China would be the biggest winner, but not the only winner … The rest of the world wins,” Sahay said. It’s “basically the IRA in reverse. When the IRA passed, foreigners were like, ‘Oh my God, Americans are stealing our jobs and investments because of their superior fiscal space.’ Well, now the IRA is gone, then foreigners are like, ‘Well, more for us.’”

Some conservative clean energy supporters still hope they can persuade Trump to back tax credits that have yielded solar manufacturing and battery-making plants across Republican strongholds in the Sun Belt and Rust Belt.

Those advocates criticized the IRA for being too lenient in allowing Chinese content into the supply chains of products receiving the tax incentives. But they believe Trump would bless tweaks that tighten foreign content requirements to retain incentives that support blue-collar jobs in the U.S.

“There's an enormous and rapidly growing market for low-carbon technologies around the world, and right now the U.S. is a secondary player,” said Greg Bertelsen, CEO of the Cleaner Economy Coalition, a business advocacy organization that promotes low-carbon manufacturing at the state and federal level. “There's a recognition within the Trump administration that we need to be competing in these markets for these technologies.”

Trumpism on the road

Trump officials have been making a very different case.

Last month, Energy Secretary Chris Wright flew to Eastern Europe to propose that ministers from Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and other regional governments join “Team Energy Freedom,” urging them to embrace oil, gas and nuclear energy and reject what he framed as climate dogma.

“Climate alarmism has reduced freedom, prosperity and national security,” he said, adding — in language that carried a particular charge addressed to former communist bloc countries — that it may be a Trojan horse to “grow centralization and re-establish top-down control.”

Wright’s subordinate, Tommy Joyce, was even more blunt in telling a gathering of 60 governments in London last month that the pursuit of climate policy was a gift to Beijing.

“There are no wind turbines without concessions to or coercion from China,” he said.

People outside the MAGA world also acknowledge the dominance China has built over decades of developing its clean energy supply chains.

In solar, batteries, electric vehicles and to some extent wind power, “China started early. China is the biggest,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

These are the core clean technologies the world is going to need en masse in the coming decades as it shifts toward a cleaner energy system. And in all of these fields, Li said, “the Chinese lead is significant and irreversible.”

In the past months, for example, two rival Chinese companies — BYD and CATL — made potentially game-changing claims in announcing they had developed electric vehicle batteries that could get 400 or even 500 kilometers (roughly 250 to 310 miles) from just a five-minute charge. By contrast, Tesla boasts that its “superchargers” can give drivers around 320 kilometers in about 15 minutes.

Republican proposals would also hamstring some clean energy technologies that the Trump administration has touted, such as next-generation nuclear, fusion and geothermal power, according to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group. The proposed tweaks to subsidies would essentially eliminate the long-term price signals that early-stage technologies covet, eroding their business case. Beyond that, the administration’s massive spending and job cuts across federal agencies and science research threaten to constrain U.S. innovation.

Rather than focusing on clean energy technologies such as batteries and EVs, the Trump administration has so far made critical minerals the forefront of its strategy to combat China, said a State Department official who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Those efforts focus on extracting and processing raw materials rather than supporting value-added industries like battery-making or electric vehicles.

The official said the administration’s opposition to subsidies for green technology doesn’t mean it opposes the technologies writ large — apart from wind energy, which Trump has made clear for years that he despises.

America alone

Apart from the current U.S. government, no other major power has determined that China’s dominance means that action to fight climate change needs to take a back seat. The Biden administration’s argument, one still being pursued in Europe, was that a targeted industrial strategy could claw back some share of those industries.

Those strategies have often come cloaked in pledges to make this country or that country a “clean energy superpower.” But Li said there was a danger of “making too big of a promise. A promise that cannot be entirely fulfilled.”

Li said he had long feared that a U.S. president would someday ask: If China’s lead is so big, “then why do we play the game?”

That is the conclusion being drawn in the White House during Trump’s second term. And it helps explain why the administration has broken so radically with past U.S. policy, shut down government funding for future projects, kneecapped agencies that deal with clean energy, and reversed regulations.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20/8274880.jpg",N,,2025-05-21 23:00:35.769094

Defunding EVs

Honda recently revealed that it is making adjustments to previously established forecasts for electric vehicle sales. The company had originally estimated EVs would account for 30% of its sales by 2030, but the ratio is now expected to fall below that target. Thus, Honda is reassessing its strategy and shifting some $21 billion in earmarked funds to higher-growth products, including hybrids.

ADAS: Advancing Competitiveness

Another technology that Honda will address with renewed focus is its ADAS (advanced driver assistance system). This proprietary, next-generation system will assist drivers with tasks like steering and acceleration.

According to Honda, developing this technology has been challenging, especially in urban areas. Still, the company believes it has an advantage based on the behavior planning and recognition data it has amassed.

The automaker says it will apply its new ADAS to many “key EV and HEV models” with the goal of hitting the market around 2027. These may include three new hybrid powertrains, due at that time, that are set to offer a 10% improvement in fuel efficiency.

Supply Chain, Production Support

Honda also said it strives to bolster its supply chain strategy so it won’t be easily impacted by fluctuating demand. These factors, Honda said, could include shifts between EV and HEV technology, as well as changes in government policies globally.

Honda said it will also establish “a flexible production system that is capable of optimizing production according to demand and sales strategies.”

The car you drive years in the future might run off a battery being invented in a lab right now. There's a great battery race underway, a tech battle to create better electric vehicles. It has high stakes for drivers, companies and the planet. China has the lead, but it's game on in Detroit. NPR's John Ruwitch and Camila Domonoske have our story from both sides of the globe.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Mandarin).

JOHN RUWITCH, BYLINE: At the Shanghai Auto Show this spring, you could not escape technology if you tried. There were no tickets or badges for reporters. Instead, at the entrance, I had to look into a camera.

And it's a face scanner that let us in, so high tech right at the gate.

The tech on display is part of why thousands of people have come to the event. Dai Yiyao from Shanghai brought his 12-year-old son along.

DAI YIYAO: (Speaking Mandarin).

RUWITCH: He says he wanted to open his eyes to all the development that's happening. And as I wander from display to display, car company after car company, there is a lot to take in...

(CROSSTALK)

RUWITCH: ...Cars that can pivot on the spot, cars that can operate in water like a boat, concept cars with quadcopter rotors on them. And this...

UNIDENTIFIED SALESMAN: It's the world's first drone system that only designed for the vehicle.

RUWITCH: You can launch the drone to follow your vehicle, or it can speed ahead, the salesman explains.

UNIDENTIFIED SALESMAN: If I have a traffic jam, I can take up my drone and see what happened in the front.

RUWITCH: A few steps away is perhaps a more consequential advancement. It's from BYD, the world's biggest EV maker by sales and China's top brand.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Mandarin).

RUWITCH: This is a demo of what the company calls flash charging. It's charging at high voltage, which requires special batteries that are so efficient that they don't overheat. An engineer explains the benefits.

UNIDENTIFIED ENGINEER: (Speaking Mandarin).

RUWITCH: It can add more than a mile of range per second of charging and almost 250 miles in just five minutes. By contrast, U.S. market leader Tesla's fastest charger takes more than three times as long. BYD says it's pioneering fast charging to eliminate anxiety about charge times and vehicle range, a major concern for EV owners.

UNIDENTIFIED ENGINEER: (Speaking Mandarin).

RUWITCH: The engineer, who declined to give his name, citing company policy, says it takes less time to charge this car than your mobile phone. BYD plans to install 4,000 fast-charging stations in China. None will be in the United States, though. Chinese cars are largely absent from the U.S. market. That's thanks to a combination of heavy tariffs and U.S. restrictions of web-enabled Chinese car technologies.

GEO TAVERAS: (Speaking Spanish).

RUWITCH: Elsewhere, though, Chinese brands are drumming up excitement. BYD and others brought bloggers and influencers to Shanghai from around the world for the car show.

TAVERAS: This is happening in real time.

RUWITCH: Geo Taveras is an influencer from the Dominican Republic who makes videos about cars. He said BYD flew him out, all expenses paid.

TAVERAS: I mean, the technology is already developed. You took the same time when you go to the gas station to put gas in your car.

RUWITCH: BYD and others in China benefited from strong government investment and subsidies, and some say that helped them get ahead. CATL, another leading Chinese battery firm, announced that it, too, is rolling out ultrafast-charging car batteries by the end of the year. It's also launching a battery powered by sodium, which is cheaper and more readily available than lithium.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Mandarin).

RUWITCH: When BYD's fast-charging demo is over, a group of men in suits crowds around a BYD employee. One peppers him with questions about how it all works.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Speaking Mandarin).

RUWITCH: Before they walk away, I ask who they work for.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Speaking Mandarin).

RUWITCH: The Japanese, one man says. Dai Yiyao, with his 12-year-old son, says that's become the norm these days.

DAI: (Through interpreter) I told my son it used to be that we were the ones with our pens out evaluating the cars.

RUWITCH: Now foreigners are learning from China. He says he thinks foreign companies have been resting on their laurels, which has put China in the driver's seat.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY HUMMING)

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Now, Western companies would say they're not resting on their laurels at all. No American company has announced anything like five-minute charging, but companies are very focused on batteries that would make EVs cheaper and let them drive farther. Scientists have been working on that for years in GM's R&D labs north of Detroit.

Oh, my God. It's such a maze. Do you get lost?

ANDY OURY: In here? Yes. Especially...

DOMONOSKE: GM battery engineer Andy Oury is walking with journalists on a rare tour of the labs. Last week, GM announced a new battery design developed here, a breakthrough. Each room in here focuses on one tiny piece of the battery puzzle...

OURY: Negative ions.

DOMONOSKE: ...Making new ingredients for batteries, analyzing them, combining them. Competitor batteries are also torn apart for study, and yes, that definitely includes Chinese tech.

(SOUNDBITE OF FANS WHIRRING)

DOMONOSKE: Batteries are made of alternating layers of chemicals. With big fans whirring, GM battery engineer Nicole Ellison explains part of the process of turning raw materials into that battery.

NICOLE ELLISON: We mix these all together in - essentially what we have here is your KitchenAid mixer. We want to make a nice cake batter of this solution.

DOMONOSKE: Behind her in a sealed room, two people are carefully pouring a black liquid, which does in fact have the consistency of cake batter. Baking metaphors also help explain GM's recent breakthrough. Here's Andy Oury again.

OURY: So it's all about how much of each ingredient? How do you process it? How do you mix it?

DOMONOSKE: And the same ingredients - eggs, butter, milk - but different processes can make everything from scrambled eggs to popovers.

OURY: Right? Very different - same ingredients.

DOMONOSKE: OK, so now imagine if you want to make a cake cheaper but still taste good. You could cut down on the more expensive ingredients, but it won't taste right unless you can somehow tweak the baking process to compensate. And that's what GM did. GM's new battery uses more manganese, which is cheap, and a lot less nickel and cobalt, which are pricey. But GM says it holds as much energy and lasts as long as batteries packed with more expensive stuff. Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for Telemetry, says this is good in a few ways.

SAM ABUELSAMID: You get that lower cost, but also you've got the ability to source the materials from more places.

DOMONOSKE: Evelina Stoikou is with BloombergNEF, a research company.

EVELINA STOIKOU: It's also exciting that there is a roadmap and there's a timeline on when we expect to see it in vehicles.

DOMONOSKE: By 2028, GM says. Now, this breakthrough is really a tweak to today's battery recipe. There is also a race to develop something totally new. Lots of labs, including smaller startups, are working on things like solid-state batteries, a new design that promises a huge boost in performance. If today's batteries are like a cake, solid state would be a different dessert altogether. But those recipes are not ready yet. It's an open question who will perfect them first. Kurt Kelty runs GM's battery program after years at Tesla and other companies. He acknowledges in the race for new battery tech, China has an advantage.

KURT KELTY: Some of these Chinese companies have massive R&D teams, and they're getting a lot of funding from their governments.

DOMONOSKE: But he points out the types of batteries that Asian companies make so well were developed in the U.S.

KELTY: They were all invented here.

DOMONOSKE: Before being scaled up in Asia, where the manufacturing was. Today, American labs are still coming up with new battery ideas, so he argues...

KELTY: We can build an amazing battery industry here. We have the opportunity here to really, really accelerate.

DOMONOSKE: And even go beyond Chinese tech, he says, if demand for batteries in the U.S. can drive innovation from start to finish, from research lab all the way to massive factories.

Rep. Summer Lee Celebrates Over $660,000 in Solar for Schools Funding in PA-12

WASHINGTON, D.C. – MAY 21, 2025 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12) celebrated the investment of more than $660,000 in funds awarded to two schools in PA-12 as part of Pennsylvania’s Solar for Schools Grant Program. The program, administered by the Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) and funded through the Commonwealth Financing Authority (CFA), will help schools reduce long-term energy costs, lower carbon emissions, and invest in clean energy education and workforce development.

The Clairton City School District was awarded $361,990 to support a solar power project that will cut energy costs and expand learning opportunities for students. Additionally, the School District of Pittsburgh will receive $300,000 to support solar panel installation at Carrick High School, promoting sustainability and technical education in one of the city’s key public schools.

“Schools in Western Pennsylvania are already doing so much with limited resources and this funding will provide critical relief to districts that have long been underfunded,” said Rep. Summer Lee. “By helping our schools go solar, we’re reducing utility costs, cutting carbon emissions, creating good-paying union jobs, and giving our students the tools to succeed in the green economy of the future. I’m proud to see Clairton and the school district of Pittsburgh leading the way on clean energy, and I’ll keep fighting to ensure every school in our district has the resources to grow, innovate, and lead. This is about our kids learning skills for the jobs of tomorrow and about workers in our communities building the infrastructure to get us there. I’m grateful to Governor Shapiro for prioritizing clean energy investments like this and for recognizing that climate action and economic justice go hand-in-hand.”

The Solar for Schools initiative builds on Governor Josh Shapiro’s energy strategy to promote clean, affordable, and reliable energy across the Commonwealth. The program supports the purchase and installation of solar energy systems, energy storage, permitting, and utility interconnection — and positions schools as leaders in Pennsylvania’s transition to a clean energy economy.

Yet California’s radical mandates require 35 percent of all vehicle sales to be electric by 2026 – 6 months from now.
That is not what the American people want, and it cannot be what Senate Republicans want, either,” continued Heinrich.","The Republican-led Senate moved Wednesday to overturn key Biden-era waivers allowing California to set its own vehicle emissions, a major blow to that state’s effort to regulate pollution from cars and trucks that could have broad environmental impacts for the rest of the country.

And they will do it bypassing the 60-vote threshold typically needed to approve such a measure, infuriating Democrats who warned Republicans — despite their promises not to — were weakening the legislative filibuster. Republican leaders denied that was their intent and vowed to preserve the filibuster forever.

Republicans were livid when at the end of former President Joe Biden’s term, the Environmental Protection Agency greenlit California’s plan to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035, shifting the state towards electric vehicles. Republicans say the California plan will hurt the US economy and impact the rest of the country because other states follow its emissions rules.

In response, they readied action under the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to claw back agency rules without needing 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.

Tensions have built for weeks as Senate Republicans deliberated behind closed doors about whether to push the measure through despite a finding from the House’s Government Accountability Office that the CRA could not be used to nullify the California emissions waiver. Senate Republicans don’t believe the GAO has the authority to determine that.

The Senate parliamentarian — the neutral arbiter of Senate procedure — deferred to the GAO viewpoint. Despite that, the Senate took a series of votes to put it on a track to pass these CRAs in the coming days.

California has for many years set its own emission standards separate from the federal government. For decades, federal law has granted California the authority to do so, but the waiver has become a partisan football in recent years. President Donald Trump revoked that authority during his first term in 2019, before Biden reinstated it in 2022.

In one of the Biden administration’s last major actions on climate, the EPA in 2024 finalized California’s waiver – effectively greenlighting the state’s plan to phase out sales of new gas vehicles by 2035, the first regulation of its kind in the US.

California’s vehicle regulations matter a great deal to the auto industry because close to 20 other states and the District of Columbia have adopted them. And they have a big impact on climate policy; emissions from vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming pollution in the US.

Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso called California’s efforts a “fantasyland” that will hurt ranchers and farmers in his home state of Wyoming.

“California’s EV mandates ban the sale of gas-powered cars and trucks. They threaten the freedom of every American to choose what they drive,” he said on the floor. “EVs currently make up 7 percent of the U.S. market. Even in California, they account for only 20 percent of vehicle sales. And sales are stalling. Yet California’s radical mandates require 35 percent of all vehicle sales to be electric by 2026 – 6 months from now. By 2035, it jumps to 100 percent.”

Senate Democrats have argued that not accepting the parliamentarian’s guidance sets a dangerous precedent, and they are particularly concerned that the GOP may do it again as she sets some of the perimeters of what will be allowed in the massive tax, spending cuts and immigration reconciliation bill moving through Congress now.

“It’s going nuclear, plain and simple. It’s overruling the parliamentarian. And second, what goes around comes around,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on Tuesday, referring to the so-called nuclear option, which is when the majority party changes Senate rules on a party line vote instead of 67-vote supermajority typically required to make a change.

Democrats insist that the Californian regulations were created as “waivers” under the Clean Air Act, meaning that they are not considered “rules” that can be overturned through the CRA. The GAO — which weighed in on the issue when that chamber passed these CRAs recently with bipartisan support — agreed.

However, Senate Republicans insist that they are not defying the parliamentarian and have said that Democrats’ concern for weakening the filibuster is hypocritical, coming from the party that has expressed opposition to the filibuster’s role in recent years.

“The only people that have attempted to get rid of the legislative filibuster – the Democrats – every single one up there that’s popping off and spouting off has voted, literally, to get rid of the legislative filibuster,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday.

“This is a novel and narrow issue that deals with the Government Accountability Office and whether or not they ought to be able to determine what is a rule and what isn’t, or whether the administration and the Congress ought to be able to make that decision,” he added.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, echoed Schumer’s concerns in a statement ahead of Wednesday’s vote.

“If Senate Republicans force a vote on the California Clean Air Act Waivers, they set a precedent that will allow Congress to overturn nearly any agency decision nationwide,” he warned. “I urge my colleagues to reject this gross overreach.”

“By opening this door, Republicans threaten to destroy our permitting and regulatory system, leading to higher energy costs for Americans and making it impossible for new developments to come online. Indeed, nearly every major and minor project the federal government touches could be stalled, creating significant uncertainty if not complete chaos. That is not what the American people want, and it cannot be what Senate Republicans want, either,” continued Heinrich.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2092455726.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-05-22 01:04:46.199114

In the first, Trump is waging war on constitutional government, with a full-spectrum attack on the idea of the United States as a nation of laws and not men.

You see it in the words of Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and many other figures in the American political tradition.","It’s fitting that a political movement whose slogan is the backward-looking “Make America Great Again” — and whose tribune, Donald Trump, appears to live in an eternal 1990 of his own mind — is waging war on the American future.

This war has four theaters of conflict. In the first, Trump is waging war on constitutional government, with a full-spectrum attack on the idea of the United States as a nation of laws and not men. He hopes to make it a government of one man: himself, unbound by anything other than his singular will. Should the president win his campaign against self-government, future Americans won’t be citizens of a republic as much as subjects of a personalist autocracy.

In the second theater of conflict, the MAGA movement is waging war on the nation’s economic future, rejecting two generations of integration and interdependency with the rest of the world in favor of American autarky, of effectively closing our borders to goods and people from around the world so that the United States might make itself into an impenetrable fortress — a garrison state with the power to dictate the terms of the global order, especially in its own hemisphere. In this new world, Americans will abandon service-sector work in favor of manufacturing and heavy industry.

“This is the new model,” the secretary of commerce, Howard Lutnick, said in an interview with CNBC last month, “where you work in these kind of plants for the rest of your life and your kids work here and your grandkids work here.” The reality is that this particular campaign — this effort to de-skill the working population of the United States — is more likely to immiserate the country and impoverish its residents than it is to inaugurate a golden age of prosperity.

Not content to leave Americans without a meaningful democratic future or one of broad economic prosperity, the White House is also fighting a pitched battle against a sustainable climate future.

In the same way that Trump and his allies have rejected the obligation to pass the nation’s tradition of self-governance on to the next generation, they have also rejected the obligation to pass a living planet on to those who will inherit the earth. Theirs, instead, is an agenda of unlimited resource extraction, with little regard for the consequences. Upon taking office, the president issued an executive order directing federal agencies to allow drilling in formerly protected areas. This, despite the fact that American energy production is at an all-time high — and the United States is now a net exporter of oil and gas.

Trump is aiming to open national forests to logging and has issued an executive order that would expedite efforts to engage in deep-sea mining, despite the risks it poses to critical ecosystems. He is also openly hostile to renewable energy, despite its growing efficiency and declining cost. (Recall that during the campaign, Trump promised to act in the direct interests of oil producers, telling them outright that he would approve their projects and expand drilling, provided they funded his presidential effort to the tune of $1 billion.)

The White House wants to wipe out a large part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — slashing its budget by a quarter and shuttering programs in climate research — as well as obliterate a third of the budget of U.S. Geological Survey, an agency whose work is vital, notes Science magazine, “to efforts such as monitoring water quality, protecting endangered species and predicting landscape impacts from climate change.”

The fourth and final theater of the MAGA movement’s war on the future is adjacent to the third one: an assault on the nation’s capacity to produce scientific, technological and medical breakthroughs.

Whether under the guise of ending diversity efforts or in disciplining institutions of higher education or commandeering the federal administrative state for the president’s corrupt purposes, the White House has taken a buzz saw to billions of dollars in federal grants for research in medicine and the hard sciences. In the first three months of the year, according to a minority report of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, the Trump administration cut $2.7 billion from the National Institutes of Health, including funds for biomedical research and experimental cancer treatments.

The Trump administration also seeks to slash the National Science Foundation by more than half, pushing a $4.7 billion cut in its preliminary budget request. Trump’s National Science Foundation administrators have also paused or terminated hundreds of grants, according to the science journal Nature. In addition, the White House wants to cut spending in the Department of Energy’s research wing — the nation’s single largest funder of the physical sciences, which supports efforts to translate basic research into new technologies and applications — and seeks to defund or eliminate global disease monitoring and health-tracking systems at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This is the wanton, pointless destruction of a MAGA cultural revolution. It serves no obvious purpose other than to shrink the government in the most arbitrary and capricious way imaginable. The federal government is the leading source of funding for science and technology research in the United States. How does one make America great again by destroying its capacity to develop advanced technology? Who prospers when we rob our scientists of the resources necessary to make breakthroughs that could transform our society for the better?

Even the most venal and shortsighted billionaire captains of industry should recognize how much their fortunes and influence rest on the work of countless researchers whose efforts often yield results that pay dividends for years. We can’t know, for certain, what technologies and treatments Americans will miss out on because the Trump administration decided it was too expensive to maintain the American science establishment or thought that science was too liberal, too woke. But there’s no doubt that we’ll be worse off. And this is to say nothing of the potential brain drain of scientists who will leave this country for greener pastures or those from abroad who will choose to remain in their home countries, where they live under governments that are at least a little less eager to give themselves lobotomies.

One war, four fronts. The aim, whether stated explicitly or not, is to erase the future as Americans have understood it and as they might have anticipated it.

In service of what, exactly? What vision does the MAGA movement have instead?

Here, an interesting debate has unfolded.

Writing in The Guardian, Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor argue that there’s no real vision at all. Instead, they write, “the governing ideology of the far right in our age of escalating disasters has become a monstrous, supremacist survivalism.” This is an “end times fascism” that is taking advantage of social and environmental catastrophes and “simultaneously provoking and planning for them.” As for the ordinary people who form the base of the MAGA movement and its associated political tendencies, “End times fascism offers the promise of many more affordable arks and bunkers, these ones well within reach for lower-level foot soldiers.”

It is, Klein and Taylor write, a national bunker mentality — a way of being defined by plunder to prepare for the long night ahead and exclusion of those who don’t truly belong to the national community.

Responding in his Substack newsletter, Adam Tooze says, in effect, not so fast. Trump and his allies do have a vision of the future, albeit a retro one of self-sacrifice leading to new prosperity, brought on by the president’s “Liberation Day” tariffs. It is, Tooze writes, “a direct challenge to prevailing norms of American consumerism in the name of a better future.”

Commenting on Klein, Taylor and Tooze, John Ganz — the author of “When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s” (and with whom I co-host a podcast) — makes a useful intervention, invoking the historian Jeffrey Herf’s notion of “reactionary modernism” to show how the MAGA movement is a “peculiar and perverse synthesis” of backward-facing nihilism and resentment and future-oriented utopianism. With Trumpism, Ganz writes, “there is the idea of production, national expansion, growth, development, but combined with a sharp restriction and rollback of who gets to share in the political and social bounties of citizenship.”

Trump and his allies are fighting a war on the future and, in particular, on the idea that our technological progress should proceed hand in hand with social and ethical progress — on the liberal universalism that demands an expansive and expanding area of concern for the state and society. And they are fighting a war for the future insofar as this means the narrowing of our moral horizons for the sake of unleashing certain energies tied to hierarchies of race, gender and sexuality.

As Ganz observes, the Trumpist vision of the future is obsessed with heavy industry and defense-oriented technological development. It rejects “‘feminized’ service-sector capitalism,” he writes, as well as a concern with climate change that “seems feminine.” And it is not for nothing, Tooze notes, that when Trump speaks of sacrifice for his tariffs, he zeros in on “dolls” and “washing machines,” objects associated with girls, women and domestic labor.

This is the future that the MAGA movement has in mind, as revealed by its actions in power so far. It is a future in which the United States abandons its Enlightenment heritage and liberal aspirations in favor of a closed society made up of supposedly native people — recall JD Vance’s paean to the soil of eastern Kentucky in his speech accepting the vice-presidential nomination last year — and rooted in notions of dominance and zero-sum competition.

I find this account of Trumpism as a reactionary futurist movement persuasive. This year I wrote about Trump’s lack of future orientation with regard to the Constitution, a document written and ratified with posterity in mind. In fact, Americans have been preoccupied with the idea that their republic is a steward of sorts for self-government. You see it in the words of Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and many other figures in the American political tradition.

Trump may reject this particular future orientation, but that doesn’t mean he lacks one. It does mean that his runs counter to what we expect to hear from an American political leader, especially one who occupies the Oval Office.

For those opposed to it, it is tempting to say that MAGA’s vision of the future is so unappealing — so profoundly unattractive — that most people will reject it. But Trump’s political longevity and success, even if they don’t translate to a full-throated endorsement of his entire movement, make clear that this is naïve.

There are no guarantees that the public won’t embrace Trump’s future, all the more so because there does not appear to be much of an alternative to his vision of closed borders and closed societies. There are few people with the reach to contest the president — and even fewer in the putative opposition — who have tried to speak to something more than simple maintenance of the status quo or who have tried to represent the aspirations of ordinary people with a transformative vision of what the future could be for everyone, not just a fortunate and select few.

We have, in this country, a powerful movement eager to summon an authoritarian future. What we need is a movement dedicated to an egalitarian one, to a future in which all Americans can live the lives they choose to make for themselves — a country that rejects walls and rigid hierarchies in favor of the democratic virtues and universalist ideals of this country’s best traditions.

We have names for this vision. Frederick Douglass called it the “composite nation.” W.E.B. Du Bois called it the “abolition democracy,” and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of a “beloved community.”

With these materials, we can imagine a better future and contest the dark dreams of those in power. And if our political leaders are too timid to embark on that task — too afraid of backlash to think beyond the familiar — then we, as citizens still and not yet subjects, have an obligation to do so.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21bouie-qcjh/21bouie-qcjh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 21:04:44.047997

“Cities are rudderless when it comes to reliance from federal support,” Gordon said.","The federal funding tap has been turned off.

That’s the reality cities, states, and the clean-energy sector are facing just months into the new Trump administration.

It’s electric, a Brooklyn-based curbside EV charging startup, is trying to make the best of the situation by helping its clients—like the cities of Boston, San Francisco, and Detroit—figure out effective ways to pursue their electrification goals without federal support.

“We’re really excited to be bringing this technology to all of these different cities, who are facing not only the same problem they faced before, which is how to scale EV infrastructure in a way that’s actually affordable,” Tiya Gordon, it’s electric’s co-founder and COO, told Tech Brew, “but the larger issue…is that most cities now are having to proceed with their electrification plans without any federal subsidies.”

“Their grants have been frozen or removed or put on a very high shelf, with a lack of clarity around when it can get pulled down from that shelf in the future,” she added. “So we’re working shoulder-to-shoulder with a lot of our city and state partners to try and find solutions for electrification, with these new challenges around us.”

Gordon will join Tech Brew on Thursday, May 29, for a panel discussion on priorities in EV infrastructure during our live event, “Power Shift: Navigating the Intersection of Energy and Transportation.”

The company’s business model involves partnering with property owners to tap into existing electricity supplies in buildings, bypassing the need for any new utility connections. It installs Level 2 EV chargers and pulls power from behind the meter, at no cost to the property owner. The model aims to help solve for the fact that while about a third of US households live in multi-family housing, most of those households don’t have access to at-home charging.

Gordon said that it’s electric knows from firsthand experience that federal funding has been cut off, and at the same time no new federal funding opportunities are available.

It’s electric’s model is free to cities, so the startup is trying to take advantage of the opportunities that are still out there.

“Cities are rudderless when it comes to reliance from federal support,” Gordon said. “But what that’s created is an opportunity for cities to just lead this process by themselves.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/87a5d354cf142c4e77c93066b7d57e57c55cbbe0-1500x1000.png?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-05-21 22:05:29.005610

But Democrats and even some Republicans claim ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is anything but.
""The big beautiful bill is going to save the American taxpayer a fortune,"" said Michigan GOP Chair Jim Runestad.
To offset the cost of about $3.8 trillion, Republicans want to scale back clean energy tax credits introduced under President Joe Biden's administration.
""If it wasn’t for the $7 trillion dollar tax giveaway - they’re trying to make these tax giveaways and tax cuts permanent for companies and billionaires,"" she said.","A central point in President Donald Trump's signature legislative package is Medicaid.

Big picture view:

They say it's about accountability, but Democrats claim it is a recipe for mass coverage loss.

With just days until Memorial Day, Speaker Mike Johnson is trying to pass a sweeping 1,000-page legislative package that includes massive tax breaks, spending cuts, and tougher border security. But Democrats and even some Republicans claim ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is anything but.

""The big beautiful bill is going to save the American taxpayer a fortune,"" said Michigan GOP Chair Jim Runestad.

Named after a phrase Trump has used to describe his policy vision, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" would make permanent the individual and estate tax cuts first passed in 2017 and delivering on some promises Trump made on the 2024 campaign trail.

""They got rid of the tax on tips, they got rid of the tax on overtime, they’re reducing or eliminating the tax on social security,"" Runestad said. ""They’re expanding our energy program to get cheaper energy, they are getting more border security in this bill.""

To offset the cost of about $3.8 trillion, Republicans want to scale back clean energy tax credits introduced under President Joe Biden's administration.

The bill also bumps the standard deduction and child tax credit, and it allows small businesses to deduct more of their income.

But the bill is facing some criticism. Democrats call it a gift to the rich and an attack on the social safety net.

Some moderate Republicans are worried about possible cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs back home.

Outspoken Democrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) sounded off on the bill to FOX 2.

""If it wasn’t for the $7 trillion dollar tax giveaway - they’re trying to make these tax giveaways and tax cuts permanent for companies and billionaires,"" she said. ""I saw the statistic, .01 percent high income. They are going to get close to a little over $300,000 in tax breaks - for what?

""They don't need it. Why we can’t we fund programs that are critically important.""

Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.
“You don’t care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,” Zeldin said.
American taxpayers “put President Trump in office because of people like you,” Zeldin replied.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency clashed with Democratic senators Wednesday, accusing one of being an “aspiring fiction writer” and saying another does not “care about wasting money.’' Democrats countered that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s tenure will likely mean more Americans contracting lung cancer and other illnesses.

The heated exchanges, at a Senate hearing to discuss President Donald Trump’s proposal to slash the agency’s budget in half, showed the sharp partisan differences over Zeldin’s deregulatory approach. Zeldin, a former Republican congressman, has said his tenure will turbocharge the American economy while ensuring clean air and water. Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

Zeldin, who took office in January, has proposed a flood of changes that would sharply reduce the agency’s workforce, terminate billions of dollars in grants approved by the Biden administration and roll back dozens of environmental rules including landmark regulations on climate change and pollution from coal-fired power plants.

Sharp words, back and forth

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Zeldin that a plan to cut EPA spending by 55% means that, to Zeldin and Trump, “more than half of the environmental efforts of the EPA ... to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water are just a waste.” If approved by Congress, the budget cuts “will mean there’s more diesel and more other particulate matter in the air” and that “water that Americans drink is going to have more chemicals,” Schiff said.

“Your legacy will be more lung cancer,” he told Zeldin. “It’ll be more bladder cancer. It’ll be more leukemia and pancreatic cancer ... more rare cancers of innumerable varieties.’'

Replied Zeldin: “I understand that you are an aspiring fiction writer. I see why.”

Schiff said the real fiction was Zeldin’s apparent belief that he can cut the EPA’s budget in half “and it won’t affect people’s health, or their water or their air.” Schiff said the Republican administrator was “totally beholden to the oil industry,” adding: “You could give a rat’s ass about how much cancer your agency causes.”

Zeldin engaged in a similar rhetorical match with Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Whitehouse said Zeldin and others at EPA have made “baseless accusations of fraud” about grants awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden, removed “career officials who stood up for the rule of law” and deployed FBI agents “to harass career civil servants.’'

Questions over whether Zeldin reviewed canceled grants

Whitehouse also challenged Zeldin’s contention that he had personally reviewed 781 Biden-era grants totaling nearly $2 billion that the Trump administration later canceled. The grants were intended to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country, but Zeldin said they were plagued by conflicts of interest and unqualified recipients.

“You don’t care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,” Zeldin said.

When Whitehouse pressed to see Zeldin’s schedule to prove he personally reviewed the grants before canceling them, Zeldin said he’s worked on the issue “almost every single day” since taking office.

“We are cracking down on every waste, every aspect of abuse,’' Zeldin said, adding that Whitehouse seemed unable to grasp that more than one person could review EPA’s grant program.

“I am insisting on the facts,’' Whitehouse said.

American taxpayers “put President Trump in office because of people like you,” Zeldin replied. “They have Republicans in charge of the House and Senate because of people like you. You don’t want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse.”

Whitehouse replied that Zeldin should explain why Justice Department lawyers, speaking under oath on behalf of the agency, have “said that everything you just said is not true. That’s what I want.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/398f02c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5161x2903+0+269/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F1a%2F62%2F976cb6f984b59188c1cd174ff8ed%2Fa40c41e20ec34726bffd0a918941db93,N,,2025-05-21 22:05:11.657391

Engie said the project will include low-carbon solar trackers from Nextracker.

According to the company, this will be a first in Latin America with the US tracker manufacturer providing 2,311 of its low-carbon NX Horizon trackers. The trackers will incorporate steel produced in the US using electric arc furnace technology. Nextracker claims these low-carbon trackers reduce carbon emissions by 30% compared with traditional manufacturing methods.

Nextracker achieved this milestone last year, when it received confirmation from a third-party verified analysis.

Zelestra orders 1GWh of BESS from Sungrow

In related Chilean news, Spanish independent power producer Zelestra has ordered 1GWh of BESS technology plus PCS equipment from Sungrow for a solar-plus-storage project in the northern region of Tarapacá.

As covered by our sister site Energy-storage.news, the solar-plus-storage Aurora project will include 220MW of solar PV for which Sungrow will provide its 1+X Modular Inverter with an 8.8MW block design.

The project will provide power to utility Abastible outside of solar generation hours via a power purchase agreement (PPA) signed with Zelestra in March this year.

Construction of the Aurora project is currently underway, and Sungrow is expected to deliver the BESS units in Q4 2025.

Zelestra, owned by private equity firm EQT, has 1.7GW of projects contracted, in construction or in operation in Latin America and a total portfolio of 7GW.

Building solar PV with BESS in Chile has become an “absolute necessity” with more and more solar PV being curtailed. Last year, the country saw its solar PV and wind power curtailment more than double year-on-year to nearly 6TWh, according to data from trade body the Chilean renewable energy and energy storage association (ACERA).

Despite the ongoing curtailment issues for solar PV, Chile remains one of the leading markets in South America and will be one of the driving forces in the region in the coming years. Earlier this year, Wood Mackenzie forecast that South America will add 160GW of new solar PV capacity by 2034 and said Chile and Brazil would account for 78% of this.

Joseph Majkut is Director of the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.","As Congress sharpens its scalpel for the Inflation Reduction Act, the energy sector is raising alarm over the rollback of “transferability.” This important tool lets clean energy companies sell their tax credits directly to others for cash—even if they owe very little in taxes—allowing them to unlock billions in private capital.

Transferability isn’t just a financial gimmick. Since it was created in 2022, it has boosted market efficiency and multiplied the impact of public investment in strategic industries. Rolling it back prematurely will sideline a crucial source of capital and undermine U.S. economic and security interests at a critical time.

Without transferability, energy developers would be forced back into expensive, complicated, partnerships with a few big banks who use tax credits to lower their own taxes—if they can get deals at all. These big investors prefer mature technologies like wind and solar while avoiding early-stage, capital-intensive technologies such as advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, and carbon capture.

Transferability levels the playing field for technologies critical to national priorities, but long underserved by traditional financing. It cuts out the need for complex legal structures and partnerships, reduces transaction costs by more than half, and allows developers to capture upwards of 95 cents on the dollar on their credits. And it opens the door for institutional, corporate, and even retail investors to purchase credits and support projects that would otherwise be overlooked.

Just look at the numbers: transferability more than doubled the tax credit market from $20 billion in traditional tax equity to over $50 billion in 2024. For every $1 of tax credits, it has brought in $4 in private investment. And in 2024, more than 70% of those transactions supported newly eligible, high-impact technologies like carbon capture, geothermal energy, and nuclear power.

Transferability has proven particularly helpful for nuclear power. The 45U nuclear production tax credit emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments and alone accounted for 12% of market volume. It has also been used with the 48E tech-neutral credit, which has supported the recommissioning of nuclear plants across the nation to power datacenters. Transferability-enabled access to the 45Y or 48E tax credits is expected to be similarly helpful for enhanced geothermal to achieve commercial scale and for the U.S. to reach even half of its nuclear capacity addition goal by 2031.

Beyond nuclear and other firm power sources, tax credits that target domestic reindustrialization, such as 45U and 45X, will be difficult to access without transferability.

Ending transferability—even if underlying credits remain—will disrupt active project pipelines, deter investment, and derail deployment. Over time, this means fewer start-ups and innovative firms that build the supply chains and power systems needed power AI, manufacturing, and other national priorities.

Maintenance of transferability will mean little if tax credits themselves are wound down quickly. The projects needed to address America’s energy emergency—from new nuclear reactors to enhanced geothermal systems—will not come online until the 2030s and often rely on multi-year credit transfers to stay viable. Transferability aside, the proposed early sunset of tax credits and the new requirement that they be operational by 2028 would effectively extinguish these projects.

It is true that preserving transferability increases spending by making more energy tax credits utilizable. How then can we balance the need for a longer, well-financed runway for this next generation of energy and manufacturing while reducing federal expenditure? One option is to prioritize tax credit eligibility for dispatchable energy projects—such as advanced nuclear, geothermal, carbon capture, and utility scale storage—that can deliver electricity on demand. The original eligibility timeline and access to transferability should be preserved for these projects, even if credits phase out early for mature, intermittent sources like wind and solar.

At a pivotal moment of rising energy demand and intensifying global competition, transferability should be protected as one of the most effective, market-driven policy tools for financing U.S. energy security and economic competitiveness.

Electrek: What is the ENERGY STAR program, and what are the benefits for consumers?
Energy efficiency programs that VEIC administers, including Efficiency Vermont, Efficiency Smart, and the DC Sustainable Energy Utility, have incorporated ENERGY STAR certifications into their rebates and educational materials for decades.
Rebecca Foster: Efficiency labels and education from ENERGY STAR leads to more affordable energy bills for customers.
Regionally and on a local level, getting rid of ENERGY STAR could disrupt energy efficiency programs run by states, utilities, and third-party administrators that rely on the ENERGY STAR label for rebates.","The Trump administration wants to pull the plug on ENERGY STAR, the federal program behind those familiar blue labels on energy-efficient appliances, homes, and buildings. Launched in 1992, ENERGY STAR has saved Americans more than $500 billion in energy costs while slashing greenhouse gas emissions.

To dig into what this means for everyday Americans, we spoke with Rebecca Foster, CEO of clean energy nonprofit Vermont Energy Investment Corporation (VEIC), which has spent decades working to make homes, schools, and businesses more energy efficient.

Electrek: What is the ENERGY STAR program, and what are the benefits for consumers?

Rebecca Foster: It’s simple: ENERGY STAR helps customers and businesses save energy and reduce costs. The program does this by clearly labeling which products are energy-efficient options. It’s a certification of confidence – it does not dictate efficiency standards. The program was created in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush and has enjoyed decades of bipartisan support.

The brand has become the backbone of energy efficiency across the country. ENERGY STAR is a recognized and reliable mark of efficient appliances and electronics that lower costs and improve indoor air quality. The ENERGY STAR label has also expanded to include efficiency standards for weatherizing homes and certifying when new buildings are constructed to high efficiency standards. Utilities benefit from ENERGY STAR, too – with more efficient appliances and systems plugged in, they are better able to manage the grid and decrease costs for customers.

The main benefit to consumers is significant savings through energy efficiency. A typical home can save around $450 a year on their energy bills by choosing ENERGY STAR-certified products, according to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimate. Lower-income households spend a greater proportion of their budget on energy, so losing that savings will be felt especially hard by these families. Energy efficiency programs that VEIC administers, including Efficiency Vermont, Efficiency Smart, and the DC Sustainable Energy Utility, have incorporated ENERGY STAR certifications into their rebates and educational materials for decades. The ENERGY STAR certification is an easy way to let people know which products are eligible for rebates and encourage folks to choose the more efficient option by making it more affordable with incentives. Combined, these programs have delivered more than $694 million in customer incentives since 2000, resulting in over $5.6 billion in lifetime customer savings.

Evaluations of the ENERGY STAR program show it saves US households about $40 billion a year nationwide – and has delivered about $500 billion in savings since it began. All for a program that costs the government just $30 million annually. According to the Consortium for Energy Efficiency‘s 2022 survey, where I worked for over a decade prior to joining VEIC, nearly 90% of US households report recognizing the ENERGY STAR label and almost half (45%) report knowingly purchasing an ENERGY STAR-certified product or home within the last 12 months.

Electrek: How would ending the ENERGY STAR program hurt consumers at a national and regional level?

Rebecca Foster: Efficiency labels and education from ENERGY STAR leads to more affordable energy bills for customers. Ending the program means less clarity and guidance for how to choose the more efficient option, which means higher costs month after month. Households are increasingly opting for more efficient, all-electric clean technologies like cold climate heat pumps for heating/cooling and EVs for their transportation needs. That means efficiency will become even more important for households to maintain lower electricity use. So, losing ENERGY STAR now will really cost Americans more in the short and long term.

Regionally and on a local level, getting rid of ENERGY STAR could disrupt energy efficiency programs run by states, utilities, and third-party administrators that rely on the ENERGY STAR label for rebates. It could also hurt manufacturers, distributors, and contractors who have built their businesses around providing and installing more efficient equipment. Existing lists of qualified products will quickly become out of date as new models and new technology enter the market. We could see programs in different states or run by different entities come up with confusing or competing standards for their rebates, making it more difficult for people to save energy.

All of these impacts hurt consumers, especially at a time when families and businesses are already struggling to keep up with rising costs.

Electrek: What sort of impact would ending this program have on the grid?

Rebecca Foster: A stable electric grid is more important than ever as we see growing electricity demand due to data centers and AI and an increasing reliance on electricity to meet more of our daily needs. ENERGY STAR has been the backbone of energy efficiency across the country for decades, and it’s delivered the more efficient lighting, appliances, and heating systems that are in use today in countless homes. Efficiency is a major reason why US electricity demand has been flat for the last two decades, according to the EIA.

As we see the electrification of our transportation and heating sectors, we’re also going to see unprecedented growth in electricity demand – an 11% increase in New England alone over the next decade, according to ISO New England. That’s part of a 50% increase in demand nationally by 2050, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.

Losing ENERGY STAR would slow down and complicate management of the grid because efficiency contributes to a stable and optimized grid. It also helps avoid the costly expansion of transmission projects by reducing demand without asking customers to make large behavioral changes.

A more efficient grid can also avoid investing in new fossil fuel power generation, like natural gas power plants, helping meet state and regional goals for clean energy and emissions reductions. ENERGY STAR is a great tool for realizing an efficient, electrified future. Ending the program will put a greater burden on grid operators and utilities by taking away one of the most effective tools in the toolbox for addressing rising energy demand: customer participation.

“We’ve been building partnerships with schools and trades and landowners and public officials, permitting agencies,” Syphers said. “But what really needs to happen before the permitting phase begins is we have to change state laws.”

Clean energy makes up a small but growing slice of Mendocino County’s employment, accounting for just under 600 jobs in 2023, according to an analysis of federal data by the nonprofit Environmental Entrepreneurs, which advocates for state and local policies benefiting the environment and economic interests.

Mendocino County workforce and education officials are taking note, gradually ramping up programs to train students to weatherize buildings, install and maintain solar projects and take on other related construction roles.

Noel Woodhouse, an instructor who runs Mendocino College’s sustainable construction and energy technology program, said the program has already evolved since launching in 2011 and will continue to do so. He’s confident that his students’ skills in clean tech, solar and sustainable building would easily transfer to geothermal construction — especially since the non-credit certificate program could rapidly train a large number of students in a short time.

“Our students come out of our program with experience in heavy equipment machinery and ready workers for that type of project,” Woodhouse said.

Clean energy jobs pull in a wide range of professional skills, from plumbing and electrical work to pouring concrete and operating equipment.

“What I love is the people who work in oil and gas know exactly how to operate 100% of the equipment on a geothermal job site, and it’s the same wages,” Syphers said.

Geothermal energy is harnessed by drilling deep below the earth’s surface to access naturally occurring heat. The steam flows to a turbine to drive a generator that in turn produces electricity — a process that can occur 24 hours a day.

Mendocino County, along with neighboring Sonoma and Lake counties, sits on one of the country’s prime geothermal zones. The world’s largest complex of commercial geothermal power plants, known as The Geysers, is located in the Mayacamas Mountains near where the three counties connect. Owning the majority of the units there, Calpine Corporation generates about 725 megawatts of electricity using geothermal energy. Sonoma Clean Power’s GeoZone proposal aims to build another 600 megawatt geothermal power plant.

The labor needed to develop 600 megawatts of new geothermal energy capacity will require hundreds of white-collar workers and thousands of construction workers during the building phase, and the project will create about 1,000 permanent jobs, Syphers said.

“Today, about 400 people from Sonoma, Lake and Mendocino work at The Geysers,” Syphers said. “If we can roughly double that for permanent jobs, that’s very exciting to me.”

Connecting students to skills and employers

As director of employer partnerships for Mendocino College, Pamela Heston-Bechtol’s job is making connections between students and employers. She combs through job postings at least once or twice a week and distributes opportunities to respective departments.

“It’s giving our students as much exposure as possible to be able to see themselves in those jobs by inviting industry to our advisory committees and inviting our students to job shadowing,” Heston-Bechtol said.

The Mendocino County Office of Education also offers career technical education programs with various pathways for youth. Eric Crawford, the office’s director of career and college programs, and Natalie Spackman, a workforce development coordinator with North Bay Construction Corps, together work with high school seniors interested in construction trades to complete a 14-week program.

“At the end of the instruction, they get a tool belt, and then they go out for boot camp for two weeks, and they work with contractors for 80 hours on a live build site and find out what it’s really like to do the work,” Crawford said, noting that this helps students determine which type of work interests them most.

At the completion of camp, the contractors are invited to interview students and potentially offer them jobs.

The newest career technical education program set for Ukiah High School, called Roots of Success, will train high school students specifically for green energy fields. However, Spackman said that basic training in construction gives students skills that transfer to a variety of work, especially given the state’s regulations for the trades to go green.

“No matter where they go, contractors ultimately work for their customers — what’s in demand?” she said. “The skills that they’re learning, that’s going to translate.”

Leaders from both the high school and college workforce development programs agree that while there’s plenty of work for their students and a growing demand for clean energy workers, trades training is hindered by a severe shortage of teachers.

Crawford said anyone with three years of experience in a specific field can get a designated subject teaching credential and become qualified by the state of California. Woodhouse said that Mendocino College’s minimum qualifications include an associate degree and experience in the field.

Other challenges, Woodhouse said, are those stacked against the students in a county with high rates of substance abuse and poverty. To address those, he highlighted support systems at the college that include a food pantry, mental health services and transportation, among others.

A student perspective

Kevin Vasquez says participating in the Mendocino College program changed the course of his life.

When he was 11 years old, Vasquez received a message at school that his father wouldn’t be able to pick him up. He had been deported.

“I felt violated that they took my dad from me,” he said. “I started drinking alcohol, trying to escape.”

The quiet habit morphed into an addiction that left him aimless and jobless in his 20s. Yet he remembered his father, an immigrant from Mexico who had worked tirelessly in stone masonry to give him a better life. He knew he needed to make something of that life, but he needed help first.

He went through rehabilitation, where a counselor suggested he check out Mendocino College’s construction program. For Vasquez, that program sparked light in the darkness.

“It got me back out there, doing what I love, which is building with my hands,” said Vasquez, who now offers help to other students as a lab tech.

For Vasquez, the prospect of GeoZone tapping into more renewable energy within the county brings an exciting opportunity to put his skills to use at a potential union job.

Mendocino County’s hiring contractors are small, and while they offer great one-on-one experiences, Woodhouse said, they’re not unionized.

Syphers shared that Mendocino County workers won’t need to be union members to work on the GeoZone project.

“You don’t have to be a union signatory to get hired through a union and then work on these projects,” he said. “That gives you an option to decide later if you want to become a signatory and be part of the union.”

The construction phase for GeoZone is projected to be six or seven years out, but Syphers said those years will be spent cultivating relationships with local schools, unions and smaller contractors.

Ultimately, he hopes the state will streamline permitting and make long-term commitments to invest in geothermal work.

“That’s how we actually get unions to open apprenticeship centers in Mendocino County,” Syphers said.

While the Biden administration helped streamline the geothermal process nationally, most of California’s geothermal opportunities are not on federal land, he pointed out. Sonoma Clean Power has worked with California Assemblymembers Diane Papan, D-San Mateo, and Chris Rogers, D-Santa Rosa, to introduce assembly bills 526, 527 and 531, which all aim to advance geothermal energy development.

“Everyone universally agrees California is the best place in the United States to do this if the permitting changes,” he said, noting that the state requires a full environmental review that can take anywhere from two to eight years. “This region has enough geothermal potential to support areas beyond Sonoma and Mendocino. That’s really, really valuable for the state.”",https://mendovoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BCN-20250510-MCCST-10-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 20:07:53.051785

“Producing critical minerals here at home is essential for our economic and national security. We cannot allow the supply chains for critical minerals used in products like AI chips, cell phones, missiles, and fighter jets to be controlled by China, particularly the processing and refining phases of the supply chains,” said Chairman Palmer. “In today’s hearing, our witnesses were clear that Congress must take steps to build an environment enticing for domestic investment—including streamlining the permitting process—to help ensure that critical minerals can be mined, processed, and refined domestically.”

Watch the full hearing here.

Below are key excerpts from today’s hearing:

Congressman Troy Balderson (OH-12): “The US has the second longest timeline for a mine to be approved, and we’ve heard anecdotes of projects waiting decades for approval to break ground or begin operations. Why is it that approvals of projects in the U.S., whether it be a mine or a processing, refining, or recycling facility for critical minerals take so long in the U.S?” Mr. Herrgott: “One of the main reasons is lack of coordination amongst the various agencies that are involved in the permitting process. Most mining projects will require a variety of permits. We’ve had member companies that have had mines that require over 90 permits.”

Congressman Dan Crenshaw (TX-02): “Critical Minerals are the backbone of a modern economy and a modern military, from semiconductors to advanced weapons systems. Today, the U.S. imports between 50 percent and 82 percent of the critical minerals we need. So where are they coming from? It’s been mentioned plenty of times here – they’re coming from China. That’s not good. Our national security, our national industrial base, our economic future is dependent on supply chains we don’t control and from regimes we cannot trust. And why? Well, mostly because our laws and regulations have made it virtually impossible to open up new mines in this country, and even, even when we do mine, we still have to ship the raw materials overseas just to get them refined because we’ve offshored our processing capabilities.”

Congressman Randy Weber (TX-14): “The U.S. once led the world in producing and refining rare earth elements but ceded that position to China in the 1980s. Today, China controls roughly 90 percent of global rare earth processing and has already demonstrated a willingness to restrict exports and thus, as one of you mentioned, affect the market. This leaves the U.S. dangerously exposed. If China were to halt exports entirely, think of that scenario. Where would we turn to secure the materials vital to our energy infrastructure and national security?” Ms. Hunter: “So, a total export ban would be devastating to the U.S. economy. We would need to rely on domestic sources if we can get them online, and then have them be processed into the final products that need to be qualified by manufacturers, and turn to allies as much as possible, countries with which we share national security priorities.”

More to be done: NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons made clear that the EPA’s decision to maintain the previous administration’s standards for PFOA and PFAS “go against the Trump administration’s goal to make the U.S. the best place to build, grow and create jobs.”

The NAM’s involvement: The NAM opposed these standards when they were instituted, arguing that the timeline for implementation was too swift, as many of these chemicals are key manufacturing additives that do not yet have replacements.

The NAM also challenged the rule in court, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to overturn the rule due to the EPA’s failure to follow the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act, including its reliance on a deeply flawed cost-benefit analysis and deficient feasibility analysis.

The NAM says: “We’re encouraged that the EPA has listened to the voices of manufacturers and extended the compliance deadline for unworkable national primary drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS and committed to reconsidering the blatantly unlawful regulatory determinations for several other PFAS compounds,” Timmons said.

“However, the Biden-era standards for PFOA and PFOS are deeply flawed, the costs they impose exceed any demonstrable benefit and the industries they harm include those vital to our national interests, including semiconductors, telecommunications and defense systems.”

Democrats countered that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s tenure will likely mean more Americans contracting lung cancer and other illnesses.

The heated exchanges, at a Senate hearing to discuss President Donald Trump's proposal to slash the agency's budget in half, showed the sharp partisan differences over Zeldin's deregulatory approach. Zeldin, a former Republican congressman, has said his tenure will turbocharge the American economy while ensuring clean air and water. Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

Zeldin, who took office in January, has proposed a flood of changes that would sharply reduce the agency's workforce, terminate billions of dollars in grants approved by the Biden administration and roll back dozens of environmental rules including landmark regulations on climate change and pollution from coal-fired power plants.

Sharp words, back and forth

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Zeldin that a plan to cut EPA spending by 55% means that, to Zeldin and Trump, “more than half of the environmental efforts of the EPA ... to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water are just a waste.” If approved by Congress, the budget cuts “will mean there’s more diesel and more other particulate matter in the air"" and that “water that Americans drink is going to have more chemicals,” Schiff said.

“Your legacy will be more lung cancer,"" he told Zeldin. ""It’ll be more bladder cancer. It’ll be more leukemia and pancreatic cancer ... more rare cancers of innumerable varieties.''

Replied Zeldin: “I understand that you are an aspiring fiction writer. I see why.”

Schiff said the real fiction was Zeldin's apparent belief that he can cut the EPA's budget in half “and it won't affect people's health, or their water or their air."" Schiff said the Republican administrator was “totally beholden to the oil industry,” adding: ""You could give a rat's ass about how much cancer your agency causes.""

Zeldin engaged in a similar rhetorical match with Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Whitehouse said Zeldin and others at EPA have made “baseless accusations of fraud” about grants awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden, removed “career officials who stood up for the rule of law” and deployed FBI agents ""to harass career civil servants.''

Questions over whether Zeldin reviewed canceled grants

Whitehouse also challenged Zeldin's contention that he had personally reviewed 781 Biden-era grants totaling nearly $2 billion that the Trump administration later canceled. The grants were intended to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country, but Zeldin said they were plagued by conflicts of interest and unqualified recipients.

“You don't care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,"" Zeldin said.

When Whitehouse pressed to see Zeldin's schedule to prove he personally reviewed the grants before canceling them, Zeldin said he's worked on the issue “almost every single day” since taking office.

""We are cracking down on every waste, every aspect of abuse,'' Zeldin said, adding that Whitehouse seemed unable to grasp that more than one person could review EPA's grant program.

""I am insisting on the facts,'' Whitehouse said.

American taxpayers “put President Trump in office because of people like you,” Zeldin replied. “They have Republicans in charge of the House and Senate because of people like you. You don't want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse.""

Whitehouse replied that Zeldin should explain why Justice Department lawyers, speaking under oath on behalf of the agency, have “said that everything you just said is not true. That's what I want.”

A lawyer for the EPA told a federal appeals court this week that the agency was “not accusing anybody of fraud” in a separate dispute over its termination of $20 billion in grants under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/21/PDTN/83777608007-ap-25122751220919.jpg?crop=3773,2122,x596,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-21 19:11:46.921915

Given how the RAV4 is locked in a constant and bitter battle with Ford's F-150 for U.S. bestseller status, any changes to Toyota's money-printer had better be good ones. And boy howdy, the 2026 RAV4 comes out swinging.

There's a whole lot of new stuff tucked under the RAV4's blockier, angrier silhouette. Hybrids can now be optioned with front-wheel drive, the Woodland package became its own standalone trim, and the lineup has positively exploded with plug-in hybrid options. That last bit will be the focus here—PHEVs are growing fast as the market remains tepid on EVs, as they offer the convenience of electric-only operation with the, um, also-convenience of a gas engine.

Mitsubishi's Outlander PHEV is one of the stronger competitors in the RAV4's cohort, so let's see how the two compare on paper. Since PHEVs are available at many points in the RAV4's more-confusing-than-ever lineup, we'll be using the SE and XSE trims for this spec-sheet comparison. The exterior photos here, however, show the GR Sport trim while the interior photo is of the Woodland trim, as Toyota has yet to publish photos of the SE and XSE.

Size and Interior Space

The Mitsubishi Outlander really stretches the definition of ""compact,"" at least when it's hanging out next to the 'Yota. The Outlander PHEV is 185.8 inches long, 4.9 inches longer than the RAV4. The two are nearly the same width, though the Mitsubishi again takes the crown with 74.7 inches against Toyota's 74 inches flat. The Mitsubishi is also 1.8 inches taller, at 68.8 inches. The two have awfully similar wheelbase figures, though; the Mitsubishi's 106.5-inch result is less than an inch ahead of the 105.9-inch RAV4.

There's a pretty obvious extrapolation from this data: The Outlander is more spacious. Having greater dimensions on all three axes means more interior space, though it may also mean tighter fits in parking lots. The jury's still out on cargo space, as Toyota chose not to publish those figures as of this writing.

One secret benefit of the Outlander's swollen dimensions? Versatility. Despite being a compact SUV, the Outlander PHEV offers three rows of seating, though that third row is quite tight.

Powertrain and Towing

If you read the headline or any of the paragraphs above, you'd know that both vehicles are plug-in hybrids. If you scrolled right to this paragraph, congratulations, you're all caught up. Regardless of the trim that contains it, all RAV4 plug-in hybrids include a 2.5-liter four-cylinder gas engine and two electric motors, combining for a net output of 320 horsepower. That's a pretty meaty figure, one that the Outlander's 2.4-liter four-cylinder PHEV powertrain cannot match, though 248 ponies should be more than sufficient for Target runs and the like. Considering the Outlander is both larger (and likely heavier) and less powerful than the Toyota, we know where we'd place our drag-strip bets.

While towing might not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of family-friendly compact SUVs, it's still important to some. Either way, the Toyota is the clear winner here. The Outlander can only pull 1500 pounds of detritus, while the Toyota can yank up to 3500. Heck, even the regular hybrid models out-tow the Outlander PHEV. You didn't need that second Jet Ski anyway.

Battery and Charging

Not only does the RAV4 pack on the power, it's also packing on the battery capacity—we think. Toyota estimates a 50-mile range on battery power alone for its wee plug-in, thanks to more capacity and changes to the underlying hardware, namely the semiconductors. How big is the battery? We have no idea; Toyota hasn't divulged that information quite yet. On the other side, the Outlander PHEV packs a battery with 17 kWh of usable capacity, which is good for an estimated range of 38 miles.

When it comes to charging, the Mitsubishi is lacking. All RAV4 PHEVs include an 11-kW onboard AC charger, and XSE and Woodland PHEVs will come with DC fast-charging capability via a CCS port. (Sorry, NACS fans.) The SE and GR Sport will feature a J1772 port and use AC charging. The Outlander looks positively ancient by comparison. Its AC charging taps out at a paltry 3.7 kW, and while DC fast-charging is available, the Outlander relies on the extremely old CHAdeMO standard, which never really gained steam outside of Japan. Good luck explaining that to somebody who doesn't know squat about cars.

Warranty

Mitsubishi's warranty is a bit better than Toyota's, but the two are still pretty evenly matched here. The Outlander PHEV offers a five-year, 60,000-mile limited warranty, against the RAV4's three-year, 36,000-miler. Mitsubishi's 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty positively dwarfs Toyota's five-year, 60,000-mile one. Things get a little more interesting at the electrification level. Toyota splits that part into eight-year, 100,000-mile coverage for hybrid components and 10-year, 150,000-mile coverage for the battery itself. Mitsubishi's hybrid warranty covers the whole shebang for 10 years or 100,000 miles.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rav4-phev-vs-outlander-phev-682ce47682d7c.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.891xh;0,0.109xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-21 20:08:32.935780

Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump's administration doubles down on fossil fuels.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California’s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.

Thune said California's “are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation’s energy supply.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.

Here's what to know:

Why can California set its own standards?

The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions standards for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.

California has some of the nation's worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.

Trump rescinded California’s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden’s administration restored it in 2022.

What do the standards do?

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.

The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.

The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.

New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.

What do the auto and trucking industries say?

Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state's tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars if it gets blocked and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate's upcoming vote.

The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.

“Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,"" Mike Stanton, the group's president and CEO, wrote in a letter.

The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.

“While transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,” said Josh Lovelace, the group's national director.

Can the grid handle more electric vehicles?

Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation's grid can't handle California's plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California's struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.

“Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,” he said in a statement announcing the vote.

Newsom's administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.

But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state's growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state's electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state's transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an “unprecedented rate.”

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California's plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state's previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California's, saying the pace wasn't realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state's EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

South America just achieved a remarkable energy milestone, quietly setting a global benchmark: for the first time in history, the entire continent now has zero new coal-fired power plants planned. To grasp how remarkable this is, we need only glance back a decade. When the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, South America had eighteen coal-fired plants on the drawing board, reflecting global uncertainty about the role coal would play in powering emerging economies. Today, that uncertainty has vanished. Coal, once perceived as a staple of industrialization and economic stability, has essentially vanished from the continent’s energy future.

Historically, coal played a modest but still significant role in South America’s power mix. The continent’s grid has traditionally been powered predominantly by hydropower and natural gas, with coal concentrated in a handful of countries — most notably Chile, Colombia, and Brazil. Chile, in particular, relied heavily on coal for decades, with coal-fired generation peaking at over 40% of its electricity mix in 2016. Meanwhile, Colombia’s relationship with coal is deeply intertwined with its economy; though it remains one of the world’s largest coal exporters, domestically it has always used relatively little coal to generate electricity. Brazil, despite vast hydro resources, maintained a few coal plants primarily in the southern states where domestic coal mining supported local economies.

The decisive turning point for coal’s prospects in South America began around 2015, catalyzed in large part by the Paris Agreement. The international climate accord provided both a symbolic and practical impetus for nations to reconsider coal’s role. Climate commitments, coupled with rapid improvements in renewable technologies and plunging costs for wind and solar power, dramatically reshaped the energy landscape. By early 2025, every previously proposed coal plant had either been cancelled or shelved, reflecting a convergence of policy alignment, market economics, and public sentiment against coal.

Chile is perhaps the most instructive case study in this transition. In the last decade, Chile has transformed from a coal-heavy nation to a global leader in renewable energy. This rapid transformation came about through deliberate policy measures including aggressive carbon pricing, strict emission standards for coal plants, and a well-designed renewable energy auction system. The economic advantage of renewables quickly became apparent, as Chile’s Atacama Desert, one of the sunniest places on Earth, became host to massive solar projects providing electricity at record-low prices. By 2024, Chile’s reliance on coal had dropped dramatically, with coal now accounting for less than 20% of total electricity generation. Furthermore, Chile implemented innovative financial mechanisms to facilitate early retirement of coal plants, such as blended finance schemes supported by international lenders. These measures have proven highly effective, allowing coal plants to shut ahead of schedule, accelerating the nation’s transition to renewables.

Colombia’s experience illustrates another aspect of coal phase-out — the management of a “just transition.” With coal exports central to Colombia’s economy, the domestic political landscape posed significant challenges. Despite this complexity, Colombia joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance in 2021, sending a strong international signal that the era of coal power was ending. The government under President Gustavo Petro, elected in 2022, explicitly committed to winding down coal power and mining operations, albeit with careful attention to workers and communities dependent on coal-related employment. Plans are now in place to gradually retire Colombia’s few remaining coal power plants, with a particular focus on developing alternative economic activities such as renewable energy projects, agriculture, and eco-tourism to replace coal mining and related sectors. Colombia’s ongoing transition highlights the crucial importance of incorporating social and economic dimensions into the decarbonization process, ensuring no community is left behind.

Brazil’s journey away from coal reflects a somewhat contradictory policy environment. In 2022, Brazil controversially extended subsidies and operational guarantees for coal plants in Santa Catarina until 2040, citing regional economic considerations. However, even this move is effectively a holding pattern rather than a genuine expansion — no new coal capacity is planned or under serious consideration in Brazil. Meanwhile, renewable energy continues to flourish across the country. Brazil is a global leader in wind and solar energy growth, adding gigawatts of renewable capacity each year through highly competitive auctions. Market forces overwhelmingly favor renewables, and even with extended subsidies, Brazil’s coal plants struggle to compete economically. The likelihood remains high that coal generation in Brazil will diminish faster than official policy timelines suggest, driven by the relentless market pressure from cheaper and cleaner renewable alternatives.

The broader factors underpinning South America’s remarkable transition away from coal include robust economics, international climate commitments, effective environmental activism, and geopolitical shifts in energy finance. Renewable technologies, especially solar and wind, have plummeted in cost, making them unquestionably more competitive than coal across the continent. Simultaneously, international financial institutions, previously critical sources of coal plant financing, have largely withdrawn from coal projects. China’s decision in 2021 to cease funding overseas coal power was particularly impactful, as several planned South American coal projects relied on Chinese financing.

The environmental and social benefits of eliminating coal are substantial and becoming increasingly evident. Communities previously burdened by coal plant pollution, suffering from elevated rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, now experience tangible health improvements. Reducing coal use dramatically cuts air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, significantly improving public health outcomes in affected regions. Ecologically, phasing out coal also means alleviating local water stress and pollution from coal-ash storage facilities, contributing positively to broader environmental restoration efforts in historically coal-intensive areas.

Nevertheless, South America’s successful coal phase-out is not without ongoing challenges. Grid reliability remains a paramount concern as coal plants retire. Renewable energy’s intermittent nature requires new approaches to ensure continuous, reliable power supply. In response, countries are investing in expanded transmission infrastructure, energy storage systems, demand management programs, and smarter grids to effectively integrate higher shares of variable renewable generation. Furthermore, the socioeconomic transition in coal-dependent regions remains critical. Well-designed policies must ensure a genuinely just transition, with retraining, economic diversification, and community support essential to avoid social dislocation and economic hardship.

While South America has impressively eliminated plans for new coal power, caution remains warranted as the region substantially invests in natural gas infrastructure, potentially creating another long-term fossil dependency. As of early 2025, roughly 100 active gas-fired projects are either under construction or in development across Latin America. For instance, Bolivia recently inaugurated a 103 MW gas-fired plant at its Mutún Steel Complex, constructed by Chinese firm CRRC Ziyang, signaling continued reliance on gas for industrial power. In Brazil, Mitsubishi Power is supplying gas turbines for the 1.6 GW UTE Portocem thermoelectric plant, expected online by 2026. Guyana, too, is developing a major 300 MW gas-to-energy facility near Georgetown, funded through a substantial $526 million loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. While these natural gas projects are underway, the scale of renewable energy development far surpasses that of natural gas in Latin America.

Globally, South America’s quiet exit from coal provides a powerful example for other regions still grappling with their own fossil fuel dependence. Developed nations can learn from South America’s cost-effective renewable auctions, innovative financing mechanisms, and socially conscious transition strategies. Developing countries, particularly in Asia and Africa, may find inspiration and practical guidance in South America’s path, proving that economic growth and poverty alleviation do not have to depend on coal.

Looking forward, South America’s future energy landscape appears overwhelmingly renewable, driven by further investments in wind, solar, and storage solutions. The region is on track to become one of the first globally to fully eliminate coal from electricity production, an achievement that positions South America as a leader in sustainable development. With COP30 scheduled to take place in Brazil in 2025, the continent’s coal-free ambitions will be on display, demonstrating to the international community what rapid, responsible energy transition can look like.

Ultimately, South America’s elimination of planned coal plants represents a historic turning point, offering hope and a model for the world. It underscores the potential for emerging economies to leapfrog outdated, polluting technologies and directly adopt cleaner, more sustainable alternatives. The global energy transition is complex, but South America’s recent milestone shows that a coal-free future is not only possible, but already taking shape.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-21-2025-02_52_12-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-05-21 20:08:01.231927

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Trump administration will halt funding of $365 million awarded during the previous administration for rooftop solar power in Puerto Rico and redirect it to fossil fuel burning plants and maintenance of infrastructure, it said on Wednesday.

Puerto Rico has long dealt with widespread power outages due to the U.S. territory's crumbling infrastructure, the 2017 bankruptcy of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority and a string of devastating hurricanes. It experienced a wide blackout a month ago, followed by an outage that hit 134,000 customers.

The Department of Energy said the funding will be redirected away from solar power to fixes that can be deployed immediately ""such as dispatching baseload generation units, supporting vegetation control to protect transmission lines and upgrading aging infrastructure."" Baseload generation in this case refers to power plants that run on oil products and potentially natural gas.

Last week, Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order that directed Puerto Rico's state-owned utility to tackle electricity shortfalls with power generated by oil-burning power plants, which emit pollution, including the greenhouse gases that cause climate change and global warming.

The administration of President Donald Trump has supported maximizing the output of fossil fuels and dismantling policies by former President Joe Biden's administration designed to spur use of renewable power.

""The redirection of these funds will expand access to reliable power for millions of people rather than thousands and generate a higher return on investment for taxpayers while advancing grid resiliency for Puerto Rico,"" the department said on Wednesday.

The Biden administration awarded the funding for solar power and battery storage in late 2024, for projects that had been slated to begin construction in 2026.

The DOE said the redirected funding will support practical fixes and activities that offer faster help, benefiting facilities, including hospitals and community centers.

The CBO estimated that 8.6 million Americans would become uninsured—primarily from losing Medicaid—because of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s portions of the bill alone.
Finally, the House Republicans’ plan to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits could put as many as 686,000 jobs (both operational and construction) at risk.
Then the authors applied that weight to KFF state coverage loss estimates based on the House Energy and Commerce text and changes based on the loss of enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits to estimate coverage losses by congressional district.
Total estimated coverage losses were then calculated by combining estimated losses from cuts to Medicaid and from expiring ACA tax credits.","Last week, House Republicans released long-awaited tax and budget proposals that would provide the top 5 percent of taxpayers with about $1.5 trillion in tax breaks. This windfall for the ultrawealthy would be paid for by gutting programs that create American jobs and help Americans afford the cost of basic needs, such as health care and groceries. If enacted, the bill would amount to the largest cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in history; kill jobs; and jack up the cost of living in every region of the country. It’s no wonder a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) finds that the bill reduces resources for the poorest households while increasing them for the highest earners.

This analysis of the House budget plan includes state and congressional district-level estimates for number of people who would lose health coverage; how many Americans could see at least some—if not all—of their SNAP benefits taken away; and the number of jobs put at risk by eliminating clean energy tax credits if the bill were to become law.

Nationally, the bill—along with additional Trump administration health changes—would strip nearly 14 million Americans of health insurance coverage by 2034. The CBO estimated that 8.6 million Americans would become uninsured—primarily from losing Medicaid—because of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s portions of the bill alone. This number is preliminary and expected to grow. Another 5.1 million Americans would become uninsured because of Congress’ refusal to extend enhanced premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces that help people afford their premiums as well as additional regulatory changes proposed by the Trump administration. The implications of these cuts across states are staggering: 1.8 million fewer Floridians and 1.6 million fewer Texans would have coverage by 2034. Coverage losses will exceed 100,000 people in 30 states, and 13 states will see coverage losses at or above 300,000 people.

Similarly, in the case of food assistance, nearly 11 million people could see at least some cut in benefits due to expansions to burdensome SNAP paperwork requirements included in the legislation. About 9.2 million of these people would be at risk because, for the first time, the plan applies the requirements to families with school-aged children and older Americans. An additional 1.6 million people live in areas without enough jobs and would be at risk of losing their benefits entirely from the bill’s reductions in flexibility for states to receive waivers from these requirements. Additionally, the legislation proposes shifting a portion of costs the federal government currently pays on to states, which could also jeopardize beneficiaries’ SNAP eligibility.

Finally, the House Republicans’ plan to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits could put as many as 686,000 jobs (both operational and construction) at risk. Since the passage of the clean energy tax credits in August 2022, companies have invested $321 billion in the manufacturing and deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, electrification of homes and businesses, and carbon management, leading to the creation of more than 2,300 new facilities that created over 300,000 jobs across the country. Another $522 billion and 686,000 jobs (both operational and construction) have been announced but are still outstanding and are likely to be cancelled if Congress repeals some clean energy tax credits and makes others unusable due to unworkable red tape, as proposed in the House bill.

Rather than working to make health care more accessible and affordable; grocery bills less of a burden; as well as create good-paying American jobs, the House Republican tax and budget proposals would rip away health care, food, and jobs from everyday Americans. This would inflict even more pain on working families grappling with higher prices caused by President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The American people see this proposal for what it is—a massive transfer of wealth from the working-class to the ultrawealthy—which is why Americans overwhelmingly oppose gutting people’s basic needs to pay for more tax breaks.

Methodology

To estimate health insurance coverage losses by congressional district, the authors created proportional weights for each congressional district’s share of the state’s Medicaid and ACA population using KFF 2024 enrollment data. To account for states without Medicaid expansion, the authors used a weight equal to each congressional district’s proportion of the state’s total population from the Missouri Census Data Center, consistent with prior KFF analysis. Then the authors applied that weight to KFF state coverage loss estimates based on the House Energy and Commerce text and changes based on the loss of enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits to estimate coverage losses by congressional district. Total estimated coverage losses were then calculated by combining estimated losses from cuts to Medicaid and from expiring ACA tax credits.

The estimate for the impact of expanded paperwork requirements on SNAP benefits come from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ analysis, which can be accessed here and here, of fiscal year 2022 SNAP quality control data and American Community Survey data for 2019-2023.

The number of jobs at risk if IRA clean energy tax credits are eliminated was calculated using the spreadsheets “Clean Investment Monitor 2025 Q1 Outstanding Spending by State with Jobs” and “Clean Investment Monitor 2025 Q1 Outstanding Spending by CD with Jobs” downloaded from page 10 of the Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 Update from Rhodium Group and MIT CEEPR. The total of “Outstanding Operational Jobs” and “Outstanding Construction Jobs” was 686,003.

We welcome the government’s consultation and will engage with it to ensure that the benefits received by local communities hosting energy infrastructure are proportionate and continue to meet their needs.","Britain’s coastal and rural communities will receive a cash boost for new community facilities, better transport links and investment in apprenticeships, under government plans as part of the Plan for Change mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower.

The proposals will require community benefits for families, businesses and local community groups who live near offshore wind, onshore wind and solar farms.

They would enshrine in law a requirement for renewable developers to pay into community benefit funds, ensuring infrastructure projects contribute to residents’ lives, the local economy and growth as part of the government’s Plan for Change.

This could include new grassroots football pitches in Welsh seaside towns, initiatives to get young people into employment on the Yorkshire coast to train the next generation of engineers, and funding for transport links and schools in the Scottish highlands.

Coastal and rural areas will play a significant role in hosting the clean energy projects needed to get energy bills down for good and deliver energy security with homegrown power that Britain controls.

In recognition, the funding will channel community investment into where it has real impact – with families in the area deciding where the money should be spent. The plans also set out how communities could own a stake in renewable energy infrastructure through shared ownership, resulting in profits being reinvested back into the community and the British people having a stake in the clean energy transition.

The level of payments to communities will range depending on the size of infrastructure projects, from tens of thousands of pounds a year for small developments and up to millions of pounds per year for largescale developments.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

If you live near an offshore wind or solar farm, your local community should benefit from supporting this nationally critical mission.

The Prime Minister’s mission to become a clean energy superpower is creating good well-paid jobs in these areas, building the infrastructure we need to get energy bills down for working people.

Our Plan for Change will revitalise Britain’s coastal and rural communities creating community wealth, better facilities and energy security for the country.

This will benefit every household in the country by getting the UK off fossil fuel dependency and protecting billpayers from price shocks with clean homegrown power.

The announcement will build on measures introduced in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill where households within 500 metres of new or upgraded electricity transmission infrastructure will get electricity bill discounts of up to £2,500 over 10 years.

The proposals seek input on which types of energy infrastructure should be required to pay into community benefit funds, which may include renewable and low-carbon electricity generation, and energy storage.

Community benefits are an established part of development for energy infrastructure in many countries, including Ireland, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

James Robottom, Head of Policy at RenewableUK, said:

Renewable energy developers have a long history of providing a wide range of benefits for local communities, such as community benefit funds which support local initiatives, electricity discounts, employment initiatives and environmental projects.

We welcome the government’s consultation and will engage with it to ensure that the benefits received by local communities hosting energy infrastructure are proportionate and continue to meet their needs. Renewable energy developers are good neighbours and remain committed to providing benefits at an appropriate level to enable local communities to thrive all over the country.

This builds on Monday’s announcement to support coastal communities with the £360 million Fishing and Coastal Growth Fund, the new SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) agreement that will slash red tape for UK seafood exporters and businesses, and a new twelve-year fisheries access agreement with the EU securing long-term certainty for British fishing fleets.

The Fishing and Coastal Growth Fund will see investment in new technology and equipment to modernise Britain’s fishing fleet, deliver new training and skills to back the next generation of fishers and promote the seafood sector to export our high-quality produce across the world.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency’s report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity — but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.

READ MORE: Mining is necessary for the green transition. Here’s why experts say we need to do it better

It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86 percent in 2024 from 82 percent in 2020.

China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75 percent. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.

The current trend toward export restrictions and trade disputes increases concerns, the IEA said.

“Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. ”The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.”

Birol cited the energy crisis in Europe after Russia cut off natural gas supplies over the invasion of Ukraine. Another cautionary tale is the global shortage of silicon-based computer chips during and after the pandemic, which disrupted auto production.

“The golden rule of energy security is diversification,” Birol told The Associated Press in an interview. “And it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.”

Market forces are important in developing new sources but won’t be enough. “There is a need for well-designed government policies” in the form of financing and other measures, he said.

China is a massive global source of critical minerals required for a wide range of goods that includes computer chips, robots, electric autos, batteries, drones, and military equipment. It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.

China has placed export limits of many of these key products and tightened controls on others as President Donald Trump’s trade negotiations escalate, stifling U.S. industry and the nation’s ability to find quick alternatives. Without access to China’s significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.

Trump has made reducing U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals a core tenet of his first 100 days back in office as part of a national security and economic resilience agenda.

This goes beyond China; the Trump administration finalized a rocky deal with Ukraine granting American access to the nation’s vast mineral resources earlier this month.

Trump is also looking to expedite deep-sea mining in international waters, much to the chagrin of environmental groups. He called for a boost in the domestic copper industry in a February executive order alongside other calls for the federal government to fast-track new mine permits; has reviewed a minerals proposal from Congo, a conflict-riddled nation also rich with mineral reserves; and attempted to strong-arm Greenland into providing more of its minerals to the U.S.

The IEA report said that global markets were well supplied at the moment and that prices in general have fallen. It warned however that planned production of copper, which is essential for electric wiring and power grids, would not keep pace with demand and predicted a 30 percent shortfall by 2030.

Democrats countered that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s tenure will likely mean more Americans contracting lung cancer and other illnesses.

The heated exchanges, at a Senate hearing to discuss President Donald Trump's proposal to slash the agency's budget in half, showed the sharp partisan differences over Zeldin's deregulatory approach. Zeldin, a former Republican congressman, has said his tenure will turbocharge the American economy while ensuring clean air and water. Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

Zeldin, who took office in January, has proposed a flood of changes that would sharply reduce the agency's workforce, terminate billions of dollars in grants approved by the Biden administration and roll back dozens of environmental rules including landmark regulations on climate change and pollution from coal-fired power plants.

Sharp words, back and forth

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Zeldin that a plan to cut EPA spending by 55% means that, to Zeldin and Trump, “more than half of the environmental efforts of the EPA ... to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water are just a waste.” If approved by Congress, the budget cuts “will mean there’s more diesel and more other particulate matter in the air"" and that “water that Americans drink is going to have more chemicals,” Schiff said.

“Your legacy will be more lung cancer,"" he told Zeldin. ""It’ll be more bladder cancer. It’ll be more leukemia and pancreatic cancer ... more rare cancers of innumerable varieties.''

Replied Zeldin: “I understand that you are an aspiring fiction writer. I see why.”

Schiff said the real fiction was Zeldin's apparent belief that he can cut the EPA's budget in half “and it won't affect people's health, or their water or their air."" Schiff said the Republican administrator was “totally beholden to the oil industry,” adding: ""You could give a rat's ass about how much cancer your agency causes.""

Zeldin engaged in a similar rhetorical match with Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Whitehouse said Zeldin and others at EPA have made “baseless accusations of fraud” about grants awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden, removed “career officials who stood up for the rule of law” and deployed FBI agents ""to harass career civil servants.''

Questions over whether Zeldin reviewed canceled grants

Whitehouse also challenged Zeldin's contention that he had personally reviewed 781 Biden-era grants totaling nearly $2 billion that the Trump administration later canceled. The grants were intended to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country, but Zeldin said they were plagued by conflicts of interest and unqualified recipients.

“You don't care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,"" Zeldin said.

When Whitehouse pressed to see Zeldin's schedule to prove he personally reviewed the grants before canceling them, Zeldin said he's worked on the issue “almost every single day” since taking office.

""We are cracking down on every waste, every aspect of abuse,'' Zeldin said, adding that Whitehouse seemed unable to grasp that more than one person could review EPA's grant program.

""I am insisting on the facts,'' Whitehouse said.

American taxpayers “put President Trump in office because of people like you,” Zeldin replied. “They have Republicans in charge of the House and Senate because of people like you. You don't want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse.""

Whitehouse replied that Zeldin should explain why Justice Department lawyers, speaking under oath on behalf of the agency, have “said that everything you just said is not true. That's what I want.”

A lawyer for the EPA told a federal appeals court this week that the agency was “not accusing anybody of fraud” in a separate dispute over its termination of $20 billion in grants under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.

Thousands more remain unregulated.,"Joseph Winters | Grist, Joseph Winters",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/21/epa-pfas-drinking-water-limits/,"Even last year, when the Biden administration first announced its national drinking water standards, scientists criticized it for addressing PFAS on a chemical-by-chemical basis.
Those compounds got the strictest drinking water limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level at which they can be detected, reflecting scientists’ understanding that there is no safe exposure level for them.
Water utilities were instructed to use a “hazard index” to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.
The Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029.
The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government’s water quality requirements altogether.","This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

Last week, environmental groups decried plans from the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind and “reconsider” drinking water limits for four per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, compounds linked to cancer and damage to the immune and endocrine systems, among other health effects.

The limits had been finalized by Joe Biden’s administration last April as part of an effort to limit people’s exposure to hazardous “forever chemicals.” Out of a total of more than 10,000 known PFAS, they targeted just six of the most concerning ones. The Trump administration’s EPA said it would retain the limits for two of the PFAS but give utilities more time to comply with them and scrap the others. One advocate called the EPA’s move a loss for public health and a “victory for chemical companies.”

But how protective were the Biden regulations to begin with? And how much of a difference will it make to pare them back?

On the one hand, experts agree that backtracking is not in the public’s interest. Virtually everyone has PFAS coursing through their veins, and specific kinds like PFOS and PFOA are known or likely to contribute to kidney and testicular cancers. The other compounds originally regulated by the Biden administration have been linked to elevated cholesterol, heart disease, and an increased risk of diabetes.

The chemicals have become so ubiquitous in people and the environment because of their use in everything from outdoor clothing to cooking utensils and food packaging. Runoff from firefighting foam, infused with the chemicals, has contributed to widespread drinking water contamination, along with manufacturers’ deliberate dumping of the chemicals into rivers — despite knowing about their health risks.

Once they’re created, PFAS don’t break down naturally; hence the moniker “forever chemicals.” Regulating them is an “important win,” experts have said, one that “allows the country to begin cleaning up the mess in its water.”

But the fight over drinking water limits for individual PFAS distracts from the larger context that there are thousands of types, and scientists suspect they all have similar health effects. Even last year, when the Biden administration first announced its national drinking water standards, scientists criticized it for addressing PFAS on a chemical-by-chemical basis. “The EPA is trying to regulate six forever chemicals. Just 10,000 to go,” as the title of an op-ed by one Harvard researcher put it.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist for the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the U.S. is “stuck in a Whac-a-Mole game” with PFAS, in which only the best researched compounds are regulated. Lesser-known compounds may be just as toxic — thanks to their similar chemical structures — but escape regulations just because they haven’t been studied, he added. “What we need to do is control PFAS as a class.”

Of the six forever chemicals targeted by the Biden administration’s original policy, PFOA and PFOS are the most prevalent and, consequently, they’ve been researched the most extensively. Those compounds got the strictest drinking water limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level at which they can be detected, reflecting scientists’ understanding that there is no safe exposure level for them. Three additional compounds — PFNA, PFHxS, and GenX — were given a contamination limit of 10 parts per trillion. Water utilities were instructed to use a “hazard index” to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.

The Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029. The rules for the other four compounds will be scrapped and reevaluated. The EPA said it intends to finalize its replacement regulations by next spring.

A statement from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the extended timeline for PFOA and PFOS would provide “common-sense flexibility” to utilities, some of which sued the EPA over its regulations last year. The utilities said the EPA’s new rule was too strict and would cause unreasonable compliance costs.

A spokesperson for the EPA told Grist that the process by which the agency had “promulgated the preliminary regulatory determinations simultaneously with the proposed regulation” for PFNA, PFHxS, GenX, and PFBS under the Biden administration “was inappropriate and may not comply with the statutory requirements of [the] Safe Drinking Water Act.” With regard to the rescissions, they said that “while EPA cannot predetermine the outcome, it is possible” that the agency will issue more stringent requirements this spring.

Daniel Jones, an emeritus professor of molecular biology at Michigan State University, said the impacts of the Trump administration’s reversal will depend on geography. Communities primarily affected by PFOS and PFOA may not be greatly affected, since the standards for those chemicals remain in place — albeit with an extended timeline for compliance. To meet the standards, water utilities will likely have to install something like an activated carbon filtration system, he said, which is effective at removing “long-chain” PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, which have a larger chemical structure than compounds like GenX.

Putting these filtration systems into place will thankfully sweep up more PFAS than just PFOA and PFOS, Jones said.

States like North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia, however, face disproportionate contamination from GenX due to production facilities concentrated there. This contamination could continue unabated if the standard for the compound is eliminated. According to Olson, some of the technologies that remove PFOS and PFOA are not as effective at attracting GenX. “To really control the full suite of PFAS, we need to go to more advanced technologies like tight membranes, like reverse osmosis,” he said.

Some water utilities may opt for these more advanced — and expensive — technologies if they believe that they will eventually be required to test for and limit a much larger number of PFAS, Olson added.

Although Jones is disappointed that the EPA intends to drop regulations for the four PFAS, he said he is more concerned about a single clause in the EPA’s press release, about the EPA’s intent to establish a “federal exemption framework” for the PFOS and PFOA limits. The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government’s water quality requirements altogether. “It seems that an exemption framework is likely to open the door to say, ‘This is going to cost too much, you don’t have to do it,’” he said.

The EPA spokesperson said exemptions would not allow utilities to violate regulations: “Rather, they allow additional time to find a compliance solution.”

Jones also raised concerns about funding for further PFAS research, including investigations on how exposure to mixtures of the chemicals may impact human health. One of his federal grants for PFAS research was recently cut by the Trump administration, he said, and a colleague at Michigan State University studying PFAS on farms has also had his funding rescinded.

In addition to regulating PFAS by groups or as a class, Jones said the EPA should set pollution standards using what’s known as the “precautionary principle,” which doesn’t require definitive evidence about a chemical’s harms before it can be regulated. “In some countries, if you want to release a chemical into the environment you have to show it’s safe,” he said. “The U.S. usually takes the opposite approach and says, ‘You can use these chemicals … and if we find that there’s a problem, then we’ll come up and regulate [them].’”

Olson believes the EPA’s alterations to the PFAS rules are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision,” which says any revision the EPA proposes to a drinking water standard must be at least as protective of public health as the previous one. The law also caps compliance timelines at five years, whereas postponing the PFOS and PFOA compliance deadline to 2031 would give water utilities seven years.

“Ultimately, we need to be phasing these chemicals out,” Olson added. “We have to turn off the spigot and stop using these things so that five generations from now, our great-great-great grandchildren won’t be dealing with them.”

Then there's the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems.","INDIANAPOLIS — Helio Castroneves felt an immediate difference — a subtle but noticeable uptick in speed — the first time he utilized the boost of horsepower offered by IndyCar's novel hybrid engines around the imposing oval of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The question now facing the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, along with the rest of the drivers on the 33-car starting grid for the 109th running on Sunday, is how best to capitalize on the hybrid over 200 laps spent entirely on edge.

Empty it entirely and then wait for it to recharge, which might take several laps? Save it for short bursts for passes or to defend? Perhaps use it slowly to run down the leader or build a big advantage once out front?

""There is so much more that goes into this than I think people realize or recognize,"" acknowledged Indy 500 veteran Graham Rahal, whose father Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race. ""It's an interesting thing. I mean, the hybrid, it's quite powerful here. On a single lap if you utilize it correctly, it does make a hell of a difference in lap time or lap speed.""

The genesis of the hybridization began years ago, when IndyCar manufacturers Chevrolet and Honda wanted to better align their racing programs with a shift in consumer demand toward hybrid and electric vehicles. But the project was beset by delays as engineers struggled to fit a bespoke hybrid unit into the IndyCar chassis designed more than a decade ago, and that had to meet certain requirements for weight and safety, among other things.

The result was finally unveiled before last year's Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries. It provides a quick boost to the existing 2.2-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 engines before recharging to be used again.

The system was introduced at Mid-Ohio midway through last year's IndyCar season and has been in use ever since.

But it has never been used somewhere like Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds at the end of each straight can hit 240 mph, and the difference between winning and losing can be measured in thousandths of a second.

""I've had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it's going to be at Indianapolis,"" IndyCar president Doug Boles said. ""I asked why and they say, 'Well, you think about Indianapolis, how trimmed out we are — especially in qualifying — any incremental difference in horsepower makes a difference.

""We're going to see some exciting racing,"" Boles continued, ""and the strategies that I have heard from drivers in terms of talking about how to deploy the hybrid vary wildly. It's going to be fascinating to watch how this goes.""

It hasn't gone without its share of problems, either, dating to an open test last month and right through practice Monday.

For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600. And all of that weight is in the back of the car, which has dramatically altered the way they are balanced and ultimately perform.

""That's a lot of mass percentage-wise you are adding,"" two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden said. ""It's almost like adding 200, 250 pounds to a stock car. If you said, 'Hey, guys, we're going to bolt 250 pounds to these stock cars, see what you think,' I bet they would all go, 'OK, this drives differently.' And now we have to counteract it.""

Andretti Global driver Kyle Kirkwood is among many who believe the additional weight makes cars harder to drive, and Meyer Shank Racing's Marcus Armstrong said, ""I do believe the window is considerably smaller, the balance window.""

Armstrong crashed in practice last Saturday and had to squeeze into the field in a backup car on Sunday.

Then there's the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems. Rinus Veekay's hybrid didn't work at all during his first qualifying run for the final row of the starting grid, while 2008 winner Scott Dixon had his practice Monday cut short after just six laps when a warning light blinked for an overheating issue.

Nevertheless, the hybrid technology will play a part in ""The Greatest Spectacle in Racing"" on Sunday. And if it comes down to the final laps, it could be a big part, as the leader tries to hold on and the chasers try to time their boost for a winning pass.

""I think it definitely adds some variables,"" said Dixon, who will start on the second row. ""If you're sitting out front, you could be a bit of a sitting duck, especially if everybody is kind of recharged and ready to go behind you.

""I think the biggest thing that we've probably all learnt so far, you've got to be ready for change, is probably the biggest thing,"" he added. ""But I think it could ultimately change how the end of the race plays out.""

Nissan Motor Co. is nearing a deal to procure electric vehicle batteries in the U.S. from a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and South Korea’s SK On, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Japanese automaker wants to source batteries in the U.S. in part to avoid President Donald Trump’s tariffs, said the people, who asked not to be identified revealing internal deliberations. For Ford and SK On, a supply deal with Nissan would help boost production amid a slowdown in EV sales, they said.

A new Ford-SK factory in Kentucky, known as BlueOvalSK, has emerged as the frontrunner to build the batteries for Nissan, though a final decision hasn’t been made, one of the people said.

The talks reflect two crosscurrents roiling the auto industry — the cost of the 25% tariff Trump has imposed on imported cars and auto parts and slackening demand for EVs that’s pushing automakers to scale back ambitious plans for battery-powered models.

Ford is reducing its EV spending by $12 billion and canceled a big electric sport-utility vehicle as it pivots to smaller, more affordable EVs coming in 2027. Nissan said in March it is looking to source batteries in the U.S. from SK On for a new EV it plans to build at its assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi, beginning in 2028.

By taking on Nissan as a customer, Ford and SK On can more fully utilize the Kentucky battery plant that is just starting up, the people said. The facility will initially supply the American automaker’s E-Transit electric commercial van, which sells in small numbers.

Nissan, SK On and Ford declined to comment on the potential deal. Ford said the goal for its EV unit is to create “a capital efficient business and domestic supply chain for electric vehicles that will support American jobs.”

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the potential deal.

Ford is seeking to reduce EV losses that reached $5.1 billion last year and could hit $5.5 billion this year. The carmaker and SK On received a $9.2 billion loan from the US Department of Energy in 2023 to build three battery factories in Kentucky and Tennessee. As EV sales growth slowed, Ford and SK On last year put a second planned battery plant in Kentucky on hold.

Democrats countered that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s tenure will likely mean more Americans contracting lung cancer and other illnesses.

The heated exchanges, at a Senate hearing to discuss President Donald Trump's proposal to slash the agency's budget in half, showed the sharp partisan differences over Zeldin's deregulatory approach. Zeldin. a former Republican congressman, has said his tenure will turbocharge the American economy while ensuring clean air and water. Democrats say he is endangering the lives of millions of Americans and abandoning the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

Zeldin, who took office in January, has proposed a flood of changes that would sharply reduce the agency's workforce, terminate billions of dollars in grants approved by the Biden administration and roll back dozens of environmental rules including landmark regulations on climate change and pollution from coal-fired power plants.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told Zeldin that a plan to cut EPA spending by 55% means that, to Zeldin and Trump, “more than half of the environmental efforts of the EPA ... to make sure Americans have clean air and clean water, are just a waste.” If approved by Congress, the budget cuts “will mean there’s more diesel and more other particulate matter in the air"" and that “water that Americans drink is going to have more chemicals,” Schiff said.

“Your legacy will be more lung cancer,"" he told Zeldin. ""It’ll be more bladder cancer. It’ll be more leukemia and pancreatic cancer ... more rare cancers of innumerable varieties.''

Replied Zeldin: “I understand that you are an aspiring fiction writer. I see why.”

Schiff said the real fiction was Zeldin's apparent belief that he can cut the EPA's budget in half “and it won't affect people's health, or their water or their air."" Schiff said the Republican administrator was “totally beholden to the oil industry,” adding: ""You could give a rat's ass about how much cancer your agency causes.""

Zeldin engaged in a similar rhetorical match with Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Whitehouse said Zeldin and others at EPA have made “baseless accusations of fraud” about grants awarded under Democratic President Joe Biden, removed “career officials who stood up for the rule of law” and deployed FBI agents ""to harass career civil servants.''

Whitehouse also challenged Zeldin's contention that he had personally reviewed 781 Biden-era grants totaling nearly $2 billion that the Trump administration later canceled. The grants were intended to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country, but Zeldin said they were plagued by conflicts of interest and unqualified recipients.

“You don't care about wasting money, but the Trump administration does, Senator,"" Zeldin said.

When Whitehouse pressed to see Zeldin's schedule to prove he personally reviewed the grants before canceling them, Zeldin said he's worked on the issue “almost every single day” since taking office.

""We are cracking down on every waste, every aspect of abuse,'' Zeldin said, adding that Whitehouse seemed unable to grasp that more than one person could review EPA's grant program.

""I am insisting on the facts,'' Whitehouse said.

American taxpayers “put President Trump in office because of people like you,” Zeldin replied. “They have Republicans in charge of the House and Senate because of people like you. You don't want me to go through the list of all the evidence of waste and abuse.""

Whitehouse replied that Zeldin should explain why Justice Department lawyers, speaking under oath on behalf of the agency, have “said that everything you just said is not true. That's what I want.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b1fb9f96-2887-4622-8532-eb7a2c6ee2f6/wirestory_3d61818ecc3ca951dc7df3420cbe1e71_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-05-21 18:13:04.633089

The funds had been hanging in limbo in recent weeks, with the Department of Energy missing a recent deadline to finalize contracts worth $365 million that would see battery-operated solar systems installed at health clinics and public housing units in Puerto Rico.

The money had been set aside for that purpose under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden.

“That money was spring loaded to flow now,” said Javier Rúa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico’s Solar and Energy Storage Association.

Grantees that include the nonprofit Hispanic Federation had said the funds were urgently needed to provide stable power to people including those on dialysis as major outages continue to hit Puerto Rico.

The Department of Energy said in a statement that the money would now be used “to support technologies that improve system flexibility and response, power flow and control, component strength, supply security, and safety.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Energy told The Associated Press that the money would used for things including upgrading aging infrastructure, clearing vegetation from transmission lines and dispatching baseload generation units. The department said it has final authority over how the funds will be used, adding that the solar projects were not scheduled to be constructed until 2026.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that redirecting the funds would ensure that “taxpayer dollars are used to strengthen access to affordable, reliable and secure power, benefiting more citizens as quickly as possible.”

Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González praised the move in a statement, saying it would help all 3.2 million residents on the island instead of “a few customers.”

“Puerto Rico is facing an energy emergency that requires we act now and deliver immediate solutions. Our communities, businesses, and healthcare facilities cannot afford to wait years, nor can we rely on piecemeal approaches with limited results,” she said.

González previously came under fire as her support for investing $1 billion of federal funds in solar projects across Puerto Rico appeared to fade.

A spokeswoman for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment and details.

A spokeswoman for Josué Colón, the island’s so-called energy czar, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rúa Jovet noted that there are currently at least $16 billion in unspent funds from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency meant to improve Puerto Rico’s electric grid, adding that the $365 million should be used for its original purpose.

“There is nothing faster and better than solar batteries,” he said. “We should all be moving as fast as we can on generation.”

Officials in Puerto Rico already have warned that there will be a shortage of generation this summer. In addition, the Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, and it is predicted to be above average, with nine anticipated hurricanes, four of them major.

Many in Puerto Rico worry that any storm, regardless of how small, could knock out the grid given its fragile state.

Puerto Rico already was hit with island-wide blackouts on Dec. 31 and April 16.

The diversion of funds come as González criticizes the work of Luma Energy, which oversees transmission and distribution of power on the island, and Genera PR, which oversees generation.

The two private companies were contracted by the previous administration as Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority struggled to restructure more than $9 billion in public debt, with mediation still stalled.

Under Biden, there was a push for more renewable energy projects in Puerto Rico, where crews are still rebuild the power grid after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already weak before the storm hit given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.

Rúa Jovet said the Department of Energy’s decision is an ideological one supported by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Elections have consequences,” he said.

Of the $1 billion allocated for solar projects in Puerto Rico under Biden, $450 million already has been granted to install solar rooftop and batteries in thousands of homes located in rural areas or whose occupants have medical needs.

Overall, roughly 117,000 homes and businesses on the island currently have solar rooftops.

More than 60% of energy in Puerto Rico is generated by petroleum-fired power plants, 24% by natural gas, 8% by coal and 7% by renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/cbcd520c-0825-427a-b567-3afa85dc5089/wirestory_379e4dc7b361268819bf60dd0cf9b0dc_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-05-21 19:11:34.969781

The U.S. House of Representatives proposes rollbacks to key clean energy programs, which raises questions across the sector. Among the targeted provisions are the residential solar tax credit and funding elements of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—a landmark climate package that helped spark record investment in clean energy over the past two years.

The proposal suggests ending the 30% federal residential solar tax credit by the end of 2025. This is nearly 10 years sooner than expected. This policy change could greatly affect companies in the solar industry.

Understanding the Proposed Policy Change

The residential solar tax credit, or Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is Section 25D of the U.S. Tax Code. It lets homeowners claim 30% of the cost of installing solar panels. This credit appears on their federal tax returns.

The credit, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, was to last until 2032. It will start to decrease gradually in 2033. The schedule is below. However, the new proposal aims to terminate this credit by December 31, 2025.

Experts warn that this sudden change might raise costs for consumers. It could also lower demand for residential solar installations and lead to job losses in the sector. Small solar installation businesses often rely on credit for competitive pricing. This makes them especially vulnerable.

The solar industry has expressed strong opposition to the proposed cuts. Many stakeholders say the tax credit has helped grow residential solar. It creates jobs and promotes energy independence.

The Solar Energy Industries Association says the residential solar market has grown 10x in the last ten years. The tax credit has played a big part in this growth.

The proposal passed the House Ways and Means Committee. However, it still has many hurdles to clear before it can become law. Some lawmakers, including Republicans from areas that benefit from clean energy investments, are worried about the possible negative effects of the cuts.

The final outcome will depend on negotiations in both the House and Senate.

Policy Uncertainty and Its Limits

For many solar developers, these changes could signal uncertainty and disruption. For SolarBank, a developer focused on community and commercial-scale solar (as opposed to residential solar installations), the path forward remains steady. This is due to careful planning, strategic focus, and a shift in business model that favors long-term sustainability.

The company’s CEO, Dr. Richard Lu, says the company’s business model is largely shielded from this turbulence, saying:

“Over the next several years we are not expecting any major changes or challenges from the potential changes to federal solar tax incentives. Support for our community solar projects comes at a state level, and we only focus on the 22 states that have community solar policy.”

This is a key distinction. SolarBank focuses on commercial, industrial, and community solar projects. Unlike residential solar companies, it benefits from strong state mandates and incentives.

Moreover, the timeline for scaling back federal tax credits for commercial solar systems doesn’t begin until 2028 or 2029. SolarBank has already factored that into its long-term planning. Dr. Lu emphasized this, noting:

“We work with industrial and commercial large-scale solar projects, and not residential. The schedule to reduce tax incentives… has already been included in our operations to mitigate the effect.”

Resilience Through Integration

SolarBank isn’t shaken by the headlines. Instead, it is strengthening its operations. Its resilience comes from a vertically integrated model. This model covers development, construction, and long-term operations and maintenance.

This structure helps the company control costs, speed up deployment, and rely less on uncertain external factors. Dr. Lu stated:

“We have a vertically integrated system… which gives us the capability to manage our costs and simplify our process. This is really where our lean set up is competitive.”

That competitiveness is especially important in a rapidly evolving energy market. AI data centers, electric vehicles, and digital industries are driving high electricity demand.

Data center power use in the U.S. will grow twofold in 2030 due to AI. Meanwhile, traditional energy systems are having a tough time keeping up.

SolarBank sees this mismatch as an opportunity. The company can meet rising energy needs by staying agile and keeping costs in check, that is faster than many big, slower competitors.

Shifting from Build-to-Sell to Build-to-Own

In response to both market evolution and policy unpredictability, SolarBank is also adjusting its core business strategy. Once focused on a build-to-sell model, the company is now emphasizing build-to-own projects.

The CEO noted that this shift aims to create a more stable revenue base, making SolarBank less reliant on one-off transactions and external funding sources. He said:

“This will boost our long-term recurring revenue. It makes it easier to take on new projects with less external funding.”

This change also helps the company hedge against potential federal funding shortfalls. SolarBank can continue to grow by attracting private investment and forming strategic partnerships. This will help, even with solar tax credit challenges.

A recent collaboration with Qcells, involving the use of U.S.-manufactured solar modules, is one example of how the company is preparing for multiple future scenarios. SolarBank has the following project pipeline that will bring significant growth to the company:

A Message for Policymakers

The company is confident in its own path. However, Dr. Lu emphasized the broader value of maintaining federal support for clean energy—especially for community solar and distributed energy systems. He remarked:

“Consistent and long-term support… is not just an investment in clean energy but also in social equity and economic resilience.”

Community solar programs are especially important for expanding access to renewable energy among low- and moderate-income households, renters, and underserved communities. Without strong policy support, these groups risk being left behind in the clean energy transition.

Dr. Lu added:

“Stable policies and incentives are crucial for planning and investment. By supporting these initiatives, policymakers can drive job creation, foster local economic development, and advance national goals for carbon reduction and climate resilience.”

What’s The Future for Solar?

SolarBank’s calm response shows its strong position, even if the headlines are unsettling. The company is ready to succeed by using state support, seeking private investment, and adjusting its business model. This approach helps it thrive despite federal uncertainty.

Still, the broader industry faces real questions. Will Congress follow through with proposed rollbacks? Can community solar continue to grow if the tax credits vanish? And what does this mean for energy equity in the U.S.?

For now, SolarBank believes that its focus on fundamentals, policy-savvy expansion, and forward-thinking leadership will carry it through.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The U.S. Department of Energy announced Wednesday that $365 million originally slated for solar projects in Puerto Rico will be diverted to improve the island’s crumbling power grid, sparking an outcry just days before the Atlantic hurricane season starts.

The funds had been hanging in limbo in recent weeks, with the Department of Energy missing a recent deadline to finalize contracts worth $365 million that would see battery-operated solar systems installed at health clinics and public housing units in Puerto Rico.

The money had been set aside for that purpose under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden.

“That money was spring loaded to flow now,” said Javier Rúa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico’s Solar and Energy Storage Association.

Grantees that include the nonprofit Hispanic Federation had said the funds were urgently needed to provide stable power to people including those on dialysis as major outages continue to hit Puerto Rico.

The Department of Energy said in a statement that the money would now be used “to support technologies that improve system flexibility and response, power flow and control, component strength, supply security, and safety.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Energy told The Associated Press that the money would used for things including upgrading aging infrastructure, clearing vegetation from transmission lines and dispatching baseload generation units. The department said it has final authority over how the funds will be used, adding that the solar projects were not scheduled to be constructed until 2026.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that redirecting the funds would ensure that “taxpayer dollars are used to strengthen access to affordable, reliable and secure power, benefiting more citizens as quickly as possible.”

Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González praised the move in a statement, saying it would help all 3.2 million residents on the island instead of “a few customers.”

“Puerto Rico is facing an energy emergency that requires we act now and deliver immediate solutions. Our communities, businesses, and healthcare facilities cannot afford to wait years, nor can we rely on piecemeal approaches with limited results,” she said.

González previously came under fire as her support for investing $1 billion of federal funds in solar projects across Puerto Rico appeared to fade.

A spokeswoman for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment and details.

A spokeswoman for Josué Colón, the island’s so-called energy czar, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dwindling power generation

Rúa Jovet noted that there are currently at least $16 billion in unspent funds from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency meant to improve Puerto Rico’s electric grid, adding that the $365 million should be used for its original purpose.

“There is nothing faster and better than solar batteries,” he said. “We should all be moving as fast as we can on generation.”

Officials in Puerto Rico already have warned that there will be a shortage of generation this summer. In addition, the Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, and it is predicted to be above average, with nine anticipated hurricanes, four of them major.

Many in Puerto Rico worry that any storm, regardless of how small, could knock out the grid given its fragile state.

Puerto Rico already was hit with island-wide blackouts on Dec. 31 and April 16.

The diversion of funds come as González criticizes the work of Luma Energy, which oversees transmission and distribution of power on the island, and Genera PR, which oversees generation.

The two private companies were contracted by the previous administration as Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority struggled to restructure more than $9 billion in public debt, with mediation still stalled.

‘Elections have consequences’

Under Biden, there was a push for more renewable energy projects in Puerto Rico, where crews are still rebuild the power grid after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already weak before the storm hit given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.

Rúa Jovet said the Department of Energy’s decision is an ideological one supported by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Elections have consequences,” he said.

Of the $1 billion allocated for solar projects in Puerto Rico under Biden, $450 million already has been granted to install solar rooftop and batteries in thousands of homes located in rural areas or whose occupants have medical needs.

Overall, roughly 117,000 homes and businesses on the island currently have solar rooftops.

More than 60% of energy in Puerto Rico is generated by petroleum-fired power plants, 24% by natural gas, 8% by coal and 7% by renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Puerto_Rico_Trump_Tariffs_08814_65b547.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-05-21 18:12:39.365685

Small modular nuclear reactors or SMRs are a type of nuclear power plant that is exactly what the name suggests—small.
“The regulator ensures that we don’t have commercial nuclear accidents in the United States.” Huff also explained that SMRs relative to traditional nuclear reactors have the potential to be even safer.","When people think of nuclear energy, they tend to think of bombs, meltdowns or the place Homer Simpson works; needless to say, it doesn't have the best reputation.

Despite the Chernobyl disaster, Three Mile Island, Fukushima, and all the media that surrounds the conversation, nuclear energy is actually the safest form of energy in the world. That is according to Dr. Gary Was, professor of nuclear energy at the University of Michigan.

Nuclear energy during the 1950s and ‘60s amassed an unparalleled level of excitement, and it is easy to understand why, he said. People then imagined a world run through nuclear power, an infinite source of energy that could be used for everything from cars to space exploration.

In reality, the nuclear disasters were not what killed the nuclear age—they had help.

By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the first nuclear power plants broke ground on their construction, but this process didn't go as smoothly as previously thought.

“There was a huge amount of interest. Suppliers had more orders than they could fill,” said Was. “But what happened is that the plant construction times were elongated, so the cost started going up.”

Due to the sheer scale of these projects, delays and rising costs were already putting a strain on developers' attempts to put up nuclear power plants. Then in 1979, the Unit 2 reactor at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant had a partial meltdown.

“The Three Mile Island incident, although there was no harm to the public, caused the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to change a lot of the regulations, and plants that were currently under construction had to retrofit all kinds of systems,” said Was. “That caused further delays, and that further increased the costs, and in ‘79 and ‘80, inflation hit 17-20%.”

Was explained how these factors led to nuclear energy plant construction stalling or being completely abandoned. This already volatile market for nuclear energy existed leading into April 1986, when the world stood still and all eyes shifted to a small town in Ukraine called Chernobyl.

The Chernobyl nuclear disaster was the last nail in the coffin for the development of nuclear energy for the rest of the 20th century.

By the turn of the 21st century, a new development in nuclear technology led to a resurgence of nuclear power across the country when generation IV nuclear reactors were introduced. These new reactors promised to be safer, more efficient and more cost effective.

“Utilities started ordering and planning to build plants again,” said Was. “They filed applications to the NRC for construction and licensing and operation permits.”

Fifteen states (none of them Indiana) planned to construct around 37 nuclear power plants in 2007. But only a year later, nuclear energy hit another road bump when the 2008 financial crisis stalled the proposed construction projects.

“In 2011, Fukushima hit, and so those two occurrences completely squashed things,” said Was. “Out of the 37 plants planned, we got two here. That's it.”

Of the 37 plants planned, the only two to be completed are located in Tennessee and Georgia.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. completed two nuclear power plants in the 2000s, but the total number of nuclear plants in the U.S. has decreased from its peak number of 112 to 92 in 2022.

In 2019, nuclear energy was producing more electricity than ever before due to advancements and updates to existing plants while operating costs continued to drop, according to the EIA.

While proponents say nuclear energy is incredibly efficient and lucrative, the development time for a facility takes so long that outside economic factors (and public sentiment) kill the majority of the proposed projects. As Was said, this seems to be the crux of why the history of nuclear energy has been such a “roller coaster.”

What's an SMR?

Small modular nuclear reactors or SMRs are a type of nuclear power plant that is exactly what the name suggests—small.

According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, an SMR produces about half the electricity of a traditional nuclear power plant and is a fraction of the size.

“Small modular reactors take a lot of lessons from existing conventional reactors,” said Katy Huff, former assistant secretary of nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy and current professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “They try to package them in a way that will be more reliable, affordable and quick to deploy.”

Huff said SMRs could solve the biggest issue plaguing nuclear energy: the cost.

“It’s not really about the nuclear technology so much as it is about the complexity of building big stuff,” she said.

Building a traditional nuclear reactor isn’t like putting up a wind farm—it’s a mega-project. They run into the same problems as proposed high-speed railways, airports and Boston’s infamous Big Dig.

SMRs change the game because they are smaller and can have parts produced in a factory, then sent to the location—unlike traditional reactor parts manufactured on site.

“I think we will be building them more like airplanes than airports,” said Huff.

Despite the tantalizing idea, SMRs are still unproven technology, and even if they do solve the economic issues surrounding nuclear energy, many people are concerned about safety

But it turns out that nuclear energy is one of the safest forms of energy production when looking at deaths compared to the energy produced, according to Huff.

Three Mile Island had zero deaths, she said. Fukushima had zero deaths related to the meltdown. Chernobyl claimed the lives of over 28 people and caused severe environmental damage across Eastern Europe.

These stats pale in comparison to fossil fuels. The World Health Organization has reported that air pollution from fossil fuels is responsible for 6.7 million premature deaths per year.

“Nuclear compared to everything else, simply by being emissions free, does an incredible job of keeping people safe,” she said. “The regulator ensures that we don’t have commercial nuclear accidents in the United States.”

Huff also explained that SMRs relative to traditional nuclear reactors have the potential to be even safer. Because they are smaller, it means fewer parts that can malfunction. They also have the added benefit that if they need to be shut down, the heat left in the core of the reactor is much less than a traditional reactor.

However, Austin Cooper, a professor of technological history with a focus on nuclear energy at Purdue University, talked about his concerns with SMRs.

“The best thing we could do is have an informed conversation about what are the tradeoffs, what are the relevant factors, "" said Cooper. “Sometimes the glory of nuclear energy outshines the reality. You’re just boiling water.”

Cooper stated that this nuclear potential could have us abandon other energy alternatives like wind and solar.

“I fear that ‘nuclear exceptionalism’ has influenced the SMR conversation, where people are treating SMRs as a magic bullet because they are nuclear,” he said.

He also said the goal of projects like SMRs should not be to grow nuclear energy as much as have carbon-free reliable energy.

“If wind and solar plus storage can get you there more cheaply than nuclear, I don’t see why you would write that off,” he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thestatehousefile.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/b4/5b42a6c9-d78e-4635-b3ad-2d41296debfc/682e364f70163.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-05-21 18:12:43.910925

This agreement with Ford helps Nissan address financial pressures and mitigate tariffs on imported parts.

The Kentucky plant will supply Nissan with batteries from 2028 to 2033.

This news follows other positive developments for the Canton plant, including potential Sentra production and the closure of Nissan plants in Japan.

In yet another indication that the Canton, MS, Nissan facility may be safe from closure, the Japanese automotive company has come to terms for a location to produce batteries for electric vehicles.

Nissan previously announced an agreement with a South Korean company, SK On, that will supply batteries for the EVs to be produced at its Canton assembly plant.

The batteries will be made in Kentucky.

That will be made possible because it appears Ford Motor is scaling back its electric vehicle ambitions by allowing Nissan to use part of one of its Kentucky battery plants.

According to an exclusive Wall Street Journal report, the decision affects one of two battery plants Ford launched in 2021 as part of a $7 billion EV investment with South Korea’s SK On. Today, one of the Kentucky factories sits idle, while the other is only partially operational, and it is now expected to produce batteries for both Ford and Nissan.

The plant that Nissan will share with Ford is in Glendale, Kentucky, about 50 miles south of Louisville and just outside of Elizabethtown along Interstate-65.

A spokesperson for Nissan told the Clarion Ledger on Wednesday, May 21, that an announcement about where the batteries will be made will come at a later time.

According to Nissan, however, SK On will supply nearly 100GWh of high-performance, high-nickel batteries to Nissan from 2028 to 2033. Those U.S.-manufactured batteries will power Nissan’s next-generation EVs to be produced at its Canton assembly plant. The agreement reinforces both companies’ commitment to electrification and sustainable mobility, according to the Wednesday press announcement.

For Nissan, access to a U.S.-based battery plant offers a lifeline as the company faces its own financial pressure, reporting a $4.5 billion loss in the first quarter and announcing plans to lay off 20,000 workers.

Producing batteries domestically helps Nissan mitigate tariffs on imported parts and vehicles. The company previously canceled a planned battery facility in Japan and announced in March that SK On would supply batteries for its future electric SUVs to be built at its Canton, Mississippi, plant.

More reason for optimism

This is the second time in the past week that news has arisen to suggest the Canton plant is safe

After Nissan announced on May 13 new cost cuts that eliminate 11,000 more jobs and close seven production plants, Mississippians were nervous that the Canton plant in Madison County might be one of those impacted.

Nissan has seen its profit significantly decrease. Operating profit totaled $472 million in the 12 months to March, a decline of 88% from the previous year.

However, there has been news in recent days that might alleviate fears for those in the Magnolia State.

First, there was news Nissan is considering changing course on its Sentra production in Mexico and would use the Mississippi plant to make the sedan.

While the report did not say Nissan would be leaving Mexico altogether, it did suggest it may shift production to the United States for Sentra sedans intended for sale in America.

Then, on May 18, it was reported that Nissan is considering closing two of its car assembly plants in Japan as part of the restructuring plan to cut costs and improve profitability.

The plants under consideration are the Oppama plant, where Nissan started production in 1961, and the Shonan plant, operated by Nissan Shatai. The move, if finalized, would leave Nissan with only three vehicle assembly plants in Japan.

Is the Canton, MS, Nissan plant safe from closure?

The report that Nissan is considering changing course on its Sentra production seems to jibe with a report from April 21, when the Clarion Ledger reported the Canton plant could be at the forefront of a new American plan to take advantage of whatever tariffs come down from President Donald J. Trump.

At the New York Auto Show, Vinay Shahani, Nissan USA's head of sales and marketing, went out of his way to laud the Madison County plant as an example of where a new American strategy could begin.

""We have an opportunity, I think, with this tariff thing,"" Shahani said in an interview with Motor1 at the New York Auto Show. ""We're very fortunate to have a robust industrial footprint in the United States, at Smyrna [Tennessee] … and in Canton, Mississippi, and I think the opportunity to really push and really leverage some of these models that we build in the United States.""

Nissan in Talks to Buy Batteries in US from Ford-SK On Venture Back to video

Article content

The Japanese automaker wants to source batteries in the US in part to avoid President Donald Trump’s tariffs, said the people, who asked not to be identified revealing internal deliberations. For Ford and SK On, a supply deal with Nissan would help boost production amid a slowdown in EV sales, they said.

Article content

A new Ford-SK factory in Kentucky, known as BlueOvalSK, has emerged as the frontrunner to build the batteries for Nissan, though a final decision hasn’t been made, one of the people said.

Article content

The talks reflect two crosscurrents roiling the auto industry — the cost of the 25% tariff Trump has imposed on imported cars and auto parts and slackening demand for EVs that’s pushing automakers to scale back ambitious plans for battery-powered models.

Article content

Ford is reducing its EV spending by $12 billion and canceled a big electric sport-utility vehicle as it pivots to smaller, more affordable EVs coming in 2027. Nissan said in March it is looking to source batteries in the US from SK On for a new EV it plans to build at its assembly plant in Canton, Mississippi, beginning in 2028.

Article content

By taking on Nissan as a customer, Ford and SK On can more fully utilize the Kentucky battery plant that is just starting up, the people said. The facility will initially supply the American automaker’s E-Transit electric commercial van, which sells in small numbers.

Article content

Nissan, SK On and Ford declined to comment on the potential deal. Ford said the goal for its EV unit is to create “a capital efficient business and domestic supply chain for electric vehicles that will support American jobs.”

Article content

The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the potential deal.

Article content

Ford is seeking to reduce EV losses that reached $5.1 billion last year and could hit $5.5 billion this year. The carmaker and SK On received a $9.2 billion loan from the US Department of Energy in 2023 to build three battery factories in Kentucky and Tennessee. As EV sales growth slowed, Ford and SK On last year put a second planned battery plant in Kentucky on hold.

Article content

Ford also has said it expects a $2.5 billion hit from tariffs this year, which it believes it can reduce by $1 billion.

The funds had been in limbo in recent weeks, with the Department of Energy missing a recent deadline to finalize contracts worth $365 million that would see battery-operated solar systems installed at health clinics and public housing units in Puerto Rico.

The money had been set aside for that purpose under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden.

“That money was spring loaded to flow now,” said Javier Rúa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico’s Solar and Energy Storage Association.

He and others criticized the move.

“This is shameful,” Democratic New York Rep. Nydia Velázquez wrote on X, noting that the funds were meant to serve the most vulnerable.

“Republicans have turned their backs on those who need it most, just 1 week before the start of hurricane season,” she wrote.

Grantees that include the nonprofit Hispanic Federation had said the funds were urgently needed to provide stable power to people including those on dialysis as major outages continue to hit Puerto Rico.

The Department of Energy said in a statement that the money would now be used “to support technologies that improve system flexibility and response, power flow and control, component strength, supply security, and safety.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Energy told The Associated Press that the money would used for things including upgrading aging infrastructure, clearing vegetation from transmission lines and dispatching baseload generation units. The department said it has final authority over how the funds will be used, adding that the solar projects were not scheduled to be constructed until 2026.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that redirecting the funds would ensure that “taxpayer dollars are used to strengthen access to affordable, reliable and secure power, benefiting more citizens as quickly as possible.”

Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González praised the move in a statement, saying it would help all 3.2 million residents on the island instead of “a few customers.”

“Puerto Rico is facing an energy emergency that requires we act now and deliver immediate solutions. Our communities, businesses, and healthcare facilities cannot afford to wait years, nor can we rely on piecemeal approaches with limited results,” she said.

González previously came under fire as her support for investing $1 billion of federal funds in solar projects across Puerto Rico appeared to fade.

A spokeswoman for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment and details.

A spokeswoman for Josué Colón, the island’s so-called energy czar, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dwindling power generation

Rúa Jovet noted that there are currently at least $16 billion in unspent funds from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency meant to improve Puerto Rico’s electric grid, adding that the $365 million should be used for its original purpose.

“There is nothing faster and better than solar batteries,” he said. “We should all be moving as fast as we can on generation.”

Officials in Puerto Rico already have warned that there will be a shortage of generation this summer. In addition, the Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, and it is predicted to be above average, with nine anticipated hurricanes, four of them major.

Many in Puerto Rico worry that any storm, regardless of how small, could knock out the grid given its fragile state.

Puerto Rico already was hit with island-wide blackouts on Dec. 31 and April 16.

The diversion of funds come as González criticizes the work of Luma Energy, which oversees transmission and distribution of power on the island, and Genera PR, which oversees generation.

The two private companies were contracted by the previous administration as Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority struggled to restructure more than $9 billion in public debt, with mediation still stalled.

‘Elections have consequences’

Under Biden, there was a push for more renewable energy projects in Puerto Rico, where crews are still rebuild the power grid after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already weak before the storm hit given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.

Rúa Jovet said the Department of Energy’s decision is an ideological one supported by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Of the $1 billion allocated for solar projects in Puerto Rico under Biden, $450 million already has been granted to install solar rooftop and batteries in thousands of homes located in rural areas or whose occupants have medical needs.

Overall, roughly 117,000 homes and businesses on the island currently have solar rooftops.

More than 60% of energy in Puerto Rico is generated by petroleum-fired power plants, 24% by natural gas, 8% by coal and 7% by renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/6b63ca8/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fb8%2F7b928e22069b481204788f6056ca15%2F1eef921ca5ca4f25805470d4c5bd4171Puerto_Rico_Trump_Tariffs_08814.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 18:12:49.541544

noted that energy tax credits under the IRA benefitted wealthy Americans at the expense of the working class.
The bottom 60% of households take advantage of 10 percent of tax credits.","WASHINGTON—The Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs and the Subcommittee on Health Care and Financial Services today held a joint hearing on “Mandates, Meddling, and Mismanagement: The IRA’s Threat to Energy and Medicine.” At the hearing, members examined how the Biden Administration used the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to raise taxes on Americans, increase radical Green New Deal spending, and hike Medicare premiums for seniors. The Biden Administration wasted billions in taxpayer dollars and harmed Americans to fund the Democrats’ radical climate agenda and restrict Medicare plan choices, all while overlooking the waste, fraud, and abuse in funding streams to left-wing beneficiaries.

Key Takeaways:

The IRA is disastrous for American health care, especially Medicare.

Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Eric Burlison (R-Mo.) remarked in his opening statement that, “There are also implications for the future of our tax code and prescription drug costs. The IRA has already led to a more convoluted web of tax subsidies creating additional burdens for compliance for healthcare under the IRA. The Biden Administration’s pill penalty will ultimately increase drug costs and federal expenditures on Medicare.”

Dr. Erin Trish—the Co-Director of the USC Schaeffer Center—testified in her opening statement that, “Another key provision in the IRA was a significant redesign of the Medicare Part D benefit. Medicare Part D provides drug coverage to 53 million Americans…but the abruptness of the change and its implementation [have] created market instability and considerably increased federal spending. First, Part D plans are exiting the market. There is a 35% reduction in the number of plans offered this year. Today, beneficiaries have the fewest options ever in the program’s 20-year history. Second, taxpayers are paying more. Historically, taxpayers have subsidized about 75% of premiums in this market, but thanks to provisions in the IRA, as market instability grows, so too does the bill.”

IRA subsidies opened the door to potentially trillions more in radical “Green New Deal” spending than was projected at the time of its passage.

Mr. Ben Lieberman—a Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute—testified in his opening statement, “[The] price tag for the energy provisions in the IRA was estimated at about $370 billion dollars for the ten-year period from 2022 to 2032, and this was the score that informed the debate over the bill. Only two years after passage, [Congressional Budget Office] and [Joint Committee on Taxation] more than doubled this estimate.”

Dr. William McBride—Chief Economist and Stephen J. Entin Fellow in Economics at the Tax Foundation—testified in his opening statement that, “Soon after the IRA was enacted, several outside groups, including Goldman Sachs and scholars at the Brookings Institution, began providing estimates indicating the cost of the credits would be much more than originally expected. Roughly $1 trillion over a decade. [The Joint Committee on Taxation] provided an updated estimate in May 2023. That’s nine months after enactment, indicating the cost of the credits had roughly doubled over the original estimate for the same years.”

The IRA allowed vast amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse to permeate within funding streams for radical, left-wing environmental groups.

Health Care and Financial Services Subcommittee Chairman Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) noted in his opening statement,

“The IRA contains billions of dollars for subsidies of so-called ‘green energy’ projects for elites. It’s corporate welfare for the elite climate radicals. The beneficiaries of [its] tax subsidies are overwhelmingly Democratic donors…The green energy tax credits don’t benefit the average American. They have gone to high income earners who were already planning on and could already afford installing solar panels or buying an electric vehicle.”

Member Highlights:

Subcommittee Chairman Grothman inquired about who is benefiting from IRA subsidies and who is getting hurt.

Subcommittee Chairman Grothman: “Could you describe who’s largely getting the benefits of these tax credits in the so-called ‘Inflation Reduction Act’? Who’s paying the price here? Who’s paying the price and getting their taxes reduced, Dr. McBride?”

Dr. McBride: “…You look around, you know, ‘Who’s buying solar panels?’ Who’s buying electric vehicles?’ Those are high income people, and you can see that with your own eyes. The data and the studies support that. For that matter, a lot of the credits go to businesses.”

…

Subcommittee Chairman Grothman: “These energy subsidies are responsible for enormous costs. Overall, insofar as [they drive] up the cost. Who is going to pay the price for that? Is this another thing that’s kind of regressive tax on the average guy, or how would you describe who’s paying the price for this?”

Mr. Lieberman: “There’s almost nothing in the Inflation Reduction Act that’s geared toward lowering energy prices, so energy prices will go up. One thing I would add, for example, is that there’s a lot of provisions in there geared toward the discouraged use of natural gas and making homes all electric. Well, natural gas is three times cheaper than electricity on a per unit energy basis, so it’s one example where climate policy is very much at odds with pro-consumer policy.”

Rep. John McGuire (R-Va.) asked about reforms to prevent the IRA from causing a decline in medical research and new drug innovation.

Rep. McGuire: “Dr. Trish, you co-authored a white paper which concluded that, without reform, the IRA may result in a decline in new drug innovation as well as a decline in research on new indications and evidence for long term effectiveness and safety outcomes. Very briefly, what reforms are necessary to undo the harmful consequences of the Inflation Reduction Act?”

Dr. Trish: “I mean, essentially, we need reforms that realign the pricing incentives so that we are rewarding manufacturers when they produce drugs that have high value for patients in society. That’s the opposite of the set of reforms that we see in the IRA, and so we need to fundamentally shift the incentives there.”

Rep. McGuire: “Right, because what gets rewarded gets repeated.”

Dr. Trish: “Exactly.”

Rep McGuire: “And picking winners and losers means everyone loses.”

Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Tx.) noted that energy tax credits under the IRA benefitted wealthy Americans at the expense of the working class.

Rep. Gill: “Democrats love to claim that these subsidies benefit working class Americans. We have IRA data that found that $5.5 billion of the approximately $8.4 billion in tax credit claims doled out for residential energy tax credits came from filers earning more than $100,000 a year annually. I’d love to hear your opinion again. Do you believe that these tax credits benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of our working class?”

Mr. Lieberman: “The priorities in the Inflation Reduction Act are simply not the priorities of most working-class Americans. The bottom 60% of households take advantage of 10 percent of tax credits. And with regard to something like electric vehicles, keep in mind upwards of 40 percent of American households are single vehicle households. They either don’t want or most likely can’t afford multiple vehicles. Ask yourself, ‘[can] an EV really be that one go-to vehicle?’ and the answer is ‘no.’ Upwards of 90% of EVs are part of multi-vehicle and wealthier families, and a lot is true of many of these other subsidized appliances and other things that just don’t make sense for most working folks, which is why they need to be subsidized.”",https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Grothman-WrapUp.png,N,,2025-05-21 17:14:20.581064

MONTEREY, Calif., May 21, 2025 — In a party-line vote on May 18, the U.S. Congressional House Budget Committee approved a Republican tax package that proposes ending household and commercial energy-efficiency incentives, tax breaks for home batteries, and rebates for new and used electric vehicles (EVs) at the end of the year.

“Rolling back these federal incentives would seriously undermine our clean energy goals—and hit customers where it hurts: their energy bills,” said Das Williams, Senior Advisor of Policy and Legislative Affairs at Central Coast Community Energy (3CE). “We’re encouraging customers to act now: combine federal incentives with 3CE rebates and make progress toward a cleaner, more resilient energy future.”

As a local public agency, 3CE empowers its customers to take more control of their energy use and offers cash incentives for electrifying transportation, homes and businesses. Under the proposed budget, the typical 3CE customer would lose the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for new EVs and the 30% tax credits for heat-pump water heaters and HVAC systems (up to $2,000 per year) and for home batteries. For now, however, these federal incentives can still be paired with 3CE’s rebates of up to $4,000 for a new EV, up to $750 for a Level 2 charger plus up to $4,000 for associated electrical upgrades, a home-battery rebate of up to $500 per kilowatt hour of storage capacity, and a variety of home heat-pump incentives.

The draft bill in Congress also proposes eliminating key federal tax credits for renewable energy project developments — credits that have helped lower costs for clean energy projects in California and across the country. Rolling back these incentives would likely drive up electricity costs for customers.

A report from the Wall Street Journal notes that Ford had two battery factories down in Kentucky, and only part of one was actually producing batteries for Ford. A deal between Ford and Nissan will now see the plant make batteries for Nissan as well, in a bid to get around the recent tariff hikes put in place. This is particularly noteworthy, as Nissan recently announced that it shut down plans for a future battery factory to be opened in Japan.

Ford has been reeling, the report notes, from the lack of electric vehicle demand. But the Nissan batteries, reports noted, would be going into electric vehicles made at its plant in Canton, Mississippi. Whether or not Nissan would ultimately become a customer of Ford’s, however, was left off the table, at least for now.

Does Nissan Know What It’s In For?

This revelation comes at an unexpected time for just about everyone, particularly anyone who has been following Ford closely of late. About two weeks ago, we found out that the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky was, well…we should just say that it was not in the best of shape, according to some reports. Some reports, in fact, that were filed with regulatory officials, reports that BlueOval SK officials called “inaccuracies” and “blatant lies.”

The reports varied on just what was involved in these reports, with everything ranging from blocked emergency exit doors to a risk of chemical exposure, as well as a management team with a tendency to “…terminate anyone who reports any issues,” noted reports.

Is Ford Stock a Good Buy Right Now?

Turning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on F stock based on two Buys, 12 Holds and three Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 10.89% loss in its share price over the past year, the average F price target of $9.59 per share implies 8.62% downside risk.

The funds had been in limbo in recent weeks, with the Department of Energy missing a recent deadline to finalize contracts worth $365 million that would see battery-operated solar systems installed at health clinics and public housing units in Puerto Rico.

The money had been set aside for that purpose under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden.

“That money was spring loaded to flow now,” said Javier Rúa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico’s Solar and Energy Storage Association.

He and others criticized the move.

“This is shameful,” Democratic New York Rep. Nydia Velázquez wrote on X, noting that the funds were meant to serve the most vulnerable.

“Republicans have turned their backs on those who need it most, just 1 week before the start of hurricane season,” she wrote.

Grantees that include the nonprofit Hispanic Federation had said the funds were urgently needed to provide stable power to people including those on dialysis as major outages continue to hit Puerto Rico.

“Pretending that reallocating these funds will make any immediate difference on the stability of the electric grid, when the grid already has an $18 billion allocation, is just a way to distract from the real consequences of their decision. Puerto Rico deserves better,” said Frankie Miranda, the federation’s CEO and president.

The Department of Energy said in a statement that the money would now be used “to support technologies that improve system flexibility and response, power flow and control, component strength, supply security, and safety.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Energy told The Associated Press that the money would used for things including upgrading aging infrastructure, clearing vegetation from transmission lines and dispatching baseload generation units. The department said it has final authority over how the funds will be used, adding that the solar projects were not scheduled to be constructed until 2026.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that redirecting the funds would ensure that “taxpayer dollars are used to strengthen access to affordable, reliable and secure power, benefiting more citizens as quickly as possible.”

Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González praised the move in a statement, saying it would help all 3.2 million residents on the island instead of “a few customers.”

“Puerto Rico is facing an energy emergency that requires we act now and deliver immediate solutions. Our communities, businesses, and healthcare facilities cannot afford to wait years, nor can we rely on piecemeal approaches with limited results,” she said.

González previously came under fire as her support for investing $1 billion of federal funds in solar projects across Puerto Rico appeared to fade.

A spokeswoman for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment and details.

A spokeswoman for Josué Colón, the island’s so-called energy czar, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dwindling power generation

Rúa Jovet noted that there are currently at least $16 billion in unspent funds from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency meant to improve Puerto Rico’s electric grid, adding that the $365 million should be used for its original purpose.

“There is nothing faster and better than solar batteries,” he said. “We should all be moving as fast as we can on generation.”

Officials in Puerto Rico already have warned that there will be a shortage of generation this summer. In addition, the Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, and it is predicted to be above average, with nine anticipated hurricanes, four of them major.

Many in Puerto Rico worry that any storm, regardless of how small, could knock out the grid given its fragile state.

Puerto Rico already was hit with island-wide blackouts on Dec. 31 and April 16.

The diversion of funds come as González criticizes the work of Luma Energy, which oversees transmission and distribution of power on the island, and Genera PR, which oversees generation.

The two private companies were contracted by the previous administration as Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority struggled to restructure more than $9 billion in public debt, with mediation still stalled.

‘Elections have consequences’

Under Biden, there was a push for more renewable energy projects in Puerto Rico, where crews are still rebuild the power grid after Hurricane Maria hit in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm. But the grid was already weak before the storm hit given a lack of maintenance and investment for decades.

Rúa Jovet said the Department of Energy’s decision is an ideological one supported by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Of the $1 billion allocated for solar projects in Puerto Rico under Biden, $450 million already has been granted to install solar rooftop and batteries in thousands of homes located in rural areas or whose occupants have medical needs.

Overall, roughly 117,000 homes and businesses on the island currently have solar rooftops.

Despite that, many lawmakers are trying to slow it down. Add to that one of the automakers building thousands of EVs every year, General Motors. A newly uncovered email exposes the company as it urges employees to get political. It hopes that with enough support, the government will stop California from setting its own emission standards.

More: New Bill To Kill EV Tax Credits Will Only Benefit One Brand

The Golden State has long done exactly that. In 2022, it went as far as to tell automakers that they had a little over a decade. By 2035, it won’t allow the sale of new gas-powered cars and trucks. While that would seemingly be good for EV sales, the plan has several critics aside from General Motors.

The Golden State vs. Detroit

“We need your help!” GM said in an email to white-collar employees obtained by The Wall Street Journal. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.” It’s worth noting that California isn’t alone in its thinking. 11 other states have signed up to follow the same plan. Now, GM and several lawmakers want to remove California’s ability to set its own standards and thus, cancel the ability for the other states involved.

In a statement, GM’s spokeswoman made the company’s stance clear: “GM believes in customer choice, and we continue to focus on offering the best and broadest portfolio of vehicles on the market”. That’s consistent with the automaker’s view, even when it supported California’s proposal in the past. Clearly, a national standard is in the best interest of automakers since they wouldn’t have to manage different regulations in different states.

Government officials say the standards set in California are simply out of touch with reality. Data seems to back that up, too. It set a target to have 35 percent of all vehicle sales be electric in 2026. Right now, EVs only make up 20 percent of new car sales, and that’s in a place where EVs are wildly popular when compared to other states.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GM-CEO-Mary-Barra-0-copy.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 17:12:34.005368

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, kicked off a hearing on the fiscal year 2026 budget request for the Department of Energy (DOE), emphasizing in her opening remarks how important the Department’s work is—and how this administration’s illegal funding freeze, mass reductions in staffing, and steep proposed budget cuts jeopardize essential efforts to drive innovation, reduce dependence on foreign energy sources, and lower Americans’ monthly energy bills.

Senator Murray’s opening remarks, as delivered, are below:

“Thank you, Chair Kennedy. I am pleased to serve as Ranking Member of this important Subcommittee, and I hope we can continue our track record of writing bipartisan spending bills that make crucial investments in our communities that we need.

“DOE’s work is far reaching with major implications for how much families spend on their energy bills, the reliability of our energy grid, whether we lead the world in clean energy, AI, and quantum computing, and our national security and nuclear waste cleanup program. In my home state of Washington, we see this firsthand at the Bonneville Power Administration, which provides power to families across the region. At the Pacific Northwest National Lab, which is pioneering cutting edge research, and at Hanford, where we have the biggest nuclear clean-up site in the country—a moral and legal obligation we must never shortchange.

“So, we must give the programs DOE manages their due in terms of funding, and in terms of the oversight necessary to ensure that funding actually gets to our communities. But these goals are in jeopardy because of your actions over the last few months like a truly sweeping funding freeze, unprecedented contract cancellations, mass staffing reductions, and uncertainty that is hurting communities across our country.

“Now, Secretary Wright, my colleagues and I have been pressing you for information on staffing, funds signed into law you are holding up or straight up cancelling, and more. I’ve only received two responses so far, both of them yesterday—clearly to get ahead of today’s hearing. And ‘response’ is being charitable, since you failed to provide any real answers. Last week, you told the House you have ignored basic inquiries from lawmakers because you are apparently too busy, and you mentioned you don’t want to spend time on false premises. So, I thought we could save some time today by debunking a few false premises.

“It is false for you to say less than a thousand people have left since you took over when we know over 3,500 DOE employees have taken the so-called buyout you offered and we know you fired 500 more. It is false for you to say no contracts have been cancelled when you have plainly cancelled electric vehicle and low-income energy assistance grants in Colorado, to give one example. And it is false for you to say there are no unpaid invoices when we have heard from organizations still waiting on payments—including Hydrogen Hubs, which have unpaid invoices.

“Now, in addition to ignoring requests from Congress, your FY25 spend plan which is required by law is completely inadequate. That is a critical document for us to understand how you are spending—or illegally blocking and cancelling—billions of dollars Congress has provided for critical projects across the country. I’ve heard you say you are merely conducting a review as if that magically makes it okay. Call it whatever you want, the bottom line is the money isn’t moving. And as a former businessman, you know perfectly well that uncertainty alone has a massive cost.

“Jobs are already being lost because of your actions. Private investment in critical energy projects is being cancelled, delayed, or threatened to the tune of $71 billion so far this year. And as electric prices hit record highs, you are halting progress on investments that would lower people’s bills. Meanwhile, you are letting thousands of critical staff go—encouraging folks to leave—with no regard for if they do their work well, or if the work is important.

“I still don’t know how you could do something as crazy as try to fire Bonneville Power Administration workers, in the name of efficiency! I mean these are literally the people who keep the lights on and they aren’t even paid by taxpayer dollars! Eventually, you reversed those firings, but the fact they happened at all was the first in a parade of red flags.

“Now, we are here to talk about another red flag—a budget that completely guts the non-defense half of your mission. Overall, you want to slash $20 billion from DOE’s science and energy programs. Your budget proposes ripping 75% out of the energy efficiency and renewable energy program and shuttering important clean energy and manufacturing programs. I don’t know who is telling you people want to pay higher electric bills?

“Your budget slashes $1.1 billion from the Office of Science. Who is telling you we should cede ground to China in the race for innovation, and layoff scientists at our national labs? Your budget cuts $15 billion from programs we created in the bipartisan infrastructure law—hydrogen hubs, battery storage, advanced manufacturing and supply chains, and other programs to lower energy costs. Who told you we don’t want those manufacturing jobs? Who told you we don’t want to strengthen our energy production and reduce our dependence on foreign oil?

“Here is what I will tell you, if you were to follow through with this disaster of a budget the only energy you are going to save is from the lights that go out at factories across the country. Those lights are going to go off, as China swoops in to take the lead in the technologies that will define the 21st century. I don’t see any efficiency in this budget—but there is a heavy cost.

“There is the cost you are going to pass on to our constituents in the form of higher electric bills, higher gas bills, more power outages. Not to mention the cost when manufacturing moves elsewhere, and we have to pay Trump’s absurd tariffs for technology we could, and should, be making right here. Or the cost to our country. Discoveries we could be making here, jobs we could be creating here, goods we could be making here and selling across the world. Instead, it feels like you want to gift wrap the future and hand it to China.

“Your budget also flat-funds the Hanford clean-up. That has serious repercussions. They recently finalized milestones they have to meet on the High Level Waste mission. Flat funding means the only way to hit those targets is to pull funding from other priorities which would have ripple effects for workers carrying out critical projects across the site and ultimately would delay remediation along the Columbia River. That is unacceptable. We cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.

“Secretary, I know you talk about energy abundance, but talk is cheap. Doing this work takes investments—investments you are ripping to shreds. So, I want to see less talk and more money getting out the door the way Congress wrote and intended. There is common ground in this space. I know because we have found it before. The very last bill Chair Kennedy and I wrote together passed out of this committee unanimously, and I want to see us do it again. Because this is genuinely important work.

“Now, before I conclude, I would be remiss if I did not address the outrageously corrupt news we got last week on the Army Corps work plan. This administration is ripping away hundreds of millions of dollars from projects that were in the House bill and Senate Energy and Water FY25 bills and funding other projects which were not funded in any bill that we approved!

“This includes scrapping funds for the Howard Hanson Dam in Washington state. This is a vital project that has to get done and I will keep working with you Mr. Chairman to get this done because this Committee and this Subcommittee have long come together to fund projects vital to communities across this country and I know no member appreciates any administration playing games with our communities for political reasons—as is the case with the work plan released last week. It’s brazen abuse—pure and simple. I am going to keep digging into how that decision was made, demanding answers, speaking out about this, and fighting for my state of Washington.

“Thank you, and now I will turn it back to Chair Kennedy.”",https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/themes/appropriations/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 16:09:28.252669

Gas futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.4 cents, or 0.7%, to $3.403 per million British thermal units at 9:07 a.m. EDT (1307 GMT).

Analysts said heating and cooling demand should remain low across much of the country in coming weeks, allowing utilities to keep adding more gas into storage than normal for this time of year.

Gas stockpiles were already around 3% above the five-year (2020-2024) average.

Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 U.S. states fell to 104.9 billion cubic feet per day so far in May, down from a monthly record of 105.8 bcfd in April.

On a daily basis, however, output was on track to slide to a preliminary two-week low of 103.9 bcfd on Wednesday, down from 105.0 bcfd on Tuesday and an average of 105.2 bcfd during the prior seven days. That daily output decline was smaller than LSEG's outlook on Tuesday. Analysts noted preliminary data is often revised later in the day.

Energy traders noted those output reductions were due in part to maintenance on some gas pipes, including U.S. energy firm Kinder Morgan's 2.7-bcfd Permian Highway from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast.

Kinder Morgan said it will perform a turbine exchange at the Big Lake compressor station from May 13-26 that will reduce mainline capacity to around 2.2 bcfd.

Meteorologists projected the weather would remain mostly warmer than normal through June 6.

LSEG forecast average gas demand in the Lower 48, including exports, will drop from 99.4 bcfd this week to 94.9 bcfd next week. The forecast for this week was higher than LSEG's outlook on Tuesday.

The average amount of gas flowing to the eight big liquefied natural gas export plants operating in the U.S. fell to 15.1 bcfd so far in May, down from a monthly record of 16.0 bcfd in April.

The LNG feedgas decline so far this month was mostly due to maintenance reductions at Cameron LNG's 2.0-bcfd plant in Louisiana and Cheniere Energy's 3.9-bcfd Corpus Christi plant under construction and in operation in Texas, and brief unplanned reductions at Freeport LNG's 2.1-bcfd plant in Texas.

Looking ahead, energy traders said they expect LNG feedgas to remain below April's record high in June with Cheniere planning to conduct about three weeks of maintenance on a couple of liquefaction trains at its 4.5-bcfd Sabine Pass export plant in Louisiana from around June 2-23.

The U.S. became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, surpassing Australia and Qatar, as surging global prices fed demand for more exports, due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Gas was trading at a six-week high of around $13 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility benchmark in Europe and a five-week high of around $13 at the Japan Korea Marker benchmark in Asia.

Manufacturing facilities that produce solar and wind components are also eligible for the 45X tax credits.","Congress is busy trying to get Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill across the finish line. In addition to selling out our public lands and attempting to limit review of polluting projects by the courts, the bill would hobble our fast-growing clean energy economy—a critical piece in fighting climate change. All of this to pay for tax cuts that will overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest Americans and still raise the deficit by nearly $4 trillion dollars.

There are real obstacles to deploying clean energy technologies at scale. They include the upfront cost, particularly in the case of EVs or energy efficiency upgrades; the need for supporting infrastructure, such as EV charging stations or interregional transmission; and the lack of domestic supply chains and manufacturing capacity to build key components. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) contained specific provisions to address these obstacles through a combination of tax credits, materials sourcing requirements, and federal grants and loans. Now, this bill takes a sledgehammer to all of it. Here’s how.

Battery Manufacturing

Key goals of the IRA include deploying more low-carbon technology, making clean energy supply chains more resilient, and incentivizing more domestic manufacturing. The tax credits are a key policy tool to achieving these goals. To be eligible for a clean vehicle tax credit (30D), companies have to meet sourcing requirements, meaning that a specific amount of battery components and minerals need to be sourced domestically (including recycling) or from an allied country. The IRA also created an advanced manufacturing tax credit (45X) for facilities producing clean energy technologies domestically, with a bonus credit for companies that meet higher labor standards.

In reality, certain supply chain gaps are harder to fill, even with tax breaks. In the case of batteries, we have a gap in midstream capacity—refining minerals such as nickel, cobalt, or lithium, using them to synthesize “active materials,” and using that to produce battery cathodes, anodes, and ultimately, cells. Currently, those processes primarily take place in Asia, and companies import the finished components to assemble them into cells in US gigafactories. Onshoring these production steps is complex. Beyond upfront investment, it requires a skilled workforce with specialized knowledge—not only to produce the battery components, but to produce and maintain the machinery required to build them. Even in the most favorable policy environment, it would take years.

Under the Biden Administration, the Department of Energy (DOE) addressed these problems through grants and loans to help companies innovate and scale key technologies. In a perfect world, here’s how it would play out: The Loan Programs Office finances key facilities that fill known supply gaps (like this one and this one); those facilities sell to domestic battery factories, which get an advanced manufacturing tax credit (45X) that help defray high upfront capital costs; and finally, an EV company uses the batteries produced in that factory so they will be eligible for the clean vehicles tax credit (30D).

The current reconciliation package entirely undermines that strategy.

In its current form, the bill eliminates the clean vehicles tax credit (30D) and phases out the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit (45X), while introducing new requirements that would make it effectively impossible for any company to be eligible or demonstrate compliance. Meanwhile, the Energy and Commerce bill rescinds unobligated IRA funding from the Loan Programs Office, along with several other IRA programs.

The combination jeopardizes $81 billion and nearly 60,000 jobs from battery facilities that have been announced since the IRA was passed. With these credits and loan programs intertwined, an effective repeal of the tax credits causes further harm—and it’s not just those factories that benefited from loan funding. Numerous factories did not receive any public IRA funding, but companies made investment decisions with the expectation of stable tax credits that are now at risk. Further, these companies may have been counting on sourcing components from a domestic supplier who used a grant or loan to bring their technology to commercial scale. Likewise, the facilities that were directly supported by IRA funding would have planned to sell their products into the domestic market, which, again, was based on an expectation of stable consumer and producer tax credits. The current bill puts all this investment at risk.

The irony is that as this bill makes its way through the legislative process, the same committees are holding hearings on strengthening America’s supply chains and maintaining global competitiveness. They propose to achieve this by gutting environmental protections and pushing rushed mining projects while sabotaging the value-added industries that would have used those minerals to create skilled jobs across the country.

Wind and Solar

The current bill contains a similar path for wind and solar: a so-called “phase out” of vital tax credits and repeal of IRA-funded programs addressing key bottlenecks.

Let’s start with tax credits: In theory, the bill accelerates the phase out of Clean Energy Production and Investment Tax Credits (45 and 48, respectively), which were also tiered to incentivize the development of facilities that meet strong labor standards, use domestic materials, and are located in energy communities. Manufacturing facilities that produce solar and wind components are also eligible for the 45X tax credits. Under the IRA, these tax credits would have started phasing out after 2032, or when U.S. greenhouse gas emissions dropped to 25% of 2022 levels.

In reality, the reconciliation bill effectively terminates these tax credits. It introduces infeasible requirements related to sourcing and investment from foreign entities that many industry voices say are unworkable. It also changes eligibility from facilities that began construction before 2032 to “placed in service before 2028.” rendering facilities with longer lead-times for construction ineligible.

Transmission Capacity

Finally, none of these efforts will make a dent in helping us reach our emissions reductions goals if we do not increase transmission capacity in the United States. Transmission capacity would need to at least double by 2030 to realize the emissions reductions made possible by the IRA’s clean energy investments, according to modeling from Princeton’s Net-Zero America report. Increasing transmission capacity also improves grid resilience and lowers consumer energy costs.

This bill undermines that goal by repealing all unobligated funds from IRA transmission funding programs, including Interregional and Offshore Wind Electricity Planning, Modeling, and Analysis funding, Grants to Facilitate the Siting of Interstate Electricity Transmission Lines, and the Transmission Facility Financing Program. In this moment, where new load growth, destabilized grids, and rising electricity prices are evident at every corner – we cannot afford to go backwards. Building out transmission is a complex challenge that, like onshoring high-tech supply chains, can’t be fixed with money alone, but these programs were an important step to move development forward. Earthjustice has long recognized the urgent need for just, equitable, and sustainable transmission development, and worked across the environmental movement to articulate what’s needed to achieve that goal.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-05-21 16:09:36.135255

This five-part series from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce.

When Mason Taylor was getting ready to graduate from high school in 2022, he thought he would have to take an entry-level technician job with a company in Tennessee.

Taylor grew up in the town of Dryden in rural Lee County, in the westernmost sliver of Virginia between Kentucky and Tennessee. He had come to love the electrical courses he took in high school because there was always something new to learn, always a new way to challenge himself.

Driving to Tennessee for work would likely mean two hours commuting each day.

Taylor, now 21, just wanted to work close to home.

A summer apprenticeship learning how to install solar arrays helped him get on-the-job training and opened up connections to local work.

A regional partnership working to add solar panels to commercial buildings in the region aims to train young people as they go, developing workforce skills in anticipation of increasing demand for renewable energy-focused jobs in the heart of coal country, where skill sets and energy options are both changing.

Virginia ranks eighth in the nation for installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, but so far, major renewable energy projects have been clustered in the eastern and southern regions of the state. Increasing the popularity of solar power in the far southwestern corner of the state depends in part on the availability of trained workers like Taylor.

Andy Hershberger, director of Virginia operations for Got Electric, said the electrical contractor firm has had an apprenticeship program nearly since the company’s founding.

The company, which has about 100 employees total, with 40 in Virginia and an office in Maryland, has worked with Staunton-based Secure Solar Futures, a commercial and public-sector solar developer, as far back as 2012.

More recently, the two companies began working to set up a training program that was more focused on solar. The catalyst was the former superintendent of Wise County schools, a school division that had signed up to put solar panels on its facilities. The superintendent saw the installation as an opportunity to get his students hands-on work on a renewable energy project.

Approximately three dozen apprentices have signed up for the program since 2022, including about 13 who are currently involved, Hershberger said. They work on a variety of solar projects, including on rooftops, carports, and ground-mounted installations.

“We have been utilizing this program to train students coming out of high school and basically growing the workforce side of this thing, so we have the necessary personnel to build these solar projects long term,” Hershberger said.

On top of hourly pay, apprentices get free equipment and a transportation subsidy, along with nine community college credits at Mountain Empire Community College, which provides classroom training before students step onto the job site.

“I mean, pretty much everything you need to know to go out and do any electrical job, you pretty much learned in that apprenticeship program,” Taylor said.

He was in the first cohort of 10 students who installed solar panels on public schools in Lee and Wise counties in 2022. A grant from a regional economic development authority paid the students’ wages while they earned credit at Mountain Empire Community College, which serves residents of Dickenson, Lee, Scott, and Wise counties, plus the city of Norton.

He got a job offer from Got Electric at the end of that summer.

This summer, Secure Solar Futures and Got Electric will join forces again to install more than 1,600 solar panels on the community college’s classroom buildings. The project was originally slated for 2024 but was delayed due in part to a separate project upgrading fire safety equipment in one of the buildings.

The 777-kilowatt solar power system will be connected to the electric grid, and Mountain Empire will receive credit for the power it generates.

Hershberger said he sees interest in solar growing.

“I think there’s always been folks that have adopted renewable projects, different types of energy sources. There’s always the standard interest in trying to save money for facilities and campuses and things like that,” he said.

Mountain Empire Community College offers solar training as a standalone career studies certificate or as part of its larger energy technology associate degree program.

In Southwest Virginia, a solar installation project is more likely to consist of adding panels to homes and businesses rather than building the large, utility-scale ground-based facilities more commonly seen in Southside Virginia, said Matt Rose, the college’s dean of industrial technology.

On a larger project, a single worker might have a specialized role, performing the same task across a large number of panels. On a smaller project, a worker is more likely to be involved in more aspects of the job.

“Our students need to have that comprehensive understanding and ability to be able to do it all,” he said.

Last year, 10 students graduated Mountain Empire with the solar installer certification. Many students who earn the certification perform solar installation work as one part of a more comprehensive job, such as being an electrician.

Rose said the college’s students typically start out making $17 or $18 an hour but can earn more as they become journeymen and master electricians.

Nationwide, the median salary for electricians is about $61,000.

In Lee County, population 22,000, the median household income is about $42,000.

The number of solar installers in Southwest Virginia is unclear. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t collect data on employment by technology, so residential solar installation companies are labeled as electrical contractors, along with all other electrical businesses, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Tony Smith, founder and CEO of Secure Solar Futures, measures the success of the company’s apprenticeship program person by person. At an April event to celebrate the completion of the first phase of solar panel installation for Roanoke schools, Smith asked about several of the students from the 2022 cohort from Lee and Wise counties by name.

Smith said it’s tough to replicate the apprenticeship program at various school divisions. Doing so requires the work of individual school systems and the regional community colleges, instead of being able to pick up the curriculum from one area and apply it at the next project site.

And all the partners — Smith’s company, participating schools and installation firms — face some uncertainty for each project. It’s challenging to pinpoint the timing of projects so that students have the time to participate during the summer months, he said.

Solar training can give students a ​“head start on everybody”

“The things I learned in the apprenticeship program I’m still doing day to day,” Anthony Hamilton, 21, said. He completed the eight-week apprenticeship in Lee and Wise counties in 2022 alongside Taylor. He didn’t think it would turn into a full-time job. He doubted anyone really wanted to hire a kid just starting college.

He’s been with Got Electric ever since, working as an electrician primarily on commercial jobs. Hamilton’s solar experience has come in handy on recent installation projects at a poultry farm and at a YMCA facility.

Hamilton continued going to school at Mountain Empire and graduates this month with two associate degrees in energy technology and electrical. He’s also earned a handful of certificates in solar installation, air conditioning and refrigeration, and electrical fabrication, among others. With the nine credits he earned in the summer apprenticeship, he ​“already had a head start on everybody in the program.”

It wasn’t an easy journey, though.

He said he usually started his day around 6 a.m. and went to night classes after work that stretched until 9:30 p.m. Hamilton lives in Coeburn in Wise County, a 45-minute drive to the college campus. He’d get home late, then get up early and do it all over again. But his college was free through a local scholarship program that pays for up to three years of classes at Mountain Empire.

He’d like to stay with Got Electric and start preparing to take his journeyman’s license, which requires at least four years of practical experience on top of vocational training, plus an exam. From there, he’s got designs on moving up in the company and eventually becoming a master electrician.

On April 14, he was in the town of Abingdon, a few weeks into a three-month project installing a solar array at a large poultry farm that says it produces more than 650,000 eggs a day. The work so far entailed digging trenches and laying PVC pipe for the ground-mount solar system that will span one section of the farm’s expansive fields.

Taylor uses similar skills at work each day. But his work site looks a lot different from Hamilton’s.

It has taken Taylor some time to figure out how to stick close to home while working in his trade. He spent a year working with Got Electric immediately after finishing his summer apprenticeship, then left the company to work as an electrician in a local school system. He eventually returned to Got Electric for a few months, working at Virginia Tech putting solar on three buildings on campus in Blacksburg, three hours from home.

He discovered he didn’t like traveling for installation jobs that meant night after night in a motel room.

“That was the only complaint I had with it, about being away from home,” he said.

Now he’s an electrician at a state prison in Big Stone Gap. He has the same shift every day, in the same place, and drives 10 minutes home from work at the end of the day.

Taylor has also taken additional classes at Mountain Empire and wants to go back this fall to finish his associate degrees in HVAC and electrical. He eventually wants to open his own business as an electrician working locally. He’d like to be able to do small solar installation jobs. Solar hasn’t really caught on in far Southwest Virginia, he said — at least, not yet.

“We’re starting to see a lot more homeowners interested in [solar] locally as a way to offset increasing energy costs, but overall most of it is just a component of the job because there’s not enough demand,” Rose said.

Rose predicts interest in solar will grow as more homeowners and business owners look for ways to offset rising electric bills.

“As we all look at increasing energy costs, it’s going to make a lot more economic sense,” he said.

Energy independence, he added, fits with the character of Southwest Virginia.

“We’ve always been resilient people,” Rose said. ​“We’ve always been adapt-and-overcome people, and what better way than to basically control a little bit of your own power?”

Climate Advocates Demonstrate to Oppose Trump, Zeldin’s Polluters First Agenda and Proposed EPA Cuts

Inhaler-Wielding Advocates Object to Cuts, Rolling Back Clean Air and Climate Protections

WASHINGTON–Climate advocates wielding inhalers, masks and a letter signed by more than 100 groups demonstrated against Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and the Trump administration’s budget proposal for the agency, including the proposed 55% across-the-board cut, at today’s budget hearing in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Climate Action Campaign advocates, seated behind Zeldin at the hearing, were wearing blue “Zeldin Makes Us Sick” T-shirts and using medically necessary inhalers to indicate their opposition to increased levels of dangerous and toxic pollution expected if the proposed EPA cuts are adopted by Congress. Organizers released a letter signed by more than 100 climate, health, environmental justice, faith-based and conservation organizations demanding that Congress reject these draconian cuts, secure reliable funding and resources needed to tackle air pollution and climate change, and lawfully disburse all previously appropriated staff and program funds.

""As the parent of a child with asthma for over 40 years – and who has lived with asthma myself for seven decades – I know what it’s like to struggle to breathe and to live in fear that my daughter could end up in the hospital or even die because of a bad air day,"" said Candice Egan, a volunteer from Delhi, New York, who attended the hearing with her prescription inhaler. ""Clean air protections are a lifeline for people with respiratory illness. The Trump administration is literally making us sick and risking our lives: My daughter and I will be among the millions who suffer thanks to Trump and Zeldin’s Polluters First Agenda, which will result in dirty air, more kids with asthma and more severe asthma attacks.""

Volunteers hold their medically prescribed inhalers during Administrator Lee Zeldin’s appearance before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Since becoming the top official at EPA, Administrator Zeldin has injected chaos and uncertainty into our environmental and energy policies. From attempting to roll back over 30 life-saving climate and health protections to canceling hundreds of research and community investment grants, to cutting the scientists and experts we rely on to protect our air and our health, Trump and Zeldin’s priorities are clear: polluters over the people.

“The Environmental Protection Agency has an important mission – to protect our health and environment. EPA Administrator Zeldin’s Polluters First Agenda is a betrayal of that mission and a betrayal of the American people who expect the EPA to protect them from the dangerous and deadly impacts of pollution,"" said Caroline Martin, a retired nurse from Springfield, Virginia, who attended the hearing to protest the proposed cuts. “Nurses like me see the impacts of the climate crisis everyday. From a growing number of people struggling to breathe, to families displaced and hurt by wildfires, these cuts will cost lives. Americans deserve an EPA that will put people, not polluters, first.”

Both Republican and Democratic members of Congress have questioned the administrator on how the EPA could fulfill its core mission under such drastic cuts, pointing to the alarming rise in health harms and climate-driven disasters that are overwhelming communities nationwide. Lawmakers and advocates have warned these attacks on the agency would let polluters off the hook and force the American people to breathe dirtier air, lose good-paying jobs, and foot the bill for soaring healthcare expenses and emergency response and rebuilding costs due to the worsening climate crisis.

A new analysis from the Center for American Progress argues that draft language in the proposed budget package would gut domestic manufacturing by ending programs that offer tax credits and incentives for clean energy research, development, and production.

“By canceling these highly successful policies only to pay for tax cuts for billionaires, they are showing Americans their real priority: supporting billionaires over working people,” said Mike Williams, senior fellow at CAP and co-author of the analysis.

Supporting existing industries and helping new industries take hold requires a multifaceted approach that includes strong research and development paired with initial investments, longer-term support, and proper trade enforcement.

Bottlenecks in supply The increase in electricity demand within PJM is happening at the same time that supply is shrinking.","Americans’ electricity bills tend to tick up each year in line with inflation.

But upgrades to electric wires, reinforcing and protecting power lines from severe weather, and changing fuel costs – among other factors – are sending rates soaring.

High electricity consumption from data centers and other sources of rising demand will likely cause further increases in the near future.

The impact on consumers is particularly dramatic in Pennsylvania, where rate hikes are widespread.

For example, the monthly bill for a PECO residential customer who uses 700 kilowatt hours of electricity monthly increased 10% – or US$13.58 – in 2025. These bills will go up another $2.70 each month in 2026.

Retail price adjustments approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for most electric distribution utilities effective December 2024 led to higher bills for many customers across the state. In some parts of Pennsylvania, the estimated increases topped an estimated 30%.

As professors who work in the areas of energy law and electricity markets, we know electricity costs are rising in many parts of the U.S.

But Pennsylvania faces distinct challenges related to its electric grid – the maze of wires and generators – that drive both the growing demand for electricity and the limited supply.

PJM and the electric grid

Pennsylvania power plants produce a lot of electricity. In fact, the Keystone State is the the largest exporter of electricity in the U.S. and has been for many years.

But the electricity Pennsylvania produces doesn’t always stay in state.

That’s because Pennsylvania’s electric grid is managed by a company called PJM. PJM coordinates the flow of electricity through all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia, and it ensures the wholesale electricity transmission system operates reliably and safely.

Pennsylvania electric utilities, such as PECO or Duquesne Light, then distribute this wholesale electricity to retail customers, including homeowners and renters.

PJM requires the utilities to ensure ahead of time that they can meet their customers’ future electricity demands, including during heat waves and winter storms. This requirement is met using a market called a “capacity auction,” in which electricity suppliers bid to provide physical infrastructure that will generate electricity in the future.

The prices at the 2025-2026 PJM capacity auction were more than 800% higher than the previous year, in part due to the growing demand for electricity within PJM. This amounts to tens of billions of dollars in extra costs.

Power plants in Pennsylvania can’t simply stop exporting electricity and supply more in-state power because they dispatch their power into the regional grid operated by PJM, and the flow of electricity is dictated by the physical structure of this grid.

Soaring demand from data centers

U.S. electricity demand rose 3% in 2024 and is expected to rise even more rapidly in the coming years.

Much of this new demand comes from data centers, which support everything from AI applications and data storage – think of the thousands of emails and files backed up on our computers – to sports betting, online retailers such as Amazon, and national security applications such as the North American Aerospace Defense Command.

Pennsylvania is on the same electric grid as Virginia, which hosts about a quarter of all data center capacity in the Americas. New data centers are also being built in Pennsylvania.

Rising demand is also driven by the increase in electric vehicles and the replacement of gas- and oil-based furnaces with electric heat pumps. These replacements are ultimately more energy efficient but require electricity.

Bottlenecks in supply

The increase in electricity demand within PJM is happening at the same time that supply is shrinking.

Many old generating plants in the PJM grid are retiring as they near the end of their useful lives and become less profitable for plant operators, particularly as natural gas and solar become more affordable. Some of these older power plants also emit a lot of pollution and are costly to retrofit to meet current pollution limits.

Beyond the challenge of plant retirements, PJM has been slow to allow hundreds of new proposed power plants – most of them solar- and battery-based – to connect to transmission lines.

This long “interconnection queue” prevents new, needed generation from coming online. This is happening even though companies are eager and ready to build more generation and battery storage.

Aging infrastructure and growing weather extremes

One of the primary recent drivers of high consumer electric bills is that the utilities have been slow to upgrade their aging wires.

Many have recently made major investments in new infrastructure and in some cases are burying or strengthening wires to protect them from increasingly extreme weather.

Electricity customers are footing the bill for this work.

Response from policymakers

In response to rising electricity prices, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro filed a legal complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against PJM in December 2024. This complaint blamed PJM’s capacity auction design for creating unnecessary costs for consumers.

According to the settlement reached after the complaint, PJM’s price caps will be 35% lower at the next major capacity auction. This reduction in wholesale prices could limit retail price increases.

But this is at best a temporary fix. It doesn’t address the increasing demand, aging power infrastructure battered by extreme weather, or transmission bottleneck.

In order for Pennsylvania residents to see lower electric bills anytime soon, more changes are needed. For example, many experts previously observed that PJM needs to fix the queue and get online the many power plants that are ready to build and just waiting for a transmission interconnection.

While PJM has reformed its queue process, the queue is still long. New power plants are not going up fast enough, in part due to additional challenges such as local opposition and supply chain and financing issues.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/666520/original/file-20250507-62-npsddk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C913%2C5472%2C2736&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-05-21 16:09:55.720293

San Juan, P.R. - Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 2 Administrator Michael Martucci completed a five-day trip across Puerto Rico, engaging with local leaders, community advocates, and agency partners to spotlight EPA’s work revitalizing contaminated sites, restoring coastal ecosystems, and investing in local environmental jobs.

The visit coincided with Caribbean Brownfields Week and included stops in San Juan, Camuy, Arecibo, Barceloneta, Naranjito, and other municipalities. The trip emphasized EPA’s commitment to delivering on its statutory mandates, namely protecting clean air, land and water through cooperative federalism and common-sense investment.

“Redevelopment through the Brownfields program builds stronger local economies and healthier communities,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “This week showed the power of partnerships across all levels of government, with community leaders, and the private sector. Working together we can deliver long-overdue environmental and economic benefits to Puerto Rico.”

Major Highlights from the Week

Meeting with Governor Jenniffer González Colón on Energy Needs

Regional Administrator Martucci met with Puerto Rico Governor Jenniffer González Colón, along with the island’s Energy Czar, the Secretary of Natural Resources, and the president of LUMA Energy. The Governor convened the meeting to discuss Puerto Rico’s energy needs and explore ways to streamline environmental permitting processes. The meeting reflects ongoing collaboration to modernize energy infrastructure while ensuring environmental safeguards.

EPA-Funded Brownfields Projects in Action

EPA’s investments in Brownfields redevelopment took center stage throughout the week:

In Camuy, the Regional Administrator attended the Brownfields Job Training Workforce Development Forum and visited a coastal dune restoration site at Finca Nolla, a natural reserve managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources and the University of Puerto Rico with the support of the Municipality of Camuy, supported by EPA Brownfields assessment funds. The nature reserve is now a protected ecological area with community and educational benefits.

In Barceloneta, the Regional Administrator gave welcome remarks at the Revitalization Resources Forum where federal and Commonwealth partners highlighted to municipalities, non-government organizations, community-based groups, among other attendees, grant and technical assistance opportunities currently available.

In Naranjito, he met with Mayor of the city and staff to review progress from a $300,000 Brownfields grant that assessed and redeveloped properties, including a former gas station turned wastewater pump station and a former theater converted into a community resource center. A new $1 million EPA grant awarded in 2024 will expand these efforts to additional properties in the Mountain District.

At a Brownfields Job Training Program graduation ceremony hosted by PathStone Corporation, the Regional Administrator congratulated trainees who completed an EPA-supported environmental job training program, positioning them for work in site remediation, environmental monitoring, and infrastructure restoration.

Caño Martín Peña Ecosystem Restoration Groundbreaking

Regional Administrator Martucci joined Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources Secretary Waldemar Quiles, San Juan Mayor Miguel Romero, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Colonel Charles Decker, representatives from ENLACE Public Corporation and the G8 community coalition to announce the next phase of the Caño Martín Peña Ecosystem Restoration Project. This $14.7 million phase will protect critical bridge infrastructure and set the stage for future dredging work to restore tidal flow and improve water quality for the 27,000 residents living nearby.

Site Visits to Address Community Concerns

In Arecibo, the Regional Administrator toured the municipal landfill and a stormwater pump station that is part of the municipal storm water sewer system and met with local community leaders to hear firsthand concerns about landfill odors, water pollution, and compliance with federal orders. EPA continues to work with the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) and local officials to monitor and enforce pollution controls.

San Juan Bay Estuary Restoration and Monitoring

The trip concluded with a boat tour and meeting with the San Juan Bay Estuary Partnership and USACE officials. Discussions centered on the restoration of the Juan Méndez Creek, a degraded tributary whose contamination threatens nearby ecosystems and public health. Supported by EPA’s National Estuary Program, the project aims to restore habitat, reduce flooding, and eliminate illegal sewage discharges.

For the Cadillac Lyriq SUV specifically, Tesla trade-ins have surged to roughly 25%, up from previous levels of 10% to 15%.

The uptick in what the industry calls customer “conquesting” comes as Cadillac builds out one of the market’s most comprehensive luxury EV portfolios. Its current electric lineup includes the entry-level Optiq, midsize Lyriq, three-row Vistiq, full-size Escalade IQ, a performance Lyriq variant, and the ultra-luxury Celestiq, which is priced at over $300,000.

The growing interest from former Tesla owners also coincides with a period of declining sales and mounting backlash for Tesla, as CEO Elon Musk’s public support for President Donald Trump and participation in the alleged Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) stirs consumer pushback.

Cadillac has avoided speculating on whether political factors are driving the trade-ins, stating that its gains are based on vehicle quality and consumer appeal. Still, the brand sees further opportunity to attract Tesla customers as it rolls out more models across different price tiers and performance levels.

Despite these gains, Tesla vehicles have not appeared among the top 10 most cross-shopped models against Cadillac EVs over the past six months, according to Edmunds. The data suggests that many consumers leaving Tesla are not comparing it to Cadillac directly, but are instead making a clear decision to exit the brand altogether.

While Tesla’s top-selling Model 3 and Model Y are generally categorized as mainstream vehicles, Cadillac is targeting the premium segment and aiming to become the top luxury EV brand this year, excluding Tesla, though its higher-end Model S and Model X are often classified as luxury.

Wyoming’s largest natural gas producer, PureWest, says it’s getting into the data center power supply game and partnering with two other firms on a project near Evanston. For its part, PureWest must ensure its fossil fuel product will have minimal carbon emissions to meet data centers’ energy preferences.

To do that, PureWest says it will obtain a globally recognized “low-carbon verification” certificate, which means the company has met the rigors of ensuring there are no rogue emissions in its natural gas supply chain, from its production wells south of Pinedale to the gas-fired power generators near Evanston.

The project will initially generate 150 megawatts of electricity, then scale up to 1,200 megawatts, delivering the power to at least one data center developed by Prometheus Hyperscale, according to the companies.

One megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes.

Frontier Carbon Solutions, which is partnering with the U.S. Department Energy and the University of Wyoming on a “large-scale” commercial carbon storage hub near Granger, will capture and permanently store the natural gas generator carbon emissions.

“We’re very excited to help bootstrap these [data center] projects with verified low-carbon natural gas,” PureWest CEO Christopher Valdez told WyoFile.

Though the project partners are not required by state or federal law to certify the natural gas as low carbon, or to capture and store the gas-fired generator emissions, Valdez said, it’s what data center customers demand. And PureWest wants to be a player in the market.

“It’s going to be tied to the requirements of the ultimate consumers — the clients of this data center,” he said. “It’s a demand pool, and it’s specific to our local markets.”

Other companies

Anschutz Corporation, whose subsidiary is building the $5 billion Chokecherry Sierra Madre wind energy project in Carbon County and the $3 billion TransWest Express transmission line to connect it the Southwest, quietly rolled out a tentative plan in April to also add 3,200 megawatts of gas-fired generation and a 1,000 megawatt solar generation facility, according to a filing with the state.

The Seminoe Generating Station and the Walcott Generating Station would power “one or two” data center clients, and could include “on-site carbon capture and storage,” according to company statements and information on Anschutz subsidiary Power Company of Wyoming’s website. All of the facilities would be located in Carbon County. So far, there are no formal data center partners to announce, a company spokesperson told WyoFile.

Sierra Club Wyoming Chapter Director Rob Joyce estimates the natural gas plant would be among the largest in the U.S., and his organization is concerned about greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants.

“We don’t have assurances that they’re actually going to capture [and store] the emissions like they’re saying,” Joyce told WyoFile. “I’m always skeptical about that kind of thing.”

Not all environmental groups are skeptical of this market-driven trend.

Jonah Energy, which also produces natural gas in the Pinedale Anticline in west-central Wyoming, was among the first in the state to gain a low-carbon verification for its natural gas. The Environmental Defense Fund has worked with Jonah and other oil and gas operators for years to support the installation of equipment and best practices that prevent leaks of methane — a potent greenhouse gas.

“Wyoming’s natural gas producers have a real opportunity to lead in a global market looking for lower-emissions energy,” EDF Regulatory and Legislative Manager John Rutecki told WyoFile via email. “If Wyoming wants to stay competitive in powering next-generation industries like data centers, those efforts must be backed by robust, transparent emissions measurement and verification and strong statewide standards.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/jonah-flare-200511747823224.jpg?h=707772c7&itok=MuWImmaf,N,,2025-05-21 23:01:08.800725

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) appears to be scaling back its once-bold electric vehicle (EV) ambitions, with recent developments pointing to a more cautious and cost-conscious strategy.

Sources familiar with the matter say Ford is expected to let Nissan use part of its Kentucky battery plant, which is a surprising move that reflects the company’s ongoing reassessment of its aggressive EV expansion strategy.

The facility, built as part of a $7 billion initiative announced in 2021 alongside South Korea’s SK On, was meant to be a cornerstone of Ford’s electric vehicle ambitions. But so far, only one of the two plants is partially operating, while the other sits idle. Now, the active site is likely to produce batteries not just for Ford, but also for Nissan, indicating a shift from exclusive internal use to a more open, revenue-generating model.

This change comes as Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) steps back from earlier EV plans. In early 2024, the company said it was rethinking its approach, including whether it still needed to make batteries in-house. It has already delayed or scaled back $12 billion in EV spending, citing rising costs, softening demand, and uncertainty over tariffs.

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)'s EV unit posted a $5 billion loss in 2024 and is bracing for another $5 billion hit this year. The company recently withdrew its full-year financial guidance, again pointing to concerns over tariffs as a key factor.

A Ford spokeswoman redirected questions regarding the Kentucky battery facility to its BlueOval SK joint venture. Meanwhile, a representative from the venture chose not to comment on the possibility of Nissan becoming a client.

Although Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) hasn’t officially confirmed Nissan’s involvement, the deal could work to both companies' advantage. For Nissan, using a U.S. plant helps reduce exposure to import tariffs and supply chain disruptions, at a time when it's also under pressure, having posted a $4.5 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025.

F has surged by nearly 9% in 2025 so far.

The fate of the clean energy tax credits is being hotly debated on Capitol Hill.
Other companies warn that thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs could disappear if Congress repealed the tax credits.
“Once all these tax credits started getting described as once-in-a-generation climate policy, that went a long ways toward turning Republicans away,” Mr. Trembath said.
Yet others say that the broader effect that the tax credits would have on emissions has been overstated.","When it passed in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was hailed by Democrats and environmentalists as the most important piece of climate legislation in American history.

But today, as House Republicans debate whether to repeal the hundreds of billions of dollars that the law provides for solar panels, electric vehicles and other technologies designed to fight global warming, supporters of the law rarely mention the planet.

Instead, the law’s defenders argue that the tax credits for battery factories or wind farms are creating manufacturing jobs around the country and will reduce electricity prices and help the United States to compete in an A.I. race against China.

It’s a sign of how quickly climate has faded from the national agenda under President Trump, who has dismissed the risks of global warming and has rooted out any mention of climate change among federal agencies.

“We’re no longer talking about the environment,” said Chad Farrell, the founder of Encore Renewable Energy, based in Vermont. “We’re talking dollars and cents.”

Mr. Farrell was among the solar industry leaders who met in Washington last week to lobby Congress to preserve many of the law’s clean energy provisions, saying they were essential for the U.S. economy.

The fate of the clean energy tax credits is being hotly debated on Capitol Hill. The most recent version of the House Republicans’ far-reaching domestic policy bill would quickly phase out the biggest incentives for technologies like electric vehicles, batteries, wind turbines, solar panels and nuclear reactors and restrict tax breaks for domestic manufacturing. Some conservative Republicans want to entirely repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.

On the other side, three dozen Republicans in the House and four in the Senate say they want to preserve at least some incentives, such as those for nuclear power or domestic manufacturing, to protect jobs and bolster U.S. energy security.

In their pitch to lawmakers, many renewable energy companies have cast their industries as essential for achieving national energy dominance, a goal repeatedly mentioned by Mr. Trump.

One common argument: America’s demand for electricity is soaring, driven by a boom in A.I. data centers, and it’s difficult to build enough gas-fired power plants to supply all the extra power that the nation needs. Adding more solar, wind and batteries could be the country’s best hope for averting energy shortages, since they are relatively quick to construct, proponents say.

“Maybe before it was tie-dye T-shirts and hugging trees, but today we are a mature energy sector and a critical part of energizing America,” said Constantino Nicolaou, the chief executive of PanelClaw, a solar company based in Massachusetts that supplies mounting systems for rooftop solar projects.

“Yes, we love the environment, but don’t look at us like the environmentalists,” Mr. Nicolaou said.

Other companies warn that thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs could disappear if Congress repealed the tax credits. Since the Inflation Reduction Act passed, businesses have announced more than $843 billion in clean energy investments, from wind farms in Wyoming to battery factories in Georgia. More than three-fourths of that spending is expected to occur in Republican-controlled districts.

On Monday, the solar association released a report estimating that 292,000 jobs and $220 billion in local investments might be lost if Congress ended the tax breaks for solar power, while warning of blackouts and higher electricity bills.

The report does not mention climate change. It’s a marked contrast with 2022, when the solar association released an analysis showing that additional solar deployment brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act would offset more than 655 million tons of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is driving global warming.

Even many environmental groups defending the law now sound like a green-tinged version of the Chamber of Commerce.

Repealing the tax credits “means higher gas and electricity costs for struggling families and businesses, tanking the U.S. manufacturing resurgence and ceding leadership to China,” said Sara Chieffo, the vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters.

Other companies, including makers of electric vehicles, are trying to persuade lawmakers that the United States could lose a technology race with China if the law were gutted.

“We can’t lose sight of the fact that the automotive industry is global, and consumers all over the world are increasingly preferring electric vehicles for a variety of reasons,” said Michael Tubman, director of federal affairs at Lucid Motors, a start-up manufacturing electric cars in Arizona. “The American auto industry is in fierce competition with foreign competitors, particularly Chinese automakers.”

The shift away from focusing on climate change is a throwback to an earlier era of clean energy politics, said Alex Trembath, the deputy director of the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental research organization.

For many years, subsidies for new energy technologies like wind, solar and nuclear power had broad bipartisan support and were often renewed under Republican presidents, in part because they were seen as essential to accelerate technological innovation and improve U.S. energy security.

That changed during the Biden administration, when Democrats made fighting climate change a top political priority and dramatically expanded the tax credits as part of a push to quickly pivot the U.S. economy away from fossil fuels.

“Once all these tax credits started getting described as once-in-a-generation climate policy, that went a long ways toward turning Republicans away,” Mr. Trembath said. But in the wake of Mr. Trump’s victory in the 2024 election, he has written, climate change looks less like a winning issue for Democrats.

Whether Republicans are swayed by the economic arguments for the Inflation Reduction Act remains to be seen. Conservative critics have pushed back hard, saying that clean energy subsidies could cost taxpayers trillions of dollars.

“The Inflation Reduction Act has ballooned into one of the biggest government boondoggles in history,” said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a conservative research group focused on energy. “That’s real money that could be returned to taxpayers, fueling private-sector innovation, job creation and consumer-driven growth instead of funneling taxpayer dollars into a narrow, government-directed vision of the economy.”

That could result in more planet-warming emissions. An analysis by the Rhodium Group, a research firm, found that repealing tax credits for electric cars, wind turbines and solar panels could lead to hundreds of millions of tons of extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere each year by 2035.

Yet others say that the broader effect that the tax credits would have on emissions has been overstated. That’s because many solar and wind projects across the country are currently being held up by delays in local permitting or regulations that make it difficult to build large transmission lines, blunting the law’s climate impact.

“There are a lot of reforms we could make that would have a much bigger impact on decarbonization than the I.R.A.,” said Devin Hartman, director of energy and environmental policy at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank. “In some ways the fight over subsidies has hijacked that conversation.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21cli-climate-muted-01-qlwb/21cli-climate-muted-01-qlwb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 15:10:38.683179

This is supported by over half (58%) of the businesses surveyed citing their own brand reputation and sustainability goals as the leading drivers in their energy transition, showing “net zero fluency” is far more weighted toward customer perception and demanded than it is a compliance priority. And, only 29% suggest regulatory pressure and government mandates was guiding their decision making.

“Fleets are focusing on their own net-zero goals as a part of their corporate reputation and long-term commercial strategies, rather than just seeing it as a compliance checkbox,” says Alain Samaha, CEO of Teletrac Navman. “Customers recognize the importance of sustainable operations, and according to our research, are making active decisions around the businesses they support based on their sustainability credentials.”

Key takeaways:

· 84% of fleets are focusing on operational improvements rather than considering new vehicle investments. Regular vehicle maintenance (49%), optimizing vehicle utilization (36%), and investing in driver training (28%) are some of the key areas of fleet investment cited by fleet businesses globally to ensure better handling of their existing vehicles on the road.

· Conversely, 61% of fleets are indeed making Capex investments by upgrading to more fuel-efficient vehicles (48%) or switching to those using alternative fuels (31%), indicating an important focus on the type of vehicle being utilized and a longer-term approach being considered by businesses when reviewing and planning for their carbon reporting and impacts.

The White House is pushing to hold the vote Wednesday, even as warring Republican factions negotiate last-minute tweaks and some members warn they cannot yet support it.

GOP leaders have made some progress winning over holdouts, but hard-line conservatives say the bill in its current form does not have the votes to pass. Republicans can only afford three defections on the floor, assuming all members are present and voting.

The bill extends tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017, delivers on campaign promises to end taxes on tips and overtime, and funds his defense and border priorities — while making cuts through reforms to Medicaid and nutrition assistance that Democrats warn will lead to millions of low-income Americans losing benefits.

More changes are expected to appease the holdouts, which have not yet been made public in legislative text. The House Rules Committee, which will approve those changes, passed the 12-hour mark in a marathon hearing shortly after 1 p.m. Wednesday afternoon.

Here are groups of Republicans to watch as leaders press forward.

House Freedom Caucus

Hard-line conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus are primarily pushing for bigger reforms to Medicaid and the acceleration of rolling back green energy tax incentives that Democrats had approved under the Biden administration.

This group consists of Chair Andy Harris (Md.) and Reps. Chip Roy (Texas), Ralph Norman (S.C.), Scott Perry (Pa.), Keith Self (Texas), Eric Burlison (Mo.), Clay Higgins (La.) and Michael Cloud (Texas).

There is agreement on moving up new Medicaid work requirements in the bill to start in December 2026 rather than in 2029, according to a White House official.

But Freedom Caucus members have been seeking more substantial cuts to Medicaid, with Roy pointing to Medicaid “money laundering” — a reference to the provider tax mechanism states use on health providers that allows them to extract larger matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.

“We got some work to do; hopefully we get this Medicaid stuff done today and land the plane,” Roy said on “The Charlie Kirk Show” Wednesday afternoon. “But it does need to change.”

Members of the group said they thought they had an agreement with the White House on changes on those measures overnight, but a White House official pushed back, saying the group received a menu of policy options the Trump administration would not oppose if they could garner enough support in the House to pass.

Freedom Caucus members and House GOP leaders are scheduled to meet at the White House at 3 p.m. Wednesday.

SALT Caucus Republicans

At the beginning of this week, moderate Republicans from high-tax blue states were among the most vocal — and dug in — holdouts to the Trump agenda bill, demanding a higher state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap.

Those members are Reps. Young Kim (Calif.), Nick LaLota (N.Y.), Mike Lawler (N.Y.), Tom Kean Jr. (N.J.), Andrew Garbarino (N.Y.) and Elise Stefanik (N.Y.).

Now, they appear to be on board.

SALT Caucus Republicans and Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) zeroed in on an agreement Tuesday night that would increase the deduction cap to $40,000 for individuals making $500,000 or less in income, while increasing the deduction cap and income limits by 1 percent a year over 10 years.

The proposed deduction cap is quadruple the $10,000 cap in current law, and it’s more than the $30,000 deduction cap for individuals making $400,000 or less that leadership put in the package — which SALT Caucus Republicans deemed a nonstarter.

Sources told The Hill that several SALT Caucus members are on board with the plan. The deal is contingent on Trump endorsing the manager’s amendment to make the changes in the bill; the Speaker holding the line if the Senate balks; and the SALT Caucus going on “tour” to convince Senate Republicans to support the deal if the Speaker requests it.

Moderates who like tax credits

Speeding up the bill’s phasing out of green energy tax incentives — as hard-line conservatives want — risks losing support from moderate Republicans and those in districts that have benefited from such incentives.

The bill as written phases out credits for solar, wind and nuclear projects that come online between 2029 and 2032. Projects that start producing energy in 2029 can get 80 percent of the credit while those that join the grid in 2031 can only get 40 percent.

But the Freedom Caucus’s Harris said Wednesday that “as much of the green new scam should be eliminated as possible.”

Moderates for months have warned leaders against peeling those tax credits, though they have been generally supportive.

Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) led a group of 25 Republicans in a letter earlier this month asking for nuclear incentives to be preserved, providing a clue as to the members whose votes could be at stake over such changes. Other signatories on that letter included Reps. Jen Kiggans (Va.), Russell Fry (S.C.), Bill Huizenga (Mich.), Jeff Van Drew (N.J.), Dan Meuser (Pa.) and David Valadao (Calif.).

Thomas Massie

The libertarian Kentucky congressman is often a caucus of one, unafraid to oppose his party’s legislation if it does not meet his principles for deficit reduction or reducing the size and scope of government.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) is expected to oppose the bill no matter what — a dynamic that drew Trump’s ire when he visited the Capitol on Tuesday.

“I don’t think Thomas Massie understands government,” Trump told reporters before the meeting. “I think he’s a grandstander, frankly. I think he should be voted out of office.”",https://fox5sandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/05/roychip_051825gn02_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-22 00:01:43.127804

On this week’s show, we are talking about the Republican effort to gut the Inflation Reduction Act. What their cuts will mean for emissions, what their proposed rewrite would mean for the clean energy economy, and why huge changes to the IRA could result in a huge increase in U.S. consumer power bills. It’s all coming up on SHIFT KEY after this.

[ad break]

Jesse Jenkins: Oh God, this sucks.

Meyer: And let’s start there. Hi, I’m Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap News.

Jenkins: And I’m Jesse Jenkins, a professor of Energy Systems Engineering at Princeton University.

Meyer: And you are listening to SHIFT KEY, Heatmap’s weekly podcast on decarbonization and the shift away from fossil fuels. On this week’s show, we are looking at what the House budget bill will mean for the energy transition, the U.S. energy economy, and the emissions profile. You know, last week, while we were recording SHIFT KEY, as you may have heard, House Ways and Means Committee released its first crack at the text for its big partisan reconciliation bill, the big piece of legislation that this Republican Congress wants to do that includes really taking a sledgehammer to a ton of parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. Since then, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted yes on that proposal. We are recording this on the afternoon of Monday, May 19th. Last night, the House Budget Committee also voted yes on the proposal.

So in the next few days, this House budget bill will move to the floor, and I should say we don’t know exactly what policies are going to be in it when it gets there, but today on this show, we want to give you some tools for thinking about what the options are — first of all, for the final bill. And second of all, what that will mean in the real world. What will that mean for the energy economy? And to do it, we have one of the best guests I can think of to help us do that, and that guest is my very own co-host, Jesse Jenkins.

So Jesse, as some of you may know, runs the REPEAT project at Princeton University, which does exactly this kind of rapid energy policy analysis that looks at what policies under consideration might mean for the energy economy. And he has, we have today, Jesse’s new and at the time we’re recording this, exclusive new findings on just the different set of options that could result from the House Republican bill, and that’s what we’re going to talk about today. So Jesse, welcome to SHIFT KEY.

Jenkins: It’s great to be back, Rob. So yeah, I’m excited and a bit terrified to share the results from this round of modeling from the REPEAT project, which, as Rob mentioned, we’ve been running since all the way back in 2021 as an effort to try to keep tabs on changes in federal energy and climate policy, and to use our energy system modeling tools to try to put a quantitative spin on what those changes might entail for the U.S. energy transition, for greenhouse gas emissions, for energy costs across the country, and those kinds of major salient points.

We did this, of course, all throughout the development of the Democrats’ budget bill, which became the Inflation Reduction Act in 2021 and 2022, assessed also the impacts of federal regulations that were completed over time by the Biden administration before the end of Biden’s term. And now, of course, we’re looking at what happens if and when the Trump administration and the congressional Republicans start to dismantle that existing policy framework that was established as of the end of last year.

Meyer: So I think maybe the best place to start is the way this works, right? The way that modeling like this works is you look at a number of scenarios, look at a number of assessments of what could happen. And I want to get into those assessments in a second. But first I want to ask, on the whole, we may not know exactly what House Republicans are going to do and what Republicans in Congress are going to do especially, but, like, when you look at the set of possibilities encapsulated by the Republican bill, what does this mean for the energy system and for the climate? Is it good?

Jenkins: Uh, no, it is not good. And I wish I had some silver linings to pull out here, but they are non-existent — or few and far between, if there are any we can find. Dismantling the current policy trajectory would result in a substantial increase in greenhouse gas emissions, on the order of half a gigaton, 500 million tons, by 2030, rising to over a billion metric tons, or a gigaton by 2035.

And at the same time it would, of course, slow the energy transition. So less deployment of clean electricity technologies, a slower uptake of electric vehicles, and other impacts across the economy. And all that also translates to higher energy costs for Americans, for households, for businesses as we do two things. One is we remove tax credits and subsidies that are currently lowering the cost of investing in all of this new infrastructure, whether it’s new power generation or storage or new vehicles for fleets or households.

So those subsidies shift some costs out of household and business budgets right onto the federal tax code. And by slowing down measures like energy efficiency, electrification, EVs, measures that reduce fossil energy consumption, we’re also likely to see fossil fuel prices go up as demand rises. So relative to a world where we’re reducing demand for these fuels, if we slow down that process and we consume more fossil fuels overall, that’s also going to translate through the law of supply and demand into higher costs for Americans.

So that’s, I think, the top line: Higher emissions, slow down — although not halt — the energy transition, and higher energy costs for most Americans and for our businesses around the country. It’s not quite our frozen policy scenario from the beginning of January, 2021. But not surprisingly, a scenario where we dismantle the entirety of the Biden-era policy apparatus does revert us pretty close to where we would be if those laws had not passed. Not entirely. There’s some momentum that will continue. But a full repeal scenario, which is maybe where the House is trending, would mean that we’re going to see half-a-gigaton-scale increase in emissions from our current trajectory in 2030, and about a gigaton or more in 2035.

Meyer: I realize that there’s a tendency for numbers, especially gigatons, these numbers attached to giant units, to slide by and kind of be like, Oh, that’s a number. But that is staggering. U.S. energy emissions are about five gigatons. I think global energy emissions are 38 gigatons …

Jenkins: Yeah, close to 40. Exactly.

Meyer: This is a sizable increase compared to baseline in carbon emissions.

Jenkins: I mean, yeah, it is huge. It leaves us pretty comparable to current emissions levels in 2035, if we see a full repeal of all of the regulations and tax credits and spending that are on the books now. Emissions actually go up in the near term as demand growth per electricity exceeds our ability to add new renewables in a repeal scenario. And so there’s an increase in the near term in emissions that actually takes us back towards 2022 levels, and then a slow decline at a similar trajectory that we saw really in the pre-Inflation Reduction Act, which is less than 1% per year decline in U.S. emissions.

In contrast, if we stayed on the current policy trajectory, we would close about half of the distance between that benchmark, the repeal scenario, and where we would want to be if we’re on track to net zero greenhouse gas emissions, which would be even deeper reductions than we’re currently on track for. So if you’re concerned about climate change, we should be accelerating, not decelerating, the transition, and this bill is slamming on the brakes.

Meyer: So you’ve referenced a few times, the way that you conduct this study, right, is you look at a number of scenarios. And so can you give us a sense, what scenarios did you look at to try to just begin to get a handle on what these different policies could do? And based off the text that’s out there, the Republican proposal that’s out there, which scenario are we closest to?

Jenkins: Yeah. So we have a continued policy scenario that assumes continuation of the full suite of policies in place at the beginning of January, 2025, legislative and executive. So the full suite of measures implemented by the Biden administration and the Democratic Congress through the infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Then we have an executive-repeal-only scenario, and so that scenario contemplates the Trump administration repealing all of the EPA greenhouse gas emissions regulations — that’s on power, on transportation, and on oil and gas methane pollution, as well as DOE efficiency standards and Department of Transportation fuel economy standards, and rescinding all unspent grant funding at the executive agencies.

And of course, we’ve seen those types of actions already from the Trump administration. They’ve not completed the rescission of those rules because it takes a bit of time to work through the administrative process of repealing existing regulation, but they have made very clear their intention to roll back all of those regulatory policies as soon as they’re able to. And they, as we’ve talked about in the past on the show, are going far beyond what we expected in terms of trying to block spending of not just unobligated funds that hadn’t been awarded to recipients yet, but even grant funding that’s going out to recipients under existing contracts. They’re also doing everything they can to roll that money back. So I’d say that scenario is our current path. We’re on the executive-repeal-only scenario.

And then the remaining question is, what happens in the legislature? What happens in the House and Senate as they craft this budget bill — that was our subject last week — that may, or is likely to, further repeal incentives for clean electricity, for electric vehicles, for energy efficiency, for nuclear power, for hydrogen, et cetera. All of the measures on the tax code to support the energy transition and support the development of a cleaner energy infrastructure — all those could be repealed as well.

And so we also have a full repeal scenario, which would basically include the end of all tax credits established by the IRA at the end of this calendar year. So beginning, you know, January 1, 2026 — no more credits. And unfortunately, it looks like that might be the direction we’re trending in the House bill, as well.

Meyer: That feels like the one we’re moving close to.

Jenkins: Yeah, so we didn’t model exactly every piece of detail in the House bill. We haven’t done that yet. We will, once the House passes something final. If it’s necessary, it may look exactly like the repeal scenario. We’ll see. We saw in the draft we discussed last week that there were a few credits that had a few more years of life in them, but the details are important. The clean electricity tax credits, for example, under the House Ways and Means Committee bill that passed out of committee on Sunday, does allow a few more years of deployment of carbon-free electricity technologies through 2028. If they’re placed in service by 2028, they could still claim the clean electricity tax credit, so that is a little bit better than the full repeal scenario we look at.

But we’ve also heard from Representative Chip Roy, who led efforts to block the budget committee vote over the weekend, that in order to extract further reductions in spending, that we can expect further reductions in the subsidies for clean electricity, thanks to his and his conservative budget hawk caucus efforts to further constrain spending in the House bill.

Meyer: Yeah,and I was going to say, I don’t want to delve into … There’s a lot of tea leaf reading you can do right now, especially around the gap between what House Freedom Caucus members say that they want out of this bill and what House IRA Caucus folks say they want out of this bill. And the gap has only grown. Especially the gap between that and then what senators say they will accept, all of which has contributed to a very confusing information environment.

Jenkins: Bottom line, full repeal is awfully darn close to what the House is trying to do.

Meyer: Exactly. I think we’re so much closer to a full repeal than people would have been willing to bet earlier this year.

Jenkins: Yeah, it’s a lot worse than I expected it to be, because I of course, posited that the economic constituencies out there that are benefiting from these current policies would be more effective at mounting an opposition. And at least at this point in the House side, that doesn’t seem to be the case. You know, just contrast the way that the budget hawks were willing to basically say, “We’re going to hold this bill hostage if we don’t get our way.”

Well, look, they got their way, whereas the House Republicans who have spoken up in the past in public in support of a more tapered or surgical approach to amending the clean electricity credits and others. You know, they wrote a nice letter to the Speaker saying, “Pretty please. We’d like you to do this, if you don’t mind.” But when push comes to shove, none of them seem to be willing to stand up and demand the changes they want to see.

It would only take four of them, or six of them, right? Only take a small cadre of that 21 to be willing to say, “Look, this is really bad for my constituents, and I don’t want to see it. Can we strip this stuff out and work on a bill that we can all support?” But they’re not willing to go to bat at that level, given the challenging politics they face within their own party and the backlash they’re likely to face from President Trump and whatever else that’s just keeping them afraid to actually stick their necks out here.

Meyer: Let’s get into some of the sector-by-sector findings. I think the biggest one, in terms of where we see the biggest emission cuts from the Inflation Reduction Act, is in the power sector. It’s where we have these big, powerful, tech-neutral tax credits that in the law as written and in the law as enacted, are meant to stay on the books for a really long time. They’re meant to stay on the books basically until we decarbonize the power sector, and certainly for decades. That changes in the House Republican proposal — under the best version of the proposal that we have right now, there are rumored worse versions out there, but in the version of the text we have, these tax credits start phasing out in 2029 and they’re gone entirely by the early 2030s.

In your assessment, what does it do to the emissions impact of the electricity sector? And then what does it do in terms of even just what kind of resources are generating electricity for us?

Jenkins: Yeah. So there’s two really big wedges that we see in our modeling scenarios that are differences from repeal efforts. The first is the executive action to repeal the EPA power plant regulations, which have no impact through 2030 because they have very little impact in the early years, because they don’t come into effect until the early 2030s. But by 2035, they have a substantial impact on the power sector, effectively eliminating coal from the portfolio, and further constraining the role of natural gas — although in some weird ways, that actually drive more gas capacity on the grid, even though the power plants are used less because of restrictions on how often the new capacity can run.

That is a big factor. In 2035, that’s the biggest single policy change probably we see in terms of moving the emissions needle, is repeal of the 111(d) standards. Those increase emissions in 2035 by just shy of half a gigaton. But then it all compounds with the repeal of the clean electricity or tech-neutral tax credits, which add another 300 or so million metric tons of emissions by 2035, with a growing impact from 2028 on. So it does start to bite even in 2030 with about 100 million tons more emissions then — this is all round numbers — but growing to something like 300 million tons, even on top of the EPA repeal. So those two together are the biggest chunk of the emissions increase, but there are some other substantial ones in the mix as well.

Meyer: You mentioned this earlier, but I thought one of the most interesting findings in your report was that in almost any scenario, emissions from the power sector actually, and emissions across the economy, increase slightly over the next few years. And I think that’s all driven by stuff in the power sector. Why is that happening, number one? And number two, what happens — let’s say just between now and 2028, or between now and 2030 — in the power sector, in these different scenarios?

Jenkins: So in the near term, we basically, and this is the longer term story indeed, is that we are, we have a race in the power sector between growing demand for electricity and growing shares of clean electricity. If you look at what’s getting built in the United States, it is mostly wind, solar, and batteries. That’s the vast majority of the capacity that’s come online over the last couple of years, and it’s also the vast majority of what is expected to come online over the next couple of years. But because of, particularly, delays and challenges in interconnecting wind power, we’re seeing deployment rates for wind really lag quite substantially. Even the record rates that we’ve seen in the U.S. in the past, where we built about 15 gigawatts of wind per year in 2020, 2021.

Right now we’re running at seven or eight gigawatts a year of deployment, and under continued policies, we expect that to accelerate back towards and beyond that record rate over time. But it’s constrained by our ability to interconnect wind resources to the grid, to get them permitted, to expand transmission into the areas where we need to tap the best wind resources. And in a full repeal scenario, that pace just never hits the accelerator. So it continues to bump along at a few gigawatts per year.

Solar, under a current policy scenario, does grow quite substantially, continuing to set new record growth rates, as we’ve seen each year over the last several years. Solar is a lot easier to cite, faster to complete projects, less dependent on existing grid infrastructure or expansion of existing grid infrastructure to connect. And so we see in a continued policies case that eventually that pace of growth from solar and wind outpaces the increase in demand for electricity. But it doesn’t do so in the full repeal scenario. We do still see a bit more wind and solar built in 2025, 2026, but then the pace collapses, and the growth of demand swamps the additions of new supply.

And so what that means is the power sector leans more in the near term on coal, existing coal fired power plants, than we would otherwise see. And, of course, coal is highly emissions-intensive, and so not even, not very large changes in the amount of coal in the energy mix have a huge impact on our total emissions.

Meyer: Did you see this study that came out over the weekend that was like, recessions, which have previously been thought to have this big public mortality effect, now seem to be life expectancy-improving on the margin, entirely accounted for by the air pollution effects?

Jenkins: I didn’t see that!

Meyer: Fewer people drive and there’s less power use during recessions, and that makes air pollution go down, and that means actually people live longer, even though there’s a lot of public health impacts from the economic effects of recessions, which are unemployment and underemployment.

Jenkins: I mean, I think as Americans, we just routinely underestimate the continued mortality and morbidity impacts, public health impacts, of air pollution in the country. Yes, it’s gotten way better than it was in the past, thanks to regulations like the ones the Trump administration is currently trying to undo. But it’s still bad, particularly in the most heavily populated parts of the country, whether that’s Southern California or where I live here in New Jersey. So yeah, where you got a lot of people driving around and burning power, turns out to be not so good for our health, and there’s a lot more progress we could make on that front if we could accelerate the growth of clean electricity.

Meyer: So one argument that I’ve heard from more IRA-skeptical folks is that if we’re building so much solar and batteries especially, if wind and solar and batteries are the easiest technologies to add to the grid right now, why should we be spending money to subsidize them, given that they seem to be winning on their own as is? Why is that important, either from an economic standpoint, and also, why is it a good use of public funds?

Jenkins: Yeah, it’s a great question. And I should be clear, we do see continued deployment of wind and solar, even in a policy repeal scenario, and storage as well, just at a much slower pace. There are parts of the country where wind and solar are subsidy-independent, where they can just beat out natural gas plants and existing coal on the margins, on economics alone. But that is a restricted portion of the country, and if we want to be able to deploy these American energy resources broadly, all across the country, then we need to do something to value the contributions they’re making to the country. That includes clean air, that includes emissions reductions, that includes lower energy costs, and our ability to keep up with rapid demand growth. It includes economic benefits in a wide range of districts, from employment and local tax revenue and spending.

We have historically subsidized lots of energy technologies. We continue to offer long term subsidies for oil and gas production, lower per unit rates than we provide for wind and solar, but large in aggregate. The question is, do you want to taper these things out over time? That could make sense, but ending them precipitously, especially after they were just extended, it’s a whipsaw kind of effect, right? Any large changes in policy are bad for business, because it means projects that looked like they were going to move forward because of the current policy environment — thought they had visibility to be completed, to get financing, to line up long lead time items, et cetera — are going to have the rug pulled out from them.

So this is where this kind of discussion about where exactly the House and/or Senate bills land in terms of phase-out of these credits, I think is really important. Maybe they don’t need to run ’till 2040 but if you don’t, if you sunset them very rapidly — say by the end of this year — then there’s lots of projects that are already pretty well under development that will no longer be able to claim those credits and may no longer be financially solvent. That creates stranded costs on costs, and projects that get scrapped, companies that go bankrupt, lay people off, et cetera. And so the smoother way to do that would be to have some longer-term runway in which projects can commence construction and lock in the kind of tax credit that they’re eligible for, and move to completion, even as you step down the level over time. That’s where I thought they were headed, but it looks like they may be headed in the opposite direction under the current House discussion.

Meyer: Let’s finish up with a few more sectors. So in transportation, it looks like your results for all scenarios, there’s a reduction in emissions, but the size of that reduction changes a lot based on which policies we happen to follow. What stuck out to you there?

Jenkins: Yeah, that’s right, and we should remember that U.S. transportation emissions peaked a long time ago, and they have been falling since, I think, around 2006, which is when U.S. emissions as a whole peaked, actually. And that’s because of an increase in fuel efficiency over time, right? That increase in energy efficiency in the transportation sector has been enough to offset the growth in vehicle-miles-traveled that we’re seeing across both personal vehicles and freight on private vehicles.

That trend continues under current policies, we see continued growth of hybrid electric vehicles, for example, which are on quite a tear lately, as increasing their market share. And we see continued growth of electric vehicles, because they are still attractive vehicles for many consumers out there across the country, and increasingly more so as their costs fall. But just like in the power sector, that pace drops dramatically, and so we basically see about a 40% reduction in annual sales of electric vehicles by 2030. Cumulatively between now and 2030, it’s something like 8 million less electric vehicles on the roads of the United States, and that does have a measurable impact on total gasoline consumption and therefore emissions and energy costs.

It’s, in some ways, it’s sort of wild. It’s kind of a backdoor gas tax. You know, if you remove these incentives to improve the efficiency of the U.S. fleet and to electrify the U.S. fleet and shift away from gasoline and diesel fuel, you’re going to see a much higher demand for gasoline and diesel, and higher demand translates to higher prices at the pump. You wouldn’t see House Republicans caught dead voting for a gas tax, right? But actually, by removing these subsidies for electric vehicles, that’s effectively what they’re doing to everybody else. By increasing the total consumption of gasoline quite substantially, we’re going to be paying higher prices at the pump across the country.

Meyer: In a world where we’re selling 8 million fewer EVs, what does that do to the EV factories and battery factories and critical mineral supply chains that are being supposedly built all around the country at this moment? And that also supposedly at least on the critical mineral side, the Trump administration is quite keen to expand?

Jenkins: It’s decimating for that whole effort to build out a U.S. battery supply chain. I mean, we are seeing right now a huge amount of investment in projects that are not yet complete to manufacture batteries, to build battery components, upstream projects like mines and processing of critical minerals and components for batteries and, of course, final vehicle assembly. We find that if we look upstream, the current pipeline of both electric vehicle assembly and battery manufacturing capacity is pretty on track to meet where demand would be if we didn’t repeal these scenarios, these policies.

Meyer: So we’ve invested for a non-repeal.

Jenkins: Yeah, the market was anticipating a continuation of policies. It started developing manufacturing plants and making investments and planning investments in accordance to that. If we repeal the tax credits for EVs immediately, or by 2030 even, what we’re doing is making those vehicles more expensive. That means they’re going to sell less of them. If they sell less of them, they of course need to manufacture and assemble less vehicles. And then that permeates all the way up the supply chain, which means less demand for vehicles, for batteries and for critical minerals and for components as well.

And so what we find is that if we do see that contraction in demand for electric vehicles, about 40%, even if the U.S. maintains the same market share as it does today, in terms of assembly of cells and vehicles, that would basically render most all of the planned capacity additions in vehicle assembly redundant. We have enough already under construction, with a couple more, that we would not need any additional capacity. It’s even worse on the battery side, we would have more than enough capacity from projects that are complete by the end of this year to meet the expected demand in that scenario.

And there’s reason to believe that that market share, that U.S. market share, won’t remain the same. It’s likely to fall as well, because the 30D tax credit, that’s the personal vehicle tax credit, is part of an overall strategy to basically onshore and friendshore this supply chain. And so it has a set of requirements that to get the full vehicle subsidy, you have to source, you have to assemble the vehicle in North America, you have to source battery components and assemble those in North America, and the materials that go into them have to come from North America or from our former Free Trade Agreement partners.

So that was sort of the demand side pull that was driving a lot of incentives to produce these in the U.S. There’s also a direct subsidy, 45X, that’s also on the chopping block in the House bill, that was directly subsidizing battery manufacturing in the U.S. And those two together have driven the battery boom that we’re seeing right now, which, by the way, is massive in Georgia and North Carolina and South Carolina and Tennessee and Kentucky and a number of other Republican states.

If you remove either one of those, the supply-side push from 45X, the advanced manufacturing subsidy, or this sort of demand pull that you get from 30D, it’s likely that U.S. market share would fall. And in that case, we’re going to see not only all currently unfinished projects be redundant, likely scrapped, but we’re also going to see, we would have a large amount of over-capacity already operating, and that means that factories would be idled or have to be repurposed to build internal combustion cars. Investments that were just made in new product lines and new assembly lines and robotics and everything else would be wasted. It would really be quite disastrous for the battery boom.

So yeah, I guess I should have put that in my top-line. In addition to increasing energy costs and emissions, it will decimate the U.S. battery manufacturing sector, which is just starting to explode across the country, in mostly Republican districts.

Meyer: How sensitive are your models to oil prices? Because I think one thing we’ve seen in other models is like, well, there’s actually a lot of year-to-year variation in what emissions do based on how high fuel prices get. Like, when you look at your scenarios, is there a way that, say, maybe the parts of the IRA stay on the books, but fuel gets cheaper? Or parts of the IRA go off the books, but fuel gets really expensive? What’s the relationship between fuel prices and emissions in your model?

Jenkins: No, that’s a great question. I should say that’s an area where our particular suite of models is not the strongest. That’s one of our limitations, is that we don’t include a general equilibrium market effect for fuel prices as a function of demand. And so when we calculate, for example, the increase in energy expenditures that we see under repeal, that doesn’t account for a further increase you would see from increased gasoline prices and natural gas prices.

So that is something that the Rhodium Group, who uses the NEMS model — that’s the same model that the U.S. Energy Information Administration uses — and is much better designed to capture these oil and gas supply chain dynamics, I’d say much less well designed to capture electricity sector transition dynamics, which is why we don’t use it. But it is good, in particular at this, which is capturing oil and gas supply chain impacts. What they find is that under a full repeal scenario, by 2035, it would amount to a 1% to 5% increase in retail motor gasoline prices across the country. So that’s like a $0.05 to $0.15 per gallon increase in the cost of gasoline. So it’s like a gas tax of $0.05 to $0.15, right? You get pollution and less exports of oil. Yeah, not great.

And I can’t imagine Chip Roy, again, or his friends voting for a $0.15 gas tax, but that’s effectively what it would do. We would also see an increase in the cost of natural gas by about 2% to 7% in their estimates that natural gas cost drives up the cost of industrial energy expenditures by on the order of $10 billion per year. So it’s making our businesses less competitive, our industries in the global landscape. It would increase industrial electricity rates by 7% to 12% in 2035 and of course, it would also increase our household costs as well. Our estimates from REPEAT Project, even without accounting for that bump in prices, just the fact that we’re shifting costs off of the tax base and back onto household energy budgets, and that we’re going to see more consumption of fuel overall because of less EVs and less heat pumps and less energy efficiency, et cetera, we estimate that total annual expenditures on energy across the U.S. go up by $25 billion In 2030 and by over $50 billion in 2035.

So you’re right, though, to point out that while there is this increase in household costs and reduced competitiveness of American industries and higher cost of gasoline, all that might have a countervailing impact on emissions. That means, all else equal, just considering that change alone, EVs are slightly more attractive when gasoline costs 15 cents more, I just don’t think that’s likely to be as salient to consumers as losing a $7,500 tax credit, which drops the cost of a new vehicle by 25%, or drops the cost of a lease almost in half, because of the way that the tax credits enter into leases.

Meyer: Totally. Though I do feel like one thing we still really don’t understand in the current car and oil market together as linked, is how much if we were to see a 2007 or 2006 oil price surge, which doesn’t seem to be in the cards at this particular moment, but I guess could be if enough supply got lost, and whatever. How much there’s, like, now a ceiling on oil, because consumers can just be like, “Well, screw OPEC, you know, I’m gonna go buy an EV!”

Jenkins: Yeah, that’s true, although it is a slow impact on total consumption, because vehicle turnover is small, like, we only sell, what, 15 million vehicles a year, and we have a fleet of 300 million. And so it does take time for these impacts to mount. That’s why we don’t see any substantial impacts on energy prices in, say, 2026 or 2027, it mounts over time as those 8 million additional EVs that would otherwise have been on the road by 2035 are not there, or by 2030 are not there. So it’s these cumulative impacts over time that will help constrain energy costs.

For an individual household, you can opt out of oil whenever you want. That’s good. So you know, if oil prices go up and you want to say, “I’m done paying at the pump, I’m going to go buy an EV,” that helps you. But in terms of the overall economy, it’s not as quick a transition as we’d like, which is why having long term policy certainty and driving this transition over time would probably be a good idea.

We talked about this a bit with Ellen Hughes-Cromwick when she was on to talk about the impacts of tariffs on the automotive sector. She’s the former chief economist at Ford Motor Company and a Department of Commerce official. She noted that the future of the automotive sector is electric, whether you like it or not. Whether you’re MAGA or not! And the reason we can say that with confidence is that you already look in the U.S. market at what’s growing in terms of vehicle segments, and what’s shrinking. What’s shrinking is conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, and what’s growing are hybrids, plug-in hybrids and EVs.

Beyond that, if the future of automotive is autonomous vehicles, which anybody who’s ridden a Waymo in San Francisco recently, of which Rob and I are both part — we should have an episode on this. So there’s a reason that all of those Waymos are running on Jaguar EVs, not because they’re Jaguars, but because they’re EVs. You can’t have the kind of sensors and compute power that you need onboard a fully autonomous vehicle without an electric vehicle platform.

There’s a reason that Ford launched its BlueCruise, hands-off, hands-free driving that I have in my Mustang Mach-E, for the Mustang Mach-E, in the Ford F-150 Lightning first, because they have the power onboard to power these devices. So if you think long-term about the future of the sector, and you think the two big growth trends globally, right, are electrification and autonomous vehicles, and that those two go hand in hand, because even if you don’t care about the electrification part from an emissions perspective, or oil reduction, or whatever, you just like the autonomous vehicle part, you need electric vehicles.

And you start to see why the current industrial policy that we have in place to support this transition for our automakers is so important to their future. You rip all that away, and we could very well be left with a set of failing automakers who are able to produce large SUVs and trucks that run on internal combustion engines the way they always have, and therefore have a shrinking share of a North America or U.S.-only market at their disposal, having seeded all of the growth markets around the world and their ability to keep up in autonomous vehicles. And that’s just, like, disastrous right? To see that kind of outcome.

So I just, what I hate about this whole debate is how it’s all about “owning the libs,” right, and unwinding any of Biden’s achievements, right? And all that ends up doing is seeding all of these industries to others. You want to own the libs? Great, well, now we just lost nuclear power, we lost EVs, we lost autonomous vehicles, and we’ll probably lose AI too, because we can’t keep up with the demand growth.

Meyer: Well, but it’s incoherent. I mean, this is what’s kind of flummoxing me, is that the day one Donald Trump executive order declared the lack of energy resources in the country, specifically the lack of electricity, but also the lack of critical mineral capacity, to be national emergencies. And we see a huge focus from the Trump administration, at least so far, in trying to shore up critical mineral resources. Now, has that been unified with their trade policy? No, not at all. But they talk about the importance of critical minerals, and how improving and increasing critical mineral extraction and refining is so crucial to the long-term wellbeing of the country.

There’s three industries that produce downstream demand for critical minerals, right? They’re EVs, they’re wind turbines — because you need the magnets for rare earths in the wind turbines — and they’re electronics, consumer electronics. Well, they’re destroying the EV industry. They’re really obliterating the wind industry. They want nothing to do with the wind industry. One thing we see in the House Ways and Means proposal is that they phase out the subsidies for producing wind equipment way earlier than they phase out anything else.

Jenkins: Right, almost immediately.

Meyer: Almost immediately! And then there is basically no serious interest in developing a downstream consumer electronics market. I mean, we have the CHIPS Act, right, but there’s no—

Jenkins: Well, the tariffs! The tariffs are going to bring it all back, Rob.

Meyer: We’ve already relented on tariffs. And even with the tariffs set at 164%, even then, it seemed like we were unlikely to fully decouple from the Chinese electronic manufacturing industry. And also, by the way, you produce a rival to the Chinese electronic manufacturing industry. Number one, it would be unlikely to happen here. But number two, if you wanted to do it here, you pursue a set of policies meant to create an American Shenzhen in like Houston or something. You wouldn’t do it through tariffs and minerals — it’s a bizarre way to do it. Anyway, and you’d need more workers, but not gonna get into that.

So it’s just this bizarre, incoherent policy, right, of like, “We want critical minerals. We need critical minerals. Biden was failing the country by ignoring critical minerals,” while destroying any place where demand for those minerals would come from in the economy, which means there’s no economic impetus to produce them in the first place! But anyway, I repeat myself. There’s one more place I want to talk about, which is when you look at the, in your modeling about what IRA repeal would look like, it looks like a lot of the emissions impacts are coming from, let’s say, like a category that’s neither power nor transportation. It’s buildings, but it’s also kind of a wild card.

It seems like a huge amount of emissions increases, or at least a lack of emissions reductions, comes from the non-CO2 greenhouse gas category. So like, what’s driving the rest of the increase or lack of decrease that we’re seeing here?

Jenkins: Yeah, that big shift is from the repeal of the EPA methane regulations on oil and gas. This was a huge low-hanging fruit for cost effective emissions reductions. Methane, as I’m sure most of our listeners know, is a very potent greenhouse gas. It causes a lot more warming, pound for pound, than CO2, even though it lives in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time, so it has a more immediate impact on temperatures. But you know—

Meyer: Most of the warming we’re seeing right now is from methane, I believe.

Jenkins: Right, because of its immediate impact, exactly. And so we leak a lot of methane from across the oil and gas supply chain, a lot more than we need to, using best practices and cost-effective techniques that are already available to the industry. The large players in the oil and gas industry supported the EPA methane regulations and the fee that the Inflation Reduction Act established on methane pollution from the oil and gas sector. So there’s this one-two combo of a fee on, or really a carbon fee, a methane fee on emissions in the oil and gas supply chain, and a set of regulations that would require their reductions. There were some grant funding as well for those who wanted to access it to tackle emissions. So the major players in the sector were perfectly happy with this. They saw it as very cost-effective. When you avoid leaking methane, you have more methane, a.k.a. natural gas, to sell to the market. So it’s very cost-effective and very achievable. And again, just because it happened under Biden and regulation equals bad under any context, they’re moving to repeal both the methane fee and the EPA regulations. Ballpark, that leads to an increase of about 100 million metric tons of emissions of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in 2030 and about 70 million tons in 2035.

So that’s a big chunk, right? 100 million tons is, you know, in a 5000 ton, or 5 billion ton total, is a lot. There are also impacts in industry and residential sectors from reduced energy efficiency and in industry from reductions in carbon capture and hydrogen deployment, which would just again be totally decimated by these repeals. It’s unlikely we’d see any deployment in those sectors if those credits phase out soon.

Meyer: One thing that’s interesting to me about your results is that electricity demand under your modeling, if I’m reading the charts right, and at the time I’m reading this, there’s no report yet. There’s only the charts. And so—

Jenkins: Your graph comprehension skills are being put to the test.

Meyer: I know, exactly. One thing that stuck out to me is that in the scenario where the IRA stays on the books, in 2035, electricity demand is higher than it would be if repeal happens, but electricity costs are lower. And that’s because the IRA works to both increase demand for electricity via electrification of home appliances and electrification of transportation, while at the same time working to get more electricity supply on the market via the tech-neutral tax credits, winds and solar, batteries, et cetera, et cetera.

And so in 2035, in a world where you repeal the IRA, there’s this kind of counterintuitive combination of the U.S. power grid is both smaller, it’s delivering less electricity, and—

Jenkins: It’s bigger than it is today.

Meyer: It’s smaller than it is in the counterfactual, and electricity is also more expensive. It’s a real testament, I think, to the importance of policy that works to increase supply as much as possible in order to lower costs across the economy, which is what the IRA does.

Jenkins: Yeah. I mean, we are sitting here at this moment where we’re coming out of a period of flat demand for electricity, right? It’s been basically stagnant since 2005. Into a period of accelerating growth. In our scenario, or scenarios, including even the repeal side, we’re seeing demand growing at a sustained rate of over 2.5% per year, and under current policies, it could be as high as 3.7% per year. We haven’t seen rates like that since the 1970s or 60s. That’s enough to grow electricity demand anywhere from about a third to half again, current levels by 2035. So the growth is coming, and it’s coming whether or not the IRA credits persist.

What the current policy environment is trying to do, as you said, is to try to rapidly expand our supply of electricity. And the fastest way to do that, the best way to do that under current environments, is with wind, solar and batteries. They’re, you know, again, 98% of what is in the queue, or what’s been built recently. We will add some new gas capacity, I’m sure, to keep up with some of that demand growth. But as your reporting has shown, Rob, there’s just a limit to the amount of new gas turbines that the OEMs are willing to build, and it is not at all sufficient to keep up with demand growth.

So in a world where we do anything to impede the growth of renewables and storage, which is exactly what completely blowing up the current tax credit environment would do, we’re going to simply see demand growth start to outstrip supply increases. And anytime that happens, energy costs go up along with emissions, because we’re going to be reliant. The only slack we have then in the system is to lean into existing power plants that are underutilized. That mostly means coal-fired power plants that are currently not being used much and will ramp back up to fill the slack. So, higher emissions, higher prices for everyone, and less ability to power data center demand growth and everything else that’s coming.

Meyer: One thing that sticks out to me is that in 2022 when the IRA was passed, and you can correct me here, but my memory is that we didn’t foresee this bulge in electricity demand growth coming.

Jenkins: Well, we didn’t foresee the data center part of the story, which is big. I mean, we’ve successively updated our REPEAT analyses over the last couple of years to try to factor in the latest estimates, which, of course, have a nice error bar around them as well, of data center demand growth. We did have a large growth in electricity demand just due to electrification already, when we were modeling the IRA’s impacts in 2022. But since 2022 what we’ve seen is an accelerated growth in manufacturing. A lot of the Battery Belt stuff we talked about, right? All those are tens of megawatt-scale electricity consumers for the most part. And we now have all these tens to hundreds of megawatts, even gigawatt-scale data centers, popping up across the country.

So that adds in another one percentage point a year, or something like that, of growth on top of what was already a 2% to 3% per year story, just from electrification. And just to put things into scale, it is important to note that while data centers are big, our estimates on the order of 250 to 400 terawatt hours, or billion kilowatt hours of additional consumption per year in 2030 and 2035, so 250 billion kilowatt hours in 2030, 400, say, in round numbers in 2035. Electric vehicle growth combined, both medium and heavy and light-duty vehicles, are likely to be 400 to 500 terawatt hours, or billion kilowatt hours in 2035. So on the same order of magnitude as data centers, and that’s including in the repeal scenario, right, where we see a slower but still real increase in the amount of electric vehicles on U.S. roads.

Meyer: Well, I guess this is my question, though, in some ways, the IRA seems very well-timed in retrospect. Sometimes you look back at a law and you’re like, you know, at the time that law was passed, the economy was already kind of, through some automatic process that we don’t really understand, like, dealing with the issue, or the global economy was reshuffling in a way that was becoming less of an issue. The IRA was the opposite of that. It was actually really well-timed and anticipated in a way that I don’t think even the bill authors realized necessarily at the time. The coming surge in electricity demand, especially from data centers. And so it was discussed as a climate bill and an economic development bill, but it has really become essential to the AI story. It’s in some ways a more important law now than it was when it was passed. And I think people might be overlooking that. I do wonder, you know—

Jenkins: I think they are overlooking that, and who needs to go in and tell them that right now and help them understand that, are all of the data center and AI companies. They know better than anybody that the ability to add new electricity supply and connect to the grid fast enough is part of the story of their ability to compete in a global race to develop and shape and ultimately control this next generation of technology.

Oh, look at China, where there is absolutely no constraint on their ability to add renewables at the pace needed, right? And if we are in an environment where we’re slowing down our pace of electricity demand growth, it will absolutely impede our competitiveness in the AI race. And I think that’s a message that policymakers on the Hill need to hear very quickly, or they’re about to make a very counterproductive intervention in the market.

Meyer: Yeah. I mean, I had one more question here, which is, let’s say there’s another bulk of data center activity, or, I don’t know, some other big new source of electricity demand that comes online in the 2030s, like this could all potentially be even worse, right? We’re modeling the technologies that we understand and the economic impulses that we understand, but the further this gets out in time, the more potential draws of energy there are, right, that we don’t even anticipate today.

Jenkins: Absolutely. It’s a good example of the limits of our crystal ball, right? Here’s this huge meta-trend that kind of snuck up on a lot of us, even those closely analyzing the power sector. I’m sure there were people anticipating this in 2021, 2022 but it was definitely not part of the conversation around these bills on the Hill. It was not the primary focus. Whereas today, it’s all about AI, right? Everybody’s talking about data centers everywhere I go.

Meyer: And then one last thing, which is, when we talk about electricity prices going up for consumers, I just want to draw out exactly why that would happen.

Jenkins: Yep.

Meyer: And make sure I understand correctly here what’s happening. Because electricity markets are unusual markets. They don’t work exactly like how people necessarily think. So, the idea here is that, if I’m a developer, the existence of these tax credits, or the fact that these tax credits are as potent as they are, I’m able to transfer them to other companies, maybe get 90 or 90 cents on the dollar of every tax credit I claim, as opposed to how it used to be, which was 80 to 85 cents on the dollar, right? That’s bringing, that’s allowing more projects to pencil out. And so I’m able to build that extra 10% of projects. There’s a number of projects, so to speak, that I can now build, that I didn’t used to be able to build, that didn’t make financial sense.

Jenkins: Yeah, a lot more than 10%. It’s probably more like 100% more projects, roughly, yeah.

Meyer: And so that means a lot more new capacity is coming onto the grid, and then it’s being dispatched in power auctions — largely, there’s some, obviously not in vertically integrated monopolies — but in most of the country, it’s being dispatched in power auctions, either when the sun is up and it has a zero marginal cost, or the batteries are activating when it makes sense economically. And that is through the existence of more supply on the market, and the greater amount of supply on the market that was brought onto the market by the existence of these tax credits lowering costs, which means that the cost effect of repealing the IRA actually grows over time, as we continue to lose the supply and the cheap electricity that would have once helped the economy. Is that all correct?

Jenkins: That’s exactly right. We estimate that average household energy costs would increase in 2030 by about $110 to $180 per household for the average household. But that grows to like $275 to $400 per year by 2035. And a big part of that is the increase in electricity price differences. There’s really three effects here, I think that are important to call out. One is the one you’re talking about, which is just more supply in the electricity sector means lower electricity costs, all else equal. And that’s a big lever, because it isn’t just a 10% increase in deployment. It’s more like a doubling of the amount of new wind and solar and batteries that we can bring onto the grid in a cost-effective manner.

The second issue is that there are subsidies here, which are basically transfers of cost out of your pocketbook as a household or a business and onto the federal tax code. Now, somebody’s got to pay for that cost eventually, maybe it’s going to the deficit. But the way the Inflation Reduction Act tried to pay for that was by increasing corporate minimum taxes, by expanding IRS enforcement, by reducing the cost of prescription drug purchases for Medicare, Medicaid, right? So it’s trying to raise revenues in a pretty progressive way, right? In a fair way, I would argue, to try to pay for these costs of subsidies that ended up lowering pocketbook expenses for all Americans, right, across the country. That’s the part of the name, the Inflation Reduction part of it was it was driving down costs, both through this supply effect and the direct transfer of subsidies.

And then the third effect is that a lot of what we’re talking about, whether it’s EVs or heat pumps or industrial efficiency, is substitution of upfront capital costs for reduced fuel use. Right? I’m paying more for a more efficient heat pump, or I’m paying more for an electric vehicle than an internal combustion car at the lot, or I’m paying more for an efficient boiler in my industrial process. All of that is upfront cost that then, over time, reduces the amount of fuel we consume across the economy. And that also, that reduction in demand, in addition to the supply on the power side also drives down consumption. And so when you roll that back, we see higher consumption of fossil fuels — gasoline, diesel, natural gas, coal — which is going to drive up their cost too.

So it’s really those three effects. It’s the increased supply. You’re slowing down the addition of supply in the power sector. You’re increasing consumption, in households and businesses and industry, of fossil fuels. And you’re removing taxpayer subsidies that are taking money out of household pockets, putting on the tax code. You’re reversing that, you’re putting them right back in your household pocketbook. So you have to spend more on your vehicle. You have to spend more to heat your home. You have to spend more to weatherize your house, whatever it is.

Meyer: Man.

Jenkins: So of those three effects, right — this is where it’s tricky when we talk about an average household impact because if you’re a recipient of those subsidies directly — like you bought an EV and you got a subsidy, right, whether a new or used one, or you’re a business that got the funding — that transfer goes directly to you on some of those purchases. And so there, it’s less about the average household. It’s more about households who adopt these technologies and benefit from that capital subsidy by reducing the cost of purchase versus those who don’t.

But if we’re talking about the other two effects, the effect of more electricity supply and less fuel consumption, those effects benefit everybody by lowering prices for all Americans, not just those who buy the EV, right? So there’s 8 million less EVs on the road. That means more expenses for the people who would have otherwise bought those 8 million EVs, but it also means 15 cents more at the gas pump for all Americans. And that adds up when you start to multiply that by 360 million people, or whatever it is.

Meyer: You know, it’s funny, Jesse, what I was going to say is that between this tax bill, which is just going to blow up the deficit even more than it’s already been, and the fact that rates are creeping higher, this recent debt downgrade of the U.S., and the fact that renewable energy benefits so much, either from, as you were saying, or electrification benefits either from these higher upfront costs that then get you lower energy costs over time, or from installing a solar project that has a high upfront cost and then zero marginal operating costs, you can see the return of deficit hawk Democratic politics on the horizon. You can see President Ossoff promoting his five years to a balanced budget. You know, 2028 to 2032, I don’t know. I just feel like it’s coming.

Jenkins: The deficit is not a trivial thing. It is an important challenge that needs to be addressed. The question is, how do we want to address that? Do we want to address that by repealing subsidies that are expanding electricity supply, helping power American industries and data centers, lowering costs for households and businesses, et cetera, lowering emissions, lowering air pollution. Or we could increase tax cuts or make permanent tax cuts for very wealthy people in corporations, either. One of those has a very small impact on the deficit, right, the total score that they’re saving from the IRA repeal is on the order of $500 billion over 10 years, whereas the total budgetary impact of making the tax cuts for corporations and individuals permanent is something like four and a half trillion dollars over 10 years. So you know, nine times bigger.

Meyer: From Climate Hawk to Deficit Hawk: The College Educated Millennial Story, coming soon, to Pelican Books. You heard it here first. Okay, we’re going to take a break, and then we’re going to come back with Upshift/Downshift right after this.

Every week. Jesse Jenkins, my co-host, and I like to find one piece of news that has really caught our attention and that is either making us feel more upbeat about the energy transition that week or more downbeat. Now, of course, as you might guess, if it’s making us feel more upbeat, it is an Upshift. If it’s making us feel more downbeat, it’s a Downshift. Jesse Jenkins, what do you have for us today?

Jenkins: Well, since we’ve been delivering a lot of Downshifts in our main segments here, I keep trying to look out for important Upshifts. And there’s not too many more important than what happens to greenhouse gas emissions in China, the world’s largest emitter. Back in December, we had Lauri Myllyvirta on to talk about the big structural shifts that might be happening in China’s economy that contribute to a potential peak in emissions years ahead of their schedule. The Chinese national goal is to have their emissions peak by 2030. It looks like it’s possible that over the last 12 months that peak has arrived, at least for now, we’ll see if it is sustained and if it can turn into a downturn.

But data is now out for the first quarter of 2025 that finds that China’s total CO2 emissions are down 1.6% year on year for that first quarter. And over the last 12 months, trailing through end of March, emissions are down by a full 1% relative to the previous 12 months. Back in December, I think when we recorded that episode, it aired early after the new year. We were still at this point where we weren’t quite sure, you know, are emissions going to be up or flat or down a little bit? It looks like they, in fact, are down. Couple major drivers there, the most important of which is just that power sector clean electricity additions are now fast enough to outpace demand growth, right?

It’s the same race that we were just talking about for the U.S., where the fate of the tech-neutral clean electricity tax credits will play a big role in which pulls ahead: demand or clean electricity. Historically, China’s been setting record growth rates for wind and solar, year after year, but it’s not been quite enough to keep up with their massive increases in electricity demand. Until now, where we’ve actually seen emissions from the power sector fall by somewhere on the order of 40 million tons per year — not a huge shift, but enough to drop total emissions down across the country and offset small increases in the other sectors, like chemicals and metallurgy, steel production, iron steel production, in particular.

This is exactly the kind of trend that we need to see for China to turn emissions around, is that the growth of clean electricity, wind and solar and nuclear and others, need to outpace their growth in electricity demand and other structural changes across the economy, like the slowdown in the construction sector, which also contributed, we saw a decline in cement related emissions over the last 12 months. Those are also helping contribute to declining emissions and are offsetting the growth in emissions in petrochemicals, plastic production, et cetera, and in metallurgy, iron and steel in particular.

Meyer: It’s so funny, because I think that big question of, “Is there going to be a major economy that sees clean energy supply exceed the growth in demand?” was actually, like, a major question last year. People asked that question about the United States. They asked about Europe. We’ve seen other economies achieve it, but there’s been this question of, does clean energy just ultimately add to supply, or does it start to bite into fossil supply over time? And for China, the milestone is just huge, arguably the biggest news event to happen so far this year, right?

Jenkins: It’s one of the most important shifts out there, so we’ll keep a close eye on it. But for now, it’s trending in the right direction, which is at least a bit of comfort given the way things are trending here at home. So Rob, what do you have for us this week?

Meyer: Well, I have a downshift for us. So last week, when we were going over the parts of the House Republican Ways and Means Committee proposal that effectively guts the IRA, we left one part not really discussed, and this was the foreign entities of concern clause. As folks who’ve been following the IRA for a long time will remember, there’s always been a foreign entities of concern clause attached to some parts of the IRA. It was attached specifically to the $7,500 tax credit for buying a personal EV. And the way that clause worked was basically that over time to qualify for this tax credit, automakers and battery makers had to raise the amount of non-Chinese source materials in their battery or car.

And this was meant to slowly encourage, slowly but confidently encourage battery part makers, critical mineral refiners, critical mineral mines, to shift or build new facilities outside of Chinese control. That it would gradually friendshore the EV supply chain. It was not instant. It was like, this is a long term impetus to build a parallel supply chain, because right now, China, or Chinese-controlled entities control some vast amount, I think, more than 80% of almost every supply chain that feeds into modern EVs. And if you’re an American policy maker, this would seem suboptimal.

The Republican proposal to reform or change or essentially gut the IRA, retains a foreign entity of concern clause, but it changes it so substantially that it’s almost not worth calling it by the same policy. So what this clause does, and the clause is attached to almost every tax credit in the IRA, including, I should add, to the carbon capture tax credit, to the personal EV tax credit, to the tech-neutral tax credit, every tax credit except to the biofuel, the ethanol tax credit—

Jenkins: As usual, ethanol gets its way.

Meyer: —Has a new foreign entity of concern clause, and what it says is that the tax credit cannot flow to a Chinese company. It can’t flow to a company that is majority or partially-controlled by someone with connections to China. And crucially, that it can’t — and this is where it really matters — that it can’t receive material support from a Chinese-linked entity. Now you may think that sounds very reasonable, right? We don’t want material support coming to these American energy projects. But what they mean by material support is material. Like, any kind of material.

Jenkins: Stuff. Cement or electrical wire or anything.

Meyer: The way the law is written, is that any part, in my reading and the reading of folks I’ve talked to, any part, any component, any piece of equipment, no matter how insubstantial, if it is found to be linked or come from China or was made by a Chinese-controlled company, automatically disqualifies the entire project from receiving the tax credit.

So what that means is that, let’s say you have some steel in a steel frame for solar panels that was made in a Chinese foundry — whole project loses qualification. Let’s say that there’s like a gram of graphite that, through the global market, has worked its way into your battery supply chain — whole vehicle loses qualification. Let’s say that there’s a little copper in a wire that you use to power a direct air capture product, and that copper has come from a Chinese mind somewhere — your whole project, again, loses the tax credit. So in effect, what this new clause does is it says, if there is any Chinese part, even if it’s one little bolt, and yes, the law is written to fully countenance the idea that it could be really, really insubstantial, one little bolt of Chinese source material in your project disqualifies it entirely from receiving a tax credit.

And the issue is that lots of parts that do not reflect, like, best-in-class technology, that are just kind of commodity parts on the market, intermingle in the global market. And right now there’s no way for energy developers or construction companies to know when they’re buying something that it comes from China or that it comes from Europe or that it comes from Southeast Asia. It’s totally unclear. You don’t really—

Jenkins: It’s impossible to verify this.

Meyer: Yeah, exactly. And so what this FEOC clause would mean is, number one, it would render many of these tax credits totally unworkable. And in fact, we’ve seen House Republican moderates already say that they need these, they want this particular clause to be changed in an eventual final version of the law. We’ll see if they succeed. But even Republican House moderates are saying this is totally unworkable. What the FEOC does is it basically, I think, kills these tax credits because—

Jenkins: It’s a poison pill.

Meyer: It’s a poison pill, and it’s meant to make, what’s going to have to happen is that the Treasury Department is going to have to go in and rewrite tax guidance for this new statutory text. And I would bet that by the time the Treasury Department finally gets around to writing that text, we’ll have hit the sunset deadlines for these tax credits, and these tax credits will have been effectively killed. And so you’ll hear sunset dates. You’ll hear, “Oh, House Republicans extended this date to 2028, it was supposed to be in 2033 and now companies can only claim until 2028 or 2029 or 2030.” And you might think, well, 2029 is an election away. Maybe there’ll be a different Congress by then, and they’ll repeal this law, and they’ll send the tax credits again. But what is actually going to happen is that between now and 2028, at least, the tax credit will not be, will not exist, it will not be usable, because the FEOC clauses are such a poison pill. Now, maybe they’ll change this. Maybe they’ll put in some safe harbor clauses, maybe some texts that they’ve put in there that ambiguously could be a safe harbor clause. Today they’ll clear it up so that it becomes clear if you’re using a Chinese-made bolt or a Chinese made washer that, like, you don’t lose tens of millions of dollars of tax credit support for your nuclear plant, for instance.

But as of today, my read of this clause is that it is a major, major poison pill, and that, to me, is a big old Downshift.

Jenkins: Yeah, I think it’s a huge downshift, Rob. Whether they resolve this to clarify that a few bolts or whatever don’t count or not, the simple idea of material assistance, materials of any sort, right, in your supply chain pushes this clause and the effort to sort of excise China so far back up the supply chain to the third tier of suppliers of whatever, that it will always be impossible to verify that, right? That you’re ever in compliance with that, because you would have to have provenance for every single part in the entire supply chain. And that’s just not feasible. This debate came up when the original FEOC rules were written. Where do we draw the line? How far up can we go to balance the legitimate interest in trying to build a China-resilient or China-independent supply chain and the need to actually make these tax credits usable and bankable?

And the reality is, if a project developer is going to the bank, right? Literally, a bank, to get debt finance for a project that they’re going to build 18 months from now, or 36 months from now, or whatever in the future. They don’t even know where all the parts are coming from yet when they’re going to the bank. And if the bankers have no confidence that you’re going to be able to demonstrate with 100% assurance your compliance with the tax credits, they will heavily, if not entirely, discount the value of those tax credits when figuring out your project economics. So they might say, “Well, there’s an upside scenario where you happen to qualify, and then our returns are great,” but they’re not going to loan on that scenario, right? They’re not going to factor it in. And if your project economics don’t work without the tax credit, they won’t loan to you. And so this is called bankability. If the tax credits are not bankable, which means they’re not certain at the time that you go in to finance a project. They’re just useless.

And that’s the key thing we have to watch out for, if there’s an opportunity to make any nuanced changes to the statute here is whatever they do, whatever the policy objective is, it needs to actually be usable, or it just amounts to a poison pill like you said.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDI3MTM0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDExNTM4OX0.FKZXZNikjhqMHjwafFQXghMCeUpJ9ubLtkwyO3ViwGA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-21 15:12:21.545408

Economic Impact of Proposed Clean Energy Tax Credit Restrictions

FEOC Restriction -> $237 Billion in Lost GDP & Over 1.4 Million Jobs at Stake

WASHINGTON—Proposed restrictions on technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits currently under consideration in Congress would create unnecessary barriers to deployment, undermine economic growth, and drive up costs for American families and businesses. With energy demand rising and U.S. manufacturing poised for continued expansion, these provisions would stall investment, weaken domestic supply chains, and disrupt job creation nationwide.

A new analysis from Greenline Insights, supported by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), finds that the House-imposed restrictions on Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) alone could result in:

$237 billion in lost GDP

$162 billion in lost wages

1.4 million job-years wiped out

At a moment when the private sector stands poised to make generational investments in America’s energy and manufacturing future, policymakers should be focused on the way these investments can strengthen the economic vitality of the communities they represent. These restrictive provisions would jeopardize investments in nuclear power, geothermal energy, wind, solar, energy storage, and other emerging technologies, putting the United States at a disadvantage while global competitors double down on investments in their energy and manufacturing sectors.

Beyond FEOC provisions, additional limitations in the reconciliation package introduce further risks—disrupting energy infrastructure development that would undergird our long-term economic prosperity, while leading to significant losses in jobs, wages, and economic output. Specifically:

A 2029 “placed in service” requirement could cost nearly 977,000 jobs, reduce wages by $117 billion, and cut $177 billion from GDP.

New transferability restrictions, which would greatly diminish access to clean energy project financing, could eliminate 237,000 jobs, cost $28 billion in wages, and remove $49 billion in GDP.

“We’re really at a crossroads. On one hand, this analysis makes clear the proposed modifications to these credits would have profound and far-reaching economic consequences for communities across the country. On the other hand, with the right leadership in this pivotal moment, Congress has an opportunity to bet on America’s clean energy future and the communities around the country who will power it.” said Brad Townsend, Vice President for Policy and Outreach at C2ES. “While these restrictions would undermine our ability to compete globally, drive up costs for businesses and families, and disrupt investments in critical and emerging industries, the reverse is also true. What this analysis really shows is that there’s an incredible opportunity right in front of us, to generate more than a million jobs and add more than $100 billion to American paychecks if we’re willing to believe in our ability to capitalize on the moment.”

This scenario results in nearly 1 million cumulative jobs lost and $177 billion in GDP losses through 2035.
Removing credit transferability leads to 237,000 cumulative jobs lost and $49 billion in GDP decline, disproportionately affecting smaller developers.

To assess the impact, we developed custom deployment models for five policy scenarios, each evaluated independently using the Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) by Energy Innovation to estimate net economic and emissions effects at the national level, as well as within a select number of states.

The most disruptive scenario involves restrictions on projects using components linked to Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOCs). These “material assistance” rules would disqualify a large share of clean energy projects, leading to 1.4 million cumulative jobs lost, $237 billion in GDP decline, and a 6% increase in national emissions through 2035. An early sunset of the 45Y and 48E credits is similarly damaging, eliminating long-term certainty and stalling investment in major clean energy projects. This scenario results in nearly 1 million cumulative jobs lost and $177 billion in GDP losses through 2035.

Other rollbacks are less severe but nonetheless significant. Removing credit transferability leads to 237,000 cumulative jobs lost and $49 billion in GDP decline, disproportionately affecting smaller developers. The only provision with no measurable impact is the FEOC entity-level restriction, which targets project ownership rather than component sourcing. As an alternative, a hypothetical storage mandate for wind and solar was modeled, which projects 88,000 cumulative jobs lost and $37 billion in losses, with minimal emissions impacts.

State-level findings follow similar trends, with the largest losses concentrated in clean energy investment hubs like Texas, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Indiana. State-level economic losses reach as high as over 170,000 jobs and $20 billion in GDP, in some cases.

We’re not following trends — we’re setting them.

Earlier this year, Alabama took a historic leap forward with the passage of the “Powering Growth” legislative package, which is on its way to Gov. Kay Ivey’s desk. This landmark initiative positions our state to compete and win in the global race for high-quality jobs, advanced manufacturing, and next-generation industry. At the heart of “Powering Growth” is a simple, powerful idea: Economic strength begins with energy strength. That’s why we’re investing in the infrastructure that powers everything — from rural development to robotics, from advanced manufacturing to domestic reshoring.

What makes Alabama stand out with “Powering Growth”: Proactive Planning

— We didn’t wait for crisis or grid strain to act. Working with the Alabama Department of Commerce and the Alabama Growth Alliance as well as our energy providers, we commissioned a top-tier, independent study to guide our steps. The result is a strategic, data-backed energy blueprint tailored for longterm success.

Private-Sector Focused — There are no massive government bureaucracies or tax hikes hiding in this plan. Alabama is harnessing market forces and private investment to drive results, especially in rural communities that other states often overlook.

Real Infrastructure, Real Jobs — Through the creation of the Alabama Energy Infrastructure Bank (AEIB), we now have a fiscally conservative financing tool to accelerate the buildout of power systems that serve industrial sites. This means faster permitting, fewer bottlenecks, and shovel-ready opportunities for American companies looking to grow.

Conservative Values in Action — Alabama’s approach doesn’t just make economic sense — it reflects our core principles of smaller government, smarter investment, energy independence, and national security. It’s an “America First” strategy built for the 21st century.

Other states have made big moves in energy infrastructure. But Alabama is matching that momentum with smart, agile legislation — and winning attention from industry leaders who see the value in our business climate and energy readiness.

This is not just about lights staying on — it’s about keeping America on. From Huntsville’s aerospace hubs to auto manufacturers across rural Alabama to our thriving ports in the Southern part of the state, Alabama’s economy is evolving, and we’re making sure our power grid is evolving with it.

We’ve seen what happens when infrastructure is neglected — whether it’s blackouts abroad or costly slowdowns at home that halts job creation in its tracks. Alabama isn’t waiting for a crisis. We’re preparing for a future of growth, resilience, and global competitiveness.

The “Powering Growth” package is a promise to the people of our state that Alabama will lead with vision, act with discipline, and compete with confidence. Our message to the rest of the world is clear: If you want to see how energy and economic policy can work hand in hand, look no further than “Sweet Home Alabama.”

We’re not just powering Alabama — we’re powering what’s next.",https://www.franklincountytimes.com/franklincountytimes/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/05/Ledbetter.Orr_.Gudger-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 17:14:26.962512

15 of the 23 regions expect higher peak summer demand in 2025, according to NERC’s assessment.
Active but aging generation facilities also present increased challenges to maintaining generator readiness and resource adequacy, NERC said.
However, NERC has cautioned that grid operators must remain alert to the risk of inverter-based resources (IBRs) unexpectedly tripping offline during grid disturbances—a persistent near-term reliability concern.
NERC further stressed that grid operators with solar PV resources should implement recommendations in the IBR performance issues alert that NERC issued in March 2023.","Load growth and expected higher temperatures could push peak demand higher this summer, potentially straining resources in some regions, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment.

Although the North American Bulk Power System (BPS) is expected to have sufficient resources under normal summer conditions, NERC cautioned that grid operators in many regions may face challenges during periods of high demand due to a resource mix that is generally less flexible and more variable.

Since last summer, NERC said the aggregate of peak electricity demand for its 23 assessment areas has risen by over 10GW—more than double the year-to-year increase that occurred between the summers of 2023 and 2024.

15 of the 23 regions expect higher peak summer demand in 2025, according to NERC’s assessment. Above-average temperatures and below-average precipitation are expected across much of North America. Temperature is one of the main drivers of demand and can contribute to forced outages for generation and other system equipment.

New data centres, electrification and industrial activity continue to drive load growth forecasts. NERC’s report projects notable demand increases in the US West (+5%), where a new peak demand record was set last summer; and SERC Southeast, driven by economic growth, industrial activity, and data mining.

Retirements and reliability issues for aging assets

Adding to these challenges, more than 7.4GW of generation capacity— including 2.5GW of natural gas and 2.1GW of coal-fired units—has been retired or deactivated ahead of the upcoming summer.

Active but aging generation facilities also present increased challenges to maintaining generator readiness and resource adequacy, NERC said. Forced outage rates for conventional generators and wind resources have trended historically high in recent years, the organization reported. System operators face an increasing risk of resource shortfalls and operating challenges caused by forced generator outages, especially during periods of high demand or when fewer conventional resources are dispatched to serve load.

There are greater threats to BPS reliability in regions where aging resources are further depended upon to provide essential reliability services. In the Southwest, for example, a portion of capacity has been in operation for roughly 60 years. Electric utilities in this region have also described aging generation as a reliability challenge, NERC reported.

Historical performance has demonstrated the need for planning for elevated forced outage rates for these aging generators. Older generators can also require extensive overhauls, such as generator rewinds, that take resources out of service for extended periods of time as findings can lead to additional unplanned maintenance.

Inverter-based resource concerns

Growth in solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage resources has accelerated with the addition of 30 GW of nameplate solar PV resources and 13GW of new battery storage, according to the assessment. The new solar and battery resource additions are expected to provide over 35GW in summer on-peak capacity. New wind resources are expected to provide 5GW on peak.

In Texas, California and across the UqS West, the influx of battery energy storage in recent years has markedly improved the ability to manage energy risks during challenging summer periods, NERC said.

However, NERC has cautioned that grid operators must remain alert to the risk of inverter-based resources (IBRs) unexpectedly tripping offline during grid disturbances—a persistent near-term reliability concern. To address this, NERC continues to collaborate with industry on long-term solutions.

In April, the organisation released its Aggregated Report on NERC Level 2 Recommendation to Industry: Findings from Inverter-Based Resource Model Quality Deficiencies Alert, summarising issues identified in a June 2024 alert. Key findings include:

Many operators lacked the necessary data, highlighting ongoing weaknesses in data acquisition and management.

Interconnection process requirements were found to be inadequate.

About two-thirds of grid protection settings were not configured to allow full ride-through capability, limiting the reliability contribution of BPS-connected solar PV facilities.

20% of surveyed sites were operating with a 0.95 power factor limit, leaving significant reactive power capacity underutilised.

Dynamic model data was found to be inconsistent.

As solar, wind, and battery systems continue to dominate new capacity additions, NERC is stressing the need for improved system modeling, interconnection standards, and IBR performance practices across the industry.

NERC Recommendations

To reduce the risk of electricity shortfalls on the BPS this summer, NERC is recommending that grid operators do the following:

Review seasonal operating plans and protocols for communicating and resolving potential supply shortfalls in anticipation of potentially extreme demand levels.

Consider the potential for higher-than-anticipated forced generator outage rates in operating plans due to plant age, operating patterns or limited pre-seasonal maintenance availability.

Employ conservative generation and transmission outage coordination procedures and operate conservatively commensurate with long-range weather forecasts to ensure adequate resource availability.

Engage state or provincial regulators and policymakers to prepare for efficient implementation of demand-side management mechanisms called for in operating plans.

NERC further stressed that grid operators with solar PV resources should implement recommendations in the IBR performance issues alert that NERC issued in March 2023. The organisation said state regulators should have protocols in place at the start of summer for managing requests from generators for air-quality restriction waivers.",https://www.smart-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/summer-load-growth-in-the-US.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 16:10:01.231005

The Trump administration said money was allocated “based on need and urgency,” and the cuts did not universally hit Democrat-controlled states.
Biden had proposed relatively even funding levels for water construction projects across red and blue states in his budget request last year, with blue states getting about 53% of the funds available for construction projects and red states getting 47%.
But the Trump administration’s plan allocated just 33% of funds to blue states, and 64% to red.
The other Republican-led states to gain tens of millions of new waterway construction funding include Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee.","The Trump administration significantly cut funding for flood prevention projects in blue states across the country while creating new water construction opportunities in red states, undoing a Biden-era budget proposal that would have allocated money more evenly, according to a data analysis prepared by Democratic staffers.

California and the state of Washington lost the most funds, with the administration cutting water construction budget for those states by a combined $606 million, according to the analysis, which was shared with CNN. Texas, meanwhile, gained $206 million.

Democrats decried the moves, saying the administration was slashing essential projects in the name of political retribution. Collectively, states with Democratic senators lost over $436 million in funding compared to what they would have received under the last proposed budget of President Joe Biden’s administration, the data analysis shows. Republican-led states gained more than $257 million, the analysis shows.

“President Trump is blatantly playing politics with critical Army Corps construction investments and punishing the American people for the way their states have voted,” House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro and fellow Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur said in a joint statement to CNN.

The Trump administration said money was allocated “based on need and urgency,” and the cuts did not universally hit Democrat-controlled states. Iowa and Louisiana, which both have Republican governors and US senators, for example, both saw their overall funding reduced.

“The FY25 Civil Works plan will generate billions of dollars in economic activity by building American energy dominance and shipping capacity while investing in important conservation projects,” an Office of Management and Budget spokesperson told CNN. “The available funds were allocated by the administration based on need and urgency, in accordance with the guidelines set by Congress.”

During a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday, an Army Corps of Engineers official pledged nonpartisanship but could not give a concrete answer about why the administration cut funding from blue states and gave to red states under questioning from California Democratic Rep. Mike Levin.

Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army Robyn Colosimo said the administration had to cut projects because the short-term government funding extension bill significantly cut the funds available to the program. It was not her decision, Colosimo said, how the cuts were made.

“We always support the best projects. In this case it’s a dicey situation,” Colosimo said. “They made hard choices. The administration did. And they had that discretion.”

“I believe they had to make trade-offs that I was not privy to,” Colosimo responded, when pressed further on whether the cuts were partisan. “It’s the priorities they placed that were different than the priorities of other projects.”

In an earlier statement to CNN, an Army Corps spokesperson said the appropriations bill “allowed the administration to allocate all funds to Civil Works projects, programs and activities in accordance with its priorities.”

Typically, Congress takes a presidential budget request and sets funding levels for water construction projects through full-year appropriations bills on a bipartisan basis. But because Congress passed a short-term government funding bill without clear directives for these projects in March, the Trump administration has full discretion to determine how the funding should be allocated.

Biden had proposed relatively even funding levels for water construction projects across red and blue states in his budget request last year, with blue states getting about 53% of the funds available for construction projects and red states getting 47%. Both the House and Senate passed bills in 2024 that also would have provided relatively even funding for 2025. But the Trump administration’s plan allocated just 33% of funds to blue states, and 64% to red.

A source familiar with the budget said priorities often shift with a change of administration, but the change in spending on these projects was “unique” for the “magnitude” of how the funding was reallocated.

“That’s always been done on the edges; this is a wholesale dismissal of the 2025 budget,” the person said. “It looks like a war on the West Coast primarily. They definitely swiped away from blue states to fund red states.”

Four flood prevention projects in California, which were set to gain a combined $126.4 million under the Biden budget proposal, are getting nothing under the Trump administration’s plan. One of the projects to lose funding, Sacramento’s Natomas Basin is “one of the most at-risk areas in the nation for catastrophic flooding,” according to the Army Corps of Engineers website.

The West Sacramento levee project, which is not getting a proposed $43 million, bisects 48,000 residents and provides vital infrastructure to the US Postal Service, the California Department of Water Resources flood fight facility, and the Port of West Sacramento, the Army Corps of Engineers says.

The California flood control projects are key given the deluge the state has gotten from so-called atmospheric rivers, essentially, rivers in the sky that can deluge cities and towns in water. One of the California communities that was set to receive the Army Corps funding flooded during atmospheric rivers in 2023, a year where tens of trillions of gallons of water fell on the state, according to NOAA.

“Natural disasters like floods don’t discriminate – they can and do hit red and blue states alike,” Democratic California Sen. Adam Schiff said in a statement to CNN. “The Trump administration is politicizing the Army Corps and its critical mission, and it needs to stop playing games with people’s lives.”

A $500 million dam project that provides flood control and water conservation in Washington also will get nothing under the Trump plan, and other state projects were given significantly less resources. The dam has flooded more than 30 times over the past 70 years causing serious damage to lands and buildings, according to the Army Corps of Engineers.

“We are witnessing a historic and serious, politically motivated abuse of our taxpayer dollars by President Trump,” said Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, adding, “this is some corrupt B-S from the President.”

Texas got the biggest investment, with over $206 million awarded for two large waterway projects that were not part of the 2024 budget request. One will deepen the Sabine-Neches Waterway, which is crucial to military and energy transport. And the funding for the Houston Ship Channel will provide dredging and maintenance.

The other Republican-led states to gain tens of millions of new waterway construction funding include Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee. A new $16.5 million in funding to address storm damage in Democratic-run New Jersey originates in GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew’s district.

Hill Republicans defended allocations of money to their states and districts.

“Good for Republican states,” GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas, who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, told CNN. “There is your incentive to be a Republican state.”

“Washington has picked winners and losers for a long time. It’s not going to stop picking winners and losers. Better to be on the winning side than on the losing side” Gonzales added.

When asked if he thought partisan politics overshadowed the funding breakdown, Van Drew, who worked with the administration to get the funding approved, told CNN. “Not that I know of.”

“I will say this, even when the Democrats were in control and I was here, I did very well in my district because the need for these projects are so great,” Van Drew said.

GOP Rep. Randy Weber, whose coastal Texas district is home to several key ports, said the construction awarded to his state was based on the outsized need to maintain safe shipping practices.

“We need the channel dug out,” Weber explained. “We’re able to do more commerce and more trade. So, for us, it’s a big deal.”

GOP Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio, who says he has had success getting various dredging projects funded, told CNN lawmakers must make the case to convince the administration to fund these types of projects.

“You got to work on them,” Joyce said about the way to advocate with the administration. “It’s like a rebound, right? That’s where the sharp elbows get in there and make sure you get the rebound.”

""If too much ice is lost, parts of these ice sheets may not recover until the Earth enters the next ice age.
In other words, land lost to sea-level rise from melting ice sheets will be lost for a very, very long time.
The new paper continues an intense stream of bleak studies on the worsening climate emergency, and specifically, looming sea-level rise.","Less than six months away from the next United Nations summit for parties to the Paris climate agreement, scientists on Tuesday released a study showing that even meeting the deal's 1.5°C temperature target could lead to significant sea-level rise that drives seriously disruptive migration inland.

Governments that signed on to the 2015 treaty aim to take action to limit global temperature rise by 2100 to 1.5°C beyond preindustrial levels. Last year was not only the hottest in human history but also the first in which the average global temperature exceeded 1.5°C. Multiple studies have warned of major impacts from even temporarily overshooting the target, bolstering demands for policymakers to dramatically rein in planet-heating fossil fuels.

The study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environmentwarns that 1.5°C ""is too high"" and even the current 1.2°C, ""if sustained, is likely to generate several meters of sea-level rise over the coming centuries, causing extensive loss and damage to coastal populations and challenging the implementation of adaptation measures.""

""To avoid this requires a global mean temperature that is cooler than present and which we hypothesize to be closer to +1°C above preindustrial, possibly even lower, but further work is urgently required to more precisely determine a 'safe limit' for ice sheets,"" the paper states, referring to Antarctica and Greenland's continental glaciers.

Co-author Jonathan Bamber told journalists that ""what we mean by safe limit is one which allows some level of adaptation, rather than catastrophic inland migration and forced migration, and the safe limit is roughly 1 centimeter a year of sea-level rise.""

""If you get to that, then it becomes extremely challenging for any kind of adaptation, and you're going to see massive land migration on scales that we've never witnessed in modern civilization,"" said the University of Bristol professor.

In terms of timing, study lead author Chris Stokes, from the United Kingdom's Durham University, said in a statement that ""rates of 1 centimeter per year are not out of the question within the lifetime of our young people.""

There are currently around 8.18 billion people on the planet. The study—funded by the United Kingdom's Natural Environment Research Council—says that ""continued mass loss from ice sheets poses an existential threat to the world's coastal populations, with an estimated 1 billion people inhabiting land less than 10 meters above sea level and around 230 million living within 1 meter.""

""Without adaptation, conservative estimates suggest that 20 centimeters of [sea-level rise] by 2050 would lead to average global flood losses of $1 trillion or more per year for the world's 136 largest coastal cities,"" says the study, also co-authored by University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Andrea Dutton and University of Massachusetts Amherst's Rob DeConto in the United States.

DeConto said Tuesday that ""it is important to stress that these accelerating changes in the ice sheets and their contributions to sea level should be considered permanent on multigenerational timescales.""

""Even if the Earth returns to its preindustrial temperature, it will still take hundreds to perhaps thousands of years for the ice sheets to recover,"" the professor explained. ""If too much ice is lost, parts of these ice sheets may not recover until the Earth enters the next ice age. In other words, land lost to sea-level rise from melting ice sheets will be lost for a very, very long time. That's why it is so critical to limit warming in the first place.""

While the paper sparked some international alarm, Stokes highlighted what he called ""a reason for hope,"" which is that ""we only have to go back to the early 1990s to find a time when the ice sheets looked far healthier.""

""Global temperatures were around 1°C above preindustrial back then, and carbon dioxide concentrations were 350 parts per million, which others have suggested is a much safer limit for planet Earth,"" he said. ""Carbon dioxide concentrations are currently around 424 parts per million and continue to increase.""

The new paper continues an intense stream of bleak studies on the worsening climate emergency, and specifically, looming sea-level rise. Another, published by the journal Nature in February, shows that glaciers have lost an average of 273 billion metric tons of ice annually since 2000.

Despite scientists' warnings, the government whose country is responsible for the largest share of historical planet-heating emissions, the United States, is actually working to boost the fossil fuel industry.

The execution of these contracts represents a significant milestone for reaping the benefits of these clean energy initiatives.
Alliance for Clean Energy New York Executive Director Marguerite Wells said, “The benefits of locally-produced renewable energy are immense and wide-ranging.
Today’s announcement of new land-based renewable energy projects will mean fewer greenhouse gas emissions, better air quality, and good union jobs for New Yorkers.
These large-scale renewable energy projects will bring real economic benefits to communities across the state.","Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that contracts have been executed for 26 large-scale land-based renewable energy projects that, upon completion, will provide more than 2.5 gigawatts of clean energy, enough to power more than 670,000 homes throughout New York State. These projects are expected to create more than 1,900 near-term, family-supporting jobs and generate more than $6 billion in private investment while reinforcing the State’s commitment to the development of locally-produced clean energy, grid resiliency and economic development.

“New York is creating competitive opportunities for the clean energy industry, and we could not do this without the shared commitment of our private partners,” Governor Hochul said. “The advancement of renewable energy is part of the foundation of New York’s plan to transform to a zero-emission electricity system and continue our green economy’s momentum forward.”

These contracted awards are the result of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s (NYSERDA) 2024 Tier 1 Renewable Energy Standard solicitation. Once constructed, the projects will produce approximately 5,000 gigawatt-hours annually–which is enough to power more than 670,000 homes–provide public health benefits resulting from reduced exposure to harmful air pollutants; and provide more than $300 million in commitments to disadvantaged communities, as defined by the Climate Justice Working Group, from long-term payments to community benefit funds.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “As New York transitions to a clean energy economy, we celebrate these 26 projects and the significant energy they will provide. New York remains an innovator in accelerating clean energy projects, advancing clean energy jobs, and spurring economic development opportunities for businesses and our local communities all across our state.”

The payments under the contracted projects will only begin once projects are constructed and begin delivering renewable energy to New York after obtaining all required permits and approvals. Several projects have already commenced construction activities. All projects are expected to be operational by 2029.

Additionally, the State will continue to emphasize engagements with the projects’ host communities. NYSERDA offers resources and no-cost technical assistance to help local governments understand how to manage responsible clean energy development in their communities, including step-by-step instructions and tools to guide the coordination of new clean energy projects, permitting processes, property taxes, siting, zoning, and more.

New York State Department of Public Service CEO Rory M. Christian said, “We applaud Governor Hochul’s commitment to move New York State toward a clean energy economy. The projects being announced today will spur the creation of clean energy jobs as well as encouraging economic development opportunities in New York State.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Acting Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “These large-scale renewable energy projects demonstrate how clean energy and job creation go hand-in-hand to build healthier communities and stronger economies. More than two dozen projects under contracts through NYSERDA will generate renewable power and private investment that helps continue the significant progress underway to reduce polluting power sources.”

New York State Department of Labor Commissioner Roberta Reardon said, “I thank Governor Hochul for maintaining our state’s leadership in the clean energy sector and for continuing to create great career opportunities for New Yorkers statewide. These investments will continue to build a more energy efficient and environmentally friendly future for New York State.”

State Senator Kevin Parker said, “As Chair of the Senate Energy and Telecommunications Committee, I am proud to work alongside NYSERDA, a critical partner in advancing New York’s clean energy future. Their continued leadership in delivering funding awards and innovative programs is essential to meeting the goals of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Together, we are not only strengthening the state’s electric grid with renewable energy, but also ensuring that disadvantaged communities share in the economic and environmental benefits of this transition.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “Congratulations to Governor Hochul and NYSERDA on another major milestone toward achieving New York’s renewable energy goals while adhering to robust labor standards and protections and Buy American policies. This will create good union jobs while building up the State’s clean energy program.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, “Renewable energy projects continue to represent major opportunities for New York to not only achieve the goals set out by CLCPA but also create thousands of family-sustaining union careers and economic stimulus that will reinvigorate our communities and the middle class. The execution of these contracts represents a significant milestone for reaping the benefits of these clean energy initiatives. We thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their continued commitment to pushing forward the development of green infrastructure in New York.""

Alliance for Clean Energy New York Executive Director Marguerite Wells said, “The benefits of locally-produced renewable energy are immense and wide-ranging. We thank Governor Hochul for continuing to guide the state through our clean energy transition, which will not only benefit the New Yorkers of today but also those of generations to come. Today’s announcement shows there is continued enthusiasm from private developers to invest in New York, and New York remains ready to greet them.”

New York League of Conservation Voters President Julie Tighe said, “Climate change is happening now and the impacts will only get worse if we don’t transition off of fossil fuels and deliver on our clean energy future. Today’s announcement of new land-based renewable energy projects will mean fewer greenhouse gas emissions, better air quality, and good union jobs for New Yorkers. We thank Governor Hochul for her environmental leadership and congratulate NYSERDA on this progress toward meeting our clean energy goals.”

Natural Resources Defense Council Power Sector Managing Director Kit Kennedy said, “New York State’s leadership on clean energy is more important now than ever, given the federal government’s efforts to turn back progress. The clean energy projects announced today by Governor Hochul mean more jobs, more economic development for communities, less health-harming air pollution, and lower electricity system costs. This is what leadership means. Let’s keep it coming!”

Citizens Campaign for the Environment Executive Director Adrienne Esposito said, “We are thrilled that NY is taking another significant step forward in our state’s ongoing transition to a clean energy future. As national momentum around renewable energy and climate action stumbles, it’s more important than ever for states like New York to lead. Leadership matters and we need NY to continue on a course of establishing a 21st century energy infrastructure plan we can be proud of! These projects will deliver reliable, locally-produced clean energy to millions of New Yorkers helping to meet the state’s ambitious renewable energy goals while combating climate change, creating jobs, strengthening our economy, and enhancing long-term energy security. CCE commends Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their commitment to advancing critical renewable energy projects that benefit both our environment and our communities.”

Advanced Energy United New York Policy Lead Kristina Persaud said, “This is an exciting milestone for New York’s clean energy future. These large-scale renewable energy projects will bring real economic benefits to communities across the state. These projects will not only provide clean power, but also quality jobs for New Yorkers. At the same time, they strengthen New York’s leadership in the rapidly growing clean energy sector, positioning the state to compete in a global market and reap the long-term economic benefits of a modern energy economy.”

These projects will add to New York's robust portfolio of large-scale renewable energy projects, now comprised of nearly 100 solar, land-based wind, hydroelectric and offshore wind projects currently operating or under development that are expected to deliver approximately 10 gigawatts of clean power to the grid — enough to power more than 3.3 million New York homes. Of these nearly 100 projects, more than one gigawatt of capacity is under construction, which once completed will add to the 31 operational projects currently delivering 1.4 gigawatts of clean energy to the grid – now supplying power to nearly half a million New York homes.

New York State's Climate Agenda

New York State's climate agenda calls for an affordable and just transition to a clean energy economy that creates family-sustaining jobs, promotes economic growth through green investments, and directs a minimum of 35 percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. New York is advancing a suite of efforts to achieve an emissions-free economy by 2050, including in the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2023-04/SolarPanelHero1.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=GV5G0wjs,N,,2025-05-21 15:10:54.125209

In the current market, with tremendous renewable growth and intermittency issues, you really need batteries to shift energy around.
Ultimately, Ji believes things will work out well for the energy storage industry, but current factors are leading to indecision.
Additionally, doing away with the IRA does not completely doom energy storage project development.
Ji and MN8 maintain that despite the industry’s current challenges, energy storage will continue to grow.","Ji was involved in a discussion about the impacts of 2024 on market prospects, economics and deployment of energy storage.

She notes of the discussion:

“The most important takeaway is the undeniable need and demand for batteries. In the current market, with tremendous renewable growth and intermittency issues, you really need batteries to shift energy around. This is an unprecedented load growth time that hasn’t happened in decades.”

How MN8 is preparing for the future

MN8 originated within Goldman Sachs Asset Management as Goldman Sachs Renewable Power in 2017. In 2022, it transitioned into a standalone company named MN8, with approximately 100 employees transferring to the new organisation.

In the same year, the company purchased a stake in the 200MW Mount Signal 2 solar project in California.

MN8 operates across multiple segments, including commercial and industrial (C&I), grid-scale solar and BESS and EV charging solutions.

Currently, the company claims to have around 4GW of solar PV projects operational or under construction and 1.1GWh of energy storage projects across 875 project sites in 28 US states.

Ji says of MN8:

“We’re an independent power producer (IPP), and one advantage is we’re cash flow positive. Many IPPs or renewable companies aren’t self-sustained. We have a strong operational record, and being cash flow positive gives us confidence to sustain through turbulent times.”

She continues, “we’re very selective and strategic in investments, running our own in-house analysis rather than just following market consultant reports.”

Sustaining through turbulent times will be important for MN8 and others as the energy storage industry continues to navigate unknowns around the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and shifting tariff policies.

Current market challenges

The US and China recently announced a 90-day pause on tariffs, making the effective tariff on BESS approximately 60%.

While this is certainly more favourable than a 145% tariff, it does not end import uncertainty.

In addition, the US House Ways and Means Committee recently submitted the budget reconciliation bill, which aims to reduce government spending.

Among other proposals, the bill would lower the investment tax credit (ITC) to 6% by 2030, phase out the Production Tax Credit (PTC) entirely after 2031 and put an early end to the 45X Advanced Manufacturing and Clean Hydrogen Tax Credits.

House Ways and Means also suggested blocking access to clean energy incentives that use components, technology, materials, licensing, or royalties from ‘prohibited foreign entities’.

Ji notes that Chinese battery suppliers price their products to compete with US suppliers such as Tesla.

“Even if you try to ramp up domestic production, it takes years to build. The market will continue to have both US-built and international batteries.”

“At the energy summit, they showed US-based production prices at US$180-250 per kWh versus Chinese manufacturers at US$110-150 per kWh with 10-35% tariffs,” Ji continues.

“Even with ITCs and the 10% domestic content addition, Chinese products are still a better deal. Of course, with 100-125% tariffs, it’s different, but in normal cases, Chinese manufacturers maintain competitive advantages.”

With these production prices per kWh and adding a 60% tariff, even the highest estimate of Chinese manufacturer pricing still falls below the highest estimate of US manufacturer pricing.

With that in mind, it may seem like the best option for companies to purchase Chinese-manufactured BESS right now, while the pause is active, but there is no certainty that this will be the safest bet.

After the pause, the tariffs could be drastically reduced, eliminated completely, or reach even higher levels than before.

Ultimately, Ji believes things will work out well for the energy storage industry, but current factors are leading to indecision.

“One data point shared at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance Summit is that 69% of batteries sold in the US last year were manufactured in China.”

“Comparing to the solar industry, we are still heavily relying on Chinese-made batteries. These ongoing situations have people putting things on hold a bit. Eventually, things will shake out fine, but right now there’s a lot of noise, making it hard to make investment decisions.”

A similar sentiment was recently shared by Daniel Finn-Foley, director of energy storage market intelligence for advisors Clean Energy Associates (CEA), on LinkedIn, saying:

“The tariff pause is not a starting gun – it’s a false start. No one wants to be the chump who imported from China at 30% when, for all we know, the rate may be 0% in three months. Likewise, no one wants to be the sucker who didn’t import at 30% when the rate jumps to 54% or more in three months, or sooner. The result? Paralysis.”

Growth without policy framework

The MN8 head of structuring believes that a full repeal of the IRA is unlikely to occur because of how solar and wind-related ITCs and PTCs have historically been supported bipartisanly.

Red states have benefited from renewables because they have the land needed to support such projects, bringing jobs and other benefits to local communities.

Additionally, doing away with the IRA does not completely doom energy storage project development.

As Ji notes:

“Batteries were getting built even before the IRA existed. The standalone battery ITC is new from the IRA.”

Ji remains hopeful that domestic manufacturing will increase, saying:

“My guess is maybe eventually you’ll need to reach certain domestic content levels to get a basic ITC – that’s one way to incentivise domestic production and manufacturing jobs. That’s what this administration is trying to do.”

Another factor that Ji brings up is the replacement of gas and coal plants in the face of a growing load demand from data centres.

“Even if the unimaginable happens and we lose ITC completely, solar and storage aren’t going anywhere. Our grid demand isn’t just policy-driven – we have ageing coal and gas fleets that need replacement, plus load growth from hyperscalers and data centres with environmental commitments.”

Data centres, fossil fuels and Texas

A December 2024 report from the US Department of Energy (DOE) found that:

“Data centres consumed about 4.4% of total US electricity in 2023 and are expected to consume approximately 6.7 to 12% of total US electricity by 2028. The report indicates that total data centre electricity usage climbed from 58 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023 and estimates an increase between 325 to 580 TWh by 2028.”

While many data centre developers opt to build on-site renewable energy, many more use fossil-fuel technologies.

The Trump administration has also championed expanding AI and fossil fuels.

With more complications in developing renewable energy technologies and eased restrictions on fossil fuels, the idea of data centres and renewables, like BESS, growing together seems further away. Additionally, data centres prioritise their own energy needs.

Ji says of these issues:

“Regarding the administration’s fossil fuel support – Democrats are more pro-renewable and environmental issues, but for the last decade, people understand we need all-of-the-above solutions.”

“You can’t sustain the grid with just renewable and battery – you have intermittency issues. Look at Germany – moving too fast can cause issues if things aren’t well planned.”

Ji continues:

“The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) easing environmental requirements on coal and gas has led utilities to delay coal and gas retirements. The real challenge is the interconnection queue – mostly solar and storage assets, but it’s so backlogged you can’t get projects built for five to seven years.”

“Meanwhile, we want to lead in AI innovation and data centres, which need generation capacity. Gas turbine orders are backlogged into 2029 and beyond.”

Because of these backlogs in the interconnection queue, Ji explains that gas and coal will naturally be running for longer, which she says is needed for reliability, but can also help to bridge the gap for renewables.

Ji explains two points from the panel, the first being that using surplus interconnection service for gas peakers, peak demand in Texas can be met by adding BESS without having to build new interconnection.

The second point is making loads more flexible. Ji cites a Duke University study showing that making load 0.5-1% more flexible in Texas could enable another 15GW of load without new generation.

Ji and MN8 maintain that despite the industry’s current challenges, energy storage will continue to grow. She says of MN8:

“We’re staying strong and planting seeds for long-term growth. We’re working with hyperscalers and partners on 24/7 clean energy solutions, which doesn’t exist yet but everyone’s working toward.”

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit reported that the funding freeze had forced them to furlough staff and suspend operations critical to local well-being.
Judge Gergel’s ruling underscored the limits of executive authority and reinforced the constitutional role of Congress in allocating public funds.
The Trump administration indicated it plans to appeal the ruling on jurisdictional grounds, signaling a likely escalation to higher courts.
In the meantime, affected organizations across the country may now begin the process of resuming programs critical to environmental justice, climate action, and community resilience.","In a decisive legal blow to the Trump administration’s rollback of environmental programs, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Gergel ruled Monday that $176 million in federal grant funding must be restored to 13 nonprofit organizations and six municipalities. The grants, which had been frozen earlier this year under executive orders issued by President Donald Trump, were originally awarded through landmark legislation including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

The ruling is one of the first final judgments challenging the administration’s sweeping efforts to halt climate and equity-related initiatives by targeting federal agencies and revoking congressional appropriations. The decision comes in response to a lawsuit filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) and the Public Rights Project on behalf of affected organizations and communities stretching from Baltimore to San Diego.

“This is a huge victory for these organizations who can now get back to work improving their communities,” said Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “While defendants have announced their intent to appeal this ruling, SELC’s team is energized and ready to continue this fight all the way to the Supreme Court until all the grants represented in our case are restored once and for all.”

The grants had supported a wide range of environmental and community programs, from public health initiatives and housing projects to clean energy investments and support for farmers. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit reported that the funding freeze had forced them to furlough staff and suspend operations critical to local well-being.

“Continued freezes and disruptions to our work would be catastrophic and equivalent to the government turning its back on the housing, jobs, and other economic, environmental, and social impacts that are set to be delivered,” said Bryan Cordell, executive director of the Sustainability Institute in North Charleston, South Carolina.

The Trump administration halted the grants through a series of executive orders including “Unleashing American Energy,” “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,” and “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative.” These actions, the plaintiffs alleged, amounted to “unlawful interference by the executive branch” and a violation of the First Amendment, which protects free speech.

In court filings, the administration ultimately conceded to the plaintiffs’ claims on 32 of the 38 contested grants, a move that preceded Judge Gergel’s announcement that he would enter a final judgment ordering the restoration of those funds. The ruling was issued following a hearing in Charleston, South Carolina.

The grants in question were awarded under the IRA and IIJA, two major legislative achievements of the Biden administration that allocated billions of dollars toward environmental resilience, clean infrastructure, and climate-smart agriculture. The remaining six grants—funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Climate-Smart Commodities program—were not reinstated in this ruling, having been terminated in April amid administration claims of “inefficient spending” and misalignment with policy priorities.

Nonetheless, the SELC vowed to continue pressing the case. The court signaled it would consider the legality of those grant cancellations after further testimony is presented.

The lawsuit named several Trump administration departments and officials as defendants, including the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Agriculture, Department of Transportation, and the Department of Government Efficiency, which was established under Trump’s direction to cut spending across federal programs. The EPA and USDA declined to comment on the pending litigation, while other departments did not immediately respond to media inquiries.

Judge Gergel’s ruling underscored the limits of executive authority and reinforced the constitutional role of Congress in allocating public funds. “A ruling that reaffirms that the executive branch doesn’t have the authority to disregard Congress,” said Meyer.

The case also sets a potential precedent for future conflicts between Congress and the executive branch over funding decisions and policy implementation. As legal challenges to the administration’s broader deregulatory agenda continue to unfold, the outcome of this case may serve as a benchmark in defining the balance of power between branches of government.

The Trump administration indicated it plans to appeal the ruling on jurisdictional grounds, signaling a likely escalation to higher courts. In the meantime, affected organizations across the country may now begin the process of resuming programs critical to environmental justice, climate action, and community resilience.

“This is a huge victory for us today,” Meyer said. “A ruling that reaffirms that the executive branch doesn’t have the authority to disregard Congress.”",https://i0.wp.com/s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/21102947/origin.jpg?fit=900%2C641&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-21 14:13:43.305431

Affordable, reliable energy is the engine of American prosperity.

It powers our homes, drives economic growth, and fuels innovation. But in the recent past, misguided policies have driven up costs and limited access to the energy everyone depends on.

Building a stronger economy and expanding opportunity begins with an all-of-the-above energy strategy that unleashes innovation, promotes competition, and lets people — not bureaucracies — choose the future.

Why electricity costs keep climbing

Electricity costs are rising — not just because of global events, but also due to anticompetitive policies that stifle competition and drive up prices.

One example is right-of-first-refusal laws, or ROFR, which allow existing utilities to bypass competitive bidding on new transmission projects. Without competition, costs go up and innovation slows — leaving consumers with higher bills and fewer choices.

At the same time, mandates are forcing the rapid replacement of reliable fossil fuel plants with intermittent sources like wind and solar. These require costly equipment and storage systems, with expenses passed on to ratepayers.

During the Biden administration, federal regulators finalized a number of appliance rules that limited your choice of stoves, dryers, and water heaters — a top-down approach that increases costs and reduces financial freedom in the home.

Unlocking American energy through innovation and reform

There’s a better path forward — one that gives Americans access to the full range of energy options and lets innovation lead the way.

By embracing innovation, reforming harmful regulations, and trusting markets over mandates, energy can be more abundant and affordable for everyone. Central to this vision is embracing an all-of-the-above-energy strategy that allows all energy sources — from fossil fuels to renewables — to compete on equal footing.

Here’s how America can get there:

End anticompetitive policies like ROFR: Eliminating ROFR laws would allow more companies to compete to build and maintain energy infrastructure. That means better service, more innovation, and lower costs for consumers.

Discover the energy sources that power America: Streamlining permitting across all energy sectors would eliminate delays and make it easier to explore, extract, and develop resources. Real permit reform would bring certainty to investors that could drive down costs.

Rethink electricity policy: Our electric grid is under pressure. As fossil fuel plants are retired and intermittent sources like wind and solar are added, costs continue to climb — and consumers are stuck with the bill. Instead of mandates and subsidies, America needs energy policies that allow all sources to compete on a level playing field, reward efficiency, and invest in grid reliability.

Protect consumer choice: Washington shouldn’t control your kitchen or laundry room. The current Congress recently passed three pieces of legislation that revoked energy conservation standards for appliances and an additional bill that revoked certification and labeling requirements for other consumer products. President Trump signed all four into law. These Biden administration rules would have limited consumer choice and raised costs.

Abundant, affordable, and reliable energy for all Americans

Americans for Prosperity is fighting for a future where energy is no longer a constraint, but a catalyst for prosperity.

Here’s how AFP is working to make that future a reality:

Reform government: End arbitrary regulations that stifle innovation and economic growth.

Reform policy: Replace top-down mandates with bottom-up solutions that empower communities.

Build a movement: Educate Americans about the importance of energy freedom and environmental stewardship.

Energy abundance is within reach — but only if we remove the barriers standing in the way and open the door to greater innovation.",https://americansforprosperity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AdobeStock_523943302-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-05-21 18:12:57.092235

Zacks Investment Research","U.S. auto biggie Ford F is scaling back its electric vehicle (EV) ambitions once again—this time by opening the doors of its battery plant to a rival. In a move that highlights the growing pressure facing automakers, Ford will allow Japan’s Nissan NSANY to use part of its underutilized Kentucky battery facility. This factory was originally part of Ford’s $7 billion EV investment push in 2021, built in partnership with South Korea’s SK On. Today, one plant sits idle, and only a portion of the other is producing batteries. Now that part will make batteries for both Nissan and Ford.

Partnering with Nissan will help absorb excess capacity.Nissan incurred a $4.5 billion loss in the last reported quarter and just scrapped plans for a battery plant in Japan. Local U.S. production will help reduce its tariff exposure, which is a strategic move by Nissan.

Nissan’s peer Honda HMC is also rethinking its EV roadmap. As global demand cools, Honda is slashing its EV and software investment target by nearly a third and pivoting toward hybrids. Honda now plans to launch 13 new hybrid models globally by 2030, while scaling back expectations for fully electric vehicles.

These moves underscore the challenges Ford and other automakers are facing as EV demand stalls and costs climb. Ford has suspended its full-year 2025 guidance, citing tariff-related uncertainties. The company incurred a $5.07 billion EV loss in 2024, and we expect another $5 billion at least in red ink this year.

At this stage, investors may be wondering if the automaker still has a compelling long-term case. Let’s dig into the investment thesis.

Headwinds Ford Can't Ignore

Ford is navigating through some tough terrain. One of the biggest hurdles is the impact of Trump tariffs, which are expected to cost the company a staggering $2.5 billion. While Ford plans to cushion the blow by offsetting $1 billion through various efficiency and cost-cutting measures, the remaining $1.5 billion hit in 2025 looms large. With potential retaliatory tariffs and ongoing supply chain disruptions, the road ahead remains unpredictable. On a broader scale, tariffs could slash U.S. auto industry sales by around 500,000 units, a drop that would undoubtedly weigh on Ford’s own sales and bottom line.

The traditional Ford Blue division, which sells gas-powered vehicles, is also showing signs of fatigue. The company anticipates lower sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles this year compared to 2024 A shift in product mix, combined with foreign exchange headwinds, is expected to further compress profits.

At the same time, Ford’s ambitious investments in green mobility and autonomous driving technology — while vital for the future — are taking a toll on its short-term financial flexibility. The company is pouring billions into modernization efforts, including digital infrastructure, IT systems and product rollouts. As a result, cash flow pressure remains a near-term concern for investors.

Silver Linings in Ford’s Playbook

Still, not everything is working against Ford. A standout bright spot is its Ford Pro division, which serves commercial and fleet customers. The segment is showing robust demand, backed by strong demand for its Super Duty truck. The integrated offering across vehicles, software, and physical services is gaining traction and could be a major growth engine in the years ahead. Ford’s sharpened focus on software and service-led revenues underpins a powerful long-term shift in its business model.

Then there’s Ford’s strong liquidity cushion. The company exited the first quarter of 2025 with $27 billion in cash and about $45 billion in total liquidity. The company is on track to deliver $1 billion in cost savings this year, excluding the impact of tariffs.

Finally, Ford’s dividend yield of over 5% offers a compelling case for income-focused investors, especially when compared to the S&P 500’s average yield of just over 1%. With a plan to return 40-50% of free cash flow to shareholders, Ford is reinforcing its commitment to delivering consistent returns, even as it reshapes its business for the future.

Price Performance, Valuation and Estimates for F

Shares of Ford have declined around 11% over the past year against the industry’s gain of 29%.

From a valuation standpoint, Ford trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 0.27, below the industry as well as its own 5-year average. F carries a Value Score of A.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for F’s 2025 earnings implies a 38% drop year over year. Here’s how the EPS estimates for 2025 and 2026 have been revised over the past 60 days.

Estimate Trend for Ford

Conclusion

Ford’s latest move to share its battery plant with Nissan underscores the shifting ground beneath the EV market. While near-term headwinds—from tariffs to weakening ICE sales to heavy investment outlays—pose real challenges, Ford’s strengths should not be overlooked. Its Ford Pro segment, solid liquidity and generous dividend support the case for long-term stability. Still, the road to transformation is costly and uncertain. With mixed signals across its business, Ford remains a wait-and-watch story for now.

Existing investors may want to hold their positions, while potential buyers should wait for clearer signs of progress in margins, EV strategy and cost control.

Ford stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Stephan will be moderating a panel on another highly relevant reform process for BESS, the capacity market (CM), at next month’s inaugural Energy Storage Summit Germany 2025 in Stuttgart, 3-5 June.
The partnership combines Enertrag’s experience in developing renewables and Green Flexibility’s expertise in BESS, Green Flexibility said.","“We have to reform the system used to impose network tariffs. Firstly, the number of users paying the full tariff is getting smaller and smaller, while costs continue to rise. Secondly, we do not have sufficiently effective signals as to how and where installations can be operated cost-effectively in order to avoid an unnecessarily expensive rollout of the networks. Thirdly, the current system has no incentives to reward flexible behaviour, but rather the opposite,” said Klaus Müller, president of the Bundesnetzagentur.

“Our aim is to make the network tariff system fit for the future and adapt it to the challenges of the energy transition. We are at the start of our decision-making process and are going into it with an open mind as to the outcome.”

Currently, tariffs are only paid by final network consumers and the Bundesnetzagentur is considering how the tariffs could be paid by those feeding in electricity into the grid to spread the cost amongst more payers. Options being considered are standing charges, capacity prices and dynamic network tariffs based on time-related local price signals, such as time-of-use network tariffs.

Energy storage facilities are currently exempted from the network tariffs until 2029 and the regulator wants to come up with a long-term framework that is appropriate for the technology and helps it integrate properly into the grid.

“For the electricity system, it would therefore make sense to find a grid tariff regime for storage that restricts activity in the electricity and system service markets as little as possible while simultaneously providing a cost-reflective financing contribution to the grid,” a discussion paper released by the Bundesnetzagentur said.

TSOs to open up inertia market

In related regulatory news that would have big implications for energy storage, German transmission system operators (TSOs) will start to pay battery energy storage system (BESS) resources for inertia services starting next year.

System integrator Fluence’s director for marketing, policy and public affairs EMEA Lars Stephan said that, while the final price is to be determined, it means those deploying BESS now should seriously considering including grid-forming capabilities to be ready to provide it (in a post about the new regulation on LinkedIn).

German TSOs, of which there are four, will pay BESS and other resources for inertia capability based on a fixed price to be published by 28 January 2026 latest. The price will be valid for two years and the next prices will be published a minimum of six months in advance, Stephan said.

Contracts with TSOs will be 2-10 years, and payments based on availability will be made annually with higher payments for those with over 90% availability. There will be four different products and BESS will likely go for the best-paid ‘premium product, he added. BESS will have to comply with a specified technical definition for inertia.

Stephan will be moderating a panel on another highly relevant reform process for BESS, the capacity market (CM), at next month’s inaugural Energy Storage Summit Germany 2025 in Stuttgart, 3-5 June.

For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600.
Then there’s the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems.","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Helio Castroneves felt an immediate difference — a subtle but noticeable uptick in speed — the first time he utilized the boost of horsepower offered by IndyCar’s novel hybrid engines around the imposing oval of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The question now facing the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, along with the rest of the drivers on the 33-car starting grid for the 109th running on Sunday, is how best to capitalize on the hybrid over 200 laps spent entirely on edge.

Empty it entirely and then wait for it to recharge, which might take several laps? Save it for short bursts for passes or to defend? Perhaps use it slowly to run down the leader or build a big advantage once out front?

“There is so much more that goes into this than I think people realize or recognize,” acknowledged Indy 500 veteran Graham Rahal, whose father Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race. “It’s an interesting thing. I mean, the hybrid, it’s quite powerful here. On a single lap if you utilize it correctly, it does make a hell of a difference in lap time or lap speed.”

The genesis of the hybridization began years ago, when IndyCar manufacturers Chevrolet and Honda wanted to better align their racing programs with a shift in consumer demand toward hybrid and electric vehicles. But the project was beset by delays as engineers struggled to fit a bespoke hybrid unit into the IndyCar chassis designed more than a decade ago, and that had to meet certain requirements for weight and safety, among other things.

The result was finally unveiled before last year’s Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries. It provides a quick boost to the existing 2.2-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 engines before recharging to be used again.

The system was introduced at Mid-Ohio midway through last year’s IndyCar season and has been in use ever since.

But it has never been used somewhere like Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds at the end of each straight can hit 240 mph, and the difference between winning and losing can be measured in thousandths of a second.

“I’ve had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it’s going to be at Indianapolis,” IndyCar president Doug Boles said. “I asked why and they say, ‘Well, you think about Indianapolis, how trimmed out we are — especially in qualifying — any incremental difference in horsepower makes a difference.

“We’re going to see some exciting racing,” Boles continued, “and the strategies that I have heard from drivers in terms of talking about how to deploy the hybrid vary wildly. It’s going to be fascinating to watch how this goes.”

It hasn’t gone without its share of problems, either, dating to an open test last month and right through practice Monday.

For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600. And all of that weight is in the back of the car, which has dramatically altered the way they are balanced and ultimately perform.

“That’s a lot of mass percentage-wise you are adding,” two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden said. “It’s almost like adding 200, 250 pounds to a stock car. If you said, ‘Hey, guys, we’re going to bolt 250 pounds to these stock cars, see what you think,’ I bet they would all go, ‘OK, this drives differently.’ And now we have to counteract it.”

Andretti Global driver Kyle Kirkwood is among many who believe the additional weight makes cars harder to drive, and Meyer Shank Racing’s Marcus Armstrong said, “I do believe the window is considerably smaller, the balance window.”

Armstrong crashed in practice last Saturday and had to squeeze into the field in a backup car on Sunday.

Then there’s the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems. Rinus Veekay’s hybrid didn’t work at all during his first qualifying run for the final row of the starting grid, while 2008 winner Scott Dixon had his practice Monday cut short after just six laps when a warning light blinked for an overheating issue.

Nevertheless, the hybrid technology will play a part in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” on Sunday. And if it comes down to the final laps, it could be a big part, as the leader tries to hold on and the chasers try to time their boost for a winning pass.

“I think it definitely adds some variables,” said Dixon, who will start on the second row. “If you’re sitting out front, you could be a bit of a sitting duck, especially if everybody is kind of recharged and ready to go behind you.

“I think the biggest thing that we’ve probably all learnt so far, you’ve got to be ready for change, is probably the biggest thing,” he added. “But I think it could ultimately change how the end of the race plays out.”

It’s all on the chopping block. The House GOP is moving closer to a final vote on Trump’s tax package, before it heads to the Senate.

If Congress passes the tax bill as it stands, it could cost the US more than 830,000 jobs that would otherwise be created in the coming years, the think tank Energy Innovation found. The impacted jobs are mostly in construction and manufacturing, building factories and components for EVs, wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and other clean energy products — the vast majority of which are in GOP states and districts.

It also threatens an eye-popping amount of investment from companies that piggybacked on the passage of the 2022 clean energy bill, also known as the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We’re talking about an awful lot of money — approaching a trillion dollars in private sector investment that’s either been made or has been planned — that is at risk,” said Robbie Orvis, Energy Innovation’s senior director of modeling and analysis.

The threatened funds are in the same places the jobs are at risk; nearly 80% of the investment sparked by the law is in Republican areas, according to data from the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bottom line, that’s what the new tax bill is, essentially: a repeal of the clean energy provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, according to independent analysis from the two nonpartisan think tanks.

“It’s functionally equivalent to a full-out repeal,” Orvis said, adding the current bill proposed by House Republicans is a “sledgehammer on steroids.”

It would hurt Republicans the most.

Republicans represent 14 of the top 20 congressional districts that are on the cusp of gaining the most jobs from the law, which was championed by former President Joe Biden.

Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas, among others, have gained most of the new jobs in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing and could stand to lose the most if tax credits disappear.

Rep. Mark Amodei, whose Nevada district alone is poised to gain more than 20,000 jobs in mining, refining and processing lithium for EVs and batteries, previously told CNN that continuing to fund these facilities in his district is “fundamental.”

Orvis said the Republican tax bill could not only hurt future projects, it will likely hurt existing manufacturing facilities as well.

“Some of the proposed language in the (bill) text actually puts existing facilities at risk because they will no longer qualify to receive some of the tax credits that they got financing on,” Orvis said.

The cost of electricity for everyday Americans and businesses would also go up; Energy Innovation found wholesale electricity prices would increase by 50% by 2035. This is in large part because solar and wind energy are cheaper than fossil fuels.

Rhodium’s analysis found the GOP bill would slash the amount of new clean energy on the US electric grid by 57-72% through 2035.

Cutting cheaper wind and solar will raise American’s energy bills, analysts said.

“You don’t worry about (price volatility) with wind and solar; the sun is still free,” Rhodium analyst Ben King told CNN. “By shifting away from renewables and back to natural gas, you are exposing yourself to price volatility as well.”

Some Republican lawmakers have voiced concerns that repealing the tax credits could hurt electricity generation at a time when the US needs more power than ever. The AI boom is gobbling up electricity for data centers, and companies are on the hunt for electrons wherever they can find them.

That’s the central argument solar CEOs have been making to Republican lawmakers as they’ve pleaded with them to keep the credits intact.

“Solar is the most effective form of energy going forward; it’s the fastest and cheapest to market,” said Zaid Ashai, CEO of solar company Nexamp. “The reality is we’re in this economic competition with China. The only way to win the technology and AI race is to be energy independent, and solar is a really key component of that.”

Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is allowing Nissan to use part of its battery manufacturing facility in Kentucky amid a slowdown in electric vehicle demand, according to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report.

This Kentucky plant is one of two battery factories Ford launched in 2021 as part of a $7 billion investment in partnership with South Korea’s SK On. Currently, one of these plants is idle and the other is only partially operational.

According to the WSJ, Nissan will utilize part of the operational plant to produce batteries domestically, helping it avoid tariffs on imported EV components and reduce costs amid financial challenges, including a $4.5 billion loss in the first quarter and plans to lay off 20,000 workers.

Ford expects to report a $5 billion loss for its EV unit this year after posting a $5 billion loss in 2024.

Earlier this month, it suspended its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainty around the impact of tariffs on imported EV vehicle parts.

The Ford-SK On venture received a $9.63 billion loan from the US Department of Energy to support the construction of the Kentucky and Tennessee plants, which were expected to generate over 12,000 jobs. Ford said plans for the Tennessee site are unchanged.

(AP) — Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration doubles down on fossil fuels.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California’s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.

Thune said California’s “are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation’s energy supply.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.

Here’s what to know:

Why can California set its own standards?

The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions standards for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.

California has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.

Trump rescinded California’s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden’s administration restored it in 2022.

What do the standards do?

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.

The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.

The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.

New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.

What do the auto and trucking industries say?

Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state’s tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars if it gets blocked and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate’s upcoming vote.

The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.

“Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,” Mike Stanton, the group’s president and CEO, wrote in a letter.

The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.

“While transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,” said Josh Lovelace, the group’s national director.

Can the grid handle more electric vehicles?

Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation’s grid can’t handle California’s plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California’s struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.

“Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,” he said in a statement announcing the vote.

Newsom’s administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.

But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state’s growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state’s electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state’s transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an “unprecedented rate.”

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California’s plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state’s previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California’s, saying the pace wasn’t realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state’s EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

But scientific data on how warming will impact the people, environment and economy in the U.S. may become harder to access.

In the past few months, the Trump administration has dismantled many programs and resources related to climate change — and even purged the phrase “climate crisis” from federal websites.

One recent target is the nation’s biggest climate report.

Late last month, the administration dismissed hundreds of volunteers working on the next National Climate Assessment, a report required by Congress every four years that shows how global warming is affecting regions across the U.S.

About 400 scientists, economists and tribal leaders had already begun work on the sixth assessment, which was scheduled to be released in late 2027 or early 2028.

The action fits into a larger pattern: Since taking office, the Trump administration has fired federal scientists, overrode environmental regulations on pollution and ended efforts to collect data on greenhouse gas emissions and billion-dollar disasters — and even recently proposed cutting funding to one of the nation’s oldest observatories for climate pollution in Hawaii.

Earth’s surface temperature has been 1.5° Celsius hotter than the pre-industrial average for nearly all of the past two years. This warming is mostly due to fossil fuel burning, deforestation and animal agriculture.

The National Climate Assessment has offered a status check on the environment, with concise messages and graphics informed by the latest scientific research.

The fifth assessment was published in 2023. It included a chapter on the Southeast.

“It’s kind of, unfortunately, the perfect storm for a worst-case scenario for much of the Southeast,” said Janey Camp, a research professor and adaptation specialist at the University of Memphis who helped author the chapter. “There are all these compounding factors that’s putting people and the ecosystems at risk.”

The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state’s growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state’s electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state’s transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an “unprecedented rate.”

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California’s plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state’s previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California’s, saying the pace wasn’t realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state’s EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

Stellantis has announced a $388 million investment to establish a Metro Detroit Megahub in Van Buren Township, Michigan. This facility aims to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of its Mopar service parts distribution network. Scheduled for completion in 2027, the hub will incorporate advanced technology, including AutoStore systems, to create a modern and safe working environment for employees.

The AutoStore system employs compact robots that move along tracks above a dense grid of storage bins. These robots retrieve parts and deliver them to workstations where employees handle packing and processing for final shipments. This automation boosts order speed and accuracy, optimizes storage, and accelerates delivery times for customers and dealers.

Darren Bradshaw, senior vice president and head of Mopar North America, stated, ""Our customers count on us to deliver the right part, at the right time, every time."" He added that the Metro Detroit Megahub is designed to build a faster, smarter, and more reliable parts distribution network prioritizing customer needs. The investment underscores Stellantis' commitment to innovation, sustainability, and operational excellence while creating a high-tech workplace for employees.

The workforce for this new hub will include employees from existing locations in Center Line, Warren Sherwood, Milwaukee PDCs, and Marysville. Approximately 488 UAW-represented workers will transition to this new facility. Employees from Marysville will move to Warren and Warren Sherwood PDC locations until full integration into the Megahub is complete.

As part of its consolidation strategy, Stellantis recently sold its Michigan parts distribution centers in Center Line and Marysville as well as one in Milwaukee. Operations at these sites will continue under a sale-leaseback agreement until the new facilities are ready. This move aligns with Stellantis' long-term plan to modernize its service parts distribution network for improved efficiency.

This investment builds upon Stellantis' 2023 UAW contract agreements which have already seen nearly $120 million invested in strengthening parts operations. This includes a new facility in East Fishkill, New York, and enhancements to existing PDCs. The latest commitment further emphasizes Stellantis' dedication to advancing its distribution network.

Mopar's Legacy

Mopar is globally recognized as Stellantis' brand for genuine parts and accessories. Originating in 1937 as an antifreeze product line name combining ""MOtor"" and ""PARts,"" Mopar has evolved over 85 years into a symbol of vehicle care and performance enhancement worldwide. It gained prominence during the 1960s muscle-car era with performance parts enhancing speed for both road use and racing.

Today Mopar integrates service parts with customer-care operations enhancing support worldwide.

(May 21, 2025) — When Michael McGlue, Ph.D., took the helm of the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) last fall, he took on a key role at a pivotal time as Kentucky faces increasingly extreme weather.

“Kentucky really is a paradise for geologists,” said McGlue, Alumni Endowed Professor and KGS director. “There are so many different aspects to the natural environment here that are fascinating. When I took over as director of the 14th Kentucky Geological Survey, a big motivation for me was to push hard on helping the state become more resilient to natural hazards.”

McGlue is leading a bold initiative focused on hazard preparedness, geoscience education and workforce development. At the heart of that agenda is the CLIMBS project, a major initiative funded by the National Science Foundation, uniting multiple Kentucky universities to prepare communities for the intensifying impacts of evolving weather patterns.

“Ultimately, we want our people to be healthy and safe. We want our infrastructure to be strong,” McGlue said. “And so, we need to prepare for extreme weather events that might trigger floods and landslides.”

The CLIMBS project goes beyond modeling environmental threats — it’s preparing students and communities. With funding for educational outreach and student training, McGlue sees the initiative as an important step toward strengthening Kentucky’s geoscience workforce.

“We really need to develop a workforce that has skills in the geosciences,” McGlue said. “That’s something that’s, at the moment, lacking in the state. We really need it to build our workforce moving into the future, to be climate and hazard ready.”

McGlue, a field scientist by background, brings that same philosophy into the classroom and lab.

“I think it’s really important for students to get out in nature and make observations,” McGlue said. “I want them to understand the world that surrounds them, ask good questions and critically think through how to solve problems.”

Students can also engage in projects under the mentorship of seasoned geologists through programs like the Paul Edwin Potter Internship at KGS. The program provides Kentucky university students interested in geoscience and adjacent research areas like geography, public health, data science and engineering the opportunity to get real-world experience and engage in a hands-on research project.

KGS also improves public access to geological data through its user-friendly website with interactive maps and resources for researchers, educators, industry and the general public. KGS researchers are actively engaged in projects that touch energy, water resources, natural hazards, karst, geohealth and more. KGS data are accessible and freely available to all stakeholders.

A tax package House Republicans may pass as soon as this week would kill a slew of consumer tax breaks tied to clean energy, as currently drafted. If it becomes law, households interested in the tax breaks may have to rush to claim them this year, experts said.

Tax breaks on the chopping block include ones for consumers who buy or lease electric vehicles, and others for households that make their homes more energy-efficient.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which made historic investments to combat climate change, created or enhanced those tax breaks.

Most would be terminated after 2025, about seven years earlier than under current law.

""Based on the existing proposed language, if you've been considering an EV or planning to get one, now is the time to do it,"" Alexia Melendez Martineau, senior policy manager at Plug In America, wrote in an e-mail.

Termination of EV tax credits

Halfpoint Images | Moment | Getty Images

Consumers who buy a new EV can claim a tax break worth up to $7,500. One for used EVs is worth up to $4,000. Car dealers can also pass along a $7,500 credit to consumers who lease an electric vehicle.

The House tax proposal would terminate these tax credits after 2025. The Inflation Reduction Act made them available through 2032.

A ""special rule"" would keep the $7,500 credit in place for some new EVs for an additional year, through 2026. However, it would only be available for new vehicles from automakers that haven't yet sold 200,000 EVs. That would disqualify EVs from companies like General Motors (GM ), Tesla (TSLA ) and Toyota (TM ).

About 7.5% of all new-vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2025 were EVs, an increase from 7% a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. Tax credits for EVs have been available in some form since 2008, when George W. Bush approved them.

The Inflation Reduction Act made it easier for consumers to access the EV credit, by allowing dealers to issue the tax break to consumers upfront at the point of sale instead of waiting until tax season. Consumers who buy an EV in the near term would be wise to pick this option, experts said.

""We recommend taking the upfront rebate at the dealership, as it reduces the price you pay now and shifts liability to the dealer to manage getting the credit from the IRS,"" Martineau said.

Axing home efficiency tax credits

House Republicans also aim to axe various tax breaks tied to making existing homes more energy-efficient.

These breaks defray the cost of projects like installing insulation, solar panels, heat pumps, and installing energy-efficient windows and doors, for example.

One — the energy efficient home improvement credit, also known as the 25C credit — is worth up to 30% of the cost of a qualifying project. Taxpayers can claim up to $3,200 per year on their tax returns, with the overall dollar amount tied to specific projects.

Another — the residential clean energy credit, or the 25D credit — is also worth 30% of qualifying project costs. It doesn't have an annual or lifetime dollar, except for certain limits on fuel cells, according to the IRS.

They are currently available through 2032. (The 25D credit phases down to 26% for installations in 2033 and 22% for those in 2034.)

Both tax credits would be repealed after 2025 under the House bill.

The 25C and 25D credits have been available in some form since 1978 and 2005, respectively, according to economists at the Haas Energy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.

More than 3.4 million U.S. households claimed one of the credits in 2023, receiving more than $8 billion, according to the Treasury Department.

Experts recommend that consumers considering a home-efficiency project have it completed by year's end to be able to claim a tax credit.

""If a homeowner was looking to take advantage of the 25C tax credit, under what is being proposed [by the House] they'd need to ensure their system was put in service this year,"" said Kara Saul Rinaldi, president and CEO of AnnDyl Policy Group, an energy and environmental policy strategy firm.

The House tax bill may change

Republicans are eyeing the climate tax breaks as a way to raise money for a sprawling package that also extends measures from President Trump's 2017 tax law and cuts taxes on overtime and tips, for example.

The House tax plan's repeal or modification of clean energy credits — including those for EVs and home efficiency — would raise $707 billion over a decade, according to an analysis published Monday by the Penn Wharton Budget Model.

As drafted, the overall House bill would raise the U.S. deficit by a net $3.3 trillion over a decade, after accounting for spending cuts, Penn Wharton said.

Of course, the tax bill's text may change.

There appears to be dissent from within House Republican ranks over various aspects of the bill. Some of the infighting is tied to the repeal of climate related tax breaks, which have been more popular among consumers than anticipated.

The Senate also needs to pass the measure before it heads to the president's desk.

Last week, the board of the Cape and Islands ferry operator approved a $62,000 fuel expense to try out the renewable fuel on one ferry between June 1 and Sept. 1.

The ""renewable diesel,"" which is not new, but has only recently become available on the East Coast, will be used on the ship M/V Island Home. The ship is the ferry service's largest, and regularly runs between Woods Hole and Martha's Vineyard.

The Steamship Authority said this swap will help reach Gov. Maura Healey's 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target.

"" Everybody in the commonwealth, and everyone everywhere, really, [it's] incumbent on them to do what they can for lowering emissions,"" said Sean Driscoll, spokesperson for the Authority. ""And this is a concrete step that we can take that's right now and right here.""

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found that renewable diesel can reduce ""lifecycle"" greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 78%, according to the Authority's proposal. Lifecycle emissions refer to the the emissions released by a fuel from its production to its use.

The fuel, also know as hydrotreated vegetable oil, is made of fats and oils, like soybean or canola oil, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The renewable diesel is chemically the same as its petroleum counterpart.

The fuel will replace ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel in the ship, and cost 60 cents more per gallon. The ferry's engine manufacturer already endorses the renewable diesel, so the engines do not need to be modified.

The renewable diesel has been available for years on the West Coast, said Driscoll. But the ferry is now able to test it out because Global GLO houses the fuel year-round at a facility in Providence. It will be delivered by the Steamship Authority's existing fuel supplier, according to the proposal before the board.

The Authority said other major ferry operators in the country have found success with the fuel, noting in the proposal that it had been in contact with another operator that recently decided to switch to renewable diesel on all 10 of its ships.

The M/V Island Home runs seven round trips each day, and the Authority expects to use 104,000 gallons of fuel over the trial period, said Driscoll. The ship can carry about 1,000 passengers and up to 75 cars per trip.

"" It is a key part of our fleet, but we do have a high level of confidence in this product based on what we've seen throughout the industry,"" he said.",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/0216_marthasv-09-1000x543.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 15:11:39.451885

They are an opportunity to engage members on the shop floor and educate about the potential benefits of a clean energy transition.","State and local governments have begun taking concrete steps towards a clean energy economy, and for now, even under Trump, green union jobs are increasing.

Meanwhile, unions have partnered with climate activists to win legislation for more such jobs. Six states have passed “climate jobs” bills to expand renewable energy and raise labor standards for that construction. Four more have union coalitions advocating for such legislation.

Will the green surge continue? And if it does, will workers reap the economic benefits—or get left behind?

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act opened the door for clean energy projects across the country. Many IRA tax credits were designed to encourage the use of high-wage union labor. But under the Trump administration, most of this IRA funding is either in limbo or has been canceled outright.

Still, more workers are getting experience on jobs that will be central to the potential clean energy economy of the future.

How do workers feel about these jobs? And are they laying the groundwork for more workers to embrace a clean energy transition?

SOLAR PUZZLE

The solar panels we see on rooftops of public buildings and private homes are relatively easy to install, and unions like the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers have many members with experience in the industry.

IBEW Local 3 has a solar training program based in Long Island, New York, that is required for all apprentices. Chris Schroth, a Local 3 member, says increased solar work provides a hedge against unemployment when there’s a slowdown in construction. These slow periods are happening more frequently: with more people working from home, demand for commercial construction has decreased.

But solar work comes with limitations. The panels can be installed quickly and require very little maintenance, so many workers don’t see them as long-term projects offering stability. And so far, says Schroth, “only a small percentage of our members have worked on solar. So the idea that this kind of work can be an alternative still doesn’t feel real to people.”

Joe Mirkin is an IBEW Local 7 member in Massachusetts, where many members have worked on big solar farms. The jobs are good while they last, and can include a lot of overtime. But Mirkin echoed concerns about their short-term nature. “The work is managed by out-of-town contractors,” he said. “These aren’t long-term careers.”

While more and more IBEW members are working in solar, most solar jobs are still non-union, and they’re often exploitative. Though some non-union solar workers have reached out to the IBEW, according to Mirkin this hasn’t led to new organizing.

Huge strides have been made over the last decade in developing offshore wind. The North Atlantic off New England offers ideal conditions. In Rhode Island, building trades unions supported the development of Block Island Wind, the nation’s largest offshore wind project, and jumped at the chance to use further funding through the IRA.

The Trump administration has blocked all new permits for wind energy development, at least for now. But work on existing projects continues.

Erin Vaughan, a member of IBEW Local 223 in Massachusetts, is currently working to build wind turbines off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. This is part of the Vineyard Wind 1 project, one of 11 offshore wind farms attached together on federal lands.

Generally, Vaughan thinks the working conditions on offshore wind are better than on other projects she’s been part of. But it can be dangerous, as workers deal with huge components in very tight spaces. She had to go through a rigorous six-week training program in four different states.

Vaughan is concerned about the Trump administration’s freeze on offshore wind and other IRA projects. “There’s decades of work out here and I would hate to see it all stopped,” she said.

Compounding this is the shutdown of more nuclear plants. Maintenance of these non-carbon-emitting plants is a big source of employment for IBEW members.

Maintaining existing fossil fuel infrastructure is not enough to substantially increase work, says Vaughan. “If you have the ability to travel for oil refinery maintenance, that’s good, but it doesn’t add many jobs.”

DEEPER ORGANIZING

Of course the clean energy transition we need is not limited to wind and solar. The union officers pushing climate jobs bills are often also advocating for geothermal energy, battery storage, building retrofits, and nuclear power to add to a transition. The United Auto Workers’ recent successes organizing electric vehicle plants are encouraging.

Project Labor Agreements, while great for guaranteeing higher wages on construction work, also contain no-strike clauses and limit workers’ scope of activity on the shop floor. It’s hard for workers to become on-the-job organizers who can take on problems in a context where labor peace with contractors is established from the very start.

ORGANIZING NEEDED

Especially in the current political climate, workers in the building trades need to more aggressively organize non-union clean energy workers. A new clean energy economy is an opportunity for the building trades to bring more of a union culture to these projects and combat longstanding problems like mandatory overtime and speed-up.

The shift to a green economy is also a great opening for unions to do internal education about the benefits to workers of clean energy development. Sometimes this member education can happen in the midst of real-time legislative fights unions are helping to lead.

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO fought for the state’s Act on Climate, which set binding targets for carbon emissions reductions. The act was passed in 2021.

In New York City, the building trades helped pass the Public Solar Bill in September 2024, setting the stage for the installation of 100 megawatts of solar on public buildings by 2030. The Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in Illinois, passed in 2021 with unanimous labor support, contains ambitious climate targets while maintaining a strong commitment to putting unions in the driver’s seat.

The Tennessee Valley Authority on Tuesday became the first American utility to submit a small modular reactor construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The application is a key step in TVA’s plan to build a 300-MW SMR by 2032 at its 1,200-acre Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee. Non-nuclear construction could begin next January “or sooner” as the NRC works through an expected two years of review and six months of public hearings, TVA spokesperson Scott Fiedler said in an email.

TVA aims to begin nuclear construction at Clinch River in late 2028 and commission the new power plant by the end of 2032, “subject to change based on regulatory approval and other factors,” it says.

Dive Insight:

In a statement hailing “a significant milestone for TVA, our region and our nation,” TVA President and CEO Don Moul said the application would accelerate “the development of new nuclear technology, its supply chain and delivery model to unleash American energy.”

TVA says it will be the first U.S. utility to deploy GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 boiling water SMR. The design borrows from larger boiling water reactors developed by GE since the 1960s, but occupies a significantly smaller footprint and incorporates passive safety features that nuclear experts say reduce the risk of safety events.

Advanced nuclear reactors like the BWRX-300 will help power producers deliver the energy needed to support artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing industries, TVA said in a news release announcing the application.

In 2023, TVA said it would form a working group with GE Hitachi, Ontario Power Generation and Synthos Green Energy to develop a standard design for the BWRX-300 and its modular components. The $400 million effort aimed to ready the reactor for deployment in the U.S., Canada, Poland and other countries, TVA said.

“TVA has put in the work to advance the design and develop the first application for the BWRX-300 technology, creating a path for other utilities who choose to build the same technology,” Moul said.

In April, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission approved an Ontario Power Generation application to build the first of four BWRX-300 reactors at its Darlington nuclear power plant site. OPG hopes to begin construction later this year and commission the first reactor in 2029.

In its 2025 draft integrated resource plan, TVA proposed adding up to 1 GW of nuclear capacity by 2035. That would be a small share of a new generation mix dominated by solar (up to 20 GW), gas (up to 19 GW) and energy storage (up to 6 GW).

But TVA appears committed to ensuring nuclear remains part of its energy mix in the future.

“This is not about building an SMR. We are working to develop a technology, a supply chain, a delivery model and an industry that will unleash American energy,” Moul said last month, as TVA announced its application for a $800 million DOE grant to offset some of the Clinch River project’s costs.

The years-long federal permitting process for new reactors is a check on TVA’s — and other reactor sponsors’ — near-term nuclear ambitions. The NRC review of TVA’s construction permit application could stretch into 2028, based on NRC’s generic schedule. If NRC issues the construction permit, TVA could begin building the reactor complex while seeking a separate operating license that NRC says can take up to 36 months to review. A final decision on the operating license might not come until 2031 or early 2032, not far off from TVA’s December 2032 target to power up the reactor.

The BWRX-300 does have a significant advantage over some competing advanced reactor designs: It uses the same low-enriched uranium fuel as the other 94 reactors in the U.S. commercial fleet. That means it can tap into an established, global supply chain for the material.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/FipYmTtpTrfsFdg5FfhBVnHbNC5Eo9qmTnW8r7L_ptU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS80NDAzMzEyODU2X2JiYTU2MTM4YmVfby5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-21 13:19:44.129268

(AP) — Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas powered cars by 2035.

A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump's administration doubles down on fossil fuels.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them first blocked them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California’s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.

Thune said California's “are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation’s energy supply.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.

Here's what to know:

Why can California set its own standards?

The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.

California has some of the nation's worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.

President Donald Trump rescinded California’s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden’s administration restored it in 2022.

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

What do the standards do?

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.

The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.

The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.

New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.

What do the auto and trucking industries say?

Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state's tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate's upcoming vote.

The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.

“Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,"" Mike Stanton, the group's president and CEO, wrote in a letter.

The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.

“While transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,” said Josh Lovelace, the group's national director.

Can the grid handle more electric vehicless?

Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation's grid can't handle California's plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California's struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.

“Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,” he said in a statement announcing the vote.

Newsom's administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.

But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state's growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state's electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state's transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an “unprecedented rate.”

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California's plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state's previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California's, saying the pace wasn't realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state's EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (May 21, 2025) — When Michael McGlue, Ph.D., took the helm of the Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) last fall, he took on a key role at a pivotal time as Kentucky faces increasingly extreme weather.

“Kentucky really is a paradise for geologists,” said McGlue, Alumni Endowed Professor and KGS director. “There are so many different aspects to the natural environment here that are fascinating. When I took over as director of the 14th Kentucky Geological Survey, a big motivation for me was to push hard on helping the state become more resilient to natural hazards.”

McGlue is leading a bold initiative focused on hazard preparedness, geoscience education and workforce development. At the heart of that agenda is the CLIMBS project, a major initiative funded by the National Science Foundation, uniting multiple Kentucky universities to prepare communities for the intensifying impacts of evolving weather patterns.

“Ultimately, we want our people to be healthy and safe. We want our infrastructure to be strong,” McGlue said. “And so, we need to prepare for extreme weather events that might trigger floods and landslides.”

The CLIMBS project goes beyond modeling environmental threats — it’s preparing students and communities. With funding for educational outreach and student training, McGlue sees the initiative as an important step toward strengthening Kentucky’s geoscience workforce.

“We really need to develop a workforce that has skills in the geosciences,” McGlue said. “That’s something that’s, at the moment, lacking in the state. We really need it to build our workforce moving into the future, to be climate and hazard ready.”

McGlue, a field scientist by background, brings that same philosophy into the classroom and lab.

“I think it’s really important for students to get out in nature and make observations,” McGlue said. “I want them to understand the world that surrounds them, ask good questions and critically think through how to solve problems.”

Students can also engage in projects under the mentorship of seasoned geologists through programs like the Paul Edwin Potter Internship at KGS. The program provides Kentucky university students interested in geoscience and adjacent research areas like geography, public health, data science and engineering the opportunity to get real-world experience and engage in a hands-on research project.

KGS also improves public access to geological data through its user-friendly website with interactive maps and resources for researchers, educators, industry and the general public. KGS researchers are actively engaged in projects that touch energy, water resources, natural hazards, karst, geohealth and more. KGS data are accessible and freely available to all stakeholders.

Researchers analyzed data from 662 projects across 83 countries, spanning builds from 1936 to 2024 and totaling $1.358 trillion in investment.

The study covered a wide range of project types. These included thermoelectric power plants fueled by coal, oil or natural gas, as well as nuclear reactors, hydroelectric facilities and wind farms. It also examined large-scale PV and concentrated solar installations, high-voltage transmission lines, bioenergy and geothermal plants, hydrogen production sites, and carbon capture and storage systems.

Researchers modeled projects with minimum thresholds: power plants with more than 1 MW of installed capacity, transmission lines over 10 km, and carbon capture systems processing more than 1,000 tons of CO₂ per year.

In the study, “Beyond economies of scale: Learning from construction cost overrun risks and time delays in global energy infrastructure projects,” published in Energy Research & Social Science, the authors found that energy infrastructure construction takes 40% longer than planned – on average, a delay of roughly two years.

Nuclear power plants had the highest cost overruns and delays, with average construction costs exceeding estimates by 102.5%, or $1.56 billion. Hydroelectric projects followed at 36.7%, then geothermal (20.7%), carbon capture (14.9%), and bioenergy (10.7%). Wind projects averaged a 5.2% cost increase, while hydrogen projects came in at 6.4%.

By contrast, PV plants and transmission infrastructure recorded cost underruns of 2.2% and 3.6%, respectively.

Construction delays also varied by technology. Nuclear, hydro, and geothermal projects experienced average delays of 35, 27, and 11 months, respectively. PV and transmission builds had the best performance, typically completing ahead of schedule or with only minimal delays – averaging one month if delayed at all.

The study concluded that projects exceeding 1,561 MW in capacity face significantly higher cost escalation risks, while smaller, modular renewable builds may lower financial exposure and improve forecasting. Once construction delays surpassed 87.5%, cost increases rose sharply.

“And it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.” Market forces are important in developing new sources but won’t be enough.
It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.
Without access to China’s significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The world’s sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China, leaving the global economy vulnerable to supply cutoffs that could disrupt industry and hit consumers with higher prices, a report said Wednesday.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency’s report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity — but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.

It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86% in 2024 from 82% in 2020.

China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75%. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.

The current trend toward export restrictions and trade disputes increases concerns, the IEA said.

“Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. ”The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.”

Birol cited the energy crisis in Europe after Russia cut off natural gas supplies over the invasion of Ukraine. Another cautionary tale is the global shortage of silicon-based computer chips during and after the pandemic, which disrupted auto production.

“The golden rule of energy security is diversification,” Birol told The Associated Press in an interview. “And it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.”

Market forces are important in developing new sources but won’t be enough. “There is a need for well-designed government policies” in the form of financing and other measures, he said.

China is a massive global source of critical minerals required for a wide range of goods that includes computer chips, robots, electric autos, batteries, drones, and military equipment. It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.

China has placed export limits of many of these key products and tightened controls on others as President Donald Trump’s trade negotiations escalate, stifling U.S. industry and the nation’s ability to find quick alternatives. Without access to China’s significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.

Trump has made reducing U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals a core tenet of his first 100 days back in office as part of a national security and economic resilience agenda.

This goes beyond China; the Trump administration finalized a rocky deal with Ukraine granting American access to the nation’s vast mineral resources earlier this month.

Trump is also looking to expedite deep-sea mining in international waters, much to the chagrin of environmental groups. He called for a boost in the domestic copper industry in a February executive order alongside other calls for the federal government to fast-track new mine permits; has reviewed a minerals proposal from Congo, a conflict-riddled nation also rich with mineral reserves; and attempted to strong-arm Greenland into providing more of its minerals to the U.S.

The IEA report said that global markets were well supplied at the moment and that prices in general have fallen. It warned however that planned production of copper, which is essential for electric wiring and power grids, would not keep pace with demand and predicted a 30% shortfall by 2030.

Dive Insight: The late release of the IRS's guidance on the 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit has slowed the buildout of hydrogen production capacity in the U.S. and likely made the tax credit a harder sell to House Republicans.
These figures include jobs created directly through hydrogen plant operations as well as new natural gas jobs and other positions in chemical and manufacturing supply chains that would be needed to support blue hydrogen production, according to the report.
The 45V tax credit was believed to enjoy relatively bipartisan support in Congress, and Reams said she was surprised to see the House advance a proposal to terminate the tax credit by the end of this year.
“There's a lot of disappointment from companies that were looking forward to blue hydrogen being part of their low-carbon portfolio,” she said.","Dive Brief:

The U.S. has 9.8 million metric tons of annual blue hydrogen production capacity in development — enough to power more than 18 million homes and employ 62,200 people, according to a report by the Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions Forum, a right-leaning advocacy energy group in Washington D.C.

Much of this capacity was prompted by the creation of the 45V tax credit for low-carbon hydrogen production, according to Heather Reams, president of the CRES Forum. Blue hydrogen is derived from natural gas.

Ending the hydrogen tax credit prematurely, as currently proposed by a budget reconciliation bill now before the House Rules Committee, could push the industry overseas and delay the decarbonization of sectors like heavy duty shipping, Reams said.

Dive Insight:

The late release of the IRS's guidance on the 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit has slowed the buildout of hydrogen production capacity in the U.S. and likely made the tax credit a harder sell to House Republicans. But credit's limited track record doesn't mean that it lacks economic value, according to the CRES Forum.

A new report by the CRES Forum estimates that the millions of tons of blue hydrogen production capacity that is in development throughout the U.S. could support 62,200 jobs by the time they came online, while generating $1 billion in federal tax revenue and $400 million in state and local tax revenue.

These figures include jobs created directly through hydrogen plant operations as well as new natural gas jobs and other positions in chemical and manufacturing supply chains that would be needed to support blue hydrogen production, according to the report.

Projects that plan to use water and electricity to make hydrogen, called green hydrogen, would likely also be heavily impacted by the tax credit repeal, though CRES Forum did not have specific numbers on these projects, Reams said.

Blue hydrogen, which refers to hydrogen that is made from natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration to reduce emissions, represents a means for the U.S. to use its existing natural resources in new ways, with fewer carbon emissions, Reams said. The 45V tax credit was believed to enjoy relatively bipartisan support in Congress, and Reams said she was surprised to see the House advance a proposal to terminate the tax credit by the end of this year.

It's not clear that the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, which remains untouched under the current reconciliation proposal, will provide enough incentive for hydrogen producers to continue to invest in their U.S. projects, Reams said.

“There's a lot of disappointment from companies that were looking forward to blue hydrogen being part of their low-carbon portfolio,” she said. “The technology was built around a lot of tax credits making it possible for companies to compete against other countries around the world.”

Reams said she did not see much hope that the 45V funding could be restored in the House version of the bill, and has turned her attention to the Senate, where she hopes to persuade lawmakers that investing in blue hydrogen will help U.S. energy products remain competitive. The Middle East and China have taken a keen interest in blue hydrogen, which could allow countries rich in fossil fuels to make widely used products like fertilizer with fewer carbon emissions, she said.

Moving more hydrogen production overseas could also impact efforts to decarbonize sectors like shipping and heavy duty industry in the U.S., Reams said.

“We have been talking about decarbonizing shipping and thinking” it could take more than 30 years to get there, she said. “It's a long time. I could be dead by that time. We don't have another type of technology we are talking about that can fill that role in the next 30 years.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/AXnyWEZ_5fe48L8ujLrVg-Tj7grsIt-zyq1rZ9SqRRQ/g:nowe:0:0/c:3000:1694/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNzU0OTA3MjU2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-21 12:28:53.759398

Though it was unsurprising, it was certainly a frightening omen of the environmental destruction he would pursue. While his second presidency is only slightly more than 100 days old, it is already marked by significant attempts to dismantle federal government regulations, especially those in the Environmental Protection Agency set in place to ensure public safety.

In March, the EPA director launched the biggest rollback of regulations since the department’s creation in 1970 to try and bolster U.S. energy and automotive industries. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin publicly declared that his team was taking aggressive action against what he referred to as the “climate change religion” in order to reduce living costs for American families. What Zeldin didn’t say is that supporting deregulation ignores the scientists and scholars who advocate for the “climate change religion,” which will have major consequences.

These regulations are critical safeguards designed to protect the public from chronic disease and health complications associated with pollutant exposure in air and water. By stripping essential environmental regulation law, the Trump administration poses a significant threat to the nation’s health and undermines protections that affect all aspects of life.

In this rollback, Zeldin plans to remove greenhouse gas regulations by reconsidering the 2009 endangerment finding. The finding details that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane present a danger to public health. With this discovery, the United States is responsible for keeping the six greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, legally legitimizing regulations detailed in the Clean Air Act. Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that greenhouse gases threaten humanity’s survival, the EPA is looking to dismantle the endangerment finding and its efforts to restrict emissions from various industries. Dismantling this clause may lead to extensive removal of greenhouse gas emission limitations that are set in place for businesses and the automotive industry. This will directly impact human health, as increased emissions contribute to global warming and worsening food, water and air quality for everyone.

Similarly, Trump rescinded an EPA rule that limits the discharge of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances into waterways. Companies manufacture PFAS, known as forever chemicals, that break down slowly and accumulate in human and animal bodies. The EPA acknowledges the harm that PFAS inflict on human health, citing issues such as reproductive effects, developmental delays in children, increased cancer risk and hormonal imbalances. Despite this, the Trump administration appears unconcerned about their presence in drinking water.

Ironically, when PFAS were found in paper straws, the administration swiftly banned them, ridding citizens of the dangers of PFAS and pushing the U.S. back to plastic straws. In his executive order, Trump detailed the risks associated with PFAS in the straws as a reason to ban them. This inconsistency highlights a troubling hypocrisy: Trump acknowledges the dangers of PFAS when it is convenient for him, but is willing to allow them in drinking water regulations if it will benefit big business. Such an approach suggests the administration is less focused on protecting people from PFAS and more focused on promoting certain political messages while reintroducing plastic.

Among other chemical deregulations, the administration also plans to overturn particle pollution regulations. These were put in place to limit soot from smokestacks that contain chemicals linked to increased respiratory issues and premature death. Coupled with dismantling the “good neighbor plan,” which required states to limit pollution across state lines, the administration risks impacting all states regardless of their individual regulatory policies.

It is undeniable that environmental regulation sometimes hinders the development of sustainability and green energy. As a result, some liberals have suggested that deregulation could make way for further advancements in renewable energy and emission reduction.

For example, siting is the process of locating wind and solar energy plants on new land, which requires regulated permitting, contracts and negotiations within communities. These processes often include government limitations that can completely halt renewable energy projects.

But this specific type of deregulation isn’t what Trump is trying to do. He is cutting protections that keep the American people safe, while planning to entirely remove incentives like tax credits for renewable energy. Further, he will impede the siting of new facilities to support renewable infrastructure.

Human health will suffer for years to come as a result of the Trump administration’s actions against the environment in its continued disregard for regulation and conservation.

In a time where we may feel powerless against the Trump administration’s rampant and haphazard deregulation, the nation’s focus should shift toward a differing alternative to the status quo of environmental regulation. Actionable goals like those in the Green New Deal would be effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change.

Originally introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward Markey, D- Mass., in 2019, it plans to address climate justice while creating high paying and sustainable jobs. Beyond that, it would alleviate the impacts of climate change on marginalized communities and work toward a future with clear sustainability goals. The plan is crucial for laying the groundwork for environmental action in the U.S. for years to come. As a result, Congress must reintroduce and pass this policy framework.

The Green New Deal represents a viable plan for environmental and economic reform, despite Trump’s indignant attitude toward it. In a time when America’s climate impact is critical, this legislation would be successful in protecting our planet and mitigating the impact of the Trump administration’s mass deregulation and environmental neglect.

(AP) — Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas powered cars by 2035.

A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration doubles down on fossil fuels.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

WATCH: Why the red state of Utah is going green and embracing electric vehicles

The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them first blocked them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California’s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.

Thune said California’s “are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation’s energy supply.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.

Here’s what to know.

Why can California set its own standards?

The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.

California has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.

READ MORE: Trump wants to halt the buildout of EV charging stations. Experts say it’s not so simple

President Donald Trump rescinded California’s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden’s administration restored it in 2022.

What do the standards do?

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.

The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.

The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.

New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.

What do the auto and trucking industries say?

Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state’s tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate’s upcoming vote.

The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.

“Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,” Mike Stanton, the group’s president and CEO, wrote in a letter.

The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.

“While transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,” said Josh Lovelace, the group’s national director.

Can the grid handle more electric vehicles?

Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation’s grid can’t handle California’s plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California’s struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.

“Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,” he said in a statement announcing the vote.

Newsom’s administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.

But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state’s growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state’s electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state’s transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an “unprecedented rate.”

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California’s plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state’s previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California’s, saying the pace wasn’t realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state’s EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

The bottom line is that the Trumpers, minus Musk, don't like EVs and neither does the fossil fuel industry.
If the agency considered EVs at all, it was to avoid making them too big a deal.
It was a completely fair, sensible, and legal way to organize the recommended CAFE standards.
The deceptive opportunism of congressional Republicans and Duffy is just stupefying here, calculated to accuse the Biden administration of forcing EVs on an unwilling public.","The presence of Elon Musk in the Trump White House doesn't seem to have affected the administration's general hatred of electric vehicles. Automotive News reports that the Department of Transportation is expected to backtrack on Biden-era Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, revising the numbers to address what Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement was an illegal effort to use ""CAFE standards as a backdoor electric vehicle mandate — driving the price of cars up.""

""Resetting CAFE standards as Congress' intended will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want,"" he added. Duffy's move echoes a complaint lodged in January of 2024 by 120 Republican members of Congress. In a letter to the then-head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the GOP contingent called the CAFE standards an ""out-of-touch de facto EV mandate"" that ""ignores the reality that most Americans still prefer the internal combustion engine vehicle, and the fact there is a lack of consumer demand for EVs.""

We could debate the health of the EV market all we want, but the problem here is that Duffy's DOT — and Republicans in Congress — have grossly distorted what NHTSA actually did back in 2023 when it proposed new standards for cars and light trucks.

I appreciate your patience with the rather dry way I had to set the stage. The bottom line is that the Trumpers, minus Musk, don't like EVs and neither does the fossil fuel industry. Of course, it must also be said that the auto industry has historically battled CAFE standards, with some not-unreasonable arguments about timelines and how building compliance vehicles to hit the government's marks doesn't really serve consumer demand in the US.

Republicans in Congress and Duffy, however, aren't inviting reasonable arguments. They are asking us to enter an upside-down world where those sinister bureaucrats at NHTSA willfully violated the law when they devised their recommendations. Last year, congressional Republicans wrote that despite a ""clear statutory limitation, which NHTSA acknowledged in its proposal, NHTSA accounted for EVs in its regulatory baseline and factored that baseline into its determination of the maximum achievable CAFE standards.""

NHTSA did indeed note the statutory limitation, and carefully so. In fact, by the time the agency got around to issuing its final standards last June — 50.4 mpg by 2031 — it actually reiterated how much attention it had to pay to the law and how any sort of EV mandate was the opposite of what it was pursuing. If the agency considered EVs at all, it was to avoid making them too big a deal.

Thanks to the runaway success of Tesla, one segment of the US auto market is making terrific overall progress on improving MPGs and reducing emissions: passenger cars. NHTSA, under the Biden administration, pointed out that this made it appear as though the industry was ""over-complying"" when what was really going on was that a few pure-EV companies were skewing the baseline analysis.

Taking that into account, NHTSA basically said that passenger cars don't have to increase their MPGs as rapidly as light trucks. It was a completely fair, sensible, and legal way to organize the recommended CAFE standards. And although one could push back on how soon the carmakers would have to meet the 50.4-mpg number (up from the current 39.1-mpg mark), the recommendation was kind of an anti-EV mandate, if you think about it.

The deceptive opportunism of congressional Republicans and Duffy is just stupefying here, calculated to accuse the Biden administration of forcing EVs on an unwilling public. That NHTSA under Biden sought to do neither of those things — and was at pains to focus on keeping more efficient gas-powered SUVs and pickups in the mix — was completely and predictably ignored. Biden's DOT actually didn't want carmakers to have to comply by building a bunch of expensive EVs in the face of ebbing consumer demand.

We can fight over whether 50.4 mpg by 2031 is achievable by any means, and we should, but let's not allow a bunch of Trump-enthralled, EV-hatin' Republicans to twist the facts of how we got here.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-trump-administration-is-twisting-facts-big-time-in-its-latest-attack-on-evs/l-intro-1747774476.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 14:13:56.373924

Josh Stein to oppose legislation that would allow Duke Energy to charge customers upfront costs for new power plants. The nonprofit argued ratepayers should not bear additional risks since Duke has a history of expensive canceled nuclear projects.

Durham-based NC Warn sent a letter to Gov. Josh Stein Tuesday in opposition to S.B. 261, a bill that would eliminate Duke’s 2030 interim carbon reduction goal and allow the company to charge ratepayers for power plants still under construction. The legislation passed the Senate and its language is included in the Senate budget proposal.

“Do not allow Duke Energy to foist the financial risk for high-stakes nuclear speculation onto the backs of electric ratepayers,” NC Warn wrote in the letter. “Investors — not captive customers — should bear the risks for gambling by corporate executives and boards of directors.”

North Carolina allows utilities to recover power plant construction costs every three years in rate cases overseen by the Utilities Commission. S.B. 261 would amend the rate-making process by letting utilities request more frequent rate increases to finance the design, development, and construction of new technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors.

A broad range of advocacy groups across the political spectrum have criticized S.B. 261 for making customers bear risks for projects that may not be completed. NC Warn’s new analysis found Duke has canceled or closed early 19 nuclear reactor projects since the 1970s; the nonprofit estimates they cost at least $8.9 billion.

“After 19 gigantic corporate screwups, will our state leaders sell the public out to benefit Duke Energy yet again?” NC Warn executive director Jim Warren asked.

The Utilities Commission approved $440 million in early development costs for Duke’s two proposed small modular reactor nuclear facilities in its approval of Duke’s carbon plan last fall. The Utilities Commission has conceded SMRs are not a mature technology as there are no operational SMRs in the United States; energy firm NuScale canceled its SMR project in Utah last year due to repeated cost increases after spending $600 million in federal funds.

Conservatives for a Clean Energy Future carried out a poll last month and found more than three-fourths of North Carolina voters oppose allowing utility companies to charge ratepayers upfront costs for expensive power plants even if projects are not completed.

The nonprofit commissioned Raleigh-based political consulting firm Strategic Partners Solutions to ask 650 voters of various political affiliations if they supported the S.B. 261 proposal. Out of 219 polled Republicans, only 14.2% expressed support versus 75.3% opposed; the margins were similar for 218 Democrats included in the poll.

“North Carolina voters of every kind oppose putting consumers on the hook for risky spending on power plants that might never produce a single watt of energy,” Strategic Partners Solutions partner Dee Stewart said in a release. “You don’t buy a house until it’s built, and you don’t pay for a car before it’s available. Big, profitable power companies shouldn’t squeeze North Carolina families and small businesses for a service they haven’t yet delivered.”

Alternatively, some industry trade groups argue SB 261 would make it easier for utilities to provide a broader range of affordable energy sources. The NC Chamber supports SB 261 as a key vote for the 2025 legislative session; Duke is in the lobby group’s highest donor category.

“This marks an important advancement of policy for North Carolina to continue to provide nation-leading reliable, affordable energy for our manufacturers and residents so we can lead in future nuclear generation,” the NC Chamber wrote in a March blog post.

Last spring, energy consultant Edward Burgess submitted a brief to the Utilities Commission on behalf of Stein, raising concerns about Duke’s proposed buildout of small modular nuclear reactors.

Duke earns around 10% in guaranteed profit for capital invested in its projects. Burgess contended the incentive influenced the utility to delay its carbon reduction goal by prioritizing expensive new gas and nuclear infrastructure above cost-effective alternatives.

“All else being equal, the more capital intensive a capacity resource is, the more attractive it should be to shareholders,” Burgess wrote. “In recent years, nuclear resources have tended to become one of the most capital-intensive resources available.. Following the basic economic principles of profit maximization, it should come as no surprise if an investor-owned utility like Duke were biased towards the inclusion of a nuclear resource.”",https://images.portcitydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ncwarn.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 12:29:39.413805

A new plug-in hybrid model may be built by Volvo Cars at its Ridgeland, South Carolina, plant as part of an efficiency move and to tap underutilized production capacity, CEO and President Håkan Samuelsson said on a call with analysts April 29.

The plans are part of the automaker’s strategy to protect profits and cut costs by 18 billion Swedish kronor ($1.8 billion) by 2026.

While Samuelsson recognized an opportunity to offset higher duties on vehicle imports through boosting domestic production, the automaker’s fast-moving cost-cutting plan already resulted in 125 job losses or a roughly 5% reduction of the Ridgeland plant’s workforce of 2,500, a spokesperson for Volvo said in an email to Automotive Dive.

Volvo did not specify tariffs as the primary driver behind its plan to cut expenses, but in a statement, Samuelsson said the actions would make the company stronger and more resilient.

“The automotive industry is in the middle of a very difficult period with challenges not seen before,” he said in the company’s Q1 earnings release. Samuelsson said turbulence in the marketplace prioritized the company’s need to improve cash flow and lower costs.

“While we still have a lot to do, our direction going forward is focused on three areas: profitability, electrification and regionalisation,” he said.

During the call with analysts, Samuelsson said to make better use of Ridgeland’s production capacity, building another vehicle at the plant was needed. The automaker currently builds the EX90, a fully electric SUV for the U.S., and European markets as well as the Polestar 3 EV SUV in South Carolina.

Volvo began producing the EX90 EV in Ridgeland last June but even as more of those vehicles are produced, Samuelsson said it still isn’t enough to meet the factory’s full capacity. The plant can manufacture up to 150,000 vehicles annually.

“So, we need another car, which we will bring in as soon as possible,” he said on the call. But added it won’t be an all-electric vehicle.

Though he did not specify a model, Samuelsson said “it has to be a more conventional plug-in hybrid in a very attractive and popular shape and form, so it can really bring up the volume.” Growing electrified vehicle sales is a priority for Volvo, which wants both EVs and plug-in hybrids to represent between 90% and 100% of its sales by 2030.

An essential key to building upon success in the clean energy space is ensuring we protect what’s working.","This rapid growth in the clean energy space isn’t accidental. It’s the result of smart public policy, historic federal investment, and private-sector innovation, all working together to create cleaner, more affordable, and more resilient energy for all.

I’ve had the privilege of serving on both sides of that progress — at the U.S. Department of Energy, where I helped lead the deployment of clean energy across 28 different grant programs, and now as executive vice president at Climate First Bank, a mission-driven financial institution scaling equitable solar and storage solutions across Florida and beyond.

During my tenure throughout my roles in the clean energy space, one thing has become unavoidably apparent: clean energy is here to stay, and it’s growing fast.

Let’s be clear: clean energy is not just viable, it’s dominant. In 2024, 96% of new energy coming online was carbon-free, with 60% being solar. That’s projected to repeat in 2025. We’re also seeing massive momentum in domestic clean energy manufacturing: more than 176 solar manufacturing and supply chain facilities are operating across the U.S., with nearly 900 clean energy projects underway or retrofitting as of Jan. 20. Thanks to forward-thinking policy, solar has become a growing investment opportunity, with over $1 trillion in private sector capital invested in current and completed projects.

Clean energy now sees twice the economic growth of other sectors, creating good, sustainable jobs. Women and people of color lead that workforce expansion, especially in the Sunshine State.

In fact, Florida ranks in the top five states in nearly every solar category, with a booming contractor network and broad public interest.

The Inflation Reduction Act supercharged this momentum, putting clean energy “on sale” for the next decade with generous tax credits and direct pay incentives. It’s the single largest investment in climate and energy in U.S. history — and it’s delivering.

But this clean energy boom must reach everyone, not just the wealthiest ZIP codes.

At Climate First Bank, we’ve made that our mission. In just three years, we’ve funded over $175 million in solar loans and originated over 4,000 projects — one-third of which serve low — and moderate-income households.

Thanks to new federal tax credits, nonprofits like churches and child care centers can now receive rebate checks for going solar. We’re also helping municipalities, schools, and hospitals seize these opportunities — entities often anchoring resilience in their communities.

As climate-related weather becomes more extreme, clean energy is no longer just about cost savings. Through HUD funding, we’re helping retrofit low-income community centers with solar and storage so they can act as resiliency hubs when the grid goes down due to natural disasters. It’s not just about staying online; it’s about keeping our communities safe.

Despite the progress, a major obstacle remains awareness. Too many households and businesses still assume clean energy is out of reach. They don’t know they qualify or don’t even know where to begin.

That’s why we must celebrate and replicate success. We must continue telling stories of nonprofits, small businesses, and low-to-moderate income families making the switch. We must amplify the message that clean energy is now and is for everyone.

An essential key to building upon success in the clean energy space is ensuring we protect what’s working. The clean energy tax credits driving this transformation are under threat. If we want to maintain momentum, we must contact our representatives and demand that they protect these policies.

I always say it’s amazing what can be accomplished when you decide to position yourself to be a force for good. The opportunity before us is enormous: to build a cleaner, more ethical, more inclusive energy system for all.

The clean energy transition is irresistible and unstoppable. Let’s ensure it’s also equitable. Let’s keep Florida — and America — at the forefront of a future we all deserve.

“ARENA has a vision of reaching 1 terawatt of installed solar PV in Australia by 2050 to achieve our renewable energy ambitions. Projects like this are what we need to get there.”

“Today represents a step towards building Australia’s resilience in the solar value chain as the global demand for renewable energy technologies, products and knowledge intensifies.”

5B CEO David Griffin said this funding would drive down 5B’s Australian production costs by 25% and accelerate 5B’s ability to offer large customers lower cost energy alongside the safety, speed and land efficiencies unique to the 5B Maverick solution.

“It means we can further strengthen our team, creating opportunities from the factory floor, in our field deployment crews, and specialists working on gigawatts of solar farm designs.”

The funding will support the expansion of 5B’s Australian manufacturing capacity in solar to produce at least 200 MW of Maverick units at their Adelaide manufacturing facility over the next three years. The Maverick systems will support the demand for increased deployment of large-scale solar across Australia.

Rhodium’s analysis found the GOP bill would slash the amount of new clean energy on the US electric grid by 57-72% through 2035.","House Republicans are proposing to gut energy savings and clean energy tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill — funds that are creating thousands of jobs in GOP states and saving homeowners money on their bills.

It’s all on the chopping block. The House GOP is moving closer to a final vote on Trump’s tax package, before it heads to the Senate.

If Congress passes the tax bill as it stands, it could cost the US more than 830,000 jobs that would otherwise be created in the coming years, the think tank Energy Innovation found. The impacted jobs are mostly in construction and manufacturing, building factories and components for EVs, wind turbines, solar panels, batteries and other clean energy products — the vast majority of which are in GOP states and districts.

It also threatens an eye-popping amount of investment from companies that piggybacked on the passage of the 2022 clean energy bill, also known as the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We’re talking about an awful lot of money — approaching a trillion dollars in private sector investment that’s either been made or has been planned — that is at risk,” said Robbie Orvis, Energy Innovation’s senior director of modeling and analysis.

The threatened funds are in the same places the jobs are at risk; nearly 80% of the investment sparked by the law is in Republican areas, according to data from the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Bottom line, that’s what the new tax bill is, essentially: a repeal of the clean energy provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, according to independent analysis from the two nonpartisan think tanks.

“It’s functionally equivalent to a full-out repeal,” Orvis said, adding the current bill proposed by House Republicans is a “sledgehammer on steroids.”

It would hurt Republicans the most.

Republicans represent 14 of the top 20 congressional districts that are on the cusp of gaining the most jobs from the law, which was championed by former President Joe Biden.

Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas, among others, have gained most of the new jobs in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing and could stand to lose the most if tax credits disappear.

Rep. Mark Amodei, whose Nevada district alone is poised to gain more than 20,000 jobs in mining, refining and processing lithium for EVs and batteries, previously told CNN that continuing to fund these facilities in his district is “fundamental.”

Orvis said the Republican tax bill could not only hurt future projects, it will likely hurt existing manufacturing facilities as well.

“Some of the proposed language in the (bill) text actually puts existing facilities at risk because they will no longer qualify to receive some of the tax credits that they got financing on,” Orvis said.

The cost of electricity for everyday Americans and businesses would also go up; Energy Innovation found wholesale electricity prices would increase by 50% by 2035. This is in large part because solar and wind energy are cheaper than fossil fuels.

Rhodium’s analysis found the GOP bill would slash the amount of new clean energy on the US electric grid by 57-72% through 2035.

Cutting cheaper wind and solar will raise American’s energy bills, analysts said.

“You don’t worry about (price volatility) with wind and solar; the sun is still free,” Rhodium analyst Ben King told CNN. “By shifting away from renewables and back to natural gas, you are exposing yourself to price volatility as well.”

Some Republican lawmakers have voiced concerns that repealing the tax credits could hurt electricity generation at a time when the US needs more power than ever. The AI boom is gobbling up electricity for data centers, and companies are on the hunt for electrons wherever they can find them.

That’s the central argument solar CEOs have been making to Republican lawmakers as they’ve pleaded with them to keep the credits intact.

“Solar is the most effective form of energy going forward; it’s the fastest and cheapest to market,” said Zaid Ashai, CEO of solar company Nexamp. “The reality is we’re in this economic competition with China. The only way to win the technology and AI race is to be energy independent, and solar is a really key component of that.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2198226822.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-05-21 13:19:09.859431

Utah-based EnergySolutions intends to apply for an early site permit from federal regulators to install new nuclear generation at the retired Kewaunee Power Station in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin, the company said in a statement last week.

The nuclear services company is partnering on the project with WEC Energy Group, which owns the electric and gas utilities We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service.

The early site review could take about two years, followed by a “rigorous permitting process by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,” WEC spokesperson Brendan Conway said in an email. If the project moves forward, construction could begin in the early 2030s and the new plant could come online in 2038 or 2039, he said.

Dive Insight:

The announcement comes amid renewed interest in nuclear to provide low-carbon energy as electricity demand rises. Some of that interest has centered on restarting decommissioned reactors, but much of it is focused on small modular reactors that experts say can be deployed more quickly and less expensively than traditional reactors.

Only a few working small modular reactors exist in China and Russia, but North American companies are racing to design and bring one online.

Conway said there’s no consideration of restarting the old reactor on the site.

“Decommissioning work at the plant has been going on for years,” he said. “It would not be practical to try to restart it.”

Conway emphasized that the companies are “still in the very early stages of this process” and have not made any decisions about which new reactor technologies they might deploy at Kewaunee. Small modular reactors are under consideration, he added.

The amount of new generation EnergySolutions and WEC could bring online and the site’s total hosting capacity is unclear. EnergySolutions CEO Ken Robuck told Wisconsin Public Radio last week that his company was considering expanding the site’s boundary to accommodate “a larger energy center” and had offered to purchase some adjacent properties.

The Kewaunee power plant began operations in 1974 and ran until 2013, when then-owner Dominion Energy Resources shut it down for economic reasons. EnergySolutionsacquired the site in 2022 and began decommissioning and dismantlement operations that are expected to last until 2055.

Robuck cited “rising energy demand driven by data centers, artificial intelligence and industrial growth” as motive for deploying new nuclear at Kewaunee.

Rising power demand is behind recent decisions by the owners of three other idled U.S. nuclear power plants to try to restart operations later this decade.

The highest-profile reactor restart project involves the undamaged 835-MW reactor at Constellation Energy’s Three Mile Island power plant, now called the Crane Clean Energy Center. Microsoft has agreed to purchase all of the power produced at the southern Pennsylvania site for 20 years.

Constellation has said it aims to resume operations at Crane by 2028.

In Michigan, Holtec International could restart the idled reactor at its 800-MW Palisades nuclear plant as soon as this year, despite recent pushback from local residents. Holtec and two electric cooperatives were awarded nearly $3 billion in loan guarantees and grants last year from the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Holtec also plans to deploy two of its own 300-MW SMRs at Palisades in the early 2030s.

Meanwhile, NextEra Energy is exploring a potential restart of the 600-MW reactor at its Duane Arnold power station in Iowa. That plant shut down in 2020 after sustaining exterior damage in a windstorm.

All three plant owners have engaged with the NRC on the proposed restarts. The NRC says it expects to issue its final licensing decision for Holtec’s Palisades project by the end of July.

Crane, Palisades and Duane Arnold are among the most feasible retired U.S. reactors to restart, nuclear experts say. Most other retired reactors are too far into the decommissioning process to restart cost-effectively, even in a world of brisk load growth and higher electricity prices, they say.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/RBwKLnhDhEYA4By3ZjPLGK2Gb40FPw116b4PAIqeRQQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DcmFuZV8xLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-21 12:29:43.154426

The result was finally unveiled before last year’s Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries.
“I’ve had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it’s going to be at Indianapolis,” IndyCar president Doug Boles said.
For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600.
Then there’s the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems.","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Helio Castroneves felt an immediate difference — a subtle but noticeable uptick in speed — the first time he utilized the boost of horsepower offered by IndyCar’s novel hybrid engines around the imposing oval of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The question now facing the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, along with the rest of the drivers on the 33-car starting grid for the 109th running on Sunday, is how best to capitalize on the hybrid over 200 laps spent entirely on edge.

Empty it entirely and then wait for it to recharge, which might take several laps? Save it for short bursts for passes or to defend? Perhaps use it slowly to run down the leader or build a big advantage once out front?

“There is so much more that goes into this than I think people realize or recognize,” acknowledged Indy 500 veteran Graham Rahal, whose father Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race. “It’s an interesting thing. I mean, the hybrid, it’s quite powerful here. On a single lap if you utilize it correctly, it does make a hell of a difference in lap time or lap speed.”

The genesis of the hybridization began years ago, when IndyCar manufacturers Chevrolet and Honda wanted to better align their racing programs with a shift in consumer demand toward hybrid and electric vehicles. But the project was beset by delays as engineers struggled to fit a bespoke hybrid unit into the IndyCar chassis designed more than a decade ago, and that had to meet certain requirements for weight and safety, among other things.

The result was finally unveiled before last year’s Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries. It provides a quick boost to the existing 2.2-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 engines before recharging to be used again.

The system was introduced at Mid-Ohio midway through last year’s IndyCar season and has been in use ever since.

But it has never been used somewhere like Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds at the end of each straight can hit 240 mph, and the difference between winning and losing can be measured in thousandths of a second.

“I’ve had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it’s going to be at Indianapolis,” IndyCar president Doug Boles said. “I asked why and they say, ‘Well, you think about Indianapolis, how trimmed out we are — especially in qualifying — any incremental difference in horsepower makes a difference.

“We’re going to see some exciting racing,” Boles continued, “and the strategies that I have heard from drivers in terms of talking about how to deploy the hybrid vary wildly. It’s going to be fascinating to watch how this goes.”

It hasn’t gone without its share of problems, either, dating to an open test last month and right through practice Monday.

For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600. And all of that weight is in the back of the car, which has dramatically altered the way they are balanced and ultimately perform.

“That’s a lot of mass percentage-wise you are adding,” two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden said. “It’s almost like adding 200, 250 pounds to a stock car. If you said, ‘Hey, guys, we’re going to bolt 250 pounds to these stock cars, see what you think,’ I bet they would all go, ‘OK, this drives differently.’ And now we have to counteract it.”

Andretti Global driver Kyle Kirkwood is among many who believe the additional weight makes cars harder to drive, and Meyer Shank Racing’s Marcus Armstrong said, “I do believe the window is considerably smaller, the balance window.”

Armstrong crashed in practice last Saturday and had to squeeze into the field in a backup car on Sunday.

Then there’s the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems. Rinus Veekay’s hybrid didn’t work at all during his first qualifying run for the final row of the starting grid, while 2008 winner Scott Dixon had his practice Monday cut short after just six laps when a warning light blinked for an overheating issue.

Nevertheless, the hybrid technology will play a part in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” on Sunday. And if it comes down to the final laps, it could be a big part, as the leader tries to hold on and the chasers try to time their boost for a winning pass.

“I think it definitely adds some variables,” said Dixon, who will start on the second row. “If you’re sitting out front, you could be a bit of a sitting duck, especially if everybody is kind of recharged and ready to go behind you.

“I think the biggest thing that we’ve probably all learnt so far, you’ve got to be ready for change, is probably the biggest thing,” he added. “But I think it could ultimately change how the end of the race plays out.”

A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump's administration doubles down on fossil fuels.

RELATED: US House votes to block California's 2035 ban on sale of new gas-powered cars

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them first blocked them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California's policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.

Thune said California's ""are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation's energy supply.""

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.

Here's what to know:

Why can California set its own standards?

The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.

RELATED: California expands its electric school bus fleet as federal freeze paused efforts elsewhere

California has some of the nation's worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.

President Donald Trump rescinded California's ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden's administration restored it in 2022.

What do the standards do?

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.

The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.

The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.

New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.

What do the auto and trucking industries say?

Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state's tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate's upcoming vote.

The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.

""Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,"" Mike Stanton, the group's president and CEO, wrote in a letter.

The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.

""While transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,"" said Josh Lovelace, the group's national director.

Can the grid handle more electric vehicles?

Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation's grid can't handle California's plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California's struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.

""Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,"" he said in a statement announcing the vote.

Newsom's administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.

But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state's growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state's electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state's transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an ""unprecedented rate.""

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California's plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state's previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California's, saying the pace wasn't realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state's EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

Undoing Biden’s damage alone would have been a tremendous service to the country. But true to form, Trump went even further, setting in motion an American energy renaissance unlike anything we’ve seen before.

In just four months, President Trump delivered the strongest, most successful energy agenda in modern American history. By making energy affordability, abundance and independence the priority again, he is proving that energy is the backbone of our economy, security and way of life.

One of Trump’s major victories came with the repeal of Biden’s destructive natural gas tax. Under Biden, Americans faced a stealth tax on natural gas that increased costs for heating, electricity and manufacturing. With nearly half the nation’s electricity powered by natural gas, it was a tax that hurt working families, seniors and small businesses.

Natural gas prices were trending upward, increasing the cost to heat and power millions of homes. Thanks to Trump’s leadership and the work of strong allies in Congress, that punitive tax is now officially repealed, lifting a heavy burden off the American people.

Trump also wasted no time addressing Biden’s reckless “pause” on liquified natural gas exports. That so-called “pause” was more than bad policy — it was a direct threat to American jobs, economic growth, and global security. Trump reversed it immediately.

Additionally, major projects for shipping liquefied gas are now moving forward, strengthening America’s economy and giving our allies a reliable alternative to purchase their gas from us instead of hostile powers such as Russia. American liquefied natural gas is again a force for prosperity and freedom around the world.

Recognizing that a nation rich in resources must be allowed to access them, Trump jumpstarted oil and gas production by expanding leasing on federal lands and waters. His administration is unlocking American energy potential previously off-limits under Biden’s endless restrictions. Offshore areas are now open again for responsible exploration.

In conjunction, Trump overhauled the permitting process that Biden had bogged down, leaving projects in a bureaucratic swamp. Emergency procedures put in place by the Trump administration are speeding up approvals, making it easier for producers to bring oil and gas to market and ensuring that American families benefit from lower energy prices.

More congressional work is needed on this front, but already common-sense leadership has restored momentum to America’s energy sector.

And for the record, gas this week is 42 cents cheaper per gallon than it was at this exact same time last year.

Unlike the radical left, Trump understands that coal remains an essential part of America’s energy mix. He acted decisively to reinvigorate the coal industry, amending prior executive orders to restore coal’s rightful place in powering the nation.

Coal is responsible for powering more than 16 percent of American homes, in addition to being the critical element needed for the production of steel. America’s beautiful and clean coal is no longer maligned but celebrated as a vital resource that supports jobs, provides affordable power, and strengthens our electrical grid.

Trump also ended the wasteful climate bureaucracy that flourished under Biden. On his first day, he dismantled Biden’s Civilian Climate Corps — a taxpayer-funded boondoggle that prioritized political activism over real work.

He also eliminated redundant federal climate offices that duplicated efforts and drained resources away from real priorities. Under Trump, Washington’s focus is back where it belongs: on growing the economy, creating jobs and strengthening America’s future.

The centerpiece of Trump’s first 100 days was his bold declaration of a National Energy Emergency. It was a powerful recognition that America’s security and prosperity demand urgent action.

Under Biden, Americans suffered the highest gas prices in history and crippling inflation, both driven by failed energy policies. Trump put the full power of the federal government behind restoring energy independence.

The results are undeniable: Gas prices are down. Inflation is easing. American energy workers are back on the job. Investment is pouring back into the energy sector. And the U.S. stands once again as a leader on the global energy stage.

In just four months, Trump has delivered what many thought impossible: a revitalized, energized and liberated American energy economy. No president has ever achieved a faster or more decisive turnaround.

“I’ve had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it’s going to be at Indianapolis,” IndyCar president Doug Boles said.
For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600.
Then there’s the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems.","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Helio Castroneves felt an immediate difference — a subtle but noticeable uptick in speed — the first time he utilized the boost of horsepower offered by IndyCar’s novel hybrid engines around the imposing oval of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

The question now facing the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner, along with the rest of the drivers on the 33-car starting grid for the 109th running on Sunday, is how best to capitalize on the hybrid over 200 laps spent entirely on edge.

Empty it entirely and then wait for it to recharge, which might take several laps? Save it for short bursts for passes or to defend? Perhaps use it slowly to run down the leader or build a big advantage once out front?

“There is so much more that goes into this than I think people realize or recognize,” acknowledged Indy 500 veteran Graham Rahal, whose father Bobby Rahal won the 1986 race. “It’s an interesting thing. I mean, the hybrid, it’s quite powerful here. On a single lap if you utilize it correctly, it does make a hell of a difference in lap time or lap speed.”

The genesis of the hybridization began years ago, when IndyCar manufacturers Chevrolet and Honda wanted to better align their racing programs with a shift in consumer demand toward hybrid and electric vehicles. But the project was beset by delays as engineers struggled to fit a bespoke hybrid unit into the IndyCar chassis designed more than a decade ago, and that had to meet certain requirements for weight and safety, among other things.

The result was finally unveiled before last year’s Indy 500, a design based around ultracapacitors rather than heavy batteries. It provides a quick boost to the existing 2.2-liter, twin-turbocharged V-6 engines before recharging to be used again.

The system was introduced at Mid-Ohio midway through last year’s IndyCar season and has been in use ever since.

But it has never been used somewhere like Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where speeds at the end of each straight can hit 240 mph, and the difference between winning and losing can be measured in thousandths of a second.

“I’ve had some really interesting conversations with drivers about how of all places where the hybrid is going to make a huge difference, it’s going to be at Indianapolis,” IndyCar president Doug Boles said. “I asked why and they say, ‘Well, you think about Indianapolis, how trimmed out we are — especially in qualifying — any incremental difference in horsepower makes a difference.

“We’re going to see some exciting racing,” Boles continued, “and the strategies that I have heard from drivers in terms of talking about how to deploy the hybrid vary wildly. It’s going to be fascinating to watch how this goes.”

It hasn’t gone without its share of problems, either, dating to an open test last month and right through practice Monday.

For one thing, the hybrid still checks in at about 100 pounds, which is significant on a car that weighs just 1,600. And all of that weight is in the back of the car, which has dramatically altered the way they are balanced and ultimately perform.

“That’s a lot of mass percentage-wise you are adding,” two-time defending Indy 500 winner Josef Newgarden said. “It’s almost like adding 200, 250 pounds to a stock car. If you said, ‘Hey, guys, we’re going to bolt 250 pounds to these stock cars, see what you think,’ I bet they would all go, ‘OK, this drives differently.’ And now we have to counteract it.”

Andretti Global driver Kyle Kirkwood is among many who believe the additional weight makes cars harder to drive, and Meyer Shank Racing’s Marcus Armstrong said, “I do believe the window is considerably smaller, the balance window.”

Armstrong crashed in practice last Saturday and had to squeeze into the field in a backup car on Sunday.

Then there’s the fact that the hybrid unit — while mostly reliable — is still a machine, and machines can have problems. Rinus Veekay’s hybrid didn’t work at all during his first qualifying run for the final row of the starting grid, while 2008 winner Scott Dixon had his practice Monday cut short after just six laps when a warning light blinked for an overheating issue.

Nevertheless, the hybrid technology will play a part in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” on Sunday. And if it comes down to the final laps, it could be a big part, as the leader tries to hold on and the chasers try to time their boost for a winning pass.

“I think it definitely adds some variables,” said Dixon, who will start on the second row. “If you’re sitting out front, you could be a bit of a sitting duck, especially if everybody is kind of recharged and ready to go behind you.

“I think the biggest thing that we’ve probably all learnt so far, you’ve got to be ready for change, is probably the biggest thing,” he added. “But I think it could ultimately change how the end of the race plays out.”

“They are trying to kill the messenger with the bad news, it’s crazy,” said Dr James Hansen, known as the godfather of climate science and previously director of Giss for more than 30 years.
“It’s doable but it is disruptive,” said Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at GISS.
“I see this as an attack by this administration on climate science,” said Bastiaan van Diedenhoven, a researcher who worked at GISS for 13 years.
“We were afraid of something like this because we saw what was happening at other agencies, so obviously Giss is on their list because of the good climate science done there.","Perched above the New York City diner made famous by the TV show Seinfeld, Tom’s Restaurant, a small research laboratory became, improbably, crucial to humanity’s understanding of our changing climate and of the universe itself.

Now, it is being shut down by Donald Trump’s administration.

Nasa’s top climate and space monitoring lab, called the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Giss), has been housed in six floors of a leased building owned by Columbia University on Manhattan’s Upper West Side since 1966.

Since then, it has launched the career of a Nobel prize winner, aided missions to Venus and Jupiter, mapped the Milky Way and alerted the world to global heating by creating one of the first climate models. The climate model ran on an IBM computer, the fastest in the world in the 1970s and so gargantuan it took up the entire second floor.

But this storied history has meant little to the Trump administration, which is ending the lab’s lease on 31 May, releasing 130 staff to work from home with an uncertain future ahead. Donald Trump, who has called climate science “bullshit” and a “giant hoax” in the past, wants to slash Nasa’s Earth science budget in half.

“They are trying to kill the messenger with the bad news, it’s crazy,” said Dr James Hansen, known as the godfather of climate science and previously director of Giss for more than 30 years.

The Guardian talked to Hansen, who was wearing a trademark felt fedora, as he tackled a plate of eggs and bacon at Tom’s Restaurant, which sits below the Giss office. The eggs, as well as some pancakes for your Guardian reporter, were ordered at the barked behest of the manager: “$12 minimum on food! $12! Each!”

The diner is famous – its neon-lit exterior regularly appeared on Seinfeld (photos of Jerry, Kramer and Elaine, some signed, adorn the walls inside) and it inspired Suzanne Vega’s 1980s song Tom’s Diner and so is now regularly thronged by tourists as well as Columbia students, though perhaps less so by Giss staff.

“Are they going to destroy this place? Are they bombing it?” said Hansen about the dismantling of the institution above where we were poking at our food. “That’s the approach of Doge [Elon Musk’s so-called ‘department of government efficiency’] to blow things up, to use a chainsaw,” he said. “That’s a big mistake because science isn’t something you start over. You’ve got a lot of knowledge there.”

Hansen gave Congress and the world its first major warning of a climate crisis in 1988 but left Giss in 2013 to speak out more publicly about climate breakdown. His latent activism became so concerning to Nasa that, Hansen claims, it sought to install a camera outside his office to monitor his movements.

Giss’s independence and nimbleness allowed it to chart the dangerous heating of our planet but also spurred resentment from senior officials who long desired to subsume it within Nasa’s main Goddard space flight center campus in Greenbelt, Maryland.

“We survived under a non-supportive situation for decades,” Hansen said. “Somewhat it was a matter of jealousy, of scientists in Greenbelt thinking: ‘Why are these guys getting to this privileged position?’”

Ironically for a place that has produced world-leading climate science for a tiny fraction of Nasa’s budget, however, it will be closed down ostensibly for efficiency reasons. Last month, the US president signed an executive order calling for a review of all leased federal office space, particularly in cities, to slash costs.

“Over the next several months, employees will be placed on temporary remote work agreements while Nasa seeks and evaluates options for a new space for the Giss team,” a Nasa spokesperson said.

It’s unclear where, or if, such a space will eventuate. The move will likely not even save the federal government any money – the $3m a year lease is between Columbia and a different federal agency and cannot be broken early. Researchers, their books and equipment are being packed up and removed so that the US taxpayer can fund an empty building in New York City’s moneyed Upper West Side.

“Ours is not to reason why,” said Gavin Schmidt, the current Giss director who noted the lab was only recently renovated at a cost of several million dollars. “It is frustrating.” The final weeks of Nasa’s time in Armstrong Hall, the name of the Columbia property, have been marked by team picnics with a farewell party planned among past and present staff.

“There are a few wobbly lips, the contribution of this place to science has been huge and people are emotional about that,” Schmidt said.

“Giss has a unique culture of autonomy, there’s a special sauce here that’s responsible for some really great science. Everyone knows why they are here – they could’ve gone anywhere else but they stay in an office that is dedicated to public service. Science for the public good is imbued in the floors and walls and elevators here.”

The work will, for now, continue in a different, disparate form. “It’s doable but it is disruptive,” said Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at GISS. “People would rather be doing science than thinking about moving. This is a building full of nerds who love doing science, love learning new things about our planet.”

But for how long, and from where? A best-case scenario could be that Giss goes into some sort of hibernation before being resurrected under a future administration. Or it could be a terminal end of an era, an apt outcome in an age of anti-enlightenment where climate science is torn from websites, scientists and their work are jettisoned, vaccines and even weather forecasting are eyed with suspicion and the president can opine that the rising seas will happily create balmy new beachfront property.

“I see this as an attack by this administration on climate science,” said Bastiaan van Diedenhoven, a researcher who worked at GISS for 13 years. “We were afraid of something like this because we saw what was happening at other agencies, so obviously Giss is on their list because of the good climate science done there. I don’t see how it can survive without a building. It’s really quite devastating.”

After making the most of his eggs and bacon, Hansen wandered to the nondescript side-door that gains entry to Giss, to say hello to those who followed him. Shortly after he first came to Columbia, in 1967, the building’s second-floor windows were bricked up after student protests erupted over the Vietnam war. Today a different sort of tumult is in the air – before Hansen can walk in he bumps into a Nasa scientist who is delighted to see him but then swiftly asks: “Do you have space somewhere where I can work?”

Schmidt said he was unsure what comes next, but that he wouldn’t want to move to Maryland and that others at Giss will feel the same. “People have lives, some just won’t want to go,” he said. “The mission hasn’t changed, though. We’ve punched above our weight for a bunch of folks living above a diner in New York. We’ve had a good run. But it’s not over just yet.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62a1bd29efa7eb1673324641167977ad1269b88f/0_0_4162_3329/master/4162.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=305c7c2c95da211bd5c91345ac137aec,N,,2025-05-21 12:30:17.550045

The IRA was designed as an energy entitlement program with no caps, sunsets, or accountability. Although first estimated to cost $369 billion, it is now likely to cost in the trillions. Tax credits are supposed to help an industry get off the ground. Still, the production tax credit (PTC) and the investment tax credit (ITC) for wind and solar have been around for decades, having been reinstated whenever they were to sunset. Yet, these renewable technologies only supply 2.8% of U.S. energy needs. These intermittent sources have also raised the cost of electricity as they need expensive back-up power when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing. They have also reduced the reliability of the U.S. electric grid. The IRA was passed as a budget reconciliation package on a straight party-line vote in August 2022.

Initially set to expire in 1999, the wind PTC was extended in 1999, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, and 2021. The 2016 extension of the PTC was structured as a phase-down, with the value of the PTC coming down each year by 20% for five years. The solar ITC, originally introduced in 1978, was enhanced significantly in 2005 with a 2007 expiration date, and was later extended to 2016 with a clear phase-down path. The solar ITC underwent seven laws and six extensions. The IRA, however, sunsets the PTC and ITC only after the U.S. electricity sector achieves a 75% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the 2022 baseline, which is likely not achievable. So, there is essentially no cap on the freebies awarded to green energy via the IRA. As the table below shows, the House bill would only begin to phase out the PTC and ITC in 2029, and they would not sunset until 2032. The time is ripe for their repeal as they have not benefited the U.S. power system because they have led to increased reliability problems and added costs, and will likely be extended in the future under this phase-out plan.

Wind and solar power now represent 16% of the electricity market, while supplying less than 3% of total U.S. energy needs. According to the Cato Institute, the two subsidies could cost $130 billion annually by 2034, and all green subsidies could cost taxpayers $4.7 trillion through 2050. The original CBO 10-year score significantly underestimated the subsidy payments authorized by the IRA. Third-party estimates of the IRA’s 10-year budget score, such as the Goldman Sachs estimate of $1.2 trillion, fall comfortably between Cato’s lower- and upper-bound forecast for the upcoming 10-year budget window. It is important to note that the cost is three times more than the CBO’s estimated cost of the IRA at the time of its passage.

Besides costing taxpayers bundles of money, these subsidies have also destabilized the electric grid, as the technologies they fund are intermittent and weather-driven. Other technologies (coal and gas generators) are being used as back-up power, hurting their economics because their costs spread over far fewer hours of operation, as grid operators dispatch wind and solar plants with no fuel costs first. Some states are supplementing their wind and solar plants with very expensive storage batteries that can store excess power until needed. The result is higher electricity prices for consumers, which have increased 25% since Biden became president and favored green technologies. Heavily subsidized intermittent sources, therefore, add costs to ratepayers by distorting the market, producing a “double whammy” for prices overall.

The grid distortion caused by the wind production tax credit can sometimes make wholesale power prices negative, which means other generators would need to pay the grid for their power. Wind producers can still make money when wholesale prices fall below zero because of the value of the production tax credit, but other power plants lose money. Due to the distortions, many fossil fuel and nuclear power plants have had to shut down despite the increase in electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers and manufacturing. The loss of these potential baseload generating units is wreaking havoc with available supplies in light of the surging demand, leaving large consumers scrambling to secure dedicated generation.

Conclusion

Congress has the opportunity to benefit the American taxpayer by removing IRA subsidies for green technologies that were passed solely by Democrats in 2022. While the CBO estimated the IRA subsidies at $369 billion, actual costs will likely be at least three times as much to support technologies that have been around for decades and should be viable without federal government support. Wind and solar power distort the grid because they cannot operate 24/7, meaning they must have back-up power from expensive storage batteries or other technologies that may not operate long enough to recover their costs, so many are forced to shutter. Congress could slow the rate of electricity price increases and save taxpayers huge sums by stopping the counterproductive subsidies lavished upon intermittent wind and solar in the IRA. Members of Congress need only look to Europe, where electricity prices are multiples higher than the rates their consumers already complain about, to see what the future holds if the United States does not change course from the IRA’s “Green New Deal” provisions.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bigstock-Our-Congress-Spending-And-Wast-248376820.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 12:29:46.117998

IRA TAX CREDITS: Shares of several solar energy companies slipped after conservative Republican lawmakers said they had secured a commitment from leadership to end key clean-energy tax credits earlier than planned as part of a deal aimed at allowing President Donald Trump’s tax and spending package to advance. South Carolina Representative Ralph Norman said House leadership had agreed to a proposal to end Inflation Reduction Act tax credits earlier than Republicans’ original proposal, though Norman didn’t provide a new timeframe. In a post to X, Norman stated: “After last night’s budget vote, we made some progress. Yes, we’re moving up Medicaid work requirements. Yes, we’re putting an end to the Green New Scam subsidies. There are several bites at the apple, but more to be done. We have worked tirelessly to ensure President Trump’s America First agenda is maximized in this bill. The US credit rating being downgraded is evidence of how our fiscal house is out of order. The American people deserve better, and it’s high time our colleagues step up, get serious, and deliver the bold reforms this country needs.” Publicly traded companies in the space include Enphase Energy (ENPH), Sunrun (RUN), Array Technologies (ARRY), First Solar (FSLR), Canadian Solar (CSIQ), Emeren (SOL), FTC Solar (FTCI), JinkoSolar (JKS), Maxeon Solar (MAXN), Shoals Technologies (SHLS), SolarEdge (SEDG) and SunPower (SPWR).

Ducks Unlimited received a donation to supplement its work in wetlands and waterfowl conservation. Make-A-Wish Georgia received a donation towards the life-changing wishes it grants to children facing critical illness. Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Coastal Empire received a donation to continue its profound work in providing a home away from home for families of seriously ill and injured children. The area is home to Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA), Hyundai Motor Group’s first dedicated electric vehicle mass-production plant in Bryan County, Georgia.

“Hyundai is proud of our long-term commitment to Georgia,” said Drew Ferguson, senior vice president, government affairs, Hyundai Motor Group, and Georgia native. “This includes investing billions of dollars and creating thousands of jobs in our manufacturing facilities and the supplier ecosystem. It also includes giving back to the communities where our team members live and work. On behalf of all of us at Hyundai, it’s an honor to support these worthy organizations that do so much for our communities.”

Hyundai partnered with Ducks Unlimited last year, and since then has donated $25,000 towards its conservation efforts in the Coastal Georgia region. Ducks Unlimited is the world’s largest private wetlands and waterfowl conservation organization—conserving, restoring, and managing wetlands and associated habitats for North America’s waterfowl. This year’s donation will be for its Southeast Wetlands Initiative in Georgia.

Hyundai has partnered with Make-A-Wish Georgia since 2023, cumulatively donating $30,000 towards its mission to grant life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. Making these wishes come true helps bring strength, hope, and transformation for the wish child, their family, and the community.

“We are so grateful for Hyundai’s generous and unwavering support of our mission,” said Tim Earley, president and CEO, Make-A-Wish Georgia. “Together, we are bringing hope and joy to critically ill children and their families when they need it most.”

Hyundai partnered with the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Coastal Empire in 2023 and has since donated $35,000 to the organization. Its mission is to provide a restful, comfortable place for children and their families to find refuge and support as they receive hospital-based medical treatment. Its work helps children heal faster, cope better, and stay healthy. The organization provides more than just a room and a hot meal, but a home away from home.

These were to produce batteries for electric cars from Ford and its subsidiary brand Lincoln, each with an annual capacity of 43 GWh. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, both factories are complete, but one of them is currently not being used at all, and only part of the other factory is producing batteries for Ford.

The active factory will now also produce batteries for Nissan, according to the business newspaper’s insider sources. For Nissan, this offers the opportunity to manufacture batteries in the USA, and thus a quick option to reduce the risks of tariffs on imported vehicles and components.

Ford’s goal with the battery factories was actually to massively expand electromobility. The fact that the plant in Kentucky is to produce batteries not only for Ford but also for Nissan in future can be interpreted as a further sign of Ford’s current reluctance when it comes to electromobility. The company had been banking heavily on rising demand, which has so far failed to materialise. In the last quarter alone, Ford’s Model e electric car division made a loss of 850 million dollars, while electric car sales rose from 10,000 to 31,000 units. At the same time, Ford is said to have abandoned the development of a new E/E architecture.

Demand for electric vehicles has recently been declining on the US market. It is likely to come under even greater pressure in the future because the Republican party now wants to abolish the tax credit of 7,500 dollars for the purchase of an electric car, as demanded by U.S. President Donald Trump with a corresponding bill. At the same time, production costs are rising. There is also the threat of billions in losses looming due to new tariffs.

For Nissan, on the other hand, the use of the Ford plant offers a welcome opportunity. The Japanese company recorded a loss of 4.5 billion US dollars in the first quarter of 2025. It announced 20,000 job cuts and halted the construction of its own battery plant in Japan. In future, however, Nissan plans to build electric SUVs in Canton, Mississippi. Nissan had already announced in March that it would purchase batteries from SK On for these models.

Neither Ford nor the BlueOval SK joint venture officially commented on the collaboration with Nissan. SK On also left it open as to where exactly it would be producing for Nissan in future.

Other manufacturers are also drawing conclusions from the sluggish ramp-up of electromobility: General Motors recently parted with a battery plant under construction in Michigan and handed it over to its partner LG Energy Solution. Existing GM plants are operating well below capacity. Honda, on the other hand, announced that it would reduce its planned investments in electric cars and software from 61 to 43 billion euros and put the planned construction of a new plant for e-cars and batteries in Canada on hold for two years.",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/05/blueoval-sk-kentucky-battery-factory.jpeg,N,,2025-05-21 12:32:52.675003

Billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and President Donald Trump have unleashed severe federal workforce cuts and rollbacks of environmental protections, including at the EPA.
Eight high-ranking officials have left the housing authority since August, including one who was fired.
The trash chutes have been fixed, she said, but the elevators still constantly are broken, two key issues for the many disabled and older Dearborn residents, including herself.
“CHA is lucky to have her.” Poole emphasized residents and communication with them in her interview with the Tribune.","The Chicago Housing Authority has hired a former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency staffer to head up a new division focused on environmental concerns and hazards for residents living in more than 21,000 units of public housing as part of a series of initiatives for 2025 aimed at offering a course correction for the embattled agency.

Elizabeth Poole will lead the new division as the director of healthy homes after a nearly 15-year career at the EPA. Poole said she left her role as the children’s health coordinator in the EPA’s environmental justice office due to the change in administration. Billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and President Donald Trump have unleashed severe federal workforce cuts and rollbacks of environmental protections, including at the EPA.

Poole, who started April 14, and her newly hired team of two other former EPA staffers will begin their work by focusing on lead-based paint hazards as they build out the new program. The team aims to identify solutions to mitigate or eliminate environmental contaminants and risks through not only physical building improvements, but also by providing families and property owners and managers with tools and resources to create healthier spaces.

“If it is not good enough for my child, it is not good enough for any child,” Poole said in an interview with the Tribune. “That is how I work. That is how I live. That is how this team is going to function.”

The new hire comes to the agency, the third largest public housing authority in the country, with a daunting task as CHA grapples with executive leadership turnover, long-held frustrations from residents over building conditions and a court order to pay $24 million to two residents who sued over alleged lead paint poisoning of their two children.

Eight high-ranking officials have left the housing authority since August, including one who was fired. CHA is also in the midst of hiring a new CEO, with a new leader expected by the middle of the year.

Residents at Dearborn Homes in the Douglas neighborhood and Henry Horner Homes in the East Garfield Park neighborhood have shared their concerns with the Tribune just in the last nine months about their living conditions, saying they have felt “neglected.” In January, hundreds of residents were evacuated from the Patrick Sullivan Senior Apartments on the Near West Side due to a burst pipe, which resulted in flooding and the loss of heat and hot water. The week prior, a jury found CHA responsible for two children’s lead paint injuries.

Interim CHA CEO Angela Hurlock has said CHA is “undergoing a significant transition.” In February, Mayor Brandon Johnson joined Hurlock and other CHA officials to launch a “year of renewal,” which they said will address “past challenges” around transparency and engagement with residents and include moves meant to increase housing and safety for its more than 65,000 households.

The agency said it plans to “rebuild trust” by launching a resident survey in June to help shape CHA programs, policies and operations; improving private property management of CHA buildings, with a current selection process in the final stages to find new “local and community-based organizations”; strengthening its collaboration with Chicago’s Department of Housing to help develop the city’s next five-year housing plan; and by creating Poole’s new division.

CHA has also recently hired a new sustainability manager from the EPA who will work with Poole’s team in addition to her other responsibilities. Kimberly Nevels, the former head of diversity, equity and inclusion at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, is filling CHA’s role as deputy chief of fair housing and policy. As of Monday, the authority replaced its chief of staff — a position that had been vacant since February — with Kemena Brooks. Brooks worked in real estate development locally.

Poole, who started working with CHA this year while still at the EPA through teaching Altgeld Gardens residents about environmental health exposures, said lead-based paint is not just a problem for CHA, but also nationally. The Midwest in particular struggles, she said, because it has an older housing stock and not enough qualified workers to deal with the issue. Poole wants to tackle that challenge while at CHA, including by educating residents on how to properly identify hazards and training some through the agency’s workforce development program to help staff up the lead paint remediation labor field.

The team, which is housed under CHA’s property and asset management division, does not yet know where it will begin its lead safety work in CHA’s massive rental portfolio, Poole said, as they are still examining data and launching the entire division.

“The country as a whole has done a really remarkable job of reducing lead-based paint hazards, whether it’s from emissions or in soil or in paint,” said Poole, who brings lead-related experience from her time at the EPA. “The goal is always to get to zero, and, in my opinion, the last mile of the marathon is the hardest. … We have to start being really purposeful and intensive about where we’re eliminating the last hazards.”

All of CHA’s work to educate families on lead hazards and other environmental issues such as asthma triggers and mold will focus on “low cost, no cost, low effort” tools to minimize adding burdens to families, Poole said.

The division will create a new corner of CHA’s website about healthy homes with resources to help people with decision-making, including how to clean properly with safer products. The team will also have a centralized email address and potentially a widget on the website, where people can send complaints about their living conditions to make sure, Poole said, that “we’re being more responsive, accountable, transparent” for residents.

Brenda Moore, a roughly 14-year resident of Dearborn Homes, said there is a new property manager who has “stepped up” since she spoke with the Tribune last year about the disrepair at the 668-unit site with 16 multistory buildings. The trash chutes have been fixed, she said, but the elevators still constantly are broken, two key issues for the many disabled and older Dearborn residents, including herself.

“If they can find somebody to take care of half of the issues that are going on, that’s great,” Moore said. “That would be a big help. Children and seniors need to be safer in their environment,” including from crime.

Dearborn Homes was constructed in the late 1940s, with only one elevator in each of the buildings. Modernizing the existing elevators requires they be taken offline for months, which is why CHA has said it will add a second elevator to each building on the campus so that it can update the older elevators and increase accessibility. The agency started a feasibility study for the project and expects it to conclude this year, said CHA spokesperson Matthew Aguilar. The modernization effort is included in CHA’s five-year capital plan and estimated to cost $40 million.

It’s not clear how much money will be dedicated to Poole’s division.

Poole said she thinks the biggest challenge will be to build a new program from scratch and in a space — public housing — that her team has not worked in before. The division is working with the New York City Housing Authority, which has an existing healthy homes team, as well as HUD, the Illinois Department of Public Health and the EPA to help shape its work. The team will continually improve its programs, Poole said.

“Our goal in the next year or so is to really engage with all of the different programs at CHA to see how we can fit in with what they are doing,” Poole said. “… I would like to see healthy homes champions across the agency.”

Alexa Burnett, an EPA employee who worked with Poole for two years, including as her mentee, said Poole is “one of the most intelligent people I have ever met” and “not the average government employee.” Poole sees bureaucratic red tape, Burnett said, and will still try to do the work when another employee might just throw up their hands. Poole is “someone who can just make things happen,” said Burnett, who spoke with the Tribune as a member of the EPA’s union.

“I really think she is going to thrive (in the new role),” Burnett said. “CHA is lucky to have her.”

Poole emphasized residents and communication with them in her interview with the Tribune.

“Everybody wants a healthy home. That’s a no-brainer,” Poole said. “We just have to all get on the same page of this is where we are going with this program.”

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a May 16th news release announcing $267 million in Brownfield grants.

Pine Bluff, Arkansas was awarded $500,000.00 that will be targeted for the Downtown Development District.

The federal government and many states (including Arkansas) have statutes, regulations, and policies that are intended to address “Brownfields”. Brownfields are often referred to as property (improved and unimproved) the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.

Incentive provisions, funding programs, liability exemptions, and action/cleanup standards have been utilized for a number of years to attempt to reduce the barriers for reuse or redevelopment of Brownfield properties. The goal of Brownfield programs is to encourage redevelopment and investment in such properties to increase the local tax base, facilitate job growth, and utilize existing infrastructure, encourage infield use, and take pressure off of greenspace.

The Pine Bluff Downtown Development District areas that will be targeted include:

Saenger Theatre.

Hotel Pines.

Pine Bluff Bus Terminal.

The current budget reconciliation bill would prohibit settlement agreements that require polluters to make payments to anyone unless it is “restitution for” or “directly remedies actual harm” that is “directly and proximately” caused by the polluter.","The budget reconciliation bill is now working its way through Congress, and what President Trump calls the “big, beautiful bill” has a lot of ugly provisions in it.

Among those ugly provisions are sweeping attacks on federal agencies and their ability to carry out their responsibilities under the law to protect the health and safety of the American public.

These provisions borrow from previous legislation that never made it into law, and so far they have received relatively little public attention compared to other parts of the budget reconciliation bill.

If signed into law, they would erect nearly insurmountable procedural hurdles to maintaining our existing health and environmental protections, and to establishing new ones. Safeguards that Americans rely on every day – from air quality standards to food and product safety regulations – are all at risk.

In addition to being harmful and misguided public policy, these provisions have no place in a budget reconciliation bill – which is supposed to include only provisions that are primarily intended to affect spending or revenues. Because the harmful policy impacts of the provisions are the intent and the budgetary impact is incidental – and far outweighed by the damage that would result –the House’s attempt to shoehorn these provisions into the budget reconciliation bill is an end-run around Congress’s own rules.

Here are some of those provisions:

An arbitrary “expiration date” for all existing protections

The budget reconciliation bill includes a version of a previously introduced bill known as the “Sunset Act” which would endanger every single existing rule across the federal government – including ones that protect people’s health, children’s safety, the environment, financial oversight, and consumer protection.

The version in the budget reconciliation bill would require that every federal agency submit every rule that is currently in effect to Congress over the next five years. If Congress does not take action to approve the rule, it will disappear — no matter what the costs or consequences might be to the public.

By allowing Congressional inaction to lead to the arbitrary and indiscriminate expiration of all existing regulations, this portion of the budget reconciliation bill threatens countless protections that most Americans take for granted and rely on every single day. That includes everything from air quality standards that protect communities from unhealthy levels of soot and smog, to standards that require oil and gas facilities and petrochemical plants to control their toxic and cancer-causing air pollution, to limits that keep power plants and industrial facilities from dumping polluted wastewater into our rivers and lakes.

The safeguards that would be affected by this provision were adopted by federal agencies through the transparent decision-making process required by federal law, with opportunities for public input and review in the courts. Federal agencies can, and do, revisit and revise these regulations to update and improve them, using the same transparent and rigorous process. There is no reason to bypass this process by subjecting all of our most important health, safety, and environmental protections to an arbitrary expiration date that can only be lifted through an act of Congress.

Protecting polluters who violate the law

This provision is borrowed from previous legislation introduced as H.R. 788 and S. 225 in the 118th Congress. It would shield polluters who violate our nation’s health, safety and environmental regulations – and leave the public on the hook for the damage they cause – by limiting the government’s ability to seek relief and compensation.

Violations of our health, safety and environmental regulations frequently harm large numbers of people who may be difficult to immediately identify. That’s why the government sometimes reaches settlement agreements that require the violators to fund pollution reduction projects or other activities that help make the public whole. The current budget reconciliation bill would prohibit settlement agreements that require polluters to make payments to anyone unless it is “restitution for” or “directly remedies actual harm” that is “directly and proximately” caused by the polluter. This could limit the government from pursuing remedies for harms that affect large numbers of people or that require broader solutions to provide effective redress to those harmed by a polluter’s actions.

For instance, in 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice pursued an enforcement action against Volkswagen for cheating on vehicle emission tests and exposing people across the country to harmful smog-forming pollution. As part of the settlement agreement, Volkswagen agreed to fund reduction projects for that pollution in places nationwide where their violation could have caused unlawful excessive pollution. The proposed policy in the budget reconciliation bill could have barred the Justice Department from pursuing this remedy because of the difficulty of tracing the specific pollution from Volkswagen vehicles to harms to specific people or communities.

More barriers for new protections

The budget reconciliation bill includes language similar to the REINS Act (H.R.142-Kat Cammack/S.485-Rand Paul), which is a long-running attempt to trample the ability of federal agencies to issue life-saving protections.

The REINS Act would require any “major rules,” which include some of the most consequential and necessary health and safety protections issued by federal agencies, to be affirmatively approved by a joint resolution passed by both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. This would severely hamper the federal government’s ability to implement laws that were themselves written by Congress.

Either chamber could block a rule from going into effect simply by taking no action — no matter how common-sense or necessary the rule is for protecting Americans from threats to our welfare. As included in the budget resolution markup, the provisions would require Congress to approve all major rules that increase revenue.

Making it easier to undo new protections

The latest version of the reconciliation bill also includes a version of the so-called “Midnight Rules Relief Act” (H.R.77- Andy Biggs/S.164 -Ron Johnson). This legislation would supercharge the destructive force of the Congressional Review Act, which currently allows Congress to claw back regulations that were lawfully adopted by the federal government through a simple majority vote with no filibuster.

Once Congress votes to reject a regulation through the Congressional Review Act, the federal government is permanently barred from proposing a regulation that is “substantially the same” as the one voted down.

The Midnight Rules Relief Act goes even further. It would allow Congress to simultaneously repeal multiple rules finalized near the end of a President’s term – instead of voting on them individually as the Congressional Review Act currently requires.

This would enable Congress to permanently block a whole suite of public health and safety regulations through a single vote, without requiring members of Congress to consider individual rules on their own merits. As included in the budget reconciliation bill, the provision would allow Congress to repeal major rules that increase revenue in a bundle if they were finalized in the last year of a president’s te",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//US_Congress_02.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 12:30:20.038923

,EPA,2025-05-21 14:17:50+00:00,Grist,The EPA is rolling back drinking water limits for 4 PFAS. Thousands more remain unregulated. | Grist,Joseph Winters,,,,,https://grist.org/regulation/epa-pfas-drinking-water-limits-trump-rollback/,"Even last year, when the Biden administration first announced its national drinking water standards, scientists criticized it for addressing PFAS on a chemical-by-chemical basis.
Those compounds got the strictest drinking water limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level at which they can be detected, reflecting scientists’ understanding that there is no safe exposure level for them.
Water utilities were instructed to use a “hazard index” to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.
The Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029.
The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government’s water quality requirements altogether.","Last week, environmental groups decried plans from the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind and “reconsider” drinking water limits for four per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, compounds linked to cancer and damage to the immune and endocrine systems, among other health effects.

The limits had been finalized by Joe Biden’s administration last April as part of an effort to limit people’s exposure to hazardous “forever chemicals.” Out of a total of more than 10,000 known PFAS, they targeted just six of the most concerning ones. The Trump administration’s EPA said it would retain the limits for two of the PFAS but give utilities more time to comply with them and scrap the others. One advocate called the EPA’s move a loss for public health and a “victory for chemical companies.”

But how protective were the Biden regulations to begin with? And how much of a difference will it make to pare them back?

On the one hand, experts agree that backtracking is not in the public’s interest. Virtually everyone has PFAS coursing through their veins, and specific kinds like PFOS and PFOA are known or likely to contribute to kidney and testicular cancers. The other compounds originally regulated by the Biden administration have been linked to elevated cholesterol, heart disease, and an increased risk of diabetes.

The chemicals have become so ubiquitous in people and the environment because of their use in everything from outdoor clothing to cooking utensils and food packaging. Runoff from firefighting foam, infused with the chemicals, has contributed to widespread drinking water contamination, along with manufacturers’ deliberate dumping of the chemicals into rivers — despite knowing about their health risks.

Once they’re created, PFAS don’t break down naturally; hence the moniker “forever chemicals.” Regulating them is an “important win,” experts have said, one that “allows the country to begin cleaning up the mess in its water.”

But the fight over drinking water limits for individual PFAS distracts from the larger context that there are thousands of types, and scientists suspect they all have similar health effects. Even last year, when the Biden administration first announced its national drinking water standards, scientists criticized it for addressing PFAS on a chemical-by-chemical basis. “The EPA is trying to regulate six forever chemicals. Just 10,000 to go,” as the title of an op-ed by one Harvard researcher put it.

Erik Olson, a senior strategist for the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the U.S. is “stuck in a Whac-a-Mole game” with PFAS, in which only the best researched compounds are regulated. Lesser-known compounds may be just as toxic — thanks to their similar chemical structures — but escape regulations just because they haven’t been studied, he added. “What we need to do is control PFAS as a class.”

Of the six forever chemicals targeted by the Biden administration’s original policy, PFOA and PFOS are the most prevalent and, consequently, they’ve been researched the most extensively. Those compounds got the strictest drinking water limits of 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level at which they can be detected, reflecting scientists’ understanding that there is no safe exposure level for them. Three additional compounds — PFNA, PFHxS, and GenX — were given a contamination limit of 10 parts per trillion. Water utilities were instructed to use a “hazard index” to monitor a sixth chemical, called PFBS, as well as mixtures of the chemicals.

The Trump EPA said it would keep the PFOA and PFOS drinking water limits but give utilities until 2031 to comply with them, instead of 2029. The rules for the other four compounds will be scrapped and reevaluated. The EPA said it intends to finalize its replacement regulations by next spring.

A statement from EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the extended timeline for PFOA and PFOS would provide “common-sense flexibility” to utilities, some of which sued the EPA over its regulations last year. The utilities said the EPA’s new rule was too strict and would cause unreasonable compliance costs.

A spokesperson for the EPA told Grist that the process by which the agency had “promulgated the preliminary regulatory determinations simultaneously with the proposed regulation” for PFNA, PFHxS, GenX, and PFBS under the Biden administration “was inappropriate and may not comply with the statutory requirements of [the] Safe Drinking Water Act.” With regard to the rescissions, they said that “while EPA cannot predetermine the outcome, it is possible” that the agency will issue more stringent requirements this spring.

Daniel Jones, an emeritus professor of molecular biology at Michigan State University, said the impacts of the Trump administration’s reversal will depend on geography. Communities primarily affected by PFOS and PFOA may not be greatly affected, since the standards for those chemicals remain in place — albeit with an extended timeline for compliance. To meet the standards, water utilities will likely have to install something like an activated carbon filtration system, he said, which is effective at removing “long-chain” PFAS like PFOA and PFOS, which have a larger chemical structure than compounds like GenX.

Putting these filtration systems into place will thankfully sweep up more PFAS than just PFOA and PFOS, Jones said.

States like North Carolina, Ohio, and West Virginia, however, face disproportionate contamination from GenX due to production facilities concentrated there. This contamination could continue unabated if the standard for the compound is eliminated. According to Olson, some of the technologies that remove PFOS and PFOA are not as effective at attracting GenX. “To really control the full suite of PFAS, we need to go to more advanced technologies like tight membranes, like reverse osmosis,” he said.

Some water utilities may opt for these more advanced — and expensive — technologies if they believe that they will eventually be required to test for and limit a much larger number of PFAS, Olson added.

Although Jones is disappointed that the EPA intends to drop regulations for the four PFAS, he said he is more concerned about a single clause in the EPA’s press release, about the EPA’s intent to establish a “federal exemption framework” for the PFOS and PFOA limits. The release contains no further information about what this would entail, but Jones worries it could allow water utilities to circumvent the federal government’s water quality requirements altogether. “It seems that an exemption framework is likely to open the door to say, ‘This is going to cost too much, you don’t have to do it,’” he said.

The EPA spokesperson said exemptions would not allow utilities to violate regulations: “Rather, they allow additional time to find a compliance solution.”

Jones also raised concerns about funding for further PFAS research, including investigations on how exposure to mixtures of the chemicals may impact human health. One of his federal grants for PFAS research was recently cut by the Trump administration, he said, and a colleague at Michigan State University studying PFAS on farms has also had his funding rescinded.

In addition to regulating PFAS by groups or as a class, Jones said the EPA should set pollution standards using what’s known as the “precautionary principle,” which doesn’t require definitive evidence about a chemical’s harms before it can be regulated. “In some countries, if you want to release a chemical into the environment you have to show it’s safe,” he said. “The U.S. usually takes the opposite approach and says, ‘You can use these chemicals … and if we find that there’s a problem, then we’ll come up and regulate [them].’”

Olson believes the EPA’s alterations to the PFAS rules are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision,” which says any revision the EPA proposes to a drinking water standard must be at least as protective of public health as the previous one. The law also caps compliance timelines at five years, whereas postponing the PFOS and PFOA compliance deadline to 2031 would give water utilities seven years.

“Ultimately, we need to be phasing these chemicals out,” Olson added. “We have to turn off the spigot and stop using these things so that five generations from now, our great-great-great grandchildren won’t be dealing with them.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hand-with-faucet.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-05-21 11:11:42.959373

Hochul to approve local gas pipeline projects.

The U.S Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) lifted a month-long stop work order Monday on the New York-based offshore wind project, Empire Wind 1.

Although it took 14 years to secure federal approvals for the venture, on April 16 the Trump administration had halted work on the project, claiming the approval process had been “rushed.”

But Empire Wind was set to power 500,000 homes in New York City with clean energy and create more than 1,000 union jobs in New York communities, leading environmental groups and politicians to push back on the federal hold.

“I fought to save clean energy jobs in New York—and we got it done,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a statement this week. The governor was on the phone with President Donald Trump three times over the weekend, for over an hour each time, fighting to bring the project back, her Deputy Communications Director Paul DeMichele told City Limits.

Although environmentalists applaud the governor’s effort, it’s also spurred speculation that Hochul may have struck a deal with the administration to bring more gas into the state in exchange for lifting the stop-work order.

President Trump said earlier this year that he wanted to revive fracked gas projects like the Constitution Pipeline, a major venture by the Williams company that sought to transport fracked gas from Pennsylvania to the Southern tier of New York. New York State rejected permits for the project in 2016 and the company pulled out of the venture in 2020.

“I am encouraged by Governor Hochul’s comments about her willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, who ordered Empire Wind’s pause, said on the social media platform X hours after the administration agreed to resume the project.

But the governor’s office told City Limits the social media nod did not mean they agreed to approve any projects in return.

DeMichele confirmed that during lengthy conversations with Trump over the weekend, gas pipeline projects were brought up, but said “no deal on any natural gas pipeline was reached.”

However, Hochul’s office said the governor is not opposed to pipeline projects more generally, as long as they have undergone the necessary permitting processes issued by the state authorities.

“New York will work with the Administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law,” the governor said in a statement.

Environmental groups warn that new gas pipeline projects would usher in more planet-warming emissions into the state, accelerating the impacts of climate change. But utility companies and some experts argue that added gas supply is necessary, saying there still isn’t enough clean energy available to heat New York homes, especially in the winter.

‘So much at stake‘

Putting Empire Wind on hold would have dealt a blow to New York’s local economies, City Limits reported earlier this month.

The project, BOEM projects, will generate $195 million in income for New York City and inject $1.6 billion into the state-wide economy during the planning and construction phases, according to developer Equinor.

It also seeks to breathe new life into the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT), an industrial port in Sunset Park that serves as an operational and maintenance hub for Empire Wind and other offshore ventures.

The project ushered in business to the industrial zone, which has long been overlooked for economic investment, into what the city calls “a prime destination for environmentally sustainable industry.”

A Project Labor Agreement (PLA) that Equinor signed for the construction of SBMT guaranteed “over 1,000 union construction jobs and apprenticeships in local New York communities.” The agreement prioritizes hiring union members from the Sunset Park community, and secondarily, union members from New York City. It also gives hiring priority to union members who are NYCHA residents and veterans.

“There was so much at stake for the renewable energy industry, the union employees who would be performing the work, and the opportunities for the surrounding communities to participate in the project,” said Christopher Erikson in a statement.

Erikson is business manager at Local Union No. 3 IBEW, representing the workers at Sunset Park’s marine terminal.

Despite its reversal on Empire Wind, the Trump administration said it’s still reconsidering a federal grant to build an onshore and offshore wind safety training facility un upstate New York. And an executive order that suspended new leasing and permitting for wind projects is still at large.

Raking in record donations from the fossil fuel industry while running for office, Trump has continuously positioned himself against non-polluting renewable energy sources like wind and has encouraged drilling for more oil and gas instead.

At the same time, environmental groups worry Gov. Hochul’s commitment to significantly lowering New York’s greenhouse gas emissions may be waning, citing the state’s approval of another pipeline expansion project earlier this year.

The decision is out of step with New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, they argue. The CLCPA, passed by Albany in 2019, established a roadmap for the state to mostly phase out planet-warming fossil fuels like gas by 2050, and transition to clean energy instead.

“We and others will fight tooth and nail to stop new fracked gas pipelines the state already rejected, if Hochul is doing a deal to approve those. Hell no to that,” said Pete Sikora, climate and inequality campaigns director with New York Communities for Change.

The team includes Ballard Power Systems, Forsee Power, and Linamar Corporation.

Fontaine Modification integrates the vehicle and systems. It will build the FCEV on a 26,000-pound GVWR straight truck chassis at its Charlotte, N.C., modification center. Ballard Power Systems supplies the fuel cell system. Forsee Power provides the high-voltage battery system. Linamar contributes the eAxle.

“Fontaine Modification is excited to lead this team of well-established companies that are committed to bringing clean mobility solutions to the commercial vehicle market,” said David Brosky, Fontaine Modification director, sales & business development – eMobility. “We are on track to complete a pilot unit this summer. The team will conduct independent track testing on the pilot unit before delivering it to its first customer.”

Class 6 Fuel Cell Truck Targets Middle-Mile Use Cases

Fontaine’s sister company, Kentucky Trailer, will build a lift-gated dry freight body for the pilot vehicle. If the field trial succeeds, Fontaine could start full production of the Class 6 fuel cell truck as early as late 2026.

“The middle-mile segment covers freight hauled between warehouses or distribution centers,” Brosky explained. “This segment is usually the longest, with runs within states or across regions of typically 300 to 500 miles. It’s that need for longer range that makes a fuel-cell system the best zero-emission option for efficiently powering a middle-mile truck.”

The project gives each partner a chance to showcase new technologies and support fleet sustainability goals.

“Ballard is showcasing the value of its latest fuel cell system FCmove-XD in North America for the first time,” said Nicolas Pocard, Ballard Power Systems vice president marketing & strategic partnerships. “The module provides an easy integration platform for vehicle OEMs and integrators. It is designed to deliver up to 60% fuel efficiency with volumetric power density of 0.36kW/L. And last over 30,000 hours in operation. Developed for volume production, this commercial and scalable fuel cell module provides a competitive total cost of ownership.”

Battery-Fuel Cell Integration Enhances Range and Efficiency

The team designed the truck to balance fuel cell and battery power for peak performance, range, and durability.

“Battery systems are critical to fuel-cell-electric vehicles. Depending on the situation, the FCEV is driven by the battery, by the fuel cell, or by both if extra power is needed,” said Jeremy Hiler, Forsee Power sales manager, truck and off highway. “It was critical to offer a solution that can meet the technical needs of long distance (power peaks on highway) and local deliveries, optimizing the cost.”

Fleet Operators Gain Efficiency, Comfort, and Savings

The pilot vehicle delivers benefits beyond zero emissions, helping fleets cut costs and improve driver experience.

“The vehicle’s low-maintenance design helps fleet operators reduce operational costs, while its quiet propulsion system provides a smoother and less intrusive experience for drivers and others on the road,” said Kevin Ledford, vice president of engineered product at Linamar. “Regenerative braking recoups energy that the vehicle would otherwise lose and boosts overall efficiency. Separately, it reduces wear and tear on critical components, leading to lower maintenance costs and improved durability.”",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fontaine-Modification-FCEV-Truck-Ballard-1400.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 12:32:56.787918

However, amid slower than expected demand for EVs, Ford and SK On opted to only utilize one of those plants and hire 2,500 workers in the interim, with production currently slated to begin very soon. Now, however, it seems as if the singular operational BlueOval SK Battery Park plant won’t just be building batteries for Ford, as some of that space will also be used to supply them to one of its rivals.

That rival is Nissan, according to The Wall Street Journal, which will now utilize part of the BlueOval SK Battery Park site to build batteries for its own EVs. The move makes sense given Ford’s scale back in terms of planned production, coupled with Nissan’s desire to avoid tariffs by building batteries in the U.S. Back in March, SK On announced that it had signed a battery supply agreement with Nissan, which will result in the company supplying the automaker with roughly 100 GWh of EV batteries between 2028-2033, all of which will be built in the U.S.

The batteries utilize high-nickel pouch cells and will power Nissan’s next-generation EVs, which will be built at the company’s plant in Canton, Mississppi starting in 2028 as that automaker works to dig itself out of a large financial hole. It is worth noting that none of the parties involved confirmed this report when asked to comment on the matter, and SK On did add that it hasn’t yet determined where it will build EV batteries for Nissan in the U.S. as of yet. In the meantime, Ford and SK On are facing allegations of unsafe working conditions at BlueOval SK Battery Park, which elicited a statement from the United Auto Workers (UAW) union recently.

Slowing demand for EVs also recently prompted The Blue Oval to push back its planned production start date for the next-generation Ford F-150 EV from 2026 to 2027 at the under-construction Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center, located nearby at the BlueOval City site.

Global solar power generation jumped by 34% in the first quarter of 2025 from the same period in 2024, according to data from Ember cited by Reuters columnist Gavin Maguire.
This would beat the average 223 TWh of global nuclear power generation from 2024, Maguire notes.
China and Europe are driving solar power’s global surge, but in Europe, the solar boom has led to negative power prices more frequently.
Negative power prices, while beneficial for some consumers in some countries, generally discourage investments in new capacity as renewable power generators don’t profit from below-zero prices.","This summer, solar power generation globally could exceed electricity from nuclear power plants for the first time ever, as solar capacity soars and sunlight and daylight hours are long in the northern hemisphere.

Global solar power generation jumped by 34% in the first quarter of 2025 from the same period in 2024, according to data from Ember cited by Reuters columnist Gavin Maguire.

If the pace of growth is sustained though June, July, and August, solar output is set to top 260 terawatt hours (TWh) in the summer months. This would beat the average 223 TWh of global nuclear power generation from 2024, Maguire notes.

Last year, record growth in renewables led by solar helped push clean power above 40% of global electricity in 2024, Ember said in its Global Electricity Review 2025 last month. However, heatwave-related demand spikes led to a small increase in fossil generation, too, the clean energy think tank said.

“Solar generation has maintained its high growth rate, doubling in the last three years, and adding more electricity than any other source over that period,” Ember’s analysts wrote in the report.

More than half, or 53%, of the increase in solar generation in 2024 was in China, with China’s clean generation growth meeting 81% of its demand increase in 2024, according to Ember.

China and Europe are driving solar power’s global surge, but in Europe, the solar boom has led to negative power prices more frequently.

At the end of April, for example, a sunny weekend in northwest Europe plunged power prices in the region to hundreds of euros below zero as solar generation soared.

Negative power prices, while beneficial for some consumers in some countries, generally discourage investments in new capacity as renewable power generators don’t profit from below-zero prices.

The more frequent occurrences of negative prices amid soaring solar output aren’t conducive to increased investment in generation only, and highlight the need of energy storage solutions to store the excess power and discharge it at evenings when it’s most needed.

,American Energy,2025-05-21 13:31:15+00:00,Canary Media,Some of the most polluted US cities are home to coal-based steel plants - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/coal-steel-air-pollution-cities,"But seven factories with blast furnaces remain, and they are contributing to poor air quality in the cities where they are located.
Those cities rank among the top 25 with the worst air in the U.S. for at least one of the two most widespread types of pollution, according to new data from the American Lung Association.
The tristate Chicago metropolitan area where those facilities are located ranked 15th for ozone and 13th for year-round particulate matter on the American Lung Association’s list of more than 200 U.S. cities.
Among more than 600 major emitters in Ohio, Cleveland-Cliffs’ Middletown Works plant ranked ninth on Industrious Labs’ list for NOx and sixth for PM2.5.
Cleveland-Cliffs and Nucor did not respond to emails asking whether they would join U.S. Steel.","The United States hasn’t built a new coal-burning steel mill in nearly half a century. Stricter environmental regulations shifted some of that production overseas, while the latest steel plants adopted newer and cleaner technologies. But seven factories with blast furnaces remain, and they are contributing to poor air quality in the cities where they are located.

Those cities rank among the top 25 with the worst air in the U.S. for at least one of the two most widespread types of pollution, according to new data from the American Lung Association.

The research measured ozone and particulate matter, and when analyzed alongside data on emissions from the blast furnaces, reveal a strong correlation.

“These facilities are some of the biggest emitters of the pollution the American Lung Association’s report is measuring,” said Hilary Lewis, the steel director at the climate research group Industrious Labs, who recently compared the American Lung Association data with her group’s prior research on pollution from steel factories.

“Transitioning these coal-burning furnaces to cleaner alternatives reduces those emissions,” she added. ​“This is a key step that these communities can take toward getting off the worst-25 list and moving toward cleaner air.”

Last fall, Industrious Labs published the first facility-by-facility breakdown of emissions from every coal-based U.S. steelmaking plant, measuring output of ozone-causing nitrogen oxides (NOx) and PM2.5, the tiny particulate matter increasingly linked to everything from asthma, cancer, and heart disease to ailments afflicting the entire human life cycle: erectile dysfunction, newborns’ congenital heart defects, and dementia.

The analysis ranks the pollution from each steel factory against the emissions from other high-polluting facilities in a given state. Northwest Indiana’s three coal-based steel plants all ranked in the top 10 for NOx and the top five for PM2.5 compared to over 300 other major emitters in the state. The tristate Chicago metropolitan area where those facilities are located ranked 15th for ozone and 13th for year-round particulate matter on the American Lung Association’s list of more than 200 U.S. cities.

Among more than 600 major emitters in Ohio, Cleveland-Cliffs’ Middletown Works plant ranked ninth on Industrious Labs’ list for NOx and sixth for PM2.5. The Cincinnati region where it’s located ranked 14th out of 208 U.S. metropolitan areas for annual particle pollution. The company’s plant in Cleveland fell in 15th place for NOx and seventh for PM2.5, potentially helping drive its home city to ninth place on the American Lung Association’s nationwide list of 208 metropolitan areas with the worst annual particle pollution.

While Cleveland-Cliffs’ other location in Dearborn, Michigan, was only the 42nd-worst emitter of NOx in that state, compared with more than 600 other major polluters, the plant came in sixth for PM2.5 on Industrious Labs’ list — directly mirroring its spot in sixth place on the American Lung Association’s list of U.S. locations with the worst annual particle pollution.

In Pennsylvania, ranked against more than 700 of the state’s biggest polluters, U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thomson Works facility similarly took 40th place on Industrious Labs’ list for NOx, but 21st for PM2.5. On the American Lung Association’s list, the Pittsburgh area where it’s located came in 12th for the worst annual particle pollution nationwide.

“It just points to the fact that coal-based steelmaking is harmful to our health, and we need to be taking more action today to clean up these mills,” Lewis said.

The Trump administration is considering slashing federal programs designed to help steel giants such as Cleveland-Cliffs and Nucor Corp. clean up operations by investing in new equipment like electric arc furnaces to replace the old coal-fired units, the newest of which was built in 1980.

“The transition is at risk,” Lewis said. ​“All the threats to federal funding for things like modernizing American manufacturing do put the future of clean steel at risk.”

Worse yet, the American Lung Association data doesn’t even capture the full extent of the pollution, said Jack Weinberg, the steel adviser for Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, a nonprofit that advocates for upgrading the equipment at northwest Indiana’s mills.

“The monitoring data seems to understate the problem,” he said.

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency issued new rules aimed at requiring steelmakers to clean up ​“unmeasured fugitive emissions” — air pollution emitted when opening valves, or from leaks, that companies had not previously counted in reports to regulators. In March, however, the Trump administration invited companies to apply for full presidential exemptions from the rule for two years. Earlier this month, U.S. Steel became the first major American steelmaker to announce in a regulatory filing that it took President Donald Trump up on his offer. Cleveland-Cliffs and Nucor did not respond to emails asking whether they would join U.S. Steel.

Emissions from U.S. Steel’s Gary Works plant in Indiana are likely linked to as many as 114 premature deaths, 48 emergency room visits, and almost 32,000 asthma attacks each year, according to Industrious Labs’ October analysis, which uses the EPA’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment model.

“Anecdotally, and I think more accurately,” Weinberg said, ​“people believe the pollution is affecting their health.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1753130629.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ce7041e7f78856fb6222d0d980d9bbf5,N,,2025-05-21 11:09:49.932531

PLANO, Texas – America’s bestselling non-pickup will switch to an all-hybrid lineup when the 2026 Toyota RAV4 compact SUV goes on sale later this year.

The dramatic move follows Toyota’s change to all-hybrid last year with the Camry, America’s No. 1 midsize sedan.

Toyota is dramatically increasing sales of hybrid and electric vehicles at the same time the company says U.S. tariffs will raise prices and make it harder for people to afford a new vehicle.

“A 25% tariff is not sustainable long term without significant price increases,” Toyota North America Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Mark Templin said at the company’s sprawling headquarter complex here. “They put a new car out of reach of many consumers.”

New sporty and outdoorsy models

The new RAV4 lineup will include plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and performance GR-Sport models as the automaker looks to expand sales of its franchise vehicle. The PHEVs will produce 320 horsepower, up from 302 for the 2025 RAV4. The sporty GR-Sport will be a PHEV.

For the first time, hybrids will be available on front- and all-wheel models.

An outdoorsy new Woodland model will be available as a hybrid or PHEV. AWD will be standard.

Toyota will announce electric range, fuel economy and prices closer to when sales begin.

Key features:

DC fast charging port for PHEVs

Nine-speaker JBL audio

Head-up display

Standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto

New lights, gauges and screens

Toyota’s ""hammerhead"" grille and front lights are new, along with LED taillights.

The interior features a 10.5- or 12.9-inch touch screen, depending on trim level. Digital climate controls are integrated into the bottom of the screen.

A 12.3-inch digital instrument replaces 7-inch mechanical gauges. Upper trim levels will get a toggle-switch gear selector.

The RAV4’s dimensions don’t change, but the body grew stiffer to reduce noise and improve ride and handling.

According to an exclusive Wall Street Journal report, the decision affects one of two battery plants Ford launched in 2021 as part of a $7 billion EV investment with South Korea’s SK On. Today, one of the Kentucky factories sits idle, while the other is only partially operational, and it is now expected to produce batteries for both Ford and Nissan.

The shift marks the latest retreat for Ford, which projected a $5 billion loss in its EV unit this year after a $5 billion loss in 2024. Earlier this month, the automaker suspended its full-year financial guidance, citing uncertainty around potential tariffs on imported EV components.

For Nissan, access to a U.S.-based battery plant offers a lifeline as the company faces its own financial pressure, reporting a $4.5 billion loss in the first quarter and announcing plans to lay off 20,000 workers. Producing batteries domestically helps Nissan mitigate tariffs on imported parts and vehicles. The company previously canceled a planned battery facility in Japan and announced in March that SK On would supply batteries for its future electric SUVs to be built at its Canton, Mississippi, plant.

The battery production deal, though not officially confirmed by Ford, Nissan, or SK On, represents a cost-saving opportunity for both automakers. Ford redirected questions to the BlueOval SK joint venture, while representatives from Nissan and SK On declined to provide details on the Kentucky site’s role in the partnership.

While the Ford-SK On venture received a $9.63 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy to support construction of the Kentucky and Tennessee plants, which were expected to generate more than 12,000 jobs. Ford said plans for the Tennessee site remain unchanged.

The broader EV market has cooled in recent months. In April, EV sales fell 5% despite gains in the overall auto market. General Motors recently exited a battery plant project in Michigan, and Honda said this week it would slash over $20 billion in EV spending, delaying a Canadian factory.

It’s hard to imagine how the country benefits from ending a decades-long national commitment to help the low-income communities that pay the highest price for toxic pollution and industrial harm.
It will simply force the rest of us to bear the costs of pollution that others create.
Preventing that pollution more than pays for itself — more than 30 times over, in the case of protecting clean air.
That’s one reason why, since the EPA was created in 1970, the economy has grown an inflation-adjusted 344 percent.","Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is slated to go before a Senate panel today to try and defend the indefensible: taking the nation’s environmental guardian off the beat.

That’s what the Trump administration has in mind with its proposal to slash EPA funding nearly 55 percent for the 2026 budget year, the subject of Wednesday’s hearing before the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works,

Nobody voted for that. In fact, nearly nine in 10 — 88 percent — want Congress to increase EPA funding, or at least hold it steady.

Few arms of the federal government reach our daily lives quite like the EPA. Its mission is to safeguard the air we breathe and the water we drink, manage hazardous waste, clean up contaminated industrial sites and protect us from toxic chemicals.

It defends the health of every person in this country.

The administration’s reckless assault on the EPA, its professional staff and the tools they need to do their job shows it is wildly out of touch with the people it purports to serve. Congress must step up and put a check on this off-the-rails scheme to sacrifice the environment and the health of our people for the benefit of oil and gas companies and other industrial polluters.

The administration’s proposal would cut EPA staff to levels last seen four decades ago, when there were 25 percent fewer Americans and a smaller and less complex economy than we have today.

These are biologists, chemists and other professionals that our nation depends on to tell the truth about forever chemicals in our drinking water, mercury in our fish and toxic pollution in the air we breathe. Their work is critical to sustaining such natural resources as the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River and delta.

Firing the people who do this essential work won’t eliminate those dangers. It will simply blind us to them, impede our ability to confront them and give big polluters more opportunity to break our laws and threaten our health.

Then there are the EPA programs slated for elimination.

It will be interesting, for example to hear how Zeldin defends the elimination of his agency’s popular “Energy Star” program. By providing reliable information that allows buyers to compare the annual energy use of dozens of appliances, the program has helped consumers and businesses save a staggering $500 billion on energy costs since its inception in 1992. That works out to $350 in savings for every dollar spent on the program. Eliminating that program won’t save money.

In addition, new money would be cut by nearly 90 percent for the EPA-administered revolving fund that supports popular grants that states depend on to upgrade drinking water systems and sewage treatment plants. And the agency has eliminated its critical environmental justice work. It’s hard to imagine how the country benefits from ending a decades-long national commitment to help the low-income communities that pay the highest price for toxic pollution and industrial harm.

Slashing EPA funding by roughly $4.5 billion — less than one-tenth of a penny on the dollar of federal spending — isn’t about saving money. The real goal is to hobble the agency that has the authority to say “no” to polluting industries.

That won’t cut costs. It will simply force the rest of us to bear the costs of pollution that others create.

Preventing that pollution more than pays for itself — more than 30 times over, in the case of protecting clean air.

That’s one reason why, since the EPA was created in 1970, the economy has grown an inflation-adjusted 344 percent. Predictable rules of the road encourage investment and innovation, to say nothing of protecting a healthy and productive workforce, consumer base and national quality of life.

If the administration succeeds in hollowing out the EPA, we’ll all pay the price, with dirtier air, more exposure to toxic chemicals, and more polluted rivers, lakes and streams. The costs will be measured in more emergency room visits, more heart disease, more respiratory illness, more lost days at work and more premature deaths.

Nobody campaigned on that last November, and nobody wants it now. It’s time for Congress to listen to the voice of the people and defend the agency we all depend on to protect the environment and public health.

NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / May 21, 2025 / Growing up in the heart of Hudson County, New Jersey, Carolina Ramos always felt a connection to her community and a desire to make a difference. Her path led her from college studies to hands-on experience in local government and, ultimately, to a career in the growing energy sector. But what stands out most in her story is how she turned her passion into opportunity - and how others can do the same.

A personal mission to create change

After studying environmental sciences at Rutgers University, Carolina joined the AmeriCorps VISTA program in Jersey City, where she worked on recycling initiatives before transitioning to the city's sustainability department.

[CEJ] helped me figure out exactly what kind of work I was looking for.""

- Carolina Ramos, Clean Energy Jobs program graduate

""That's where I did what I really loved, giving back to my community and being a civil servant,"" she said.

But Carolina knew there was more to learn, and as the clean energy industry rapidly expanded, she wanted to be part of it in a bigger way.

In addition to taking data science courses, connecting with industry leaders and learning from seasoned professionals, she became involved with ""Latinx in Sustainability."" As part of its leadership team, Carolina helped develop mentorship programs, professional development stipends and webinars to make the clean energy industry more accessible.

""We wanted to let people know that there is space for everyone in this industry,"" she explained.

The right connections, the right opportunities

Through her network, Carolina was introduced to the Clean Energy Jobs Program, an initiative that helps New Jersey residents access training and career opportunities in the clean energy sector. CEJ works with the state's Department of Labor and numerous public and private partners, including PSE&G, to connect job seekers with real-world opportunities, from skilled trades to professional roles in energy consulting.

Carolina shared her career goals with CEJ, and they helped her refine her resume, identify job openings and navigate the hiring process.

""They helped me figure out exactly what kind of work I was looking for,"" she said.

A career with purpose and growth

Thanks to the support and resources available through CEJ, Carolina landed a position at an energy consulting firm, where she now works on projects that improve efficiency, assess energy usage and help companies - including PSE&G - implement smart solutions.

""It's been great to get all the technical skills I wanted, to challenge myself and to learn more about the industry,"" she said. ""I've always advocated for myself, wanting to contribute to different communities - especially Spanish-speaking communities - while building a strong technical skill set.""

Even as she builds her career, Carolina is focused on helping others find their path in the clean energy sector. She volunteers at resume workshops and speaks to students and job seekers about the variety of opportunities available.

""I know there are so many people who think they can't be part of this industry because they don't have a four-year degree or they're still in community college,"" she said. ""But there are so many different opportunities, whether you want to go into the trades, pursue certifications or work in analysis like I do. It's a booming industry, and there's room for so many more voices.""

Powering the future - together

Carolina's journey is a testament to what's possible when ambition meets opportunity. With the right support and access to resources like the Clean Energy Jobs Program, more people can step into rewarding careers in the energy industry.

For those looking to make a career move, whether in the trades, technology or analysis, now is the time. The industry is growing, the opportunities are real, and, like Carolina, you might just find the perfect fit.

With over 36 billion barrels of proven oil and 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the country presents one of the continent’s most dynamic and commercially attractive energy markets. ExxonMobil is investing $10 billion in Nigeria’s offshore oil operations, with a focus on developing the deepwater Owo project while boosting production from existing assets. Chevron has renewed three deepwater leases for 20 years, is expanding operations at the Agbami field – one of Nigeria’s largest deepwater discoveries – made a major oil find in the shallow offshore Western Niger Delta in October, and plans to bring the Owowo field online by 2029.

At the same time, U.S. interest in Nigeria’s gas infrastructure is expanding, with growing momentum behind the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline – a $25 billion, 5,600-km regional project that will deliver Nigerian gas to North Africa and Europe. The U.S. is reportedly interested in investing in this strategic venture, which aligns with both Nigeria’s Decade of Gas agenda and global efforts to diversify energy supply chains. The Nigeria LNG Train 7 project – supported by U.S. engineering firms and suppliers – is increasing the country’s liquefaction capacity by 35%. The project is expected to unlock new export potential while catalyzing midstream infrastructure, including gas processing plants, pipelines and power generation facilities.

At USAEF, Nigeria’s delegation will present a compelling case to American investors, showcasing upstream and gas opportunities opened by the Petroleum Industry Act and recent licensing rounds. These reforms have strengthened regulatory certainty, streamlined approvals and created clearer frameworks for joint ventures and production-sharing contracts – all designed to boost investor confidence.

The downstream sector is also undergoing transformation. With the Dangote Refinery now operational – the world’s largest single-train refinery – Nigeria is positioning itself as a regional refining hub, reducing its dependence on imports and creating new value chains in petrochemicals and logistics. U.S. firms have opportunities to participate in refinery upgrades, modular systems and technical services.

While security and governance challenges remain, Nigeria has made meaningful strides in improving the ease of doing business, cutting red tape and fast-tracking legacy projects. The government is actively prioritizing production from undeveloped discoveries, unlocking billions of dollars’ worth of stranded reserves and signaling a pragmatic approach to resource development.

As the U.S. expands its engagement with Africa’s energy markets, Nigeria offers a strategic entry point – backed by an extensive resource base, improving fiscal terms and a wave of American-led projects already underway.

Announced last Friday, the funding includes a $500,000 Assessment Grant and a $713,600 Cleanup Grant, as confirmed by Steve Gugliotta, Galesburg’s Director of Community Development.
The grants will support environmental remediation and planning for key sites, including the former Knox Laundry, Broadview Hotel, and Tucker’s Printing Company properties.

The grants will support environmental remediation and planning for key sites, including the former Knox Laundry, Broadview Hotel, and Tucker’s Printing Company properties.

Gugliotta tells WGIL, “We appreciate the US EPA selection for these grants which can provide a number of benefits to our community.”

Cleanup focus: Knox Laundry site

The Cleanup Grant will target the former Knox Laundry site at 57 N. Kellogg St./332 E. Ferris St., a property used as a retail laundry since 1898 and later a multi-story drycleaning plant until the mid-1990s. Deemed unsafe, the city demolished the facility in 2006-07 via court order. Previous state brownfield funding supported extensive assessments, confirming contamination above soil saturation limits.

The EPA funds will treat impacted soils and install an engineered barrier, such as pavement, to limit exposure risks, paving the way for safe redevelopment.

“Terminating operations and removing structures stopped potential ongoing contamination,” Gugliotta noted, emphasizing the grant’s role in cleaning up the site’s long-standing soil contamination.

Assessing additional brownfield sites

The Assessment Grant will fund site assessments, cleanup plans, and reuse strategies for other brownfield sites, starting with the former Broadview Hotel at 29 Public Square and Tucker’s Printing Company at 175, 179, and 193 N. Cherry St. The Broadview Hotel site, with a history of hotels since 1869 and a filling station in 1927, was demolished in April 2023 due to safety violations. Tucker’s Printing Company, razed in 2024 after a second major fire, raises environmental concerns due to its historical use. These assessments will clarify the extent of hazardous materials, enabling safe redevelopment. If funds remain, the city will consult a 2023 Brownfields Inventory by Kansas State University and Terracan to identify additional priority sites.

Economic and environmental benefits

Gugliotta highlighted the grants’ broader benefits, noting that the cleanup efforts will improve environmental health by removing or containing contaminants, while attracting developers to transform vacant lots into productive spaces.

“These grants can facilitate new construction and job creation,” he said, aligning with Galesburg’s redevelopment goals outlined in a June 2024 WGIL report.

“The Carbon Hub is building an essential supply chain,” said Adam Boies, associate professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University.
Everyone needs to be in the room.” Carbon Hub is distinct not just for its scientific mission but for its structure.
“The Carbon Hub exemplifies how real progress toward sustainability happens — not in isolation but through trusted, long-term partnerships across academia, industry and institutions.
The Carbon Hub’s approach aims to solve that by using methane or biomass to yield hydrogen and carbon materials simultaneously with minimal waste.","As the world races to address the climate crisis, a coalition headquartered at Rice University is taking a radically collaborative approach to one of the toughest challenges: how to decarbonize industry while at the same time boosting manufacturing, improving infrastructure and securing the supply chains for the energy and materials we rely on every day.

The Carbon Hub, a Rice-led initiative founded five years ago, is bringing together scientists, industry leaders, federal labs and policymakers from across the globe to reimagine the role of hydrocarbons — not as fuels to be burned but as sources of clean hydrogen and advanced carbon materials.

“Building a sustainable economy that allows people to meet the standards of living they expect, while being mindful that we only have one Earth, requires bringing everyone to the table in open collaboration,” said Marie Contou-Carrere, executive director of the Rice Sustainability Institute and the founding executive director of the Carbon Hub. “This transition won’t happen in a silo. It has to be collective.”

That vision was on full display at the Carbon Hub’s annual meeting May 12-13 at Rice. Now in its fifth year, the gathering drew more than 250 attendees — up from just 40 or 50 in its early days — and featured technical updates, road map planning and big-picture panels exploring public-private partnerships and global decarbonization efforts. Keynote speakers and participants included collaborators of the Carbon Hub from more than 15 institutions; Rice faculty and experts from across numerous disciplines including engineering, science, architecture and the Baker Institute for Public Policy; leaders from Huntsman, Prysmian Group, SABIC, The Kavli Foundation, Novo Nordisk Foundation CO₂ Research Center, Shell and Aston Martin; and energy policy experts and materials scientists from across academia and industry.

“We’ve made strong progress in building a community, advancing technology and getting the word out, and we’ve received significant support from both corporations and government,” said Matteo Pasquali, director of the Carbon Hub, the A.J. Hartsook Professor of Chemical Engineering and professor of materials science and nanoengineering and chemistry at Rice. “If you stay within the existing frameworks, inevitably you face tradeoffs between economic and environmental benefits. Because we went outside the mainstream view of carbon, we are proposing solutions that bring climate benefits while also opening opportunities to boost manufacturing and strengthen supply chain security. That’s why we’re seeing such broad support.”

“This year, it was great to see even more participation from both academia and industry,” said Ricardo Prada Silvy, chief technology officer of CHASM Advanced Materials. “The panels and technical talks were top notch, and that’s what really makes Carbon Hub such a success. I look forward to continuing to participate actively in this community.”

The Carbon Hub’s core idea is deceptively simple: Instead of burning hydrocarbons and releasing carbon dioxide, why not split them into hydrogen for clean energy and solid carbon for materials? This process could address multiple issues at once, from energy access to emissions to the unsustainable use of critical metals.

“When people talk about the climate transition, they focus on energy,” Contou-Carrere said. “But there’s a materials transition happening too. Our electric vehicles, wind turbines and solar panels are built from materials that are often nonrecyclable, carbon-intensive to produce and sourced from geopolitically unstable regions.”

Carbon-based materials, if developed at scale, could replace emissions-heavy metals like steel, aluminum and copper in structural applications, potentially avoiding gigatons of CO₂. But getting there requires coordinated action across the entire value chain, from hydrogen production to carbon processing, product development, policy and public perception.

“The Carbon Hub is building an essential supply chain,” said Adam Boies, associate professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University. “It includes people who own hydrocarbons, researchers who convert them, manufacturers who use the materials, policymakers who regulate them and investors who finance them. Everyone needs to be in the room.”

Carbon Hub is distinct not just for its scientific mission but for its structure. It’s a true coalition, intentionally built to include voices across disciplines and borders. Collaborators span the U.S., Spain, Italy, South Korea and the U.K. with academic partners including Rice, Stanford, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State University, University of California, Santa Barbara and University of Minnesota.

“The Carbon Hub exemplifies how real progress toward sustainability happens — not in isolation but through trusted, long-term partnerships across academia, industry and institutions. It’s one of Rice’s most effective platforms for accelerating the development of scalable, sustainable technologies,” said Luay Nakhleh, the William and Stephanie Sick Dean of the George R. Brown School of Engineering and Computing. “As we work to generate sustainable futures — one of the key drivers in our university’s strategic plan — the Carbon Hub stands as a model for how collaborative, mission-driven research can drive global impact.”

That global scope is matched by a commitment to impact. Since its inception, the Carbon Hub has catalyzed more than $12 million in funding from organizations like the Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation and The Kavli Foundation. A flagship Kavli-funded project has enabled the coalition to expand its efforts on critical basic nanoscience questions, which in turn accelerates the advancement of reactor designs that convert hydrocarbons into solid carbon more efficiently and sustainably with applications ranging from cables to consumer products.

“The Carbon Hub is reimagining the meaning of the carbon nanotube, effectively introducing a new class of materials and a dramatically fresh way to address many critical issues,” said Jeff Miller, nanoscience program officer at The Kavli Foundation. “As such, we wanted to enable the team to identify and study gaps in fundamental science knowledge, because deeper understanding leads to bigger step changes which maximize impact and accelerate outcomes.”

One of the most powerful ideas to come out of the Carbon Hub’s work is the concept of “CO₂ avoidance” rather than just CO₂ reduction. It’s not just about cutting emissions, but instead it’s about designing systems that don’t create them in the first place.

Take hydrogen: While clean to use, it’s not naturally available and must be produced, often through processes that either consume vast amounts of energy or generate harmful by-products. The Carbon Hub’s approach aims to solve that by using methane or biomass to yield hydrogen and carbon materials simultaneously with minimal waste.

“We always ask: Can this solution hit multiple targets at once?” Contou-Carrere said. “Clean energy, lower emissions, better materials, domestic manufacturing, supply chain security, more industrial jobs — that’s the mindset we bring.”

At the annual meeting, participants discussed next steps, identifying gaps in public-private collaboration, advancing new research directions and expanding outreach to communities that may not yet realize how these changes will impact their lives.

“The presentations were incredibly informative for our student participants and have inspired many of them to take a leading role in working toward more community engagement in the next steps of their Rice journey,” said Karyn Fu, a junior at Rice who leads the Civic Immersion: Late Departure program for the university’s Center for Civic Leadership.

One session explored the transformative potential of carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers in next-generation composite materials. Facilitated by Michelle Michot Foss, fellow in energy, minerals and materials at the Baker Institute’s Center for Energy Studies, and Vinod Veedu, assistant vice president for defense research advancement at Rice, the discussion focused on the integration of CNTs to enhance mechanical strength, electrical conductivity and thermal management in nanoengineered composites — particularly in sectors like aerospace and defense. Participants delved into the commercialization challenges of CNT-enhanced materials, including issues of microcracking, interlaminar separation and scalable manufacturing. The conversation also addressed the evolving role of lightweight composites in aviation efficiency, the global competition in advanced materials development and the opportunities for artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate design and testing. Panelists and audience members emphasized the need for strategic government investment, defense applications as a proving ground and collaborative efforts to derisk and scale CNT technologies for broader commercial use.

“This was a great annual meeting, and I was impressed by the combination of cutting-edge science and vigorous industrial participation” said Lasse Rosendahl, executive director, professor and CEO of the Novo Nordisk Foundation CO2 Research Center (CORC) at Aarhus University in Denmark. “I look forward to establishing more formal relations between CORC and the Carbon Hub.”

Kenneth B. Medlock III, senior director of the Baker Institute’s Center for Energy Studies, reiterated the need for partnering research with industry.

“I always like to say it is the building block of life,” Medlock said. “I think we all learned that growing up, right? Well, it’s about time we figure out how to use it to support life on this Earth in ways that we haven’t before, and this is where we get into new structures, new materials and new ways of transporting electrons.”",https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/2025-05/featuredcopy_ch_annual_meeting_1080x1350-18_copy_2.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 12:29:24.515361

TVA is the first utility to submit a construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a small modular reactor.

Its application is the first in the U.S. for the BWRX-300, a reactor designed by GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy and under development in several other nations.

The BWRX-300 is the 10th generation of GE's boiling water reactor, a design TVA has operated for more than 50 years at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in Alabama.

""It's a tried and true technology,"" Scott Hunnewell said in an interview with the Chattanooga Times Free Press. Hunnewell is vice president of TVA's new nuclear program. ""There's a lot of confidence in that design. It's an American design. It will help create jobs and really help the economy.""

The 300-megawatt reactor would generate enough electricity to power around 175,000 homes with clean energy, and TVA's first reactor in Oak Ridge could be the first small modular reactor in the U.S.

The new class of reactors can be built more flexibly and cheaply than large traditional nuclear power plants, making them especially valuable for tech companies seeking to power artificial intelligence data centers without burning fossil fuels.

TerraPower of Washington state and X-energy of Maryland are designing advanced small modular reactors. They have submitted construction permit applications to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build in Wyoming and Texas, respectively. The companies are not utilities that provide power like TVA, and their reactors are cooled by salt and gas rather than water.

The first small modular reactor at the Clinch River Nuclear Site could cost around $5.4 billion, according to a draft of TVA's long-term energy plan, though the price is anticipated to decrease for later reactors. TVA plans to build multiple reactors in Oak Ridge.

When TVA led a team to reapply in April for an $800 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy for the project, it said the first reactor could come online in 2032, a year earlier than it previously planned.

'VERY FLUID'

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission will likely take 2 1/2 years to review and grant the construction permit. TVA can begin on non-nuclear construction as early as 2026 if it secures the Department of Energy grant, Hunnewell said.

""If we don't get that grant, that could extend our timeline and slow things down a little bit,"" Hunnewell said. ""We don't believe the $800 million is at risk at this point.""

TVA is also seeking an $8 million Department of Energy grant to help fund the license review. The federally owned utility, which supplies electricity to 10 million people in seven states, plans to work with the Trump administration on the project.

""We believe deploying new nuclear is essential to providing American families and businesses affordable and abundant electricity for decades to come,"" TVA CEO Don Moul said in a news release.

President Donald Trump and Chris Wright, his secretary of energy, have expressed strong support for new nuclear reactors to help the U.S. win a race to develop artificial intelligence. TVA could develop a supply chain for the BWRX-300 to encourage other utilities to build the reactors.

Republicans in Congress are debating phasing out clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act passed under President Joe Biden to help fund a massive tax cut bill. TVA got explicit permission in the legislation to use the tax credits, though it does not receive taxpayer dollars to fund its regular operations.

The utility has not yet evaluated what the loss of the tax credits would mean for the small modular reactor project.

""Like most things in politics, it's very fluid at this time,"" Hunnewell said. ""As they work through reconciliation, we'll take whatever is finalized, and then we'll go assess that.""

PROJECT HISTORY

TVA began exploring options for advanced nuclear reactors at the Clinch River Nuclear Site in 2010.

The Roane County site was previously home to a U.S. government reactor project and a small modular reactor project led by construction firm Bechtel and nuclear developer BWXT. Both projects stalled after losing funding.

TVA submitted an early site permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the project in 2016 and received the permit in 2019. It still holds the nation's only early site permit for a small modular reactor project.

The utility's board of directors, nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, authorized a new nuclear program in 2022 and has allocated $350 million to the project.

TVA joined a global partnership that included Ontario Power Generation in 2023 for the purpose of developing the BWRX-300.

Targeted at energy conservation and emission and pollution reduction, these projects are also expected to improve regional water quality and optimize energy infrastructure.

“The green loan empowers Jiangsu Financial Leasing to incorporate environmental considerations in their business activities, putting the company on track to meet its sustainability commitments,” the OCBC team says.

Outside China, OCBC is supporting energy projects in Australia, Southeast Asia, and North Asia as well as the UK and US. Commonalities include clear pathways to energy security, not just within the renewables space but also for liquid natural gas as a transitional fuel. The bank recently committed to financing two projects in the UK, including a large-scale commercially viable carbon capture storage facility and a gas-fired power plant with carbon capture. The OCBC team says, “Our involvement in financing long-distance transmission lines in the UK also favorably positions us to contribute to the development of an ASEAN power grid, which is currently being contemplated.”

Curtailment Risk

While China has made progress through massive transmission infrastructure investment, curtailment risk—whereby renewable energy generation may be deliberately reduced or halted due to grid constraints, oversupply, or market inefficiencies—remains a concern in certain regions. This is especially the case in the wind-rich northern provinces, where transmission constraints have led to curtailment rates that sometimes exceed 20%.

Elsewhere, curtailment risk tends to be pronounced in regions of the world that are experiencing rapid renewable energy growth but lack sufficient transmission infrastructure.

Brazil is one such country. Fitch Ratings predicts that the volume of curtailed energy there could rise over the next few years due to the level of intermittent renewable generation in the country’s energy mix and the time needed to construct new transmission lines.

Brazil is working to address this. Total infrastructure investment in the country reached R$259 billion (about $46 billion) in 2024, a 15% increase from the previous year, with around 46% allocated to energy projects, according to the Associação Brasileira da Infraestrutura e Indústrias de Base.

“Brazil’s energy market has demonstrated consistent growth, underpinned by robust regulatory oversight,” says Hugo Assunção, CFO at São Paulo-based Perfin Infra. “However, it faces structural challenges, notably curtailment … to key demand centers in the southeast. To mitigate this, investments have increasingly focused on expanding transmission infrastructure.” Perfin Infra’s infrastructure assets under management in 2024 increased from R$9 billion to R$15 billion in 2024, driven primarily by strategic investments across the transmission, generation, highways, and sanitation sectors.

Across Latin America as a whole, capital deployment led by Brazilian investors has grown steadily, Assunção says, supported in part by favorable regulatory frameworks.

“Recently, markets such as Chile and Colombia have emerged as standout opportunities,” he adds, “particularly in renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure sectors.”

Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, Assunção credits Brazil with solid momentum in capital markets appetite for well-designed infrastructure projects. “Brazil’s stable regulatory framework and the accelerating demand for clean energy have bolstered investor confidence,” he says.

Regulatory certainty remains a key factor in pushing renewables investment forward, along with policy support and streamlined permitting processes. These concerns have only gained prominence as the Trump administration’s recent actions demonstrate that regulatory uncertainty isn’t limited to emerging markets.

Policies impeding offshore wind and other renewable projects, which would have contributed substantial megawatt capacity to the system over the next decade, will create significant challenges for new-generation deployment across the US, says Marcia Hook, Energy Regulatory and Markets partner at Clifford Chance. Countries that maintain consistent investment in renewables without implementing obstructive regulations are most likely to gain competitive advantage, she argues.

“We don’t really see any other countries taking specific action against certain types of renewable projects,” says Hook.

Private-sector Funding

Crucial for private-sector investors trying to gauge their risk appetite are regulatory frameworks that include lender protections and foreclosure rights guarantees, while private equity investors closely evaluate how regulations might impact their exit opportunities and asset valuations.

That means private capital is focusing on jurisdictions with transparent, predictable regulatory environments and technologies with the strongest regulatory support.

Private illiquid funds “are increasingly displacing traditional banks as the primary source of financing, engaging from the early stages of project development, including the construction phase,” notes Perfin’s Assunção.

Perfin expects the tilt toward private capital for financing green and sustainable energy projects to persist through the end of this year, as projects aligned with the energy transition and emerging technologies—such as green hydrogen and energy storage—continue to attract significant investor interest.

The new clean vehicle credit already included workable and fully implemented “foreign entity of concern” prohibitions, but House Republicans chose to throw that language, as well as the clean vehicle and manufacturing credits, away in favor of hamstringing clean energy manufacturing development for the benefit of Big Oil.
In fact, during the first quarter of 2025, more EV manufacturing projects were canceled than in the previous two years combined.
Clean energy manufacturing—beyond just EVs—has been a driving force behind manufacturing growth in the United States.
Since August 2022, at least 186 new manufacturing projects have been announced, with the 94 projects underway supporting more than 100,000 jobs, all thanks to a budding clean energy manufacturing industry.","Already, the private sector is showing serious signs of strain, as clean energy manufacturing investment decreased by 11.5 percent in the first quarter of 2025 amid an uncertain and hostile environment created by the Trump administration and Congress. Supporting existing industries and helping new industries take hold requires a multifaceted approach that includes strong research and development paired with initial investments, longer-term support, and proper trade enforcement. Losing one of these facets makes the effort much harder, and punting two or three amounts to giving up. Additionally, the policies left in place—namely the on-again, off-again tariffs that would take effect if the proposed legislation is enacted—likely have more to do with other ideological means rather than supporting and growing domestic manufacturing.

Building and maintaining U.S. manufacturing

As mentioned above, to onshore manufacturing of the components of critical global supply chains, the United States must engage in long-term and robust investment. This includes direct support for the build-out of manufacturing facilities, as well as support for the uptake of components and a foundation to create domestic demand—just as the CHIPS and Science Act did for semiconductors and the IRA did for multiple industries, including electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.

With solar panel production in particular, for years the United States had a boom-and-bust tax policy that was supposed to encourage renewable power production, including from solar. Every few years, the credit would lapse, there would be a political fight, and then it would get extended for another year or so. The solar industry never had long-term certainty and often only provided a retroactive windfall rather than forward-looking incentives. There also was barely any direct funding to support the domestic manufacturing of solar panels, even though the technology was originally invented and supported through robust research and development at the U.S. Department of Energy. Back in 2012, the Obama administration utilized tariffs to try and hold on to the last remaining parts of the domestic panel manufacturing industry, and they were kept in place and strengthened by each successive administration. Even still, solar panel production continued to decline until 2022, when it began to blossom thanks to the full-scale investment portfolio established by the IRA.

House Republicans’ bill would gut domestic manufacturing

Last week, the House Energy and Commerce and the Ways and Means committees released and moved their draft language on the president’s “big, beautiful bill,” revealing that they intend to gut key provisions of the IRA. Notably, this includes a de facto repeal of credits that support the build-out of renewable energy projects due to onerous new requirements. In addition, their language includes a direct repeal of the following credits:

New clean vehicle tax credit: A $7,500 credit for purchase of EVs, prioritizing vehicles that are domestically assembled and whose batteries are made in North America or countries with which the United States has a free trade agreement. In turn, the credit has helped spur significant growth in EV demand. To date, there are 72,300 jobs tied to facilities making batteries and EVs that are eligible for the tax credit.

Commercial clean vehicle credit: Up to a $7,500 credit for the purchase of a commercial light-duty EV or up to $40,000 for the purchase of a commercial heavy-duty EV. The credit can also be monetized, meaning that it can be claimed by local governments, municipalities, school districts, and other tax-exempt entities. This has made the commercial clean vehicle credit an important component in electrifying local and state government vehicle fleets.

Previously owned clean vehicle credit: Up to a $4,000 credit for the purchase of a used EV. With lower income and vehicle price caps, the new clean vehicle tax credit is aimed at making EVs—and their associated fuel costs—more affordable for lower-income Americans.

Alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit: Designed to spur the build-out of charging infrastructure across the country, providing up to $1,000 for the installation of a private charger and up to $100,000 for the installation of commercial chargers.

Advanced manufacturing production credit: The linchpin of the manufacturing renaissance, this credit provides direct support for producing goods key to growing clean energy industries, from EV battery manufacturing to critical mineral processing. The new language would subject the credit to the onerous new requirements and would phase it down early—especially the portions regarding the manufacture of wind energy parts and components. An early phasedown would likely force companies to rethink the finances of planned, under construction, and completed facilities. Worse, the House Ways and Means Committee’s proposed “foreign entity of concern” requirements are so complicated that they are likely to be unworkable, with businesses unable to establish sufficient certainty to make investments—a problem that would be compounded by the Trump administration’s gutting of U.S. Treasury staff. The new clean vehicle credit already included workable and fully implemented “foreign entity of concern” prohibitions, but House Republicans chose to throw that language, as well as the clean vehicle and manufacturing credits, away in favor of hamstringing clean energy manufacturing development for the benefit of Big Oil.

At the same time, the Energy and Commerce Committee proposes to rescind funds from the following Department of Energy programs:

Loan Programs Office (LPO): This office has invested across clean energy industries, providing major funding to uplift innovative technologies. For example, it gave a major boost to a sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) refinery in Montana. Once fully operational, the facility would make Montana one of the leading producers of SAFs in the world, producing roughly 12 percent of global SAF supply through 2030.

Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) program: Alongside the LPO, this program has played a key role in American auto manufacturing by providing investments to spur the domestic expansion of clean vehicle production, notably by providing loans to Ford through the 2008 financial crisis as well as Tesla in its early days. More recently, the ATVM program supported a large EV manufacturing project in Georgia as well as Ford facilities in Kentucky and Tennessee.

Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program: This program supports major advancements in decarbonizing heavy industry, including at a steel mill in Vice President JD Vance’s hometown of Middletown, Ohio.

Repealing these credits and rescinding funds for these programs would strip away key investments to kickstart manufacturing facilities as well as longer-term incentives to help the industry strengthen and grow, and the Trump administration has also proposed drastically gutting research and development. The harms already done by the Department of Government Efficiency at the Department of Energy—including the growing rumors of first steps toward cutting investments in the Industrial Demonstrations Program which is critical for future industrial competitiveness—and in the nation have created a cocktail of failure for competitiveness in any future auto and clean energy industry supply chain.

What once was booming now fizzles

Much of taxpayers’ investment in advanced manufacturing has already been awarded or spent and was destined to pay off in the form of new factories, new jobs, and a stronger competitive position for the country. However, given the Trump administration’s decision to pull back from many of the projects and programs that would see this investment through to the end, the transformational investments made over the past few years now appear to have been wasted.

The previous administration’s investments in the EV industry—from minerals to charging to batteries to final assembly—were really starting to take hold, and as of a few months ago, job creation and private sector investment looked as sunny as ever. Indeed, private sector investments totaled nearly $200 billion as of January 2025, with projects underway supporting more than 50,000 jobs across the country and those announced projected to support tens of thousands more if they came to fruition. Alas, the uncertainty created by the Trump administration’s chaotic trade war and the worry over Congress repealing critical EV incentives slammed the brakes on this growth. In fact, during the first quarter of 2025, more EV manufacturing projects were canceled than in the previous two years combined. Billions of dollars in unrealized investments are now gone, all to pay for tax breaks for the rich in House Republicans’ proposed budget bill.

Clean energy manufacturing—beyond just EVs—has been a driving force behind manufacturing growth in the United States. Since August 2022, at least 186 new manufacturing projects have been announced, with the 94 projects underway supporting more than 100,000 jobs, all thanks to a budding clean energy manufacturing industry. That growing industry is spurred on by the existence of key tax incentives, none more so than the previously described advanced manufacturing production credit. Just the uncertainty over whether this credit and others will persist—on top of worries over the president’s reckless trade war—has led to at least $56 billion in investments and more than 62,000 jobs being lost, delayed, or threatened. A de facto repeal and phaseout of the advanced manufacturing production credit would certainly not reverse this slowdown and may just continue grinding the new manufacturing growth to an eventual halt.

Moreover, these attacks on domestic manufacturing are not harmful only to the country’s industrial competitiveness going forward: Given the strong overlap between advanced manufacturing and the country’s economic and national security, the proposed cuts stand to make the country weaker and less resilient. If the Pentagon thinks, for example, thatlithium-ion batteries are important to the military’s future, why would congressional Republicans and the Trump administration gut programs designed to ensure American leadership in that sector?

""We're not getting the results,"" he said of the business subsidies and the universities' technology programs.
The Business Development and Community Revitalization programs have been appropriated at least $1.5 billion since they were created in 2011 to replace tax credit incentives.","LANSING — There appears to be bipartisan support for making deep cuts to state business-attraction incentives and nixing funding for programs designed to commercialize universities' technology and research.

A week after the Democratic-led Senate voted to strip $75 million, or nearly two-thirds, from the initiatives in the next budget, Republican House Speaker Matt Hall said Tuesday he favors axing all $115.7 million.

Most of it, $100 million, goes to Business Development and Community Revitalization programs run by the Michigan Economic Development Corp and the Michigan Strategic Fund. One awards performance-based grants and loans to companies for creating jobs, making investments or both. The other gives incentives to developers for redeveloping brownfields and historic preservation sites if milestones are reached.

The remaining $15.7 million backs the Tech Transfer Talent Network, also known as T3N, and the Michigan Translational Research and Commercialization program, or MTRAC, which have helped launch hundreds of startups. Seven universities benefit from one or both programs.

One plank of House Republicans' plan to increase road funding by around $3 billion is using $500 million in projected ""surplus"" tax revenue. That figure fell to about $180 million under a revised estimate released Friday, Hall said at a news conference.

He said lawmakers could make up the $320 million difference by cutting the $115 million in ""corporate giveaways"" along with $28 million for the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity's Office of Global Michigan, $22 million for a COVID-19 task force, all $11 million arts and cultural grants issued by the MEDC, and $150 million by not filling 2,900 vacant state jobs.

""We're not getting the results,"" he said of the business subsidies and the universities' technology programs. ""We're just saying local roads is probably more important to more people than these big corporate giveaways. So we'll just get rid of the rest of them.""

The elimination of the funding would be a blow to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration, which has so far failed to persuade lawmakers to renew much bigger yearly deposits into the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund. The $500 million in annual funding for attracting ""critical"" industries and prepping sites — electric vehicle battery plants, for instance — is due to expire after this fiscal year despite having the backing of major business groups.

The Business Development and Community Revitalization programs have been appropriated at least $1.5 billion since they were created in 2011 to replace tax credit incentives.

Universities and entities like Invest Detroit, which has a venture capital arm, have expressed concerns that cuts to T3N and MTRAC would reverse progress on fostering an innovation economy.

The House has not proposed a full 2025-26 budget plan yet, but Hall’s comments signal what is likely coming from the chamber. Whitmer has proposed keeping the initiatives' funding flat at $115.7 million.

""We respect and understand the budget process and recognize that it evolves,"" MEDC spokesperson Otie McKinley said. ""We remain supportive of the funding levels proposed in Gov. Whitmer's executive budget recommendations. Alongside the governor, we look forward to working with our bipartisan legislative partners to ensure we are appropriately funded to execute the Make It in Michigan economic development strategy focused on people, places and projects.""",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/IMG_6102.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 09:08:19.878175

AI could keep us dependent on natural gas for decades to come

Last December, Meta announced plans to build a massive $10 billion data center for training its artificial intelligence models in rural northeast Louisiana. Stretching for more than a mile, it will be Meta’s largest in the world, and it will have an enormous appetite for electricity.

To power the data center, a Meta contractor called Entergy will build three large natural-gas power plants with a total capacity of 2.3 gigawatts. It’ll also upgrade the grid to accommodate the huge jump in anticipated demand.

The choice of natural gas as the go-to solution to meet the growing demand for power from AI is not unique to Louisiana. The fossil fuel is already the country’s chief source of electricity generation, and large natural-gas plants are being built around the country to feed electricity to new and planned AI data centers. That’s all but wiping out any prospect that the US will wean itself off natural gas anytime soon. Read the full story.

From executive orders to federal lawsuits against state-level climate policies, the administration has acted with urgency to reverse the low-carbon momentum built under President Biden. While legal challenges are underway, the policy shift has already sent shockwaves through US clean technology manufacturing and global climate cooperation. How much of a setback this represents for the US and global energy transition will depend on market conditions for low-carbon technologies and policy action in the rest of the world.

Climate Backtracking by Executive Orders

Within days of taking office, President Trump issued a flurry of executive orders to dismantle key components of Biden-era climate policy. These included:

Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (again), halting US participation in the global climate accord and any associated financial commitment;

Halt and recovery of funds previously allocated to green banks established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), in some instances using criminal law as the legal basis;

Suspension of renewable energy project authorizations on federal lands for 60 days. While solar and geothermal reviews have resumed, wind projects remain in limbo;

Declaration of a National Energy Emergency, aimed at expanding fossil fuel extraction and deeming federal and state clean energy policies ‘threats’ to energy security.

These moves, largely driven by executive action rather than new legislation, are reshaping the policy landscape—one in which the federal government is no longer a driver of decarbonization but a barrier to it.

Global Efforts Undermined

The US exit from the Paris Agreement and related international platforms—such as the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action and the Network for Greening the Financial System—represents a substantial blow to global climate diplomacy. The vacuum left by the US will require coordinated leadership from the EU and China to keep the energy transition on track.

Leadership by large emitters and major markets plays a crucial role in the global energy transition. Many multinational firms make investment and product development decisions based on the policy landscape across all the markets they serve—not just the United States. When firms face stringent environmental standards in one jurisdiction, they may choose to develop products that comply with those higher standards and sell them globally—a phenomenon known as ‘trading up’. Consequently, the policy stance of jurisdictions such as California, the European Union, or China—each representing sizable markets—can significantly influence global practices and technological developments.

Encouragingly, both the EU and China are stepping up. The EU has reaffirmed its commitment to net-zero by 2050 and is preparing its 2040 emissions target. China’s President Xi Jinping recently announced that China’s next Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will include all greenhouse gases, not just CO₂—a significant policy expansion. But such commitments will need to be confirmed and translated into action, especially as the September 2025 NDC update deadline approaches.

While models suggest that US emissions will continue to decline through 2040 even with a full repeal of the IRA, the pace of reduction will be markedly slower. The IRA had positioned the US to reach approximately 3.6 Gt CO₂ emissions by 2030. Without it, emissions are expected to settle around 4.2 Gt.

Can state policies fill the gap? Not entirely. States like California (with its Cap-and-Trade program) and the Northeast/New England states (through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative) have historically led on climate. But federal backing offers scale, credibility, and fiscal heft that no state can match. And with the federal government now suing states over their climate policies, even these efforts face headwinds, creating uncertainty detrimental low carbon investments.

A Sudden Reversal for Clean Tech Investments

The IRA had incentivised unprecedented investment in US clean technology manufacturing. In Q4 2024 alone, over $16 billion was invested in new manufacturing capacity. Now, that momentum is reversing. The first quarter of 2025 saw a drop in investment and $6.9 billion worth of clean tech manufacturing projects cancelled—the highest quarterly cancellation value on record. These cancellations reflect investor uncertainty, and a weakened demand outlook shaped by rapidly changing federal policy.

The Inflation Reduction Act on the Chopping Block

The centerpiece of US climate policy under Biden—the Inflation Reduction Act—has been under direct attack and specific provisions have already been repealed. For instance, the House and Senate voted to repeal the methane fee, a signature provision penalizing excessive methane emissions. Now, a Republican-controlled Congress is seeking to pass a budget bill whose proposed provisions would all but rescind the key tax credits of the IRA. These changes are sought in part to fund an extension of the provisions from the Trump 1.0 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are otherwise set to expire in 2025, at an estimated cost of $4 trillion over ten years.

,Clean Energy ,2025-05-21 12:30:30+00:00,the Guardian,Demand for copper to dramatically outstrip supply within decade | Renewable energy,"Fiona Harvey, www.theguardian.com, fiona-harvey",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/21/copper-supply-demand-analysis-international-energy-agency,"Demand for copper, needed for the transition to a low-carbon world, will outstrip supply within the next decade, according to the global energy watchdog.
Birol said more must be done to increase the supply of critical minerals if the world was to shift to a low-carbon economy.
Developing these industries and trade links would diversify the global supply and could prevent bottlenecks and potential price rises, like those seen in 2021.
“This is a major, major issue.” Copper must be a key concern, he added.
“The impact of a critical minerals supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness,” according to the report.","Demand for copper, needed for the transition to a low-carbon world, will outstrip supply within the next decade, according to the global energy watchdog.

Supplies of the metal, a key component of every form of electrical energy system at present, will fall 30% short of the amount required by 2035 if nothing is done, analysis by the International Energy Agency predicts.

Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “This will be a major challenge. It’s time to sound the alarm.”

He said developed countries should aim to do more of the refining of copper and other key metals needed for industry, and form partnerships with developing countries to do so.

Critical minerals that are necessary for manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines, and transforming the global energy system, are overwhelmingly being refined in China, though they are mined in many locations, including Africa, Australia and Latin America.

China processes more than 70% on average of the world’s top 20 minerals needed in the energy industry, according to IEA data. Elements such as cobalt, gallium, lithium and manganese are used in the production of batteries and electrical components needed for renewable energy generation.

This stranglehold is increasing, even though the prices of many critical minerals have fallen from the highs of 2021 and 2022, when the shock of the Covid pandemic created a supply crunch. The average share of the top suppliers is expected to decline only marginally over the next decade.

Birol said more must be done to increase the supply of critical minerals if the world was to shift to a low-carbon economy.

“Diversification is key,” he said. “The UK, Europe, Japan, the US, South Korea – the technology is there. Africa, Latin America have the resources. There could be international cooperation among countries.”

Governments should intervene, as market forces alone would not solve the problem, he added. “There is a need for government policies, to support new entrants [in the market],” he said.

Developing these industries and trade links would diversify the global supply and could prevent bottlenecks and potential price rises, like those seen in 2021. “If the costs go up, that would be a major, if not the most important, hurdle” to shifting to a green economy, Birol said. “This is a major, major issue.”

Copper must be a key concern, he added. It takes on average 17 years from the discovery of new deposits to the production of the metal.

“We have analysed all the copper mining, in Latin America, Africa, Australia – all the pipelines,” said Birol. “[Rising costs would] make the cost of the green transition significantly higher, and may lead to delay.”

But he said that if governments took rapid action, they could reduce the projected shortfall. “[A supply crunch] is not inevitable. We can soften it if we move very fast, by putting new projects to market very fast, by recycling copper, and substituting copper with other metals such as aluminium, to alleviate the problem.”

China’s build-out of its electricity grids, as it moves to clean energy and the manufacturing of clean technology components such as solar panels and wind turbines, has been the biggest factor behind the sharp increase in demand for copper in recent years.

The need for other critical minerals has also increased rapidly. Demand for lithium rose by nearly 30% last year.

The IEA warned that any disruption to supply would be dangerous, not only for the green energy transition but also to the wider global economy.

“The impact of a critical minerals supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness,” according to the report.

“A sustained supply shock for battery metals could increase global average battery pack prices by as much as 40-50%.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccf8f9a87ec04c9a35710a416300c1d3445b12ef/73_0_2752_2202/master/2752.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fee0dbee8394db794c53395f45572c77,N,,2025-05-21 10:10:32.583511

The bill passed out of the House Budget Committee over the weekend and will be considered by the House Rules Committee early Wednesday morning.

“If this proposal becomes law, nearly 300 U.S. factories — mostly in red states — could close or never open, and we simply won’t have the energy we need to power American innovation in AI and data centers,” SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in a statement Tuesday.

SEIA’s analysis urged supporters to join the group in lobbying their representatives against the bill, saying the current version of it “could trigger an immediate decline in solar and storage investments. By 2030, up to $220 billion in investment could be lost.” The group also estimated an increase of $51 billion in consumer electricity costs.

The bill would set earlier phaseouts to several credits that have been boosting the solar and storage industries: The 25D residential energy credit would be phased out after 2025; the 48E clean electricity investment credit would be phased out after 2028; and the 45X advanced manufacturing production credit would be fully phased out after 2031.

The month-long stop-work order on the Empire Wind project came amid Donald Trump’s targeting of the wind industry in the first 100 days of his second term as the US president pushes a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

The pause on the project had raised concerns about whether New York state could meet its climate and energy goals without it, and environmentalists will welcome its resumption.

Norway’s Equinor said on Monday that construction work can now resume on the project, which is expected to provide power for half a million homes from 2027 onwards, and create 1,500 jobs.

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, has been lobbying Trump over resuming the project, with the Washington Post reporting that she has had three one-hour calls with him, with the latest on Sunday.

“New York’s economic future is going to be powered by abundant, clean energy that helps our homes and businesses thrive. I fought to save clean energy jobs in New York – and we got it done,” Hochul said in a statement on Monday.

Liz Burdock, the president and CEO of the non-profit Oceanic Network, welcomed the resumption of the project: “After more than a month of uncertainty, America is back on track with an Above All Energy approach – one that puts thousands of skilled workers back on the job, reignites construction in our nation’s shipyards and sends mariners back to sea.”

The interior secretary, Doug Burgum, who had issued the stop-work order on Empire Wind on 16 April, sending shockwaves through the offshore wind industry, said he was encouraged that Hochul will now allow new gas pipeline capacity to move forward.

The deal could revive plans to build a gas pipeline from Pennsylvania’s drilling fields, which was blocked on environmental grounds in 2020.

“Once again, E15 is set to provide major savings at the pump for Memorial Day travelers,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “With nearly 40 million Americans planning to hit the road this weekend, access to lower-cost E15 will make a real difference for hardworking families. Every additional gallon of ethanol that reaches consumers means more American-made energy in the marketplace, lower fuel costs, and a much-needed boost to the farm economy.”

The sale of E15 is restricted over the summer due to outdated federal regulations that were enacted long before this fuel option entered the marketplace. However, this cleaner, more-affordable fuel choice remains available this summer thanks to a temporary waiver issued by the Trump administration as part of an effort to support American energy dominance, increase homegrown fuel supplies, and hold down prices at the pump.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the use of E15 in all cars, trucks, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) made in model year 2001 and newer—representing 98% of all vehicle miles traveled this Memorial Day.

That region is currently under an ozone maintenance plan because for many years, its ozone levels exceeded standards set by the federal Clean Air Act. Ground-level ozone—also known as smog—is known to worsen or even cause many breathing conditions, such as asthma and bronchitis.

But environmental groups including the Sierra Club say that near the end of 2023, an ozone monitor in Detroit showed readings that exceeded those set in the maintenance plan. They say that should have triggered the state to take additional corrective steps—but that never happened.

“They have not done that,” said Nicholas Leonard, head of the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center. “And when we talked to EGLE about it, they basically said that they didn't have any intentions to do so.”

Leonard said the east side Detroit location where the high ozone levels were detected is significant as well.

“This is an environmental justice community,” he said. “This is a place where asthma hospitalization rates are the highest found anywhere in the state of Michigan. And so it's just deeply disappointing to see EGLE walk back from another commitment that it's made.”

Environmental groups have already sued the EPA and EGLE over its initial finding that southeast Michigan is in attainment with federal ozone standards. That case is still progressing through the federal court system, Leonard said.

In a statement, EGLE maintains that it acted appropriately in accordance with its “mission to protect air quality for residents of Southeast Michigan and all of the state.""

“Ozone data, evaluated by EGLE, shows ozone values in Southeast Michigan continue to improve,” the statement continued. “We followed appropriate processes in examining available data and remain confident our determinations were made properly, and U.S. EPA has agreed with those determinations.

With XPENG's lineup of EVs parked by the water, the walls at the venue's entrance displayed a timeline of the company's history, stretching from its founding in 2014 up until the present day. There was also a graphic displaying the markets XPENG is targeting, covering countries in Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and pan-European regions.

Conspicuously absent from XPENG's international vision board? America.

XPENG sees U.S. tariffs as 'opportunity' for global expansion

Tesla is the reigning king of electric vehicles within the U.S., accounting for over 50 percent of the country's new EV registrations in 2024 according to an analysis by EV Volumes. Elon Musk's company faces little real competition, with distant runner up Ford responsible for just six percent of registrations.

However, the EV landscape looks markedly different beyond U.S. borders. While Tesla still has a significant foothold, its sales last year were more than doubled by Chinese giant BYD, which dominated the global market with over 22 percent of all EV sales. Coming in third was Wuling, another Chinese company which most Americans will likely have never heard of.

XPENG hasn't yet achieved such heights, ranked 10th last December at almost two percent of global EV market share. Though considering the competition, that's still no mean feat. The company also has clear ambitions to continue climbing, with vice-chairman and president Dr. Brian Gu stating that he considers the U.S. tariffs on China both ""a challenge and opportunity.""

""As a company, we cannot escape from economic volatilities that come with such tension,"" said Gu. ""We need to be prepared to make sure that our products continue to sell well. We also need to prepare that it may have an impact on the potentially global supply chain… However, I think it does raise an opportunity for a company that has aspirations globally.""

Gu noted that XPENG is closely monitoring the U.S.-China tariff feud to ensure its supply chain isn't impacted. ""With the tariff situation, it also means that we have to be even better at making sure we are self-sufficient,"" he said.

However, as the company hasn't expanded to the American market, its sales haven't been affected by the turmoil. XPENG's global expansion plans don't appear to have been adversely affected either.

""We will continue to expand our footprint, because we see that our product is now welcomed by a lot of the international markets that we enter,"" said Gu. ""The customer feedback has been great. We think we have a strong confidence and appeal to tackle into more markets, to offer our product to more customers…

""I would say a crisis always leads to opportunity, and we feel like we can actually take advantage of that to really [put] more focus on our mission, more focus onto making ourselves better, but at the same time to be more diversified and more strong, [and] introducing our product [and] technology to global customers.""

Tariffs, tariffs, everywhere, but not an EV to drive

While global Tesla sales have plummeted in recent months, demand for electric vehicles in general isn't waning. As of March, global sales of electric vehicles have reportedly increased by 30 percent compared to the same time last year, with the U.S. market in particular growing by 28 percent. However, U.S. tariffs mean that anyone hoping to buy an EV in the land of the free has significantly fewer options than their counterparts across the globe.

Tariffs play a significant part in this. President Donald Trump initially increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles during his first term in 2018. Such vehicles had already been subject to a standard 2.5 percent tariff, however Trump added an extra 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods to bump the rate up to 27.5 percent. His successor Joe Biden subsequently increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent in 2024.

U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs then skyrocketed to a whopping 247.5 percent earlier this year, courtesy of Trump's second term tariff blitz. Specifically, Trump added a further 145 percent tariff on all Chinese goods, plus a 2.75 percent tariff on electric vehicles in general. A recent 90-day pause has temporarily dropped the U.S.' tariffs on China from 145 percent down to 30 percent. However, this still leaves Chinese EVs subject to a tariff rate of 132.5 percent.

This means that if launching the X9 in the U.S. were to make financial sense, XPENG would have to charge local drivers a significantly larger sum than its pre-order price tag of ¥399,800 ($54,800 U.S.) in other parts of the world.

Yet despite this relative affordability, XPENG's X9 is packed with extravagant features you won't see in Tesla EVs twice the price. These include massage chair functions, a storage box for keeping food either cool or warm, and a 21.4-inch ceiling-mounted screen to keep rear passengers entertained.

""We also see [the U.S. tariff situation] as an opportunity for us to differentiate from the rest of [the] EV players, because we feel like we're bringing something different,"" said Gu. ""We're not just another affordable China brand in a foreign market.

""We want to be viewed as bringing the best in technology, the highest quality, and the coolest brand to these local customers. And that's something I think will position us well when there's actually these difficulties and tensions around the world.""

Fuelling an EV industry with subsidies

An aggressive shift toward electric cars in the U.S. would have a notable beneficial impact on the environment. China has already seen carbon emissions from vehicles drop significantly due to its adoption of EVs. However, when it comes to U.S. policies, business and economic concerns prevail.

When raising tariffs last year, part of Biden's reasoning was that Chinese EV manufacturers have been assisted by their government's subsidy programs. The now former U.S. president claimed that such support helped Chinese companies to ""cheat"" by selling cars at ""unfairly low prices"" which drove competitors out of business.

""Our competitor is not a domestic one [local to the markets XPENG is expanding to],"" said Gu via a translator, indicating disinterest in nationalistic EV rivalries. ""It is more about who is able to provide the most forward looking, most competitive technology, as well as with quality.""

The Chinese government has heavily invested in local EV manufacturing since 2009, reportedly offering over ¥200 billion ($27.5 billion U.S.) in subsidies and tax breaks in the following 13 years. It also actively encouraged EV adoption by entering contracts for its public transport fleet, and enacting policies which cut obstacles to car ownership for those who chose to go electric. Local companies aren't the only ones that benefited though. U.S.-based Tesla was reportedly the second largest beneficiary of Chinese subsidies, receiving over $450 million U.S.

The U.S. government has its own subsidiary programs for local EV manufacturing as well. However, its efforts to invest in the industry don't appear to have fostered a similarly strong or diverse local EV scene. Electric and hybrid vehicles only accounted for around 21 percent of new light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S. during Q2 of 2024, while last July almost half of all new vehicle sales in China were EVs.

Instead, the U.S. government's investment appears to have had one primary beneficiary: Tesla. The EV company has reportedly received at least $38 billion from the U.S. government in the form of subsidies, tax credits, loans, and contracts, spread over more than 20 years.

In fact, Tesla only became profitable after it began selling regulatory credits to other auto manufacturers — a revenue stream made possible by U.S. government incentives. Under this policy, auto manufacturers are required to build a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles. Companies who don't meet their target can make it up by buying credits from other manufacturers who have a surplus.

As Tesla only sells electric vehicles, it has a significant number of credits to sell. Tesla's regulatory credit sales account for around a third of its $35 billion in profits since 2014, and were responsible for the company turning its first year of profitability in 2020.

XPENG aims to win over the world

China's investment in the EVs has fuelled hundreds of local companies, as well as fierce competition between them. As such, not all of them are realistically expected to survive. Speaking via a translator, XPENG's CEO He Xiaopeng stated that those which have performed well centered software and AI. He believes companies will therefore focus on research and development moving forward.

""We used to have hundreds, thousands, of [mobile phone manufacturers], and right now only six Chinese mobile phone companies [remain],"" He said via a translator. ""For automakers, we used to have 100 to 200, and with EVs we have 400 to 500. I think that in the end, only 10 will survive.""

XPENG first ventured into the international market in 2020, launching its G3 SUV in Norway. It has expanded to around 30 countries in the years since, with He telling reporters that they plan to double this number to 60 by the end of 2025. The EV company has already debuted in Indonesian and Polish markets this year, and has announced it will arrive in Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in Q2. This is already significant, though many more launches can be expected if XPENG intends to keep up with its ambitious growth plans.

""In the countries where Tesla sells well we also sell well, because these are the countries that have been educated [in EVs], they would recognize these technology driven vehicles,"" said Gu, also speaking via a translator.

""[In the] next 10 years we hope that more than half of XPENG's sales come from outside China, so revenue is not a single stream,"" said He through a translator.

Such confident expansion plans seem to have been informed by XPENG's apparent success overseas. The company recently reported it had delivered 94,008 of its smart EVs in Q1 2025 — a 331 percent increase since the same time last year. It further saw a 23.4 percent increase in revenue in Q4 2024 when compared to the same time in 2023.

""We are continuing to expand despite the current geopolitical situation, because we see that having a more diversified portfolio will ultimately benefit our company,"" said Gu.

Such expansion may eventually include bringing local manufacturing jobs to its new markets. Gu believes that if XPENG is to become a leading EV manufacturer internationally, it's inevitable that it will transition to having operations that are more locally based.

""Local brand, local operations, local services, maybe local charging capabilities and also local production capabilities,"" said Gu. ""You cannot rely on the export-only strategy to tackle such an important market [as Europe]. But the timing and how to do it is something that we're working on intently.""

The U.S. may soon be left behind

With U.S. trade relationships having become increasingly volatile, public sentiment in other countries has become more open to exploring alternate options for partnerships. And as Gu noted, it seems the perfect opportunity for Chinese companies such as XPENG to show what they have to offer.

In the Emerald Pavilion at Hong Kong's Hopewell Hotel, reporters from around the world questioned He and Gu about XPENG's plans in various countries. When might it expand to South Korea? What are their views on the Italian market? Will XPENG be addressing its voice recognition software's issues with the Australian accent?

Amidst this global conversation, the U.S. barely merits a mention.

If passed, the legislation would cut this 30% tax credit nearly a decade earlier than it was set to expire.

What's happening?

Reflective of President Donald Trump's legislative agenda, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act primarily aims to extend tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act while eliminating existing incentives like the residential clean energy tax credit and the electric vehicle tax credit.

The bill as drafted would also cut federal assistance for food stamps and include work requirements for Medicaid. The New York Times reported in mid-May that it would ""slash taxes, while providing the biggest savings to the wealthy, and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement.""

The clean energy and EV tax incentives currently on the chopping block originated as part of the Inflation Reduction Act — or IRA — and they were intended to support more widespread adoption of cleaner alternatives that also increase the country's energy independence from requiring as much foreign oil.

Taking a closer look at the clean energy tax credit — also known as the Investment Tax Credit, or ITC — as one example, Electrek explained that this incentive was aimed at supporting homeowners with essentially a 30% discount on solar installation costs. It was then meant to be phased out over time until finally ending in 2035, rather than being suddenly shuttered, as proposed in the new bill.

Aaron Nichols of Exact Solar said, per Electrek, ""If Congress eliminates the ITC without a reasonable phase-down, that's obviously going to cause immediate disruption within the solar industry.""

It also has the potential of cutting off many from a more affordable pathway to cleaner, cheaper energy that is more resilient to intensifying weather events capable of knocking out other power sources.

Why is this concerning?

These tax credits have been key in helping homeowners make upgrades that can benefit savings at home, individual resilience to power outages, community preparedness, and the planet as a whole.

Continuing to take the example of solar panels, though they can save residents thousands of dollars over their lifespans, the upfront installation costs can be intimidating. The 30% savings through the IRA's tax credit have done a lot to address this challenge, along with companies like EnergySage, which functions like an Expedia.com for solar panels.

While many residents have already leveraged the incentive to make the switch since the IRA was enacted in 2022, ostensibly many more — plenty of them only now becoming homeowners and standing to benefit from the credit — might be able to afford a transition to residential solar systems with another decade of the ITC in effect.

That additional 10 or so years is also critical because increasing the number of people able to make the switch to solar and other renewables could lower the amount of heat-trapping pollution produced on our planet. This can mitigate Earth's overheating, with the potential to curb destructive weather events, reduce costly infrastructural damage, and improve human health.

In mid-May, the Associated Press reported, ""Environmental groups warned the proposals would pave the way for more oil and gas industry activity on public lands and increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.""

What can be done?

House Republicans advanced the One Big Beautiful Bill out of the Budget Committee on May 18 with a vote of 17-16, with four holdouts, according to PBS.

The day after it advanced through the Budget Committee, NPR reported that the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has ""[estimated] that the House bill is shaping up to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.""

Meanwhile, the bill must still be approved by the full House and Senate to become law.

The AP previously reported that House Speaker Mike Johnson ""set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts.""

The company designed this site as a business hub for those interested in Toyota hydrogen fuel cell solutions. The page offers product details, case studies, and direct contacts to help customers lower emissions with Toyota’s hydrogen-powered fuel cell technology.

TMNA made the announcement at the Advanced Clean Transportation Expo. Toyota highlighted fuel cell technology as a cleaner power source that generates electricity for both devices and vehicles. Toyota already uses these fuel cells to cut emissions across its supply chain and now offers them to customers in North America.

The manufacturer supports fuel cell applications in stationary power, Class 8 truck powertrains, modular systems, and other innovations.

Fuel Cell Solutions Go Beyond Powertrains

“While Toyota continues to offer its hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric technology in vehicle powertrains, we are more than a powertrain supplier,” said Jay Sackett, TMNA R&D chief engineer of Advanced Mobility. “We aim to provide a host of efficient solutions that help get work done. This new website is a clear indication that we are open for business.”

Toyota installs its fuel cell stacks in the 2025 Mirai FCEV sedan, backup power generators, and heavy machinery. These include port and cargo-handling equipment and buses, all of which emit only water vapor.

Fuel cells create electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen. Sources for hydrogen include natural deposits and processing methods like electrolysis, steam-reformed methane, and water treatment gas capture.

Data centers could consume 9 percent of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030.
The market worked its magic, and innovations like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling revolutionized the American energy portfolio.
His April 9 executive order, “Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy,” seeks to undo the regulatory overreach that constricts energy growth.","“Tens of millions of dollars.” That’s how much Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, says users are costing his company by using extra words for politeness like “please” and “thank you” when interacting with the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. Altman’s admission called attention to the elephant in the AI room: the technology will require massive, rapidly growing amounts of electricity to continue to mature.

American companies will have to address this energy problem in two ways: more efficient AI technologies, and innovations in the energy sector to provide ample, cheap electricity for future AI demand growth. To assist them, policymakers should reject the familiar path of subsidies and central planning, choosing instead to clear regulatory bottlenecks and let market incentives drive energy breakthroughs—an approach that history shows delivers lasting results.

AI is in its infancy. Its energy costs, while growing, remain manageable. But as the technology advances, companies will face a cost and resource ceiling. For example, creating an image using today’s AI models requires more than five times the electricity needed for simple text generation—and as much electricity as fully charging a cell phone.

Demand will only grow. A new report by the International Energy Agency finds that 50 percent of United States electricity consumption growth by 2030 will come from AI demand. The sector will demand more electricity than U.S. manufacturing for all energy-intensive goods—like aluminum, steel, cement, and chemicals—combined. Data centers could consume 9 percent of all U.S. electricity generation by 2030.

In April, representatives of major AI tech companies warned the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that a lack of energy infrastructure, especially for generation and transmission, threatens to stunt AI’s growth. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt called AI “inherently power-hungry,” stating bluntly that America needs “energy in all forms, renewable, non-renewable, whatever. It needs to be there, and it needs to be there quickly.”

The traditional government approach to this problem would be massive subsidies for data centers and the utilities fueling them. But history shows that this approach to energy development will fail. For example, the government’s heavy subsidization of nuclear power in the mid-twentieth century crippled commercialization. As a result, the U.S. went more than 30 years without building a new nuclear power plant.

In contrast, the U.S. deregulated natural gas markets in the 1980s, motivating entrepreneurs to invest in and develop new energy technologies. The market worked its magic, and innovations like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling revolutionized the American energy portfolio. Today, the United States is a world leader in natural gas extraction, and Americans benefit from a seemingly endless supply of cheap energy. Due to its low cost, natural gas went from fueling 20 percent of domestic electricity generation in the 1980s to 40 percent today.

Subsidies also don’t do much to make energy more environmentally friendly. The subsidies that have artificially propped up the renewables market have had only a marginal impact on reducing carbon emissions, while the shift from coal to natural gas for electricity generation has reduced emissions in the sector by 40 percent since 2005.

Unfortunately, President Joe Biden chose to subsidize new energy development, largely in the form of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act. But President Donald Trump has chosen a different path. His April 9 executive order, “Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy,” seeks to undo the regulatory overreach that constricts energy growth.

To be sure, implementation of this agenda will be key. But the administration has also shown interest in opening the door for new energy technologies, from small modular nuclear reactors and fusion to advanced geothermal and other moonshot ideas.

To make AI more energy efficient, the U.S. must also foster an environment that promotes innovation. China’s DeepSeek shocked both Silicon Valley and Wall Street in early 2025 when it released a more efficient, less capital-intensive AI model. To compete with China, American companies will need to produce models that deliver quality results while using less energy and computing power.

To win against China’s model of state-driven economic and technological growth, the U.S. government should give AI companies free rein to innovate and experiment. This regulation-light, subsidy-light environment will ensure that America remains the global leader in AI technology.",https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/artificial-intelligence-energy-demand-regulation.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 11:10:13.216613

The nation's largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority, announced Tuesday it submitted a construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a small, modular nuclear reactor. It wants to develop next-generation nuclear power in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, at its Clinch River site.

TVA President and CEO Don Moul said that by going first, they can show other utilities a way to accelerate the development of small nuclear reactors.

“Nuclear is very reliable, very resilient. It is carbon free,” he told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview Monday. “It is, what I would consider, one of the highest quality generating sources we have. And so starting a path forward not only helps others in America follow, but it can also help America lead the world in the new technology.”

The federally owned utility provides electricity to seven states and operates three traditional, large nuclear power plants, which provide 40% of the Tennessee Valley's power. The region's population is growing, industries are replacing fossil fuels with electric alternatives and there's more manufacturing. The TVA expects to need up to 26 gigawatts of power by 2035, enough to power roughly 15 million homes, to meet the growing demand for electricity and replace retiring power plants.

Its board launched a program in 2022 to develop and fund small modular nuclear reactors as part of its strategy to dramatically reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and has provided $350 million for it so far.

U.S. electric utilities have been reluctant to invest in new nuclear construction because of large cost overruns and delays in Georgia, as Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Vogtle was expanded from two of the traditional large reactors to four, said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The TVA decision is meaningful because it may be the start of a trend, Buongiorno added.

The United States does not have any next-generation reactors operating commercially. The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies that want to build these reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. A project to build the first was terminated in 2023, as costs increased and not enough local power providers signed up to be part of it.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors. Ontario Power Generation chose the same reactor the TVA wants to build, GE Hitachi’s design that uses light water like all large U.S. commercial reactors.

In Ontario, they're expecting the first to cost $6.1 billion Canadian dollars ($4.4 billion), along with $1.6 billion Canadian dollars ($1.1 billion) for equipment to build all four. The cost is expected to decline with each subsequent reactor. TVA's cost estimates are in the same range, Moul said, but he declined to give specifics and said the utility is looking for partners to help with the initial costs.

The nonprofit Environmental Working Group says far cheaper, safer and cleaner electricity can be delivered much faster through investments in proven renewable sources like solar rooftops, battery storage and wind power. There’s “no bigger example of a money pit than the fantasy of small modular reactors” as a viable source of energy in the U.S., said Alex Formuzis, spokesperson for the research and advocacy organization.

The Biden administration announced a $900 million investment in these reactors last year. The Trump administration also supports building small modular reactors for flexible, reliable power for energy-intensive sectors like industry and data centers as electricity demand soars. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in March that the $900 million would be awarded, but applicants had to submit new proposals to be judged solely on technical merit, without consideration for past diversity, equity and inclusion practices.

The TVA and its industry partners applied for $800 million in federal funding, which they say will help speed up the development of the technology by about two years.

The NRC has already said the Clinch River site is suitable for a new nuclear plant. There’s enough room for a total of four small reactors. If the NRC and the TVA board approve the plans to build the first reactor there, it could begin operating around 2032, providing 300 megawatts of power, which is enough for about 175,000 homes.

DETROIT, May 21, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The HVAC experts at C & C Heating & Air Conditioning, a leading Detroit-area heating and cooling company with more than seven decades of experience, say homeowners who are considering a new air conditioning system this summer should research how new eco-friendly refrigerants can affect their decision.

""Buying a new air conditioning unit or heat pump is an expensive decision for any homeowner,"" C & C Heating & Air Conditioning General Manager Dayna Hottle said. ""Before making a purchase of this magnitude, homeowners should make themselves aware of how the new laws concerning refrigerants can affect this important decision.""

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has mandated that all new residential and light commercial HVAC systems manufactured in 2025 must be compatible with A2L refrigerants like R-32 and R-454B. Hottle said that most air conditioning units and heat pumps that are currently installed use the older R-410A, which will no longer be manufactured.

But the law allows retailers to sell air conditioning units that still use R-410A refrigerants until January 2026.

""So, if a homeowner is considering a new AC unit this summer, they will need to make a decision about which air conditioner to choose,"" Hottle said. ""The units that use the R-410A refrigerants are less expensive, but there's no guarantee that the refrigerant will be available in the future if you have a repair and need your refrigerant refilled.""

She said that the newer units that use the A2L refrigerants are more expensive but are more efficient than older models, and they have a lower Global Warming potential (GWP), making them a more environmentally friendly choice.

""My advice is to work closely with a trusted HVAC professional about which system is right for you,"" Hottle said. ""And, even if you don't need a new unit this year, you may want to consider switching to the newer models as your system reaches 10 years old. Between the refrigerant change and the evolving situation with tariffs, it may become increasingly difficult to find replacement R-410A from here on out.""

Anglo American Coal Deal Likely, Jefferies Says -- Market Talk

0449 GMT - It seems likely a deal for Peabody to buy Anglo American's steelmaking coal assets will be renegotiated, according to Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina. In a note, LaFemina says Anglo appears not to have acknowledged Peabody's material adverse change claim in the 10-day response period. Renegotiation, arbitration, or the deal closing in its initially agreed form are all possible, he says. ""We believe a renegotiated deal structure with a greater portion of the deal being deferred could be a win-win scenario, whereas arbitration is a potential lose-lose on a relative basis,"" says LaFemina. The up-to $3.78 billion deal has come under scrutiny after a recent fire at one of the Australian mines Anglo American intends to sell. Jefferies has buy ratings on both stocks.

The acquisition consists of five combined-cycle gas turbine plants and two combustion turbine plants in California, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, “further geographically diversifying Vistra's natural gas fleet”, Vistra said in an online statement.

The plants have a combined capacity of 2,557 megawatts (MW). The biggest of them is the Fairless plant in Pennsylvania, which produces up to 1,320 MW.

The transaction price translates to $743 per kilowatt, subject to net working capital adjustments, according to the Irving, Texas-based power utility.

“Vistra expects to fund the transaction with the assumption of an existing term loan from Lotus and cash on hand”, it said. “Although the principal amount of the term loan to be assumed is subject to change, it is currently expected to be approximately 50 percent of the consideration at closing.

“The purchase price implies a multiple of approximately 7x 2026 Adjusted EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), excluding any potential synergies”.

The parties expect to complete the transaction late this year or early 2026, subject to regulatory approvals including anti-trust clearance.

Vistra said the acquisition will not change its previously set capital allocation plans including $300 million in annual dividends and at least $1 billion in share buybacks each year.

""We are excited to announce another opportunistic expansion of our generation footprint in some of our key competitive markets”, said Vistra president and chief executive Jim Burke. ""We believe natural gas-fired generation will continue to play an ever-increasing role in the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of U.S. power grids for years to come.

“The addition of this attractive portfolio of combined cycle and peaking assets allows Vistra to serve growing power demand while exceeding our mid-teens levered return target”.

""Importantly, as our experienced team has demonstrated previously with the acquisitions of Dynegy and Energy Harbor, successfully integrating fleets of generation assets is a core competency of our company”, Burke added. “We look forward to closing the transaction and welcoming new team members to the Vistra family”.

In 2018 Vistra merged with Dynergy Inc., positioning itself as “the leading integrated retail and generation platform throughout key competitive power markets in the United States”.

Immediately after the combination, the enlarged Vistra had about 40,000 MW of installed generation capacity, according to a company statement April 9, 2018.

Last year Vistra took over Energy Harbor Corp., adding to its portfolio about 4,000 MW of 24/7 nuclear generation.

Currently Vistra has about 41,000 MW of capacity, enough to power 20 million homes, according to the company. The capacity is spread across “all of the major competitive wholesale markets in the country”, it says on its website. Its portfolio includes coal, gas, nuclear, solar and battery energy storage facilities.

As Florida continues to experience economic growth and an influx of new residents, our energy demands are increasing rapidly. To meet this challenge, we must adopt energy policies that align with the conservative principles that have made our state the greatest in the nation: reducing costs for consumers, fostering job creation and ensuring energy independence.

As we work to bring manufacturing and energy production back home, we must prioritize smart clean energy tax policy that delivers results. These measures help grow our economy, drive private investment and ensure greater energy security for consumers, businesses and especially our military.

Smart tax policy helps spur significant investment in our state’s economy. Florida is rich in renewable energy potential, and the state has a growing clean energy economy that has generated tens of billions of dollars in statewide investment, over 40,000 jobs and billions of dollars in household income. Companies are establishing manufacturing facilities, creating high-paying jobs and strengthening our domestic supply chains.

A wholesale rollback of policies that are working as designed would be a direct hit to Florida’s growing energy economy. According to data from the U.S. Energy and Employment Report, Florida ranks third in the nation for clean energy employment, with 175,572 jobs across sectors like solar, energy efficiency, grid modernization and electric vehicles.

In 2023 alone, clean energy employment in Florida grew by 5.9%, nearly 2.5 times faster than overall state job growth. Clean energy job growth in Florida has also consistently outpaced the broader economy for the last five years — proving that this sector is not only critical to reducing energy costs, but also to fueling stable, long-term employment across the state.

Florida is rapidly emerging as a leader in clean transportation. According to the same study, we are home to over 12,900 electric vehicle jobs. This marks a steady increase of nearly 18% growth over two years. These jobs are spread across manufacturing, maintenance, logistics and supporting services — creating opportunities not just in major metros, but in small towns and conservative districts as well. These aren’t abstract policy wins — they’re real jobs for real Floridians, driving innovation, reducing fuel costs and bringing advanced industries into our communities.

At Conservatives for Clean Energy, we advocate for pragmatic, market-driven energy policies that strengthen our economy, protect consumers and modernize our infrastructure. Supporting pragmatic policies that support clean energy generation in our state is consistent with these values. These policies are not handouts; they are strategic investments that enable businesses to plan, invest and grow within our state.

As discussions about energy tax policy continue, it’s imperative that reforms prioritize business and market certainty. We must not undermine the key drivers that are revitalizing our economy and powering our future.

Protecting these investments is the conservative, pro-growth and America First approach. Let’s continue to build on that momentum — for our workers, our families and our future.

This is about energy projects that are under construction being stopped.” — Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewable Americas Why this matters: The Empire Wind case shows just how precarious the clean energy transition remains.","In short:

Ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has quadrupled since the 1990s, becoming the main driver of sea level rise.

By 2050, just 20 cm of sea level rise could cost $1 trillion annually in damage to 136 major coastal cities.

Scientists say a rise of one to two meters is now unavoidable, with the “safe limit” for adaptation likely already surpassed at 1C of warming.

Key quote:

“What we mean by safe limit is one which allows some level of adaptation, rather than catastrophic inland migration and forced migration, and the safe limit is roughly one cm a year of sea level rise.”

— Jonathan Bamber, professor at the University of Bristol

Why this matters:

Sea level rise is no longer a distant risk. It’s a relentless force reshaping coastlines and economies. As the planet warms, polar ice sheets are melting at alarming rates, swelling oceans and threatening coastal areas where billions of people live. The most vulnerable populations — those in low-lying developing nations like Bangladesh or small island states — will face the harshest consequences. But even wealthy countries with sophisticated defenses, like the Netherlands or parts of the U.S., are not immune to the long-term costs and upheaval. Sea level rise amplifies the impact of storms, floods infrastructure, contaminates drinking water, and erodes habitats. Crucially, these shifts won’t happen centuries from now—they’re accelerating within our lifetimes.

Related: Climate disasters challenge the myth of ‘safe’ havens

In short:

The Trump administration has dismantled key climate research efforts, dismissed scientists, and stopped tracking greenhouse gas emissions, undermining decades of work that informs climate policy.

Cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Weather Service are eroding the nation’s capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, with federal aid denied to communities hit by recent tornadoes and floods.

The administration is halting clean energy projects, slashing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations on pollution, and withdrawing from international climate efforts, positioning the U.S. as a global outlier in climate denial.

Key quote:

“Here we see a government that is taking a hatchet to the scientific enterprise. It’s the kind of destruction that will have implications for a while to come.”

— Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists

Why this matters:

Scientific data from agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration underpins early warning systems for hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts—tools that save lives and limit destruction. The Trump administration’s cuts to climate research, pollution regulation, and disaster preparedness hollow out that safety net, leaving communities more vulnerable. Without consistent tracking of emissions or federal support for resilience, local governments are left to fend for themselves, often without the resources or expertise required. The rollback of EPA authority and clean energy investments also threatens public health: Pollution from transportation and power plants contributes to heart and lung disease, particularly in children and low-income communities. And with climate disasters becoming more frequent and severe, the lack of a coordinated federal response magnifies both human suffering and economic losses.

Related: New FEMA chief says states must take the lead on disaster recovery this hurricane season

In short:

Forty-two people died as tornadoes swept across Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia, highlighting the importance of fast and accurate weather alerts to save lives during rapidly developing disasters.

The National Weather Service has lost more than 10% of its staff amid budget cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency, leaving 40% of forecasting offices short-staffed and impairing use of vital tools like Doppler radar and weather balloons.

While some observers credit local efforts for maintaining alert coverage in this storm, experts warn that broader, long-term damage to the alert infrastructure may be felt as hurricane season approaches.

Why this matters:

As climate patterns shift, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are increasing, from hurricanes to fast-moving tornado outbreaks. Accurate, timely forecasts can be the difference between life and death, especially when storms strike with little warning. The National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration form the backbone of the nation’s severe weather alert system, but proposed budget reductions threaten this safety net. These cuts come at a dangerous time, as climate volatility accelerates and populations grow in vulnerable areas like the Midwest and Southeast.

Related: Trump’s government cuts disrupt NOAA forecasts and data collection

In short:

The Trump administration sees clean energy tax credits as a boon for China and is aiming to dismantle key Biden-era incentives through a broad GOP tax and spending bill.

House Republicans are divided, with moderates hoping to preserve credits that benefit manufacturing in their districts, while hard-liners seek sweeping rollbacks to focus on fossil fuels.

Analysts warn that weakening these incentives could devastate U.S. clean energy manufacturing, allowing China and other nations to dominate future markets in solar, batteries, and EVs.

Key quote:

“What has surprised me is the extent to which the administration hasn’t just pursued an agenda but has thrown sand in the gears of the parts of agenda that they don’t agree with. Even when it costs American jobs.”

— Thom Woodroofe, former Australian diplomat in Washington who now works at the Smart Energy Council

Why this matters:

The future of U.S. clean energy policy is hanging in the balance. As the Trump administration shifts decisively toward oil, gas, and coal, billions in private investment tied to solar panels, battery factories, and electric vehicle production may dry up. The risk is not only to jobs and technology development at home but also to global competitiveness. China already leads in many areas of green manufacturing, having spent decades building up its supply chains. If the U.S. exits this race, it could be surrendering both economic opportunity and influence over the climate technologies that will define the next half-century.

Trump’s climate rule repeal sets stage for fossil fuel revival and threatens renewable growth

Trump’s energy strategy backfires as oil falters and renewables stall

In short:

The Empire Wind project, stalled by an April executive order halting offshore wind work, will resume after Hochul held multiple calls with Trump urging him to lift the stop-work order.

Equinor had been losing $50 million per week during the pause and warned it would cancel the project if no resolution came soon. Work had already begun onshore in Brooklyn, with offshore construction set to start this month.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum praised Hochul’s willingness to work with the administration on energy infrastructure.

Trump has pushed to revive the Constitution Pipeline to bring shale gas from Pennsylvania to the Northeast; New York State did not provide environmental approval for that project and it was abandoned in 2020.

Key quote:

“We feel strongly that this is bigger than Empire Wind and the offshore wind industry. This is about energy projects that are under construction being stopped.”

— Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewable Americas

Why this matters:

The Empire Wind case shows just how precarious the clean energy transition remains. Offshore wind promises thousands of union jobs and zero-emission electricity for millions, but abrupt reversals in federal support threaten to chill investment and derail progress. The Trump administration’s initial pause on Empire Wind sent shockwaves through the industry, signaling that even shovel-ready projects with major capital invested could be upended by political whim.

In short:

More than 480 European “green” funds governed by the EU’s sustainable finance disclosure regulations (SFDR) regulations collectively held $33.5 billion in fossil fuel stocks, including stakes in ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, and TotalEnergies.

Fund managers, including BlackRock, JP Morgan, and DWS, argue these investments enable shareholder influence over fossil companies, though climate analysts say the companies are not aligned with Paris climate agreement targets.

Upcoming European Securities and Markets Authority guidelines — set to take effect May 21— will allow regulators to hold funds accountable for the use of sustainability-related labels, though the rules are not legally binding.

Key quote:

“It is diabolical for banks and asset managers to invest billions in major fossil fuel companies under the rubric of ‘green investing’ when we need to accelerate investments in non- and low-carbon energy, in carbon efficiency, and in carbon removal technologies.”

— Richard Heede, Climate Accountability Institute

Why this matters:

The term “green investing” carries a promise: that your money supports environmental progress. But when so-called sustainable funds funnel billions into oil giants, that promise is broken. Funds operating under vague or loosely enforced definitions of sustainability risk misleading individuals, institutions, and governments alike. While regulators have begun to react — tightening rules around fund naming and disclosure — investors may still find themselves funding fossil fuel expansion through portfolios meant to fight climate change.

In short:

Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government plans to cut emergency preparedness funding and slash wildfire response budgets, despite recent ice storms and ongoing evacuations in northern communities.

The province is recommitting to large infrastructure projects like Highway 413 and a pumped hydro energy project in Georgian Bay, while blocking cities from using congestion pricing and failing to fund new transit.

The Ford government is accelerating mining development in the Ring of Fire, despite unresolved environmental assessments and opposition from some First Nations over lack of proper consultation.

Key quote:

“We always put money aside for what we can’t predict might happen. But we’re there financially. We’ve always been there, whether it’s fire, floods or whatever may come.”

— Peter Bethlenfalvy, Ontario Finance Minister, addressing cuts to emergency preparedness and firefighting

Why this matters:

As climate change accelerates, Ontario is leaning into fossil fuels and car-based infrastructure while scaling back climate mitigation and adaptation. The province's emissions-free electricity supply has eroded sharply, down to 84% last year from 96% seven years ago, as natural gas replaces phased-out renewables. At the same time, Ontario’s budget slashes critical spending on wildfire management and emergency preparedness — services already strained by extreme weather. Environmental advocates say the current policy direction undermines environmental safeguards and public transparency, along with sidelining urban transit, clean building standards, and congestion reduction tools that could make cities more resilient and livable in a warming world.

The move comes as Ford and other automakers face mounting financial pressure from weak EV sales, high costs, and rising tariff risks, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The Kentucky battery plants were once the centerpiece of Ford’s aggressive $7 billion EV investment announced in 2021. Built in partnership with South Korean battery manufacturer SK On under the BlueOval SK joint venture, the two facilities were expected to power Ford’s next-generation EV lineup. But today, one factory sits idle, while the other is only partially operational—and now will also supply batteries to Nissan, marking a significant retrenchment in Ford’s electrification strategy.

A costly shift amid steep EV losses

The decision reflects broader turbulence in the EV market. Ford has already lost $5 billion on its EV operations in 2024 and projected another $5 billion loss for 2025. Earlier this month, the company suspended its financial guidance for the year, citing uncertainty over tariffs. A Ford spokeswoman declined to comment directly on the matter, referring all questions about the battery facility to the BlueOval SK joint venture, which also declined to confirm Nissan’s involvement.

Nissan gains a foothold in US battery production

For Nissan, the arrangement offers a critical lifeline. The carmaker reported a $4.5 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025 and recently announced 20,000 job cuts while cancelling a planned battery plant in Japan. With US trade policies penalizing imported vehicles and components, local battery production is an attractive option for Nissan, which plans to manufacture electric SUVs at its Canton, Mississippi facility. The company had previously said SK On would supply batteries for that plant, though details of production location remain undisclosed.

A Korea-based spokesperson for SK On said the company has not yet finalized the US location for Nissan battery production. Meanwhile, Nissan referred questions back to the battery supplier.

EV market faces a broader slowdown

The EV sector is showing signs of strain across the board. Electric vehicle sales dropped 5% in April, even as overall auto sales grew. In response, Congress is considering scaling back tax incentives that have helped drive EV purchases in recent years. Automakers are reacting swiftly. General Motors recently exited a joint venture battery plant in Michigan, selling its stake to Korean partner LG Energy Solution. GM’s other battery plants are running well below capacity, with the Tennessee plant at just 40% of its expected output.

Honda, another major player in the EV space, announced this week it was cutting over $20 billion in planned EV spending and delaying construction of a factory in Canada.

Tennessee plant still on track—for now

Despite these setbacks, Ford has not entirely abandoned its EV infrastructure plans. The company says the timeline for its Tennessee battery plant, also part of the BlueOval SK venture, remains unchanged. The Department of Energy had issued a $9.63 billion loan to support the construction of the three plants—two in Kentucky and one in Tennessee. Combined, they were expected to create more than 5,000 construction jobs and another 7,500 operational roles at the joint venture.

A new chapter for Ford’s EV strategy

Still, the shared use of the Kentucky plant with Nissan signals a shift in Ford’s strategy, reflecting the harsh new reality for automakers: bold bets on electric vehicles now come with much greater risks and slimmer margins than anticipated. As the industry recalibrates, the future of EV production in the US may look very different from the grand visions laid out just a few years ago.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/05/20250521102548_Ford-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 10:11:59.047002

The nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority, announced May 20 it submitted a construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a small, modular nuclear reactor. It wants to develop next-generation nuclear power in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, at its Clinch River site.

TVA President and CEO Don Moul said that by going first, they can show other utilities a way to accelerate the development of small nuclear reactors.

“Nuclear is very reliable, very resilient. It is carbon free,” he told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview. “It is, what I would consider, one of the highest quality generating sources we have. And so starting a path forward not only helps others in America follow, but it can also help America lead the world in the new technology.”

The federally owned utility provides electricity to seven states and operates three traditional, large nuclear power plants, which provide 40% of the Tennessee Valley’s power. The region’s population is growing, industries are replacing fossil fuels with electric alternatives and there’s more manufacturing. The TVA is planning for the demand for electricity to increase by up to 26 gigawatts by 2035, which is enough to power roughly 15 million homes.

Its board launched a program in 2022 to develop and fund small modular nuclear reactors as part of its strategy to dramatically reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and has provided $350 million for it so far.

U.S. electric utilities have been reluctant to invest in new nuclear construction because of large cost overruns and delays in Georgia, as Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Vogtle was expanded from two of the traditional large reactors to four, said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The TVA decision is meaningful because it may be the start of a trend, Buongiorno added.

The United States does not have any next-generation reactors operating commercially. The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies that want to build these reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. A project to build the first was terminated in 2023, as costs increased and not enough local power providers signed up to be part of it.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors. Ontario Power Generation chose the same reactor the TVA wants to build, GE Hitachi’s design for a small modular reactor that uses light water like all large U.S. commercial reactors.

In Ontario, they’re expecting the first to cost $6.1 billion, along with $1.6 billion for equipment to build all four. The cost is expected to decline with each subsequent reactor. TVA’s cost estimates are in the same range, Moul said, but he declined to give specifics and said the utility is looking for partners to help with the initial costs.

The nonprofit Environmental Working Group says far cheaper, safer and cleaner electricity can be delivered much faster through investments in proven renewable sources like solar rooftops, battery storage and wind power. There’s “no bigger example of a money pit than the fantasy of small modular reactors” as a viable source of energy in the U.S., said Alex Formuzis, spokesperson for the research and advocacy organization.

The Biden administration announced a $900 million investment in these reactors last year. The Trump administration also supports building small modular reactors for flexible, reliable power for energy-intensive sectors like industry and data centers as electricity demand soars. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in March that the $900 million would be awarded, but applicants had to submit new proposals to be judged solely on technical merit, without consideration for past diversity, equity and inclusion practices.

The TVA and its industry partners applied for $800 million in federal funding, which they say will help speed up the development of the technology by about two years.

The NRC has already said the Clinch River site is suitable for a new nuclear plant. There’s enough room for a total of four small reactors. If the NRC and the TVA board approve the plans to build the first reactor there, it could begin operating around 2032, providing 300 megawatts of power, which is enough for about 175,000 homes.",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2023/08/shutterstock_1037107573MainWEB.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 10:11:35.162524

(AP) — Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration doubles down on fossil fuels.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California’s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.

Thune said California’s “are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation’s energy supply.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.

Here’s what to know:

Why can California set its own standards?

The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions standards for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.

California has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.

Trump rescinded California’s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden’s administration restored it in 2022.

What do the standards do?

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.

The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.

The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.

New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.

What do the auto and trucking industries say?

Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state’s tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars if it gets blocked and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate’s upcoming vote.

The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.

“Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,” Mike Stanton, the group’s president and CEO, wrote in a letter.

The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.

“While transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,” said Josh Lovelace, the group’s national director.

Can the grid handle more electric vehicles?

Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation’s grid can’t handle California’s plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California’s struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.

“Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,” he said in a statement announcing the vote.

Newsom’s administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.

But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state’s growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state’s electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state’s transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an “unprecedented rate.”

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California’s plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state’s previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California’s, saying the pace wasn’t realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state’s EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

Construction of a new subsea cable factory, slated to be the tallest building in Virginia, represents a massive investment in the future of the region’s steadily growing clean energy sector. But its success, as well as that of the larger sector, depends on Congress protecting tax credits that enable companies such as GreenLink to invest in these facilities and create the renewable energy needed to power America’s future.

In July, Greenlink announced plans to build a $681 million, 750,000-sq.-ft. high-voltage direct current submarine cable manufacturing facility in Chesapeake. Gov. Glenn Youngkin noted that the company will employ 330 full-time workers and praised Greenlink for helping “showcase the commonwealth as a leader in offshore wind industry manufacturing.”

Common for an announcement of this sort, a press release from the governor’s office included statements from various officials and dignitaries, including some — Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, Rep. Bobby Scott — who specifically cited the clean energy tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for propelling the project forward.

Greenlink was approved for $99 million in tax credits under the IRA for its cable manufacturing facility, though it will not receive that money until the factory is operational. The company cited the law as a key reason for being able to proceed.

That is a fraction of the $4.8 billion in funding directed to Virginia thanks to that legislation and the Infrastructure Investment Act, according to reporting by WHRO. That data shows Hampton Roads has received about $700 million in federal funding since those laws were passed, a figure that does not include loans and tax credits.

It’s important to note that these aren’t giveaways, but instead serve as support for expanding green energy initiatives, bolstering renewable power sources and creating jobs. Expanding wind and solar generation helps reduce our reliance on dirty and foreign energy, such as oil and gas, which in turn helps reduce greenhouse emissions that are warming the planet and changing the climate. That’s particularly important here in Hampton Roads, where recurrent flooding from rising sea levels represent an existential threat to the region.

Trouble is, there are plenty of Republicans in Congress, and one in the White House, who seem determined to undo all of this good work, despite the harm it may inflict on communities such as ours.

President Donald Trump wasted no time after taking office in January to cease awarding funding under those two laws, which were a signature accomplishment of former President Joe Biden. He issued executive orders halting wind generation projects and even threatened those under construction, including Dominion’s wind farm taking shape off the Virginia Beach coast.

Now Congress wants to follow suit. In the budget reconciliation bill now making its way through the House, the Republican majority has proposed deep cuts to the provisions of both laws. Negotiations within the party over the budget even caused the bill to stall last week as a group of dissenters said the cuts didn’t go far enough.

Other Republicans, including 2nd Congressional District Rep. Jen Kiggans, have been vocal advocates for preserving the clean energy tax credits and several other parts of the laws, recognizing that they are creating jobs, investment and opportunity in their districts. While they may not be championing climate action, they do understand the value of keeping these critical parts of the laws in place.

The sixth-generation model, which has been a staple in the compact car segment for over four decades, is being designed at Nissan’s Design Europe in London.

The MICRA’s transition to a fully electric model introduces two battery options – 40kWh and 52kWh – providing substantial power and range for city driving.

The 52kWh battery option offers an impressive real-world range of 408km, alleviating range anxiety for longer trips. Charging is made efficient with a 100kW DC charger that can power the battery from 15% to 80% in just 30 minutes.

Weighing 1,400kg, the new MICRA will be equipped with V2L (vehicle-to-load) technology on both battery versions, allowing the battery to power external devices.

The new MICRA will feature a refreshed and distinctive exterior look, combining a premium finish with an SUV-like design.

It will come with 18-inch wheels, available in three different options depending on the grade: “active” wheel covers, “Iconic” and “Sport” alloy wheel designs.

The vehicle’s assertive stance is further enhanced by iconic headlamps that perform a “welcome wink” upon unlocking and a “farewell” light show when locking the car. At the rear, the taillamps will be defined by a simple but ornate LED light design.

The new MICRA will be available in 14 exterior colour combinations, offering two-tone colour options for a distinctive look.

Inside, the car’s interior continues the theme of understated elegance, with a nod to its Japanese heritage through design elements like a moulded outline of Mount Fuji.

Nissan said, drivers will be greeted by a three-spoke wheel and a 10.1” configurable display, with an additional 10.1” touchscreen providing navigation and connectivity.

The new MICRA will be available exclusively in a five-door configuration and boasts a storage capacity of 326 litres, outperforming many competitors in its class.

Nissan Design Europe vice president Giovanny Arroba said: “In designing the sixth generation of the MICRA, we’ve celebrated all the values that have historically made it so popular – and opened a new chapter for MICRA as an EV.

“The exterior has an audacious and playful appearance on first look but has a stance which gives it a solid presence on the road. We’ve also been able to integrate delightful details into the design, which owners will love. We’re proud to have been able to bring the MICRA into the EV age.

NissanConnect with Google built-in services and the NissanConnect services app will provide an integrated and connected driving experience, offering features like remote control of cabin temperature and charging schedules.

The new MICRA will be available with Nissan ProPilot assist and a suite of advanced driver assist technologies.

Sales of the new MICRA will commence in Europe later this year, marking a significant milestone in Nissan’s EV offerings.

Dismantling material support The proposal’s current language presents multiple layers of limitation and definition for “prohibited foreign entities”.
It also delineates “Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity”, which we heard was particularly notable for its ambiguity.
Moreover, it proposes to limit designs “based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any know-how or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity”.
What of the “foreign entities” already operating in the US solar industry?","The proposal’s language, which will ultimately need to be incorporated into House and Senate budget plans and reconciled into one bill before it lands on the president’s desk, has triggered a variety of reactions.

The most concerned opinions have focused on the provisions to limit “prohibited foreign entities” from accessing IRA tax credits and the obscure legislative language surrounding that, which could become law in various ways. Ultimately, this is geared towards limiting – even dismantling – the participation of Chinese companies in the US solar industry.

The uncertainty is such that, based on background discussions and briefing information PV Tech has seen from leading solar policy hawks, the outcomes range from administrative headaches and bureaucratic shortfalls, on the positive end, to the effective destruction of US solar and battery manufacturing and a massively reduced solar market on the other. The latter could see the leading technology of US energy capacity growth and tens of billions of dollars of private investment sacrificed on the altar of politics.

Just this week, the SEIA warned that 300 solar and battery manufacturing facilities could be jeopardised by the bill in its current form.

Dismantling material support

The proposal’s current language presents multiple layers of limitation and definition for “prohibited foreign entities”. The restrictions will affect facilities and projects receiving the 48E investment tax credit (ITC) for renewable energy generation facilities, the 45Y production tax credit (PTC) for the same, and the 45X advanced manufacturing credit.

The measures include limits on the ownership of companies eligible for IRA credits and restrictions on technology licensing from specific foreign entities. It separately defines a “Specified Foreign Entity”, a “Foreign-Controlled Entity” and a “Foreign-Influenced Entity”, all of which amount to varying degrees of influence from Russia, Iran, North Korea and – most pertinently for solar PV – China.

It also delineates “Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity”, which we heard was particularly notable for its ambiguity.

The current draft language on “material assistance” prohibits direct procurement from certain foreign entities, such as buying solar cells or glass from a Chinese-owned company. But it could, by virtue of omission, implicitly allow indirect procurement via other channels.

There is also provision to exempt products “not uniquely designed for use in construction of” tax credit-eligible facilities and products “not exclusively or predominantly produced by prohibited foreign entities” from the material assistance restrictions.

Moreover, it proposes to limit designs “based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any know-how or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity”.

The issue, according to expert analysis seen by PV Tech, is that the bill’s current language is particularly vague around these provisions. That leaves the door wide open to any number of scenarios once the bill is implemented. Under a certain reading, the US industry could end up with bureaucratic challenges and the need to shift supply away from China and towards more diverse sources. Under another, the tax credits could become effectively unusable.

‘A poison pill’?

The uncertainty and ambiguous language are the key things emerging from this draft bill, and we have heard many times that uncertainty is bad for business. Legal, financial and industry players are relatively unwilling to comment on the features of the draft. This may be because of the aforementioned ambiguity.

Posting on LinkedIn, referring to the apparent exceptions around “unique” or indirectly sourced products, Christian Roselund, senior policy analyst at Clean Energy Associates, described the “foreign entities” language as a “poison pill with an antidote that may or may not work”.

Mike Carr, head of the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) trade group and formerly of the Department of Energy, said similarly.

He told PV Tech: “In general, I think we see where the Members were trying to go. That said, the language is pretty complicated and might, as written, have some implementation challenges and could have some unintended consequences on the manufacturing and deployment side.”

Some US lawmakers and parts of the solar manufacturing industry have long opposed the notion of Chinese companies accessing US IRA tax credits, particularly the 45X advanced manufacturing credit. PV Tech Premium spoke with SEMA and CEA on the topic in December, following proposed amendments to the Treasury’s 45X provisions from two House representatives.

But while the logic (whether or not one agrees with the political motivation) of preventing overreliance on a single supply country through tax restrictions holds water, the lack of clarity in the bill poses real-world problems.

The broad strokes are thus: despite building impressive solar module manufacturing capacity – around 50GW according to SEIA – the US is heavily reliant on imported components such as cells, wafers, glass and others to supply those module factories. Some domestic capacity for those components exists, but not enough to meet end demand.

The Ways & Means Committee bill does preserve the 45X manufacturing credit until 2031, a move which Wood Mackenzie said this week was “positive for manufacturers” and which Carr said the SEMA group “appreciates.” But, still, uncertainty remains.

This could ultimately make it very hard – and certainly even more expensive – to get the components to produce US modules. The short-term reliance on imports from a global industry dominated by China puts untold stress on the precise language and the final shape of the “foreign entities of concern” portion of the bill, and the “material support” portion in particular.

How closely scrutinised might “direct” procurement be? How will provisions policing “any copyright or patent… or any know-how or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity” be enacted, particularly when the US has been one of the battlegrounds for solar cell patent wars, often involving Chinese firms? Who defines precisely what is “uniquely” produced for a US facility? What of the “foreign entities” already operating in the US solar industry? How far up the solar supply chain will these rules apply, and who will interrogate the bill of materials for any given product?

Maybe understating the situation, Carr tells us: “We’ll need to work through some scenarios and work with Congress to make sure the final language is workable.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/darren-halstead-sT50jo9LCH0-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 11:11:01.009503

(AP) — Congress may stop California from implementing its first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas powered cars by 2035.

A Senate vote expected as soon as this week could end the nation’s most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump’s administration doubles down on fossil fuels.

California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.

The Republican-controlled Congress is targeting three California waivers that set stricter emissions rules than the federal government. The House voted to block them first blocked them several weeks ago, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune said his chamber would take up a similar effort this week, even though the Senate Parliamentarian and the U.S. Government Accountability Office say California’s policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.

Thune said California’s “are an improper expansion of a limited Clean Air Act authority and would endanger consumers, our economy, and our nation’s energy supply.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and state air regulators say what lawmakers are doing is illegal and they will likely sue if the measure advances.

Here’s what to know:

Why can California set its own standards?

The Environmental Protection Agency has let the state adopt stricter emissions for decades, and other states can sign on to those rules.

California has some of the nation’s worst air pollution, and the waivers date back to efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to fight smog in Los Angeles.

President Donald Trump rescinded California’s ability to enforce its standards during his first term, but President Joe Biden’s administration restored it in 2022.

What do the standards do?

Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. State air regulators formalized the rules in 2022, and the federal government allowed them to move forward last year.

The rule requires automakers to sell an increasing number of zero-emission cars, pickup trucks and SUVs over the next decade. Electric vehicles would have to make up 43% of new sales by 2027, 68% by 2030 and 100% by 2035. People would still be able to buy used gas-powered cars, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

California passed another rule in 2020 to phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles, including box trucks, semitrailers and large pickups. Depending on class, zero-emission trucks will have to make up 40% to 75% of sales by 2035. The Biden administration approved that policy in 2023.

The third regulation targeted by Congress would reduce smog-forming emissions from trucks. The rule revamped a testing program to ensure heavy-duty vehicles comply with emissions standards and set stricter standards to limit pollution from nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, which pose public health risks.

New York, Colorado and New Mexico are among the states that announced plans to follow all three of the policies.

What do the auto and trucking industries say?

Several automakers, including Honda, Ford and Volkswagen, signed deals with California to follow some of the state’s tailpipe emission standards. But the companies have not committed to complying with the 2035 mandate on gas-powered cars and did not respond to requests for comment on the Senate’s upcoming vote.

The National Automobile Dealers Association urged the Senate to pass the measure.

“Banning gas and hybrid cars is a national issue that should be decided by Congress, not an unelected state agency,” Mike Stanton, the group’s president and CEO, wrote in a letter.

The Safe Roads Coalition, which represents towing and truck companies, said the medium- and heavy-duty truck rule is unfeasible and should be blocked.

“While transitioning combustion engines to electric is well-intended, unworkable regulations threaten roadside services for millions of American motorists,” said Josh Lovelace, the group’s national director.

Can the grid handle more electric vehicless?

Thune, the Senate majority leader, said the nation’s grid can’t handle California’s plans. It is a concern shared by other critics, who point to California’s struggle several summers ago to maintain consistent power during a heat wave.

“Our already shaky electric grid would quickly face huge new burdens from a surge in electric vehicles,” he said in a statement announcing the vote.

Newsom’s administration argues the state is on its way to building out an electric grid and charging infrastructure that can support many more electric vehicles. Broadly, California has a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2045.

But the state remains far short of what is eventually needed. California has about 84,000 public electric vehicle chargers in the state but needs 1.2 million by 2030 to support the EV transition, according to the California Energy Commission. The Trump administration directed states earlier this year to stop spending money approved under Biden to help build electric vehicle charges across the U.S. More than a dozen states are suing the federal government over the effort.

Newsom has also recently touted the state’s growing battery storage capacity. Neither the commission nor the California Air Resources Board responded to questions about how much the state’s electric grid must grow to support the power demand expected from the state’s transition. But the state has said it needs at least four times more wind and solar power to meet 2045 energy demands and that the grid must grow at an “unprecedented rate.”

Timothy Johnson, a professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, said most regions of the U.S. can generate enough power or add enough to meet EV charging demand, but local power lines and transformers could be overloaded.

How are other states responding?

Eleven other states, plus Washington, D.C., have adopted California’s plan to phase out new gas-powered cars, according to the air board. Several more have adopted the state’s previous zero-emission vehicle standards.

But some of those states are already backing away.

Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott last week paused enforcement of electric vehicle sales targets that follow California’s, saying the pace wasn’t realistic. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer has said he wants to rescind the state’s EV mandate. Other states still appear to be moving ahead.

In short:

Detroit’s St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center is still waiting on $2 million in federal funding for clean energy upgrades, one of many delays linked to Trump’s freeze on Biden-era climate equity funds.

Neighborhoods historically subjected to redlining suffer higher rates of power outages, energy shutoffs, and barriers to clean energy adoption, including aging infrastructure and housing stock.

Community solar and subsidy programs show promise but remain inaccessible to many due to state restrictions, utility resistance, or poor program design.

Key quote:

“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don't fix that, we'll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system.”

— Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan

Why this matters:

Across the country, historically redlined communities, often home to Black and brown residents, face compounding challenges: old electrical grids, outdated housing, and disproportionately high utility bills. These barriers make it nearly impossible for many to access the cost savings and resilience offered by clean energy technologies like solar panels and battery storage. And the problem isn’t just technical — it’s systemic. Federal support programs meant to close this gap have been frozen or gutted, while utilities often prioritize upgrades in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods. The result is a power system that reinforces old inequalities even as it modernizes.

Ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has quadrupled since the 1990s, becoming the main driver of sea level rise.

By 2050, just 20 cm of sea level rise could cost $1 trillion annually in damage to 136 major coastal cities.

Scientists say a rise of one to two meters is now unavoidable, with the “safe limit” for adaptation likely already surpassed at 1C of warming.

Key quote:

“What we mean by safe limit is one which allows some level of adaptation, rather than catastrophic inland migration and forced migration, and the safe limit is roughly one cm a year of sea level rise.”

— Jonathan Bamber, professor at the University of Bristol

Why this matters:

Sea level rise is no longer a distant risk. It’s a relentless force reshaping coastlines and economies. As the planet warms, polar ice sheets are melting at alarming rates, swelling oceans and threatening coastal areas where billions of people live. The most vulnerable populations — those in low-lying developing nations like Bangladesh or small island states — will face the harshest consequences. But even wealthy countries with sophisticated defenses, like the Netherlands or parts of the U.S., are not immune to the long-term costs and upheaval. Sea level rise amplifies the impact of storms, floods infrastructure, contaminates drinking water, and erodes habitats. Crucially, these shifts won’t happen centuries from now—they’re accelerating within our lifetimes.

Related: Climate disasters challenge the myth of ‘safe’ havens

In short:

The Trump administration has dismantled key climate research efforts, dismissed scientists, and stopped tracking greenhouse gas emissions, undermining decades of work that informs climate policy.

Cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Weather Service are eroding the nation’s capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, with federal aid denied to communities hit by recent tornadoes and floods.

The administration is halting clean energy projects, slashing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations on pollution, and withdrawing from international climate efforts, positioning the U.S. as a global outlier in climate denial.

Key quote:

“Here we see a government that is taking a hatchet to the scientific enterprise. It’s the kind of destruction that will have implications for a while to come.”

— Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists

Why this matters:

Scientific data from agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration underpins early warning systems for hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts—tools that save lives and limit destruction. The Trump administration’s cuts to climate research, pollution regulation, and disaster preparedness hollow out that safety net, leaving communities more vulnerable. Without consistent tracking of emissions or federal support for resilience, local governments are left to fend for themselves, often without the resources or expertise required. The rollback of EPA authority and clean energy investments also threatens public health: Pollution from transportation and power plants contributes to heart and lung disease, particularly in children and low-income communities. And with climate disasters becoming more frequent and severe, the lack of a coordinated federal response magnifies both human suffering and economic losses.

Related: New FEMA chief says states must take the lead on disaster recovery this hurricane season

In short:

Forty-two people died as tornadoes swept across Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia, highlighting the importance of fast and accurate weather alerts to save lives during rapidly developing disasters.

The National Weather Service has lost more than 10% of its staff amid budget cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency, leaving 40% of forecasting offices short-staffed and impairing use of vital tools like Doppler radar and weather balloons.

While some observers credit local efforts for maintaining alert coverage in this storm, experts warn that broader, long-term damage to the alert infrastructure may be felt as hurricane season approaches.

Why this matters:

As climate patterns shift, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are increasing, from hurricanes to fast-moving tornado outbreaks. Accurate, timely forecasts can be the difference between life and death, especially when storms strike with little warning. The National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration form the backbone of the nation’s severe weather alert system, but proposed budget reductions threaten this safety net. These cuts come at a dangerous time, as climate volatility accelerates and populations grow in vulnerable areas like the Midwest and Southeast.

In short:

The Trump administration sees clean energy tax credits as a boon for China and is aiming to dismantle key Biden-era incentives through a broad GOP tax and spending bill.

House Republicans are divided, with moderates hoping to preserve credits that benefit manufacturing in their districts, while hard-liners seek sweeping rollbacks to focus on fossil fuels.

Analysts warn that weakening these incentives could devastate U.S. clean energy manufacturing, allowing China and other nations to dominate future markets in solar, batteries, and EVs.

— Thom Woodroofe, former Australian diplomat in Washington who now works at the Smart Energy Council

Why this matters:

The future of U.S. clean energy policy is hanging in the balance. As the Trump administration shifts decisively toward oil, gas, and coal, billions in private investment tied to solar panels, battery factories, and electric vehicle production may dry up. The risk is not only to jobs and technology development at home but also to global competitiveness. China already leads in many areas of green manufacturing, having spent decades building up its supply chains. If the U.S. exits this race, it could be surrendering both economic opportunity and influence over the climate technologies that will define the next half-century.

In short:

The Empire Wind project, stalled by an April executive order halting offshore wind work, will resume after Hochul held multiple calls with Trump urging him to lift the stop-work order.

Equinor had been losing $50 million per week during the pause and warned it would cancel the project if no resolution came soon. Work had already begun onshore in Brooklyn, with offshore construction set to start this month.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum praised Hochul’s willingness to work with the administration on energy infrastructure.

Trump has pushed to revive the Constitution Pipeline to bring shale gas from Pennsylvania to the Northeast; New York State did not provide environmental approval for that project and it was abandoned in 2020.

Key quote:

“We feel strongly that this is bigger than Empire Wind and the offshore wind industry. This is about energy projects that are under construction being stopped.”

— Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewable Americas

Why this matters:

The Empire Wind case shows just how precarious the clean energy transition remains. Offshore wind promises thousands of union jobs and zero-emission electricity for millions, but abrupt reversals in federal support threaten to chill investment and derail progress. The Trump administration’s initial pause on Empire Wind sent shockwaves through the industry, signaling that even shovel-ready projects with major capital invested could be upended by political whim.

In short:

Detroit’s St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center is still waiting on $2 million in federal funding for clean energy upgrades, one of many delays linked to Trump’s freeze on Biden-era climate equity funds.

Neighborhoods historically subjected to redlining suffer higher rates of power outages, energy shutoffs, and barriers to clean energy adoption, including aging infrastructure and housing stock.

Community solar and subsidy programs show promise but remain inaccessible to many due to state restrictions, utility resistance, or poor program design.

“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don't fix that, we'll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system.”

— Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan

Why this matters:

Across the country, historically redlined communities, often home to Black and brown residents, face compounding challenges: old electrical grids, outdated housing, and disproportionately high utility bills. These barriers make it nearly impossible for many to access the cost savings and resilience offered by clean energy technologies like solar panels and battery storage. And the problem isn’t just technical — it’s systemic. Federal support programs meant to close this gap have been frozen or gutted, while utilities often prioritize upgrades in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods. The result is a power system that reinforces old inequalities even as it modernizes.

Op-Ed: Black gold and the color line

Opinion: How financial institutions engineered climate injustice and the clean energy colorline

In short:

Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government plans to cut emergency preparedness funding and slash wildfire response budgets, despite recent ice storms and ongoing evacuations in northern communities.

The province is recommitting to large infrastructure projects like Highway 413 and a pumped hydro energy project in Georgian Bay, while blocking cities from using congestion pricing and failing to fund new transit.

The Ford government is accelerating mining development in the Ring of Fire, despite unresolved environmental assessments and opposition from some First Nations over lack of proper consultation.

Key quote:

“We always put money aside for what we can’t predict might happen. But we’re there financially. We’ve always been there, whether it’s fire, floods or whatever may come.”

— Peter Bethlenfalvy, Ontario Finance Minister, addressing cuts to emergency preparedness and firefighting

Why this matters:

As climate change accelerates, Ontario is leaning into fossil fuels and car-based infrastructure while scaling back climate mitigation and adaptation. The province's emissions-free electricity supply has eroded sharply, down to 84% last year from 96% seven years ago, as natural gas replaces phased-out renewables. At the same time, Ontario’s budget slashes critical spending on wildfire management and emergency preparedness — services already strained by extreme weather. Environmental advocates say the current policy direction undermines environmental safeguards and public transparency, along with sidelining urban transit, clean building standards, and congestion reduction tools that could make cities more resilient and livable in a warming world.

China is a massive global source of critical minerals required for a wide range of goods that includes computer chips, robots, electric autos, batteries, drones, and military equipment.
It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.
Without access to China’s significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.","FRANKFURT, Germany -- The world's sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China, leaving the global economy vulnerable to supply cutoffs that could disrupt economies and hit consumers with higher prices, a report said Wednesday.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency's report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity — but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.

It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86% in 2024 from 82% in 2020.

China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75%. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.

The current trend toward export restrictions and trade disputes increases concerns, the IEA said.

“Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. ”The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.”

Birol cited the energy crisis in Europe after Russia cut off natural gas supplies over the invasion of Ukraine. Another cautionary tale is the global shortage of silicon-based computer chips during and after the pandemic, which disrupted auto production.

“The golden rule of energy security is diversification,” Birol told The Associated Press in an interview. “And it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.""

Market forces are important in developing new sources but won't be enough. “There is a need for well-designed government policies” in the form of financing and other measures, he said.

China is a massive global source of critical minerals required for a wide range of goods that includes computer chips, robots, electric autos, batteries, drones, and military equipment. It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.

China has placed export limits of many of these key products and tightened controls on others as President Donald Trump’s trade negotiations escalate, stifling U.S. industry and the nation’s ability to find quick alternatives. Without access to China’s significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.

Trump has made reducing U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals a core tenet of his first 100 days back in office as part of a national security and economic resilience agenda.

This goes beyond China; the Trump administration finalized a rocky deal with Ukraine granting American access to the nation’s vast mineral resources earlier this month.

Trump is also looking to expedite deep-sea mining in international waters, much to the chagrin of environmental groups. He called for a boost in the domestic copper industry in a February executive order alongside other calls for the federal government to fast-track new mine permits; has reviewed a minerals proposal from Congo, a conflict-riddled nation also rich with mineral reserves; and attempted to strong-arm Greenland into providing more of its minerals to the U.S.

The IEA report said that global markets were well supplied at the moment and that prices in general have fallen. It warned however that planned production of copper, which is essential for electric wiring and power grids, would not keep pace with demand and predicted a 30% shortfall by 2030.

Ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has quadrupled since the 1990s, becoming the main driver of sea level rise.

By 2050, just 20 cm of sea level rise could cost $1 trillion annually in damage to 136 major coastal cities.

Scientists say a rise of one to two meters is now unavoidable, with the “safe limit” for adaptation likely already surpassed at 1C of warming.

Key quote:

“What we mean by safe limit is one which allows some level of adaptation, rather than catastrophic inland migration and forced migration, and the safe limit is roughly one cm a year of sea level rise.”

— Jonathan Bamber, professor at the University of Bristol

Why this matters:

Sea level rise is no longer a distant risk. It’s a relentless force reshaping coastlines and economies. As the planet warms, polar ice sheets are melting at alarming rates, swelling oceans and threatening coastal areas where billions of people live. The most vulnerable populations — those in low-lying developing nations like Bangladesh or small island states — will face the harshest consequences. But even wealthy countries with sophisticated defenses, like the Netherlands or parts of the U.S., are not immune to the long-term costs and upheaval. Sea level rise amplifies the impact of storms, floods infrastructure, contaminates drinking water, and erodes habitats. Crucially, these shifts won’t happen centuries from now—they’re accelerating within our lifetimes.

Related: Climate disasters challenge the myth of ‘safe’ havens

In short:

The Trump administration has dismantled key climate research efforts, dismissed scientists, and stopped tracking greenhouse gas emissions, undermining decades of work that informs climate policy.

Cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Weather Service are eroding the nation’s capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, with federal aid denied to communities hit by recent tornadoes and floods.

The administration is halting clean energy projects, slashing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations on pollution, and withdrawing from international climate efforts, positioning the U.S. as a global outlier in climate denial.

Key quote:

“Here we see a government that is taking a hatchet to the scientific enterprise. It’s the kind of destruction that will have implications for a while to come.”

— Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists

Why this matters:

Scientific data from agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration underpins early warning systems for hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts—tools that save lives and limit destruction. The Trump administration’s cuts to climate research, pollution regulation, and disaster preparedness hollow out that safety net, leaving communities more vulnerable. Without consistent tracking of emissions or federal support for resilience, local governments are left to fend for themselves, often without the resources or expertise required. The rollback of EPA authority and clean energy investments also threatens public health: Pollution from transportation and power plants contributes to heart and lung disease, particularly in children and low-income communities. And with climate disasters becoming more frequent and severe, the lack of a coordinated federal response magnifies both human suffering and economic losses.

Related: New FEMA chief says states must take the lead on disaster recovery this hurricane season

In short:

Forty-two people died as tornadoes swept across Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia, highlighting the importance of fast and accurate weather alerts to save lives during rapidly developing disasters.

The National Weather Service has lost more than 10% of its staff amid budget cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency, leaving 40% of forecasting offices short-staffed and impairing use of vital tools like Doppler radar and weather balloons.

While some observers credit local efforts for maintaining alert coverage in this storm, experts warn that broader, long-term damage to the alert infrastructure may be felt as hurricane season approaches.

Why this matters:

As climate patterns shift, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are increasing, from hurricanes to fast-moving tornado outbreaks. Accurate, timely forecasts can be the difference between life and death, especially when storms strike with little warning. The National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration form the backbone of the nation’s severe weather alert system, but proposed budget reductions threaten this safety net.

In short:

More than 480 European “green” funds governed by the EU’s sustainable finance disclosure regulations (SFDR) regulations collectively held $33.5 billion in fossil fuel stocks, including stakes in ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, and TotalEnergies.

Fund managers, including BlackRock, JP Morgan, and DWS, argue these investments enable shareholder influence over fossil companies, though climate analysts say the companies are not aligned with Paris climate agreement targets.

Upcoming European Securities and Markets Authority guidelines — set to take effect May 21— will allow regulators to hold funds accountable for the use of sustainability-related labels, though the rules are not legally binding.

Key quote:

“It is diabolical for banks and asset managers to invest billions in major fossil fuel companies under the rubric of ‘green investing’ when we need to accelerate investments in non- and low-carbon energy, in carbon efficiency, and in carbon removal technologies.”

— Richard Heede, Climate Accountability Institute

Why this matters:

The term “green investing” carries a promise: that your money supports environmental progress. But when so-called sustainable funds funnel billions into oil giants, that promise is broken. Funds operating under vague or loosely enforced definitions of sustainability risk misleading individuals, institutions, and governments alike. While regulators have begun to react — tightening rules around fund naming and disclosure — investors may still find themselves funding fossil fuel expansion through portfolios meant to fight climate change.

Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make good on the promises Republicans have made — and that’s why advocacy groups and other stakeholders are coming out in droves to urge Congress to immediately pass the landmark bill.

Here’s what they’re saying about the One, Big, Beautiful Bill:

American Exploration & Production Council CEO Anne Bradbury: “On behalf of America’s leading independent producers of oil and natural gas, AXPC urges all House Republicans to pass the budget reconciliation and advance President Trump’s agenda to unleash American energy. This legislation takes decisive steps towards improving our nation’s energy landscape by repealing the Biden-era menthane tax, unlocking oil and gas development on federal lands, and alleviating regulatory pain points that have stymied the build out of American energy. Passing this bill is essential to secure America’s energy dominance through smart, durable reforms.”

NumbersUSA: “For decades Congress has promised to secure the border and failed to deliver. The House Reconciliation bill delivers on the promise of building the border wall, 10,000 ICE officers, detention beds, historic funding for Customs and Border Patrol and a tax on money illegal aliens send out of the country. The Trump Administration needs this funding to deport illegal aliens, millions of whom entered the country over the last four years. The American people voted in mess this last election to secure our borders and return law and order to our immigration system. Congress must not fail them.”

Airlines for America: “A4A strongly supports the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and applauds the inclusion of a critical investment of $12.5 billion in modernizing the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic facilities, systems and infrastructure. For years, A4A has been sounding the alarm about ATC staffing shortages and antiquated equipment, such as copper wires and floppy disks. Given the challenges facing the air traffic system, these funds are a vital down payment on updating the technology that guides 27,000 flights, 2.7 million passengers and 61,000 tons of cargo every day—all while driving five percent of our nation’s GDP. The legislation also makes smart, strategic investments in Customs and Border Protection personnel and training for the aviation workforce of tomorrow while supporting American energy dominance in aviation fuel production. We encourage the House to pass this legislation and deliver on the Department of Transportation’s plan to help keep our skies safe and efficient. Modernizing our National Airspace System is necessary, and passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will help ensure the United States has a world-class aviation system.”

National Federation of Independent Business SVP for Advocacy Adam Temple: “On behalf of NFIB, the nation’s leading small business advocacy organization, I write in support of the Committee’s legislative proposal to comply with reconciliation instructions contained within the concurrent resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, H. Con. Res. 14. As written, this is one of the most pro-small business pieces of tax legislation in recent history.”

CTIA—The Wireless Association President and CEO Ajit Pai: “The wireless industry urges swift passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The critical spectrum and tax provisions in this legislation will allow the wireless industry to invest, create jobs, propel economic growth, and secure America’s edge in innovation.”

Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz: “House Republicans’ big, beautiful reconciliation bill is exactly what the country needs to jumpstart the economy and guarantee the safety and prosperity of Americans for decades to come. It helps people of all backgrounds but especially small businesses, the backbone of our economy, by making permanent and expanding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It increases the small business tax deduction used by 26 million entrepreneurs annually from 20% to 23% — a tax cut Job Creators Network has long been the leading voice for. The bill also restores 100% immediate expensing, allowing businesses to write off investments, expansion, and modernization. It will empower Main Street to expand, hire, raise wages, and reinvest in their communities, while also providing significant tax relief for ordinary folks. All Republicans should unite to support this historic reconciliation bill. We need Tax Cuts Now.”

Business Roundtable President & COO Kristen Silverberg: “Business Roundtable strongly supports the House budget reconciliation bill. This important legislation ensures a more competitive, pro-growth tax system, secures our borders and takes the necessary step of raising the debt ceiling. We urge members of the House Budget Committee to swiftly pass this measure.”

Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council President & CEO Karen Kerrigan: “SBE Council strongly supports the One Big, Beautiful Bill and urges every member of the U.S. House to vote in support of this economically powerful package. The One Big, Beautiful Bill provides entrepreneurs and small businesses with the tools and policy environment they need to invest in their businesses and workforce, to innovate and strengthen their firms, and to lead America’s economic resurgence.”

Associated Equipment Distributors SVP Daniel B. Fisher: “This legislation will spur economic growth and job creation, incentivize capital investment, and ensure AED members, which supply and maintain the equipment needed to build, feed and fuel America, remain competitive for years to come. We urge support for the bill and look forward to working with the entire House of Representatives to approve it as soon as possible.”

National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association Interim CEO Michele Stanley: “NSSGA appreciates that ‘The One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ includes aggregates industry priorities, such as bonus depreciation, the Research and Development Tax Credit, small business deductions, keeping the corporate tax rate at the status quo and protecting percentage depletion and estate taxes. Additionally, we appreciate the committee’s commitment to safeguarding associations’ tax-protected status. NSSGA thanks the committee for introducing this bill and encourages the Ways and Means Committee and the House of Representatives to pass this package in a timely manner.”

60 Plus Association Chairman Jim Martin: “It’s a win for seniors across the country. The President and House Republicans are providing much needed tax relief to middle and low-income seniors.”

Association of Mature American Citizens Action SVP Andrew J. Mangione, Jr.: “This bill is a win for seniors, for taxpayers, and for the future of our country. We urge swift passage and full support from lawmakers who value liberty, accountability, and the financial security of AMAC members across the country.”

RATE Coalition Executive Director Dan Combs: “This legislation is a clear step toward preserving a tax code that spurs job creation, boosts wages, and builds on the legacy created by President Trump and Congress under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Now is the time for Congress to come together, finish the work, and deliver a strong, stable economic foundation for American workers and businesses. A competitive corporate tax rate is key to keeping the U.S. ahead and a top destination for investment in the global economy. This bill goes a long way towards making that possible.”

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi: “We’ve said from the start: No Tax on Tips should include @Uber drivers & couriers. Grateful the new House Ways & Means bill does just that. Thanks to @POTUS and @RepJasonSmith for backing all tipped workers—no matter how they work. Let’s get this done!”

DoorDash CEO Tony Xu: “Thanks to @POTUS and @RepJasonSmith, millions of Dashers may soon get a tax break on their hard-earned tips. Following advocacy from 40K Dashers, including dozens in DC last week, the House’s budget bill is an important step in making #NoTaxOnTips a reality.”

Americans for Prosperity Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner: “The Republican Party has an incredible opportunity to put the country on the right track for long-term economic growth by making the Trump Tax Cuts permanent and avoiding the largest tax hike in American history. This bill is smart pro-growth policy that would provide certainty for American businesses and lead to sustained prosperity for millions of working Americans. This legislation also takes meaningful action to cut billions in special interest giveaways, reforming broken programs, and rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse – ensuring that taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars are spent wisely. It’s about making government work better for the people it serves. We’re encouraged by the foundation laid in the House and stand ready to work with Senate lawmakers to get this measure across the finish line. The moment for action is now. We urge all Members to support this legislation and put our economy on the path to growth and opportunity.”

Concerned Veterans for America Executive Director John Vick: “Failing to extend President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would impose the largest tax hike in U.S. history on American families and businesses. Congress must seize its opportunity to protect our long-term prosperity while improving the lives of middle-class Americans. The American people sent a clear message last November: they are tired of massive tax hikes, higher prices, reckless government spending, and Biden-era “Green New Deal” giveaways. Congress must answer this call by moving budget reconciliation forward. As veterans, we fought for a better future for our fellow Americans. We also understand that a strong economy is the bedrock of American strength at home and abroad. Today, CVA calls on Congress to act to protect the promise of long-term economic growth and prosperity for all Americans.”

The LIBRE Initiative Executive Director Sandra Benitez: “We commend the House Budget Committee for taking a positive step to ensure that we continue extending tax relief to middle-class families and job creators, including Latinos who cannot afford a tax hike. Now it is critical that the House of Representatives have a full House vote as quickly as possible and approve this pro-growth legislation to help unleash prosperity and opportunity for all. The LIBRE Initiative looks forward to educating and activating the Latino community on the benefits of this critical legislation.”

America First Policy Institute: “Conservatives must deliver to the American people! The One, Big, Beautiful Bill cuts taxes for ALL Americans, secures the border, stands up to the woke mob by empowering parents and protecting women and children, and much more!”

Independent Women Center for Economic Opportunity Director Patrice Onwuka: “Passing the Big, Beautiful Bill is an imperative. The stakes are high. If Congress fails to pass this bill, average Americans face a massive 22% tax increase, 40 million families will see their Child Tax Credit slashed in half, and 26 million small businesses face a 43.4% top tax rate. Republicans should not hold up tax relief for American families and small businesses to bail out high-tax blue states.”",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:35.425336

In 2023 Poland’s Ministry of Climate and Environment issued decisions-in-principle for the construction of BWRX-300 SMRs at six locations. A total of 24 BWRX-300 reactors are planned at the sites.

TVA, which owns and operates the Sequoyah and Watts Bar nuclear stations in Tennessee and the Browns Ferry nuclear station in Alabama, is also leading a coalition of utility companies and supply chain partners that has applied for an $800m (€712m) US Department of Energy (DOE) grant to accelerate construction of the nation’s first SMR.

GVH said in a statement that momentum is continuing to build around the global deployment of the BWRX-300.

Earlier this month, the province of Ontario and OPG announced approval to proceed with construction of the first BWRX-300 at OPG’s existing Darlington nuclear power station site near Toronto. A total of four BWRX-300s are planned for the site with construction of the first unit to be complete by the end of the decade.

Only a handful of SMRs have been completed and only in Russia and China. The Darlington project is expected to be the first to be deployed in the developed Group of Seven countries.

In January, Duke Energy said it had entered into an agreement to invest in activities to advance the standard design and licensing of the BWRX-300 SMR.

Duke said American Electric Power had selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment at the Indiana Michigan Power Rockport Plant, a coal-fired facility, in Spencer County, Indiana, pending approval of the DOE funding request that TVA is leading.

Technology Is Advanced And Real’

Canadian utility SaskPower has chosen the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan, subject to a decision to build expected in 2029.

“TVA’s investment in the standard design of the BWRX-300 technology will accelerate its deployment, helping meet the rising demand for energy and enhancing energy security,” said Craig Ranson, GVH’s president and chief executive officer.

“This milestone, in addition to this month’s decision by the Province of Ontario to build the western world’s first SMR, demonstrates that this technology is advanced and real.”

According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, more than 80 commercial SMR designs are under development with a number of countries planning deployment. Designs are being developed for applications including electricity generation, heating and water desalination. Most are designed to factory built and easily deployed where needed.

The BWRX-300 is a 300-MW water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems. It is based on an existing boiling water reactor design – the ESBWR – that is licensed in the US. It also uses an existing, licensed fuel design.

The Clinch River Nuclear Site is owned by TVA. It was originally the site of the Clinch River breeder reactor project, for which funding was erminated by Congress in 1983.

In the Senate, that refers to employing a simple majority to overrule precedents on issues that otherwise require a 60-vote supermajority under the filibuster.
2 Republican and a leading advocate of undoing the waivers, said that the fight was a “smoke screen” for Democrats who want to use federal waivers to ban gas-powered cars nationwide.
Despite reluctance to overrule the parliamentarian, Republicans say they are confident they have the votes to move forward.
“The only people that have attempted to get rid of the legislative filibuster are the Democrats,” Mr. Thune said on Tuesday.","Senate Republicans plan to move on Wednesday to overturn California’s landmark vehicle emissions law, using a little-known federal statute that allows Congress to strike down regulations and that Democrats claim would erode the filibuster.

The fight has serious implications for both environmental policy and the institution of the Senate. Republican leaders intend to use the statute, the Congressional Review Act, to force a vote to nullify federal waivers granted in the last days of the Biden administration to allow California to phase out gas-powered vehicles by 2035 and impose other emissions reductions.

They are acting even though the Government Accountability Office and their own Senate parliamentarian determined that the Environmental Protection Agency waivers were not subject to the review law, which is meant to give the legislative branch a way of undoing federal regulations, not state ones.

“Republicans seem to be putting the wealth of the big oil industry over the health of our constituents,” Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, said on Tuesday as he and other Democrats laid out their case against the Republican effort to undo his state’s emissions requirements.

Because resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act need only a majority vote, they are some of the only legislation that can avoid a filibuster in the Senate. Democrats have accused the Republicans of “going nuclear” on the California emissions standards. In the Senate, that refers to employing a simple majority to overrule precedents on issues that otherwise require a 60-vote supermajority under the filibuster.

Republican leaders dismissed the Democratic complaints. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, who has vowed to protect the filibuster, said the dispute was over the “novel and narrow” issue of whether an E.P.A. waiver constituted a rule — not anything central to the future of the filibuster governing legislation.

Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Republican and a leading advocate of undoing the waivers, said that the fight was a “smoke screen” for Democrats who want to use federal waivers to ban gas-powered cars nationwide.

“What they are trying to do is force-feed the American public electric vehicles that the public doesn’t want and can’t afford,” Mr. Barrasso said. He said Republicans were protecting the power of the Senate to determine what could be considered under the law.

“The determination is going to be made by the Senate,” he said in an interview.

The House, with significant Democratic support, voted two weeks ago to overturn the waivers, sending the matter to the Senate.

Senators are traditionally reluctant to upend their chamber’s rules, fearing that “going nuclear” will come back to haunt them when the other party gains control. But it has happened repeatedly in recent years, with serious repercussions.

In 2013, Democrats, frustrated at Republican obstruction of federal appeals court nominees, overruled Senate precedents to establish that a simple-majority vote was sufficient for confirming most judicial and executive branch nominees. When Republicans gained control in 2017, they then lowered the filibuster threshold for Supreme Court justices to a majority as well, empowering President Trump to name three justices to the court over Democratic objections.

Republicans have sought to focus the dispute mainly on the Government Accountability Office, arguing that the watchdog agency improperly interfered when it determined that the emissions waivers were not subject to congressional review.

Mr. Thune said it was “the first time ever the Government Accountability Office has decided to insert itself into the process and affirmatively declare an agency rule submitted to Congress as a rule is not a rule,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary deviation from precedent for an agency that should be defending Congress’s power.”

Democrats said the Republican focus on the watchdog agency was a diversion, and took to the floor on Tuesday evening to note that the Senate parliamentarian — the nonpartisan protector of Senate rules — had also determined that the waivers did not qualify for filibuster-free consideration under the Congressional Review Act.

“To use the C.R.A. in a way that Republicans propose is going nuclear,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. “No ands, ifs or buts.”

He and other senators said a decision to overrule the Government Accountability Office and the parliamentarian would have future consequences as lawmakers try to take advantage of a new route around the filibuster.

“Just as we saw with judges, there is no cabining a decision to overrule the parliamentarian,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. “And so any suggestion that this situation is ‘exceptional’ or that the precedent it would create would be ‘narrow’ is magical thinking.”

Democrats also said they feared that the Republican action on the California waivers was a prelude to Republicans potentially overruling the parliamentarian on the major tax and spending cuts legislation expected to be considered later this year. That measure is subjected to special rules sparing it from a filibuster that are enforced by the parliamentarian.

Despite reluctance to overrule the parliamentarian, Republicans say they are confident they have the votes to move forward.

Their efforts to nail down the votes got a significant boost last week when Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the former party leader and a staunch defender of the filibuster, told colleagues in a private luncheon that he would support the move, according to people who attended the lunch but spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.

Republicans also said that Democratic hypocrisy on the issue was rampant, given that many of those complaining about their push on the California standards were ready in 2022 to jettison the filibuster on voting rights legislation, a move that would have significantly eroded the reach of the legislative filibuster. But Democrats fell short of the required votes in that instance.

“The only people that have attempted to get rid of the legislative filibuster are the Democrats,” Mr. Thune said on Tuesday. “Every single one of them up there that’s popping off and spouting off has voted — voted literally — to get rid of the legislative filibuster.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21dc-filibuster-gpmk/21dc-filibuster-gpmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 06:03:03.112197

While this is not the first construction permit application for a SMR, it is the first for a utility that seeks to connect the planned reactor to the grid.
That’s better utilization of workforce and supply chain,” Adam Stein, director of the nuclear energy innovation program of the Breakthrough Institute, told me.
“A construction permit is part of a two-step licensing process.
You get a construction permit, and then you’re allowed to start building the plant.","Senate Republicans plan to vote this week on California’s ability to set its own emissions standards, Majority Leader John Thune said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Since 1967, the Environmental Protection Agency has granted California a waiver to set stricter-than-federal restrictions on emissions in acknowledgment of the state’s unique air pollution challenges, including smog; due to the state’s size, however, those standards have largely been adhered to by automakers nationally. The House voted earlier this month to end California’s waiver — which has long been opposed by Republicans, who’ve called it, erroneously, an “electric vehicle mandate” — although there had been some uncertainty over whether the Senate would take up the vote, since Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough and the Government Accountability Office had both ruled that the EPA waiver is not subject to the Congressional Review Act, which is what Republicans have called upon to attempt to overturn it.

Thune confirmed that the chamber would take up the three House resolutions unwinding the California waiver, claiming Democrats were “attempting to derail a repeal by throwing a tantrum over a supposed procedural problem.” In response, Senator Alex Padilla of California, a Democrat, said, “If this attempt is successful, the consequences will be far-reaching, not only for our clean energy economy, the air our children breathe, and for our climate, but for the future of the CRA and for the Senate as an institution.”

2. For the first time, U.S. utility seeks permit for an SMR

The Tennessee Valley Authority is seeking a permit to build a small modular reactor, the Journal-News reports, the first utility to do so. On Tuesday, the TVA — the nation’s largest public power provider — took another step toward adding an SMR to its nuclear fleet by applying for a construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a site on Tennessee’s Clinch River.

While the project had previously been touted by the Biden administration as helping advance the nation toward “a clean energy future,” my colleague Matthew Zeitlin noted that language has vanished from the construction application, which now argues the SMR is the next step in “establishing America’s energy dominance to power artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing.” Regardless of spin, the fastest Clinch River could go into operation is about five years, Adam Stein, the director of the nuclear energy innovation program of the Breakthrough Institute, told Matthew.

3. CATL goes public — with no onshore American investors

The world’s biggest manufacturer of electric vehicle batteries, CATL, raised $4.6 billion in its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Tuesday, making it the largest share offering of 2025 to date. The stock surged 16% over the subscription price, although onshore U.S. investors were largely shut out by the company in order to “limit its exposure to U.S. legal liability,” with the Pentagon having put the Fujian province-based company on a blacklist earlier this year for its alleged links to China’s military, Bloomberg writes.

CATL’s manufacturing is done almost entirely within China, although the company has said it will use 90% of its proceeds from the Hong Kong offering on the construction of a new factory in Hungary, The Economist reports. Though the company faces an uphill battle making inroads in the U.S. due to slowing demand for electric vehicles and scrutiny of Chinese companies by American politicians, The Economist adds that CATL also has “plenty of room for further expansion,” including growing its “higher-margin energy-storage business.”

4. Honda to pivot from EVs to focus on hybrids

Japanese automaker Honda announced Tuesday that it will pivot away from its investment in electric vehicles in order to focus on growing demand for hybrids, Reuters reports. The company revised its electrification investment from about $69 billion to $48 billion, while at the same time planning 13 hybrid models between 2027 and 2031.

Honda cited a slowdown in EV sales as justification for its decision, though as Electrek points out, “It’s estimated that this year – not 2030 – 25% of cars sold globally will be EVs,” and that “any company that sells less than that is lagging behind the curve, losing ground to companies that are ready for the transition that is already happening.” Electrek adds that Honda’s profits have largely slipped due to competition in the Chinese auto market from domestic EVs.

5. Even 1.2 degrees of warming could ‘profoundly alter’ world’s coastlines: report

If the world merely sustains the current level of warming, at 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, ice melt off of Greenland and Antarctica could still “profoundly alter coastlines around the world, displacing hundreds of millions of people, and causing loss and damage well beyond the limits of adaptation,” a grim new study published in Nature has found. Even keeping global temperature rise beneath the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold established in the Paris Climate Agreement could result in “catastrophic inland migration and forced migration,” the University of Bristol’s Jonathan Bamber, one of the authors of the report, told The Guardian. In fact, “you don’t slow sea level rise at 1.5,” lead author Chris Stokes of Durham University told CNN. Rather, “you see quite a rapid acceleration.”

Around 230 million people live less than a meter, or 3.2 feet, above sea level, including many residents of Miami. The researchers estimated that due to ice melt, seas could rise 40 inches by the end of the century, requiring “massive land migration on scales that we’ve never witnessed since modern civilization,” Bamber told CNN. As Stokes added, “There’s very little that we’re observing that gives us hope here.”

Ikea has begun selling air-to-water heat pumps in Germany, in partnership with Svea Solar. “Sustainable living should be accessible to the masses,” Jacqueline Polak of Ikea Germany said in a statement.

Because of the long lead times for nuclear projects and the promise (for now, at least) of government support, how developers talk about them tends to change along with the partisan revolutions of power.

TVA has been considering the Clinch River site for new nuclear since 2010, applied for an early site permit from the NRC in 2016, and received it in 2019. When TVA announced in 2022 that it would spend another $150 million on the project, in addition to the $200 million that had already been authorized, the public utility’s then-CEO Jeff Lyash justified the investment as part of an overall effort to convert America to clean energy. “We believe advanced nuclear technologies will play a critical role in our region and nation’s drive toward a clean energy future,” he said. The following year, when then-Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholmvisited the Clinch River site, the TVA touted how new nuclear generation would reduce the system’s overall carbon emissions.

As the project marches on under Donald Trump, however, the emissions talk is gone.

In Tuesday’s announcement, “carbon,” “emissions,” and even “clean” go unmentioned. Instead the construction application is “TVA’s next step in … establishing America’s energy dominance to power artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing.”

American energy — and nuclear — policy is in flux, but rhetoric aside, TVA’s nuclear ambitions appear to be an area of continuity between the Trump and Biden administrations. The Trump White House is reportedly working on a series of executive actions to speed up regulatory approvals for nuclear projects and remove some of the NRC’s power and independence.

At the same time, energy policy experts have lambasted Republicans in Congress for their proposed cuts to the Loans Program Office andphase-out of tax credits for nuclear power. Contra the legislative winds, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Tuesday that he supports “every incentive” for nuclear power, and that he favorsextending tax credits for nuclear and geothermal for another 15 years while more quickly phasing out wind and solar credits.

While this is not the first construction permit application for a SMR, it is the first for a utility that seeks to connect the planned reactor to the grid. Both the Bill Gates-backedTerraPower and the partnership of X-Energy and Dow have applied for construction permits for reactors.

The TVA application is another step in a long journey towards new nuclear for the power authority, which is one of two organizations to actually turn on a nuclear plant in the United States this century. It’s also a big step for Ontario Power Generation, TVA’s Canadian counterpart, which recently received a construction permit from Canadian regulators to build a BWRX-300. By building the same design multiple times in sequence — first in Ontario, then in Oak Ridge, and then hopefully in Ontario again — the projects’ developers hope to be able to apply lessons learned from one reactor to the next, as well as shuttle specialized workers back and forth between construction sites.

“If you flip flop sites, they can transition from one site that’s ready to another site that’s ready for the stage that needs that speciality. That’s better utilization of workforce and supply chain,” Adam Stein, director of the nuclear energy innovation program of the Breakthrough Institute, told me.

GE-Hitachi, meanwhile, applied to the NRC for a license for its SMR design in 2019. Despite all the excitement and investment around SMRs, there is onlyone licensed design, NuScale’s US600 — and no current plans for anyone to build it.

The fastest the Clinch River project could actually go into operation is about five years, Stein told me. “A construction permit is part of a two-step licensing process. You get a construction permit, and then you’re allowed to start building the plant. Then you need to get an operating license,” he explained.

The environmental review should go quickly, Stein said, because TVA already has its site permit. “They should be able to do less intensive environmental review to make sure that nothing changed in the application versus what it’s already approved,” Stein added.

While TVA is a government entity, it funds itself and operates independently, albeit with a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed board. The board currently does not have a quorum thanks to the Trump administration firing two Biden-appointed members, and would not be able to make a final investment decision on the project until it adds new members. The firings came after Tennessee’s two Republican senators, Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn, wrote an op-ed criticizing the TVA for moving too slowly on its SMR work. TVA also has a new chief executive, Dan Moul, who took over in March, after Lyash announced in January that he intended to resign and looked forward to “spending more time with family.”

Nuclear already comprises over 40% of TVA’s generation capacity. The utility has asked for assistance from the Department of Energy to increase that, including an $800 million grant to help speed up construction at Clinch River and an $8 million grant to specifically defray licensing costs for the SMR.

The Trump administration has shown some friendliness to Biden-era nuclear initiatives, including honoring aloan guarantee to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan.

Considering the long and uncertain time frame for building any nuclear reactor, it’s almost certain that, if TVA’s application is approved, the project will be completed under a different president than Trump. By then, it might be a carbon-free and emissions-reducing one again.

That number is a reflection of the narrow subset of policies the group modeled and does not take into account Trump’s tax cuts. In theory, those could have a positive effect on GDP that offsets some of the loss. But the effects on energy costs and jobs on their own tell a grim story.

By 2030, the average American would spend $120 more per year on transportation and home energy costs than they otherwise would. By 2035, the increase would climb to more than $230. Lower demand for clean technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels would kill more than 700,000 potential jobs across the economy in 2035.

Energy Innovation isn’t the only group warning of dire consequences. The bill “represents a crisis for America’s ability to build the energy infrastructure we need to meet surging demand,” Abigail Ross Hopper, the CEO and president of the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement yesterday. The group estimates that the bill would put 287 factories that serve the solar industry at risk of closing or never opening in the first place. Most of those are in red states.

The forecasts stem from key changes the GOP is proposing to make to tax credits that incentivize wind and solar development, domestic manufacturing, and consumer adoption of electric vehicles and energy efficiency upgrades. The bill would end these subsidies earlier than currently planned (though how much earlier is currently in flux), and impose stricter materials sourcing requirements, tighter development timelines, and more rigid project finance rules for the years they remain in effect, making it nearly impossible to use them.

As a result, fewer wind, solar, and energy storage projects would get built. Those that did get built would cost more, meaning that natural gas would set the price in energy markets more frequently. Natural gas would also be more expensive because of higher demand. The Energy Information Administration already expects natural gas costs to rise this year and next, even without changes to tax incentives. Altogether, generating electricity would cost about 50% more in 2035 than it otherwise would, according to Energy Innovation, which would translate to roughly 17% higher bills for consumers.

Budget hawks in the House are now pushing for an even more aggressive phase-out of the green tax credits before they agree to send their legislation to the Senate, and the Republican leadership can afford to lose just three votes on the floor, giving them a narrow window to please everyone. But the earlier phase-out would have little impact on Energy Innovation’s findings, Robbie Orvis, the senior director for modeling and analysis for the group, told me. The existing provisions in the bill that prevent companies from sourcing materials from China would be so difficult to meet that the model assumes the affected credits would be unclaimable beginning next year.

The modeling shows a similar effect in transportation costs. Terminating the tax credit for electric vehicles would lower demand for EVs and increase demand for gasoline, causing prices at the pump to go up. Less demand for EVs would also mean fewer domestic jobs producing them, and fewer jobs producing the components that go into them. Then there’s the overall tightening of purse strings that would come as a result of higher energy costs, which could reduce hiring still further.

Orvis said the estimates for job loss are likely conservative, as the model looks at changes in demand for EVs and other clean technologies but doesn’t do a good job accounting for the changes in supply that would result from early repeal of 45X, the clean manufacturing tax credit.

Notably, energy costs go up in the model despite provisions in the bill that are designed to lower the cost of oil and gas. Those include more frequent lease sales and lower royalty rates for companies that pay to drill on federal lands and waters. But Energy Innovation found that demand-driven price increases more than offset any price declines resulting from these measures.

The tax credit termination also isn’t the only factor here. Energy Innovation included the House’s proposed repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency’s emissions standards for cars and trucks, which amplified the effects. This provision may not make it into the final text, however, as the special rules governing the budget reconciliation process in the Senate prohibit policies that aren’t budgetary in nature. As the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund put it in a memo to reporters, the regulations were issued to protect public health, and while they do result in costs and benefits for Americans and companies, they do not change the federal budget. “Even if Republican leadership tries to claim any budgetary impacts here, they would be clearly incidental to the main purpose of the proposed legislation,” the group said.

Of course, at least seven Senate Republicans have been vocal about their disapproval of the House’s treatment of the tax credits, so the whole thing may still be subject to change.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDI3MTM0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDExNTM4OX0.FKZXZNikjhqMHjwafFQXghMCeUpJ9ubLtkwyO3ViwGA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-21 09:07:56.309394

The Trump administration has said it plans to finalize new rules for the three forever chemicals in spring 2026.","The EPA announced it's extending the deadline on removing two forever chemicals from public water systems and rescinding regulations on three other contaminants, also known collectively as PFAS.

Under the regulations finalized by the Biden administration last year, public water agencies had until 2029 to install PFAS-reducing filtration systems in drinking water supplies that exceeded the EPA standard for two forever chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. The deadline is now 2031.

The Trump administration, which said it plans to finalize new rules for the other three PFAS next year, has pitched the move as a way to support smaller water systems that may need more time to address forever chemicals in drinking water.

In the meantime, the current federal limits for those three chemicals — PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA — are to be canceled. The EPA had set the limit at 10 parts per trillion for each.

Forever chemicals are toxic to humans, and may cause cancer and damage to the liver, heart and immune system, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

How does new PFAS deadline from EPA impact Bucks County water?

Water systems in Bucks and Montgomery counties have faced contamination from forever chemicals, thanks in part to firefighting foam used at former military bases along the Bucks-Montgomery county line. Other common sources of PFAS include wastewater treatment plants and landfills, according to the EPA.

Pennsylvania currently has higher allowances for PFOA and PFOS (14 and 18 parts per trillion) to trigger mandatory treatment than EPA regulations at 4 parts per trillion each.

The extension of the deadline on treatment system installation means that water systems that may have tested above EPA limits but below Pennsylvania limits won't have to install a treatment system until 2031. A number of water systems throughout the county routinely test above the EPA limit but below the state limit, according to the latest state data.

However, the state still ""highly recommends"" that new treatment systems are designed to bring PFAS to below the 4 parts per trillion level, a Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson said Friday.

Rescinding the limits for the other three forever chemicals may affect water regulation in the state as well.

While Pennsylvania has set limits for PFOA and PFOS, it doesn't have any for PFNA, PFHxS or HFPO-DA, although some water systems in Bucks County do provide testing data for HFPO-DA to the state on a voluntary basis. It's unclear whether the limits on the three chemicals will be rescinded without replacement, meaning there will no limits for those three chemicals in effect, or if EPA intends to rescind those limits only when it has new ones to replace them.

The EPA did not immediately respond to questions on Monday.

The Trump administration has said it plans to finalize new rules for the three forever chemicals in spring 2026.

So U.S. companies are still feeling intense pressure to improve their battery offerings.
Chinese cars are largely absent from U.S. roads, thanks to a combination of heavy tariffs and U.S. restrictions on web-enabled Chinese car tech.
Ford is licensing some technology made by Chinese battery maker CATL for use in American-made vehicles.
Chinese EV and battery companies, like BYD, have grown quickly on the back of strong government investment and subsidies.","Lithium-ion batteries were invented in the United States. But years ago, as part of a push toward electric vehicles, China took the lead in mass-producing them.

Now there's a great race underway to see who will dominate the future of EV batteries.

Chinese automakers are announcing newer, better batteries at a breakneck speed, including vehicles promising 5-minute ""flash charge"" times first demonstrated this spring. And, not coincidentally, more than half of new cars sold in China come with a plug.

In the U.S., plug-in sales are lower and policies promoting EVs are politically divisive. The Trump administration has started the process of rolling back incentives, infrastructure and requirements encouraging them.

But globally, battery-powered cars remain a crucial part of plans to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change, thanks to their smaller carbon footprint. They're also widely believed to be the technology of the future, and companies want to make sure they can compete in tomorrow's auto market as well as today's. So U.S. companies are still feeling intense pressure to improve their battery offerings. Last week, General Motors engineers in Detroit announced a cheaper long-range battery, and work is frantically underway to unlock even more dramatic innovations.

""Unquestionably, the Chinese are ahead in manufacturing technology,"" says Bob Galyen, a retired executive whose long career in automotive batteries spanned both GM and the Chinese battery giant CATL. Today, profits from making batteries are being poured back into R&D in China, he says. ""Clearly, the U.S. is lagging behind.""

But, he says, American labs are still coming up with new ideas: ""There is hope for us.""

In Shanghai, a futuristic auto show

To enter the Shanghai Auto Show this spring, first visitors had to pass through facial recognition scanners. It was a taste of the technology on display inside, one of the main reasons why thousands of people, like Shanghai resident Dai Yiyao, flocked to the event.

Dai was accompanied by his 12-year-old son. ""I brought my kid to see the development, to see what this era is like,"" Dai said. ""He can't be ignorant of it.""

Booth after booth, car company after car company, there was a lot to absorb. Cars that can pivot on the spot. Cars that can operate in water, like a boat. Concept cars with quadcopter rotors. BYD, the world's biggest EV maker by sales and China's top brand, put on display a drone pod that attaches to the roof of a car and opens automatically.

A salesman called it ""the world's first drone system only designed for the vehicle."" The drone, made by the Chinese company DJI, can follow the car automatically, or it can be controlled from inside the car — if there's a traffic jam, the salesman said, you can deploy it to see what's going on ahead of you.

A few steps away, BYD was demonstrating what is perhaps a more consequential development: ""flash charging."" It's car battery charging at 1 megawatt (1,000 kW) — far more power than competitors — with batteries designed to be so efficient that they don't overheat under the high power load.

""How fast is it? It can add two kilometers of range per second, or 400 kilometers in five minutes,"" said an engineer on site who declined to be named, citing company policy.

That's more than three times faster than U.S. market leader: Tesla's Supercharger.

""Charging a mobile phone is slower. We're faster,"" the engineer said.

BYD says it's pioneering fast charging to eliminate anxiety about charge times and limited vehicle range, a major concern for EV owners. It's planning to install 4,000 fast charging stations across China.

None, however, will be installed in the United States. Chinese cars are largely absent from U.S. roads, thanks to a combination of heavy tariffs and U.S. restrictions on web-enabled Chinese car tech.

As a result, U.S. consumers can't buy any of the buzzy Chinese EVs on the market — at least, for now.

In Detroit, remixing the battery ""recipe""

But while Chinese EVs aren't on U.S. streets, they're very much on automakers' minds.

Executives from multiple companies have publicly acknowledged that trade barriers can only go so far. Eventually, companies will have to be able to go toe-to-toe with Chinese counterparts on their merits, or risk being relegated to irrelevance on the global market. And that means better EV batteries.

No American company has announced anything like five-minute charging. But companies are very focused on bringing down battery costs to make EVs more affordable — without sacrificing the long range and large vehicles that American buyers prefer.

GM's new battery chemistry, announced last week, is designed to do just that. It's a ""lithium manganese-rich,"" or LMR, battery, to be produced in partnership with LG Energy Solutions and deployed in vehicles starting in 2028.

Lithium-ion batteries are made up of alternating layers of different chemicals, some of which are more expensive than others. GM says its new battery uses a lot more manganese — which is cheap — and less of pricey materials like nickel and cobalt.

GM says the battery can store almost as much energy as today's most expensive EV batteries, but at a cost comparable to the cheapest version, without compromising on lifespan. It's a little bit like if you made a cake cheaper by cutting back on expensive ingredients, like eggs and butter — but changed how you mixed and baked the cake to keep it just as tasty.

""It's all about: How much of each ingredient, how do you process it, how do you mix it?"" says GM battery engineer Andy Oury. He points out that starting with eggs, milk and butter, you could wind up with anything from scrambled eggs to popovers. The steps you follow determine the final product.

In GM's research and development labs north of Detroit, scientists have been working on this new battery recipe for years. Engineers say they've cracked the right one, and now it's about figuring out how to efficiently produce the battery in huge quantities. That's its own kind of challenge, a little bit like scaling up cake production from a home kitchen to Costco.

Leading journalists on a tour of GM's battery labs, Shriram Santhanagopalan, the company's senior manager of advanced battery cell development, pointed through a window into a sealed, humidity-controlled room featuring a waist-high silver metal device with tubes running in and out. It blends chemicals together, kind of like an oversized KitchenAid mixer, he said.

The chemicals do indeed have the texture of batter. They were about to go on a sheet of foil, get baked, then stacked up like a layer cake. (Tesla's process, by contrast, is to roll up the layers like a jelly roll.)

Santhanagopalan laughed. ""When we hire people, we say that good cooks make good batteries,"" he said.

Bigger breakthroughs are on the horizon

The recipe that GM has cooked up is ""exciting,"" says Evelina Stoikou, with the research company BloombergNEF. It should translate directly into longer range, she says, ""which is quite important for consumers.""

Sam Abuelsamid, a longtime auto analyst now with the strategic communications firm Telemetry, says it has other benefits too. For one thing, while China dominates existing battery supply chains, using more of a cheaper input like manganese can make it easier to find alternative supplies, he says: ""You get that lower cost, but also you've got the ability to source the materials from more places."" (GM has invested in a company called Element 25 that plans to build a U.S. refinery for Australian-sourced manganese.)

At the same time, they both point out, GM's announcement is essentially a tweak to today's battery recipes, offering higher performance at lower cost. It's ""more about optimizing,"" Abuelsamid says, rather than being a ""next-generation"" battery — a radical change in chemistry or design that would lead to dramatically improved performance.

Companies around the world are racing to build those, too. They include batteries based on sodium, for instance, which is cheaper and more abundant than lithium. Or ""solid-state"" batteries, entirely made from solid components instead of the liquid electrolyte used in today's batteries. These have gotten particular attention from the industry and the press because of their potential to be safer and cheaper while storing more energy. A variety of companies are trying to perfect one that's ready for use in a mass-market EV.

No one has nailed it yet — although many companies say they're only a few years away.

Kurt Kelty is GM's vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, after an influential career at Panasonic, Tesla and the battery start-up Sila. He says GM is talking with start-ups about their solid-state technology and continuing to research other radically different battery recipes, while also rolling out more incremental improvements.

He acknowledges in the race for new battery tech, China has an advantage. ""Some of these Chinese companies have massive R&D teams and they're getting a lot of funding from their governments,"" he says. ""It's hard to compete against that, but we've got quite a good, nimble team here.""

At the same time, he points out that the types of batteries that Chinese companies make so well today were developed in the U.S. before being scaled up in Asia, where the companies buying them were located.

Things could work out differently this time, he says — if American scientists can keep innovating new battery tech, and big companies can figure out how to commercialize them here and there's enough domestic demand. ""We can build an amazing battery industry here,"" he says. ""We have the opportunity here to really, really accelerate.""

And it's worth noting that while the U.S. and China are competing, there could be room for collaboration, too. Ford is licensing some technology made by Chinese battery maker CATL for use in American-made vehicles. And many battery experts see the potential for more cooperation, when it makes business sense — even if political tensions and trade wars are a major barrier.

In Shanghai, a sense of confidence

Meanwhile China, which has already built up its domestic battery industry, is in the process of a global expansion.

At the Shanghai auto show, reporters and bloggers were flown in from around the world. Bloomberg reported that BYD alone ""hosted some 150 journalists and influencers from Latin America.""

Geo Taveras, an influencer from the Dominican Republic who makes videos about cars and said he had been flown, all expenses paid, to the show by BYD, was filming a demonstration of flash charging. ""This is happening in real time,"" he said. ""I mean, the technology is already developed. You took the same time when you go to the gas station to put gas in your car.""

Chinese EV and battery companies, like BYD, have grown quickly on the back of strong government investment and subsidies. Years ago, the government recognized that batteries were going to be a key sector and made development of a battery supply chain, among other industries, a strategic priority.

The massive subsidies that followed are one reason they've built such enormous success — although Bob Galyen, who worked for years in China, said it's not the only reason. He said China's experience building consumer electronics for the rest of the world also positioned it for success in batteries — and the ""development and education of the people that go into building batteries,"" including scientists, engineers and factory workers, was also crucial.

Ahead of the auto show, CATL announced that it, too, is rolling out ultra-fast-charging car batteries. It's also launching a battery powered by sodium.

Dai, the Shanghai resident who brought his son to the car show, said China's world-leading technologies are now the envy of the world.

""I told my son, it used to be that we were the ones with our pens out evaluating the cars. Now [foreigners] are taking out cameras, pens, color charts to evaluate our cars,"" he said. ""The times have changed.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1200x675+0+63/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2F7c%2F5ca58a4342fea9b0005db5c7a7ce%2Fgmbatteries01.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 06:02:58.957865

The nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority, announced Tuesday it submitted a construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a small, modular nuclear reactor. It wants to develop next-generation nuclear power in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, at its Clinch River site.

TVA President and CEO Don Moul said that by going first, they can show other utilities a way to accelerate the development of small nuclear reactors.

“Nuclear is very reliable, very resilient. It is carbon free,” he told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview Monday. “It is, what I would consider, one of the highest quality generating sources we have. And so starting a path forward not only helps others in America follow, but it can also help America lead the world in the new technology.”

The federally owned utility provides electricity to seven states and operates three traditional, large nuclear power plants, which provide 40% of the Tennessee Valley’s power. The region’s population is growing, industries are replacing fossil fuels with electric alternatives and there’s more manufacturing. The TVA expects to need up to 26 gigawatts of power by 2035, enough to power roughly 15 million homes, to meet the growing demand for electricity and replace retiring power plants.

Its board launched a program in 2022 to develop and fund small modular nuclear reactors as part of its strategy to dramatically reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, and has provided $350 million for it so far.

U.S. electric utilities have been reluctant to invest in new nuclear construction because of large cost overruns and delays in Georgia, as Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Vogtle was expanded from two of the traditional large reactors to four, said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The TVA decision is meaningful because it may be the start of a trend, Buongiorno added.

The United States does not have any next-generation reactors operating commercially. The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies that want to build these reactors to begin providing power in the early 2030s. A project to build the first was terminated in 2023, as costs increased and not enough local power providers signed up to be part of it.

This month, the power company in Ontario, Canada, began building the first of four small nuclear reactors. Ontario Power Generation chose the same reactor the TVA wants to build, GE Hitachi’s design that uses light water like all large U.S. commercial reactors.

In Ontario, they’re expecting the first to cost $6.1 billion Canadian dollars ($4.4 billion), along with $1.6 billion Canadian dollars ($1.1 billion) for equipment to build all four. The cost is expected to decline with each subsequent reactor. TVA’s cost estimates are in the same range, Moul said, but he declined to give specifics and said the utility is looking for partners to help with the initial costs.

The nonprofit Environmental Working Group says far cheaper, safer and cleaner electricity can be delivered much faster through investments in proven renewable sources like solar rooftops, battery storage and wind power. There’s “no bigger example of a money pit than the fantasy of small modular reactors” as a viable source of energy in the U.S., said Alex Formuzis, spokesperson for the research and advocacy organization.

The Biden administration announced a $900 million investment in these reactors last year. The Trump administration also supports building small modular reactors for flexible, reliable power for energy-intensive sectors like industry and data centers as electricity demand soars. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in March that the $900 million would be awarded, but applicants had to submit new proposals to be judged solely on technical merit, without consideration for past diversity, equity and inclusion practices.

The TVA and its industry partners applied for $800 million in federal funding, which they say will help speed up the development of the technology by about two years.

The NRC has already said the Clinch River site is suitable for a new nuclear plant. There’s enough room for a total of four small reactors. If the NRC and the TVA board approve the plans to build the first reactor there, it could begin operating around 2032, providing 300 megawatts of power, which is enough for about 175,000 homes.

Mike DeWine signed a bill into law that could provide some relief — eliminating a subsidy from the scandal-ridden Ohio House Bill 6 that requires ratepayers to fund unprofitable coal plants. As this happens, utility companies are moving to increase consumers’ bills.

Back in 2019, Former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder took and funneled $61 million worth of bribes in exchange for legislation to give utility company FirstEnergy a $1 billion bailout, named H.B. 6, all at ratepayers’ expense.

In March 2023, a jury found that Householder and former GOP leader Matt Borges, beyond a reasonable doubt, participated in the racketeering scheme that left four men guilty and two dead.

In late June that year, federal judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges got five years for his role in the scheme, but most importantly, he attempted to bribe Tyler Fehrman, an FBI whistleblower, with $15,000 to help kill a repeal effort he was working on. On video, Borges told Fehrman that if he told anyone about the bribe, he would “blow up” his house.

While some of H.B. 6 was overturned already, ratepayers have been paying a subsidy that funds two Ohio Valley Electric Corporation coal plants — one in Southern Ohio and one in Indiana. The main beneficiaries for OVEC are American Electric Power Company (AEP), Duke Energy and AES Ohio. Still, FirstEnergy collects payment for it.

But with the swipe of a pen — consumers will likely see their bills go down. DeWine signed a massive energy overhaul bill, H.B. 15, on Friday. It repeals the OVEC charges.

A study commissioned by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association found that in 2024 alone, these subsidies cost ratepayers roughly $200 million. The company lost more than $100 million the same year, so consumers are paying for plants that aren’t profitable.

Consumers can expect to save between $1.30 and $1.50 per month, depending on their utility provider, according to the Energy News Network.

The subsidies may not seem like a lot every month, but they add up when inflation is high and people struggle.

“It makes a difference, especially in today’s day and age with a kind of shaky economy and folks trying to just make ends meet,” Fehrman said.

While this will save citizens a bit of money, Householder attorney Scott Pullins argues that this will hurt the rural areas it serves.

“They are major high-paying jobs in the area, and the kind of area where there aren’t very many high-paying jobs,” Pullins said about the plant jobs. “They generate a whole boatload of taxes for schools in those areas. And if those plants get shut down, it’s going to be devastating for those communities.”

The Ohio plant employs many Ohioans, he added. But now, this may embolden utility companies to ask for more rate hikes, he said. This is already happening.

“Our electric grid needs to be modernized,” Pullins said. “I’m assuming that those are where those costs are going. I think we do need a robust regulatory scheme to make sure these companies aren’t wasting these funds.”

FirstEnergy is now petitioning the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) to raise its prices — a $190 million increase in its charges.

If approved, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel estimated that Cleveland Illuminating Company consumers will see a $13 price increase per month, Ohio Edison will have a $3 spike, and Toledo Edison at $1.50.

On Monday, DeWine said he doesn’t have an opinion on the price increases.

“As far as the raising of bills, ultimately, as you know, this is up to the PUCO,” he said.

Fehrman said this shouldn’t be allowed.

“There is this massive scandal where these companies tried to put a larger burden on the backs of every single Ohioan,” he said. “And now, they’re asking for more money in a time when folks are already struggling.”

The bill will go into effect in 90 days.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-94/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/electric-meter-700x466-11747817345.jpg?h=241828bc&itok=70Npx1VT,N,,2025-05-21 15:12:39.230398

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is warning that legislation recently passed by the House Ways and Means Committee could shut down or prevent nearly 300 solar and battery storage factories from opening. If this bill becomes law without changes, the US could lose enough solar generation by 2030 to power the state of Pennsylvania for a year. That’s 145,000 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity that could vanish.

The SEIA analysis paints a grim picture: Nearly 300,000 US jobs are at risk, including 86,000 in solar manufacturing alone. And here’s the twist, as I’ve pointed out before – about 80% of the jobs and factories at risk are in red states that voted for Trump.

“There is still time to improve this bill, which, as written, represents a crisis for America’s ability to build the energy infrastructure we need to meet surging demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

The SEIA says the legislation would slam the brakes on solar and storage investments just as energy demand is soaring, thanks partly to the explosion in AI and data centers. SEIA estimates the bill could wipe out $220 billion in potential investments by 2030.

The House bill also repeals the Section 25D residential solar tax credit, which has been a critical driver of solar adoption for middle-class families. Without it, installing solar gets way more expensive – and out of reach for many households.

As Electrek reported last week, solar and wind accounted for almost 98% of new US electrical generating capacity added in Q1 2025, according to new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) data.

Solar and wind also made up an impressive 100% of new capacity in March, and March was the 19th consecutive month in which solar was the largest source of new capacity.

The US needs to add 206.5 gigawatts of new energy capacity by 2030. Solar is expected to deliver nearly three-quarters of that. If the bill guts solar incentives, we’re looking at higher electricity bills and slower economic growth. SEIA says the rollback could drive up consumer energy costs by $51 billion.

Hopper didn’t mince words: “Passing this bill would create a catastrophic energy shortfall, cede AI and tech leadership to China, and damage some of the most vital sectors of the US economy.”

She added that the Senate can still step in with a smarter proposal that aligns with Trump’s push for US energy dominance.

SEIA’s message to lawmakers? Fix the bill or energy production will plummet, blackouts will become more frequent, and the US will face a devastating – and completely avoidable – energy shortage.

In late March, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published the official notice in the Federal Register (90 FR 13428) outlining significant updates to how “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) will be interpreted under the Clean Water Act. Prompted by the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, the agencies announced plans to revise the way they determine whether certain wetlands and water bodies fall under federal jurisdiction.

A key highlight of the notice is the agencies’ move to eliminate “discrete features”—such as culverts, swales, or ditches—from automatically establishing a “continuous surface connection” to a jurisdictional water. Instead, wetlands and water bodies must physically abut or touch the main water body to be considered adjacent. This shift marks a departure from earlier 2023 guidance and is intended to provide a more straightforward approach in line with Sackett. This policy change was previously announced in a March 12 joint memorandum issued by the EPA and Corps titled, “WOTUS Notice: The Final Response to SCOTUS.”

To gather further perspectives before finalizing any additional clarifications or rulemaking, the agencies held listening sessions in late April and early May for states, tribes, local governments, agriculture, environment, and conservation stakeholders. Public listening sessions haven’t been announced. The listening sessions focused on three key topics: defining “relatively permanent” waters, clarifying the scope of “continuous surface connection,” and determining how jurisdictional ditches should be evaluated.

EPA accepted written recommendations from the public until April 23. According to the Federal Register, 34,693 public comments were received.

These developments signal another chapter in the long-evolving story of WOTUS regulations, and practitioners are encouraged to participate in the listening sessions and public comment process as the EPA and Army Corps consider next steps for federal water oversight.

The Federal Register filing comes after officials from both agencies announced they would be redefining WOTUS after years of rulings, rules, and disparate policy decisions by states on how to define waters of the United States under the Clean Water Act in protection of wetlands.

“We want clean water for all Americans supported by clear and consistent rules for all states, farmers, and small businesses,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news release issued March 12. “The previous Administration’s definition of ‘waters of the United States’ placed unfair burdens on the American people and drove up the cost of doing business. Our goal is to protect America’s water resources consistent with the law of the land while empowering American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families to help Power the Great American Comeback.”

In a memorandum issued March 12, the EPA, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers noted that Sackett provided a two-part test for determining CWA jurisdiction over adjacent wetlands. One, an adjacent body of water must be a “water of the United States,” meaning permanent and connected to a traditional navigable water. Second, a wetland must have a continuous surface connection to a requisite covered water, making it difficult to determine where the water ends and the wetland begins. The memo gives a history on Sackett and a preceding case, Rapanos v. United States.

It also notes that the EPA guidance in recent years has not been helpful to landowners affected by the court ruling and subsequent federal rule filings. It describes two 2023 rule filings as not including, “adequate direction or guidance on the meaning of the “continuous surface connection” requirement, and the agencies’ case-speciﬁc policy memoranda issued post-Sackett neither provided national guidance on the topic nor clear and transparent direction for the public or the agencies.”

“This guidance represents the agencies’ views on the proper implementation “waters of the United States” and is eﬀective immediately,” the memo states. “The EPA will apply this guidance when determining if a wetland has a “continuous requisite jurisdictional water under the Clean Water Act.”

For decades, officials in Washington D.C. have attempted to create definitions of WOTUS, which are continuously challenged in court. The country now has a patchwork of regulations, with 23 states operating under the “2023 Rule,” which took effect in March 2023, and 27 states – including Florida – operating under a pre-2015 regulatory framework.

Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday morning that the Senate will take up the vote to overturn waivers the Environmental Protection Agency granted to California that allowed the state to phase out gas-powered cars. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the Congressional Review Act — the legislative vehicle Republicans plan to use to overturn the policy — does not apply to waivers.

Ignoring Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough could open the door to ignoring her decisions later this year, when she will decide which policies can be part of the reconciliation bill and which should be subject to a 60-vote threshold filibuster. Democrats have warned that overruling the parliamentarian foreshadows how Republicans approach Senate rules in the near future, particularly as it applies to the Byrd Rule, which restricts what can be part of a reconciliation bill.

Thune dismissed this possibility in this floor speech, saying that Democrats’ concerns “are entirely misplaced.”

Thune called concerns that overruling the parliamentarian on this waiver will eventually open the door to ending the filibuster “hysterical.”

“We are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate,” he said. “The EPA has submitted the waivers to Congress as rules, which is all that Congress has ever needed to decide something under the Congressional Review Act.”

Conservative and liberal legal experts are sharply divided about whether the Senate’s move can be subject to legal challenge because the Senate is making a choice about its own procedures and has the authority to do so. The CRA has been used so rarely since its creation that its boundaries have not been thoroughly tested, and many gray areas remain, experts told NOTUS.

Many automakers and industry alliances lobbied for Congress to take up the repeal of California’s EV mandate, concerned more with the economic consequences of the EV mandate than any question of Senate procedure.

The California Air Resources Board criticized Senate Republicans’ decision to overrule the parliamentarian.

“The use of the Congressional Review Act resolution is inconsistent with past precedent and violates the plain language of the Congressional Review Act itself as recognized by both the nonpartisan and well-reasoned analyses of the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian,” a spokesperson with CARB told NOTUS. “The vote does not change CARB’s authority. CARB will continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.”

Instead of the initial plan to invest 10 trillion yen ($69 billion) in an electrification strategy through the fiscal year ending in 2031, Honda is reducing that investment by 3 trillion yen ($21 billion) to 7 trillion yen ($48 billion).

Honda Motor Co. Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe called the decisions “a switch in the planned course,” while stressing the long-term shift toward electrification remained unchanged, just pushed back in time.

Mibe didn't mention U.S. President Donald Trump. But Trump’s policies on tariffs, as well as his lack of enthusiasm for electric vehicles, have Japanese automakers scrambling to adapt.

“The environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day. Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of the EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations,” Honda said in a statement.

Mibe did not give a specific timeline for a new course for electrification. But Honda, which makes the Civic and Accord car models, will be more aggressive in producing hybrids instead, he said.

Honda’s auto plant in Marysville, Ohio, for instance, will be adapted to produce both EVs and hybrids under the new plan.

Mibe pointed to Honda’s motorcycle business as its core strength, as sales continue to grow in India, and Honda’s global market share was steadily rising.

Mibe also said the Tokyo-based automaker was working on the use of various digital technology to strengthen safety, including assisted driving that will bring deaths from traffic accidents down to zero, a longtime Honda goal.

Talks that began late last year to bring together the operations of Honda and Japanese rival Nissan Motor Corp., as well as smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp., in a merger, collapsed earlier this year. Mibe told reporters talks were still ongoing to have the three automakers work together on developing technology. He remained vague and did not say when a deal might be reached.

Nissan is sinking into losses, reducing its work force and shuttering plants. Its new chief executive, Ivan Espinosa, is promising a turnaround by speeding up decision-making.

Honda’s profit for the fiscal year through March slipped 24.5% from the previous year. But much of the negative impact is from external factors like tariffs and sliding sales in China.

“Honda’s profitability outlook remains robust, supported by cost-cutting initiatives,” said Aaron Ho, equity analyst at CFRA Research.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/20/PDTN/83745370007-ap-25140245196395.jpg?crop=4994,2811,x0,y243&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-21 05:04:48.819781

Gaps in power supply, combined with the rush to build data centers to power AI, often mean shortsighted energy plans.
And increasingly, you don’t need to go looking to use AI: It’s being integrated into every corner of our digital lives.","AI’s integration into our lives is the most significant shift in online life in more than a decade. Hundreds of millions of people now regularly turn to chatbots for help with homework, research, coding, or to create images and videos. But what’s powering all of that?

Today, new analysis by MIT Technology Review provides an unprecedented and comprehensive look at how much energy the AI industry uses—down to a single query—to trace where its carbon footprint stands now, and where it’s headed, as AI barrels towards billions of daily users.

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review’s series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

We spoke to two dozen experts measuring AI’s energy demands, evaluated different AI models and prompts, pored over hundreds of pages of projections and reports, and questioned top AI model makers about their plans. Ultimately, we found that the common understanding of AI’s energy consumption is full of holes.

We started small, as the question of how much a single query costs is vitally important to understanding the bigger picture. That’s because those queries are being built into ever more applications beyond standalone chatbots: from search, to agents, to the mundane daily apps we use to track our fitness, shop online, or book a flight. The energy resources required to power this artificial-intelligence revolution are staggering, and the world’s biggest tech companies have made it a top priority to harness ever more of that energy, aiming to reshape our energy grids in the process.

Meta and Microsoft are working to fire up new nuclear power plants. OpenAI and President Donald Trump announced the Stargate initiative, which aims to spend $500 billion—more than the Apollo space program—to build as many as 10 data centers (each of which could require five gigawatts, more than the total power demand from the state of New Hampshire). Apple announced plans to spend $500 billion on manufacturing and data centers in the US over the next four years. Google expects to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure alone in 2025.

This isn’t simply the norm of a digital world. It’s unique to AI, and a marked departure from Big Tech’s electricity appetite in the recent past. From 2005 to 2017, the amount of electricity going to data centers remained quite flat thanks to increases in efficiency, despite the construction of armies of new data centers to serve the rise of cloud-based online services, from Facebook to Netflix. In 2017, AI began to change everything. Data centers started getting built with energy-intensive hardware designed for AI, which led them to double their electricity consumption by 2023. The latest reports show that 4.4% of all the energy in the US now goes toward data centers.

The carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average.

Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it’s likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be. According to new projections published by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in December, by 2028 more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households.

Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. And all of this growth is for a new technology that’s still finding its footing, and in many applications—education, medical advice, legal analysis—might be the wrong tool for the job or at least have a less energy-intensive alternative.

Tallies of AI’s energy use often short-circuit the conversation—either by scolding individual behavior, or by triggering comparisons to bigger climate offenders. Both reactions dodge the point: AI is unavoidable, and even if a single query is low-impact, governments and companies are now shaping a much larger energy future around AI’s needs.

We’re taking a different approach with an accounting meant to inform the many decisions still ahead: where data centers go, what powers them, and how to make the growing toll of AI visible and accountable.

ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X.

That’s because despite the ambitious AI vision set forth by tech companies, utility providers, and the federal government, details of how this future might come about are murky. Scientists, federally funded research facilities, activists, and energy companies argue that leading AI companies and data center operators disclose too little about their activities. Companies building and deploying AI models are largely quiet when it comes to answering a central question: Just how much energy does interacting with one of these models use? And what sorts of energy sources will power AI’s future?

This leaves even those whose job it is to predict energy demands forced to assemble a puzzle with countless missing pieces, making it nearly impossible to plan for AI’s future impact on energy grids and emissions. Worse, the deals that utility companies make with the data centers will likely transfer the costs of the AI revolution to the rest of us, in the form of higher electricity bills.

It’s a lot to take in. To describe the big picture of what that future looks like, we have to start at the beginning.

Part Two: A Query

If you’ve seen a few charts estimating the energy impact of putting a question to an AI model, you might think it’s like measuring a car’s fuel economy or a dishwasher’s energy rating: a knowable value with a shared methodology for calculating it. You’d be wrong.

In reality, the type and size of the model, the type of output you’re generating, and countless variables beyond your control—like which energy grid is connected to the data center your request is sent to and what time of day it’s processed—can make one query thousands of times more energy-intensive and emissions-producing than another.

And when you query most AI models, whether on your phone within an app like Instagram or on the web interface for ChatGPT, much of what happens after your question is routed to a data center remains a secret. Factors like which data center in the world processes your request, how much energy it takes to do so, and how carbon-intensive the energy sources used are tend to be knowable only to the companies that run the models.

This is true for most of the name-brand models you’re accustomed to, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude, which are referred to as “closed.” The key details are held closely by the companies that make them, guarded because they’re viewed as trade secrets (and also possibly because they might result in bad PR). These companies face few incentives to release this information, and so far they have not.

“The closed AI model providers are serving up a total black box,” says Boris Gamazaychikov, head of AI sustainability at Salesforce, who has led efforts with researchers at Hugging Face, an AI platform provider of tools, models, and libraries for individuals and companies, to make AI’s energy demands more transparent. Without more disclosure from companies, it’s not just that we don’t have good estimates—we have little to go on at all.

Without more disclosure from companies, it’s not just that we don’t have good estimates—we have little to go on at all.

So where can we turn for estimates? So-called open-source models can be downloaded and tweaked by researchers, who can access special tools to measure how much energy the H100 GPU requires for a given task. Such models are also incredibly popular; Meta announced in April that its Llama models have been downloaded more than 1.2 billion times, and many companies use open-source models when they want more control over outputs than they can get using something like ChatGPT.

But even if researchers can measure the power drawn by the GPU, that leaves out the power used up by CPUs, fans, and other equipment. A 2024 paper by Microsoft analyzed energy efficiencies for inferencing large language models and found that doubling the amount of energy used by the GPU gives an approximate estimate of the entire operation’s energy demands.

So for now, measuring leading open-source models (and adding estimates for all these other pieces) gives us the best picture we have of just how much energy is being used for a single AI query. However, keep in mind that the ways people use AI today—to write a grocery list or create a surrealist video—are far simpler than the ones we’ll use in the autonomous, agentic future that AI companies are hurling us toward. More on that later.

Here’s what we found.

Text models

Let’s start with models where you type a question and receive back a response in words. One of the leading groups evaluating the energy demands of AI is at the University of Michigan, led by PhD candidate Jae-Won Chung and associate professor Mosharaf Chowdhury. We worked with the team to focus on the energy demands of one of the most widely adopted open-source models, Meta’s Llama.

The smallest model in our Llama cohort, Llama 3.1 8B, has 8 billion parameters—essentially the adjustable “knobs” in an AI model that allow it to make predictions. When tested on a variety of different text-generating prompts, like making a travel itinerary for Istanbul or explaining quantum computing, the model required about 57 joules per response, or an estimated 114 joules when accounting for cooling, other computations, and other demands. This is tiny—about what it takes to ride six feet on an e-bike, or run a microwave for one-tenth of a second.

The largest of our text-generation cohort, Llama 3.1 405B, has 50 times more parameters. More parameters generally means better answers but more energy required for each response. On average, this model needed 3,353 joules, or an estimated 6,706 joules total, for each response. That’s enough to carry a person about 400 feet on an e-bike or run the microwave for eight seconds.

Part Three: Fuel and emissions

Now that we have an estimate of the total energy required to run an AI model to produce text, images, and videos, we can work out what that means in terms of emissions that cause climate change.

First, a data center humming away isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If all data centers were hooked up to solar panels and ran only when the sun was shining, the world would be talking a lot less about AI’s energy consumption. That’s not the case. Most electrical grids around the world are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. So electricity use comes with a climate toll attached.

“AI data centers need constant power, 24-7, 365 days a year,” says Rahul Mewawalla, the CEO of Mawson Infrastructure Group, which builds and maintains high-energy data centers that support AI.

That means data centers can’t rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity. One preprint study from Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average. Part of the reason is that data centers currently happen to be clustered in places that have dirtier grids on average, like the coal-heavy grid in the mid-Atlantic region that includes Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. They also run constantly, including when cleaner sources may not be available.

Data centers can’t rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity.

Tech companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google have responded to this fossil fuel issue by announcing goals to use more nuclear power. Those three have joined a pledge to triple the world’s nuclear capacity by 2050. But today, nuclear energy only accounts for 20% of electricity supply in the US, and powers a fraction of AI data centers’ operations—natural gas accounts for more than half of electricity generated in Virginia, which has more data centers than any other US state, for example. What’s more, new nuclear operations will take years, perhaps decades, to materialize.

In 2024, fossil fuels including natural gas and coal made up just under 60% of electricity supply in the US. Nuclear accounted for about 20%, and a mix of renewables accounted for most of the remaining 20%.

Gaps in power supply, combined with the rush to build data centers to power AI, often mean shortsighted energy plans. In April, Elon Musk’s X supercomputing center near Memphis was found, via satellite imagery, to be using dozens of methane gas generators that the Southern Environmental Law Center alleges are not approved by energy regulators to supplement grid power and are violating the Clean Air Act.

The key metric used to quantify the emissions from these data centers is called the carbon intensity: how many grams of carbon dioxide emissions are produced for each kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed. Nailing down the carbon intensity of a given grid requires understanding the emissions produced by each individual power plant in operation, along with the amount of energy each is contributing to the grid at any given time. Utilities, government agencies, and researchers use estimates of average emissions, as well as real-time measurements, to track pollution from power plants.

This intensity varies widely across regions. The US grid is fragmented, and the mixes of coal, gas, renewables, or nuclear vary widely. California’s grid is far cleaner than West Virginia’s, for example.

Time of day matters too. For instance, data from April 2024 shows that California’s grid can swing from under 70 grams per kilowatt-hour in the afternoon when there’s a lot of solar power available to over 300 grams per kilowatt-hour in the middle of the night.

This variability means that the same activity may have very different climate impacts, depending on your location and the time you make a request. Take that charity marathon runner, for example. The text, image, and video responses they requested add up to 2.9 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In California, generating that amount of electricity would produce about 650 grams of carbon dioxide pollution on average. But generating that electricity in West Virginia might inflate the total to more than 1,150 grams.

AI around the corner

What we’ve seen so far is that the energy required to respond to a query can be relatively small, but it can vary a lot, depending on the type of query and the model being used. The emissions associated with that given amount of electricity will also depend on where and when a query is handled. But what does this all add up to?

ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. In December, OpenAI said that ChatGPT receives 1 billion messages every day, and after the company launched a new image generator in March, it said that people were using it to generate 78 million images per day, from Studio Ghibli–style portraits to pictures of themselves as Barbie dolls.

Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it’s likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be.

One can do some very rough math to estimate the energy impact. In February the AI research firm Epoch AI published an estimate of how much energy is used for a single ChatGPT query—an estimate that, as discussed, makes lots of assumptions that can’t be verified. Still, they calculated about 0.3 watt-hours, or 1,080 joules, per message. This falls in between our estimates for the smallest and largest Meta Llama models (and experts we consulted say that if anything, the real number is likely higher, not lower).

One billion of these every day for a year would mean over 109 gigawatt-hours of electricity, enough to power 10,400 US homes for a year. If we add images and imagine that generating each one requires as much energy as it does with our high-quality image models, it’d mean an additional 35 gigawatt-hours, enough to power another 3,300 homes for a year. This is on top of the energy demands of OpenAI’s other products, like video generators, and that for all the other AI companies and startups.

But here’s the problem: These estimates don’t capture the near future of how we’ll use AI. In that future, we won’t simply ping AI models with a question or two throughout the day, or have them generate a photo. Instead, leading labs are racing us toward a world where AI “agents” perform tasks for us without our supervising their every move. We will speak to models in voice mode, chat with companions for 2 hours a day, and point our phone cameras at our surroundings in video mode. We will give complex tasks to so-called “reasoning models” that work through tasks logically but have been found to require 43 times more energy for simple problems, or “deep research” models that spend hours creating reports for us. We will have AI models that are “personalized” by training on our data and preferences.

This future is around the corner: OpenAI will reportedly offer agents for $20,000 per month and will use reasoning capabilities in all of its models moving forward, and DeepSeek catapulted “chain of thought” reasoning into the mainstream with a model that often generates nine pages of text for each response. AI models are being added to everything from customer service phone lines to doctor’s offices, rapidly increasing AI’s share of national energy consumption.

“The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni.

Every researcher we spoke to said that we cannot understand the energy demands of this future by simply extrapolating from the energy used in AI queries today. And indeed, the moves by leading AI companies to fire up nuclear power plants and create data centers of unprecedented scale suggest that their vision for the future would consume far more energy than even a large number of these individual queries.

“The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni. “Generative AI tools are getting practically shoved down our throats and it’s getting harder and harder to opt out, or to make informed choices when it comes to energy and climate.”

To understand how much power this AI revolution will need, and where it will come from, we have to read between the lines.

Part four: The future ahead

A report published in December by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is funded by the Department of Energy and has produced 16 Nobel Prizes, attempted to measure what AI’s proliferation might mean for energy demand.

In analyzing both public and proprietary data about data centers as a whole, as well as the specific needs of AI, the researchers came to a clear conclusion. Data centers in the US used somewhere around 200 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, roughly what it takes to power Thailand for a year. AI-specific servers in these data centers are estimated to have used between 53 and 76 terawatt-hours of electricity. On the high end, this is enough to power more than 7.2 million US homes for a year.

If we imagine the bulk of that was used for inference, it means enough electricity was used on AI in the US last year for every person on Earth to have exchanged more than 4,000 messages with chatbots. In reality, of course, average individual users aren’t responsible for all this power demand. Much of it is likely going toward startups and tech giants testing their models, power users exploring every new feature, and energy-heavy tasks like generating videos or avatars.

Data centers in the US used somewhere around 200 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, roughly what it takes to power Thailand for a year.

By 2028, the researchers estimate, the power going to AI-specific purposes will rise to between 165 and 326 terawatt-hours per year. That’s more than all electricity currently used by US data centers for all purposes; it’s enough to power 22% of US households each year. That could generate the same emissions as driving over 300 billion miles—over 1,600 round trips to the sun from Earth.

The researchers were clear that adoption of AI and the accelerated server technologies that power it has been the primary force causing electricity demand from data centers to skyrocket after remaining stagnant for over a decade. Between 2024 and 2028, the share of US electricity going to data centers may triple, from its current 4.4% to 12%.

This unprecedented surge in power demand for AI is in line with what leading companies are announcing. SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and the Emirati investment firm MGX intend to spend $500 billion in the next four years on new data centers in the US. The first has started construction in Abilene, Texas, and includes eight buildings that are each the size of a baseball stadium. In response to a White House request for information, Anthropic suggested that the US build an additional 50 gigawatts of dedicated power by 2027.

AI companies are also planning multi-gigawatt constructions abroad, including in Malaysia, which is becoming Southeast Asia’s data center hub. In May OpenAI announced a plan to support data-center buildouts abroad as part of a bid to “spread democratic AI.” Companies are taking a scattershot approach to getting there—inking deals for new nuclear plants, firing up old ones, and striking massive deals with utility companies.

MIT Technology Review sought interviews with Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft about their plans for this future, and for specific figures on the energy required to inference leading AI models. OpenAI declined to provide figures or make anyone available for an interview but provided a statement saying that it prioritizes efficient use of computing resources and collaborates with partners to support sustainability goals, and that AI might help discover climate solutions. The company said early sites for its Stargate initiative will be natural gas and solar powered and that the company will look to include nuclear and geothermal wherever possible.

Microsoft discussed its own research on improving AI efficiencies but declined to share specifics of how these approaches are incorporated into its data centers.

Google declined to share numbers detailing how much energy is required at inference time for its AI models like Gemini and features like AI Overviews. The company pointed to information about its TPUs—Google’s proprietary equivalent of GPUs—and the efficiencies they’ve gained.

The Lawrence Berkeley researchers offered a blunt critique of where things stand, saying that the information disclosed by tech companies, data center operators, utility companies, and hardware manufacturers is simply not enough to make reasonable projections about the unprecedented energy demands of this future or estimate the emissions it will create. They offered ways that companies could disclose more information without violating trade secrets, such as anonymized data-sharing arrangements, but their report acknowledged that the architects of this massive surge in AI data centers have thus far not been transparent, leaving them without the tools to make a plan.

“Along with limiting the scope of this report, this lack of transparency highlights that data center growth is occurring with little consideration for how best to integrate these emergent loads with the expansion of electricity generation/transmission or for broader community development,” they wrote. The authors also noted that only two other reports of this kind have been released in the last 20 years.

We heard from several other researchers who say that their ability to understand the emissions and energy demands of AI are hampered by the fact that AI is not yet treated as its own sector. The US Energy Information Administration, for example, makes projections and measurements for manufacturing, mining, construction, and agriculture, but detailed data about AI is simply nonexistent.

“Why should we be paying for this infrastructure? Why should we be paying for their power bills?”

Individuals may end up footing some of the bill for this AI revolution, according to new research published in March. The researchers, from Harvard’s Electricity Law Initiative, analyzed agreements between utility companies and tech giants like Meta that govern how much those companies will pay for power in massive new data centers. They found that discounts utility companies give to Big Tech can raise the electricity rates paid by consumers. In some cases, if certain data centers fail to attract the promised AI business or need less power than expected, ratepayers could still be on the hook for subsidizing them. A 2024 report from the Virginia legislature estimated that average residential ratepayers in the state could pay an additional $37.50 every month in data center energy costs.

“It’s not clear to us that the benefits of these data centers outweigh these costs,” says Eliza Martin, a legal fellow at the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard and a coauthor of the research. “Why should we be paying for this infrastructure? Why should we be paying for their power bills?”

When you ask an AI model to write you a joke or generate a video of a puppy, that query comes with a small but measurable energy toll and an associated amount of emissions spewed into the atmosphere. Given that each individual request often uses less energy than running a kitchen appliance for a few moments, it may seem insignificant.

But as more of us turn to AI tools, these impacts start to add up. And increasingly, you don’t need to go looking to use AI: It’s being integrated into every corner of our digital lives.

Crucially, there’s a lot we don’t know; tech giants are largely keeping quiet about the details. But to judge from our estimates, it’s clear that AI is a force reshaping not just technology but the power grid and the world around us.

We owe a special thanks to Jae-Won Chung, Mosharaf Chowdhury, and Sasha Luccioni, who shared their measurements of AI’s energy use for this project.

Have you been curious about purchasing an electric vehicle or an electric bike? Or, maybe you’ve heard about the instant torque of EVs and e-bikes and want to test it out for yourself?

Well, mark your calendars for the upcoming EV Ride ‘n Drive and E-Bike Demo , a hands-on celebration of electric mobility and climate action that puts you in the driver’s seat of the clean energy transition. This year’s EV Ride ‘n Drive and E-Bike Demo will be on Sunday, June 1, from 2-6 p.m. at the Brush Creek Pavilion in Eagle. This event is put on in partnership with Walking Mountains and the Climate Action Collaborative , Clean Energy Economy for the Region , and the town of Eagle .

Whether you’re EV-curious or already dreaming of trading gas for green, this event is your chance to experience the thrill of EVs and e-bikes. With knowledgeable community experts on hand and a local fleet of various EV models, attendees can test drive a wide range of EVs, from zippy compacts to spacious SUVs, and hop on an e-bike for a pedal-assisted ride around downtown Eagle.

The e-bike demo will be supported by several local e-bike shops across Eagle County, and four lucky event participants will have the chance to win a $150 gift card from one of the participating e-bike shops. Even more, this event will include food, live music, an EV 101 workshop, and an e-bike maintenance station!

While this event will bring family fun for everyone, it’s also primarily about action. Every electric mile driven or ridden is a small victory for cleaner air, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a more sustainable transportation future.

We’re fortunate to have Holy Cross Energy as our primary electric utility in Eagle County, which also happens to be a sponsor of this event. Holy Cross Energy has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy to the electricity grid by 2030, and we’re eager to share that they’re well on their way to achieving this goal. In Eagle County, the transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to carbon pollution, and shifting to electric forms of transportation is one of the most impactful moves we can make, individually and collectively.

Perhaps you’re skeptical about the environmental impact of EVs, and if they’re really all that better than a gas-powered vehicle. First and foremost, the cleaner the electricity used to power the EV, the fewer overall emissions will come from the life cycle of the EV.

In 2023, Holy Cross Energy’s power supply was 50% renewable. The Bronco Plains II Wind Project, which came online in 2024, has raised its renewable portfolio by nearly 25%, meaning that in 2024, our electric utility’s power supply mix was nearly 75% renewably powered. Additionally, EVs are simply more efficient and less wasteful than their gas counterparts. Today’s gasoline-fueled cars waste around 80% of the energy that gets pumped into their gas tanks, due to heat loss and thermodynamics.

EVs, on the other hand, operate with 10 % to 20% energy loss, converting most of the energy put into them into movement. Beyond these essential points, it’s important to consider that EVs don’t idle with air-polluting emissions, and they have regenerative braking that captures energy when slowing down. All to say, even if you aren’t driven by the environmental impact, the efficiency and operational cost savings of an EV should surely spark your interest.

If you leave this event awe-inspired to purchase an EV or e-bike, don’t miss out on the great incentives available for doing so! Consider the following:

Holy Cross Energy e-bike and EV charging rebates

Energy Smart Colorado rebates are administered through Walking Mountains, for EVs and EV chargers

The State of Colorado’s EV tax credit and e-bike tax credit

Federal government clean vehicle tax credits

So, whether you’re a local community member looking for a day of fun, a commuter tired of gas prices, a tech enthusiast, or in the market for a new vehicle, the EV Ride ‘n Drive and E-Bike Demo has something for everyone. The road ahead is electric, and everyone’s invited.

Two of the most contentious issues now awaiting votes would have particularly heavy impacts on California.

One pending measure would cancel, or at least try to cancel, California’s long-standing waiver of federal clean air rules that allows the state to impose tighter restrictions on emissions. More specifically, legislation that passed the House of Representatives — with support from several dozen Democrats — is pending in the Senate and would undermine California’s decree that no new gasoline-powered cars could be sold in the state after 2035.

Another issue is whether a $10,000 cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes on federal tax returns, passed in 2017 during Trump’s first stint as president, will remain in force, be repealed or be altered.

It has the effect of raising federal levies on taxpayers in states with high income tax rates, such as California, and is seen by leaders of those states as punitive. When the cap was enacted, California tax authorities estimated that it would cost Californians another $12 billion a year.

When the House voted a few weeks ago to cancel California’s Clean Air Act waiver — and those of other states that have followed its lead — Gov. Gavin Newsom cried foul, contending that the action illegally invoked the Congressional Review Act.

“Trump Republicans are hellbent on making California smoggy again,” Newsom said in a statement. “Clean air didn’t used to be political. In fact, we can thank Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon for our decades-old authority to clean our air.

“The only thing that’s changed is that big polluters and the right-wing propaganda machine have succeeded in buying off the Republican Party — and now the House is using a tactic that the Senate’s own parliamentarian has said is lawless.”

During his first presidency, Trump tried to cancel California’s waiver but failed. The nation’s automakers, although displeased by the 2035 decree, didn’t back Trump’s move.

That was then and this is now. Sales of zero emission vehicles, which were booming a few years ago, have flattened. California had contended that 35% of new vehicle sales in California would be zero emission cars by 2025, but purchases seem to be stuck at about 25%. Major automakers, such as General Motors, now contend that the 2035 mandate is unrealistic.

On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared that the chamber would soon vote on the waiver, indicating that he has the votes, and it could garner support from some Democrats, as it did in the House. Its passage probably would touch off a legal battle.

The aforementioned deductibility of state and local taxes, dubbed SALT by the issue’s political warriors, is less settled.

“The SALT deduction has become an outsize stumbling block for Republicans trying to pass a $3.8 trillion tax proposal that would extend President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and roll back subsidies for clean energy, among other things,” the New York Times reported last week.

“A group of Republican House members, mostly from New York, New Jersey and California, have vowed to vote no on the package unless the cap, which helped pay for the 2017 cuts and expires this year, is raised or abolished. And even among the holdouts, there is dissension — something that drew attention … during a Republican caucus meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson.”

The issue cuts across party lines, pitting legislators from the most affected states against mostly red states that are largely unaffected. While Trump apparently wants to keep the $10,000 cap, the possibility of raising it, perhaps to $30,000, is kicking around. The issue remains deadlocked.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/022724_EV-Chargers-LA_CC_CM_29.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-21 07:08:11.340516

PLANO, Texas — The top-selling SUV in the United States will exclusively be offered as a hybrid model as part of a redesign of the RAV4 lineup, Toyota Motor announced Tuesday night.

The world's largest automaker said the 2026 Toyota RAV4 only will be offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, eliminating a traditional gas engine in the vehicle for the first time. It will still have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, but with hybrid technologies such as batteries and electric motors.

Despite a slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, automakers have looked to hybrid models — which combine electric vehicle technologies with traditional internal combustion engines — to increase performance and help them meet fuel economy regulations.

Toyota, which started offering hybrids with the Toyota Prius in late 1990s, has been a global leader and advocate for hybrid adoption, despite an industry push in recent years for automakers to exclusively offer all-electric vehicles.

Toyota's electrified vehicle sales in the U.S. — including hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles — accounted for 43.1% of the company's 2.3 million units sold domestically in 2024.

Toyota

RAV4 sales increased 9.3% last year to nearly 475,200 units sold, including a 29.3% increase in RAV4 hybrids and 19.3% gain in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Roughly half of RAV4 sales last year were hybrids.

Sales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models reached a record 20% of new car and truck sales in the U.S. last year, to 3.2 million electrified vehicles, according to auto data firm Motor Intelligence. That encompasses 1.9 million hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, and 1.3 million all-electric models.

Hybrid-only

David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said the company decided to exclusively offer the RAV4 as a hybrid because of its already established popularity and growing customer demand.

""The hybrid is faster turning; it has more sales orders on it, and the consumers and dealers are asking for it,"" he told CNBC Tuesday during an event at the automaker's North American headquarters. ""It was pretty clear that the consumer is voting for the hybrid.""

Christ said the automaker expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, including additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicle offerings.

Seven of Toyota's current vehicles are exclusively hybrid models, including the Camry and Prius cars, Sienna minivan and Sequoia SUV. RAV4 will be the eighth.

Toyota

RAV4 hybrids accounted for 44% of sales last year, Toyota reported, while plug-in models — which offer all-electric ranges with a traditional engine that needs to be plugged in — were 6.5%.

The redesigned RAV4 is set to go on sale at U.S. Toyota dealerships in later this year. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign of the vehicle that included interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to the vehicle's performance and technologies.

The company declined to disclose pricing until closer to the vehicle's launch. The current RAV4 starts at $30,645. The hybrid variant starts at about $33,700. Pricing includes mandatory delivery fees.

The RAV4 has steadily increased sales since its U.S. introduction for the 1996 model year. Last year's sales of the vehicle increased 9.3% year-over-year to a new record — making it the best-selling non-pickup nameplate in the U.S. last year.

Tariffs

The RAV4 faces new challenges this year with President Donald Trump's ongoing tariffs of 25% on vehicles imported into the U.S., as well as many auto parts.

Toyota produces the RAV4 at a plant in Kentucky, but a majority of its U.S. sales come from vehicles built at a plant in Ontario, Canada. It currently exclusively imports plug-in hybrid models for U.S. consumers from Japan.

Roughly half of Toyota's U.S. sales are imported from outside of the U.S., including 84.3% of RAV4 models, as well as its popular Tacoma midsize pickup truck from Mexico.

Toyota

Mark Templin, chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, said the company plans to produce more RAV4 models at its Kentucky plant, but declined to offer specific plans for potential changes in production to mitigate tariffs.

""It'll work its way out. I think we'll build more RAV4s in Kentucky, which will help. But that's such a big volume car. … It was the No. 1 selling vehicle in the entire market, even beating out the F-150,"" he told CNBC. ""Now we're bringing out one that's even better than that car.

Cox Automotive reports the RAV4 finished third in sales last year behind the Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado truck models, which include several variants. However, other third-party data firms have said the RAV4 topped sales of the Detroit pickups last year when breaking out the models, such as the Ford F-150 from the larger group.

Toyota's days' supply — an adjusted number based on the rate of sales — has been among the lowest in the automotive industry, especially for the RAV4.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked.
""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""
Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car.
In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments.","Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

Some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, are considering repealing the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy incentives. Supporters of the measure say cuts would threaten jobs in Alaska. The efforts come as Alaska's liquid natural gas supplies will not be enough to meet demand in the state. That means the state may have to begin importing gas causing prices to rise.

Jennifer Hyde, federal infrastructure coordinator at the Alaska Center, hoped clean energy projects could begin benefitting the state before the crisis takes hold.

""We're hoping that communities can seize on IRA funds in order to actualize on solar projects, on wind projects, on hydro projects, on a number of other alternatives before this crisis happens,"" she explained.

Begich and other Republicans signed a letter arguing that the clean energy subsidies in the IRA will undermine America's energy dominance - and inflate energy costs. But Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has supported the clean energy incentives.

Anchorage business owner Ben Kellie is concerned about the impacts of the possible repeal of clean energy incentives on Alaska's economy, and said the incentives can mean major savings for Alaska families.

""This isn't just saving a few cents off of a bill. A lot of these projects are in communities where people are paying over a thousand dollars to heat and light small homes off the road system,"" Kellie said. ""This is real money that not only stays in the community and circulates, but helps families make ends meet through cold winters.""

In 2023, about a quarter of all Alaska energy came from renewable sources.

A bill before Indiana legislators that would have prevented city officials from requesting energy information from large commercial buildings failed in this year's legislative session.

One nonprofit believes if Senate Bill 197/House Bill 1389 had become law, Hoosiers would have faced higher utility bills. The Thriving Buildings Program relies on utility usage data gathered between 2021 and 2025 to help lower utility bills.

Paula Brooks, justice director for the nonprofit Hoosier Environmental Council, said conversations between community stakeholders, public officials and residents about building environments are key to the program's success.

""It gave building owners the opportunity to benchmark -- which is, make comparisons of their energy and water usage -- to be able to identify ways to save money on utility costs and most importantly, improve the air quality, reduce carbon emissions,"" she explained.

A building environment consists of building and construction materials and is a major contributor to global gas emissions. With the program's collected data, it is predicted that public health savings in Indianapolis could reach $77 million by 2030. Indianapolis is responsible for 66% of community-wide greenhouse gas emissions.

Brooks applauds the Thriving Buildings Program because residents feel their voices are being heard as their communities develop. But these voices also oppose President Donald Trump's recent executive orders to build more coal plants to boost electricity generation, and to ensure the EPA is assisting in promoting America's energy security.

Brooks believes there is another alternative to using coal as a power source.

""Renewables is not only the future, but it's happening now. This distribution model that we have now, where the energy companies hold all the power, it's only about 75 years old,"" she continued.

Renewable energy creates opportunities to look at new energy delivery models or ""energy democracy,"" with solar for microgrids. So, rather than having a huge power plant somewhere, she noted, the electricity could be in a community and owned by the community, while contributing to the electric generation for industrial use.

A new report from the Ohio River Valley Institute argued the oil and gas industry, not taxpayers, should cover the cost of plugging up hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil wells across Appalachia.

Plugging wells in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia could cost nearly $40 billion, with most of the burden coming from shale wells.

Dwayne Purvis, founder and principal consultant at Purvis Energy Advisors in Fort Worth, Texas, and co-author of the report, said he analyzed the Ohio River Valley along with other states, finding old shale wells are often unable to fund their own decommissioning.

""Of course, there are some shale wells are getting older and depleting, producing at slower rates, and even some that are shut in or marginal,"" Purvis explained. ""What we did in this study that was new for the first time, was to offer ideas on how financial assurance reform can address this disparity.""

Purvis pointed out there are currently more than 265,000 unplugged non-shale wells across the three states too, many of which also pose environmental risks. He added hundreds of thousands more were plugged decades ago but often to outdated standards, meaning they may still leak.

Purvis noted the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law jump-started efforts to plug oil wells but the funding was never meant to be permanent. He contended operators should pay for decommissioning the wells but acknowledged many cannot afford to do it.

""The next best option is what we've offered, that it needs to come from, the money for decommissioning, needs to come from other companies in the oil and gas business, who do have the income necessary to cover the liabilities of the industry as a whole in order to protect the public,"" Purvis outlined.

According to the report in the three states studied, Purvis' proposal would directly increase oil and gas employment by an estimated 32% and create more than 19,000 new jobs.

“There’s a lot that can be done to revitalize West Virginia,” he told me last fall.
West Virginia therefore faces a dire economic situation, with a poverty rate well above the national average, falling life expectancy, and a declining population.
In Ravenswood, West Virginia, BHE Renewables had broken ground on a 2,000-acre project.
He shirked child support, and without her solar job, she couldn’t have afforded her son’s school supplies or doctor visits.","Nine months ago, Marqees, 42, began a training program for adults facing employment barriers and felt energized about his future. His program in Huntington, West Virginia—once dubbed “America’s drug death capital” —was preparing people for careers in solar, and Marqees felt drawn to projects on abandoned mine lands. Though his father worked in coal, the national coal miner workforce has fallen from 900,000 in 1923 to about 40,000 today. West Virginia has fewer than 4,500 such positions.

Drug probation had taken Marqees from McDowell County, West Virginia, to Huntington, where he completed rehabilitation and entered transitional housing. McDowell is the poorest county in the state, and one of the most remote. It has lost 83 percent of its population since 1950. Marqees described the people still there as “those who couldn’t afford to leave.” Securing a spot in the training program felt like a promising first step toward a sustainable future in the new green economy.

West Virginia might not seem like a probable place for a solar boom. Coal still generates 86 percent of its electricity, more than any other state, but modern businesses demand renewable power—if for no other reason than it’s typically cheaper. In Huntington, Marqees was learning construction techniques to qualify as a solar installer. “There’s a lot that can be done to revitalize West Virginia,” he told me last fall. “I’m ready to build.”

The Inflation Reduction Act gave federal agencies financial tools to help communities eliminate environmental hazards on abandoned mine sites and spur clean-energy production.

Until January, the Inflation Reduction Act directed clean-energy investment to regions tied to fossil fuels. While large-scale solar carries risks from price shifts and permitting hurdles, new tax credits increased returns to investment, and major developments gained traction. The credits also made the shift to residential solar more attractive to homeowners.

“We can move on from coal,” Marqees said. “Coal was never good for miners.” He saw how coal companies stripped value from his motherland and people. “Everything in McDowell died, leaving no jobs, no hope, no nothing. And it’s been like: What can I do? Where do I fit in? That’s why I’m glad to be in my program.” His training organization had partnerships with solar developers hiring legions of workers to construct new installations. Most relied on the federal incentives.

On his first day back in office, President Trump signed an executive order suspending the funding. With most of the money going to places that voted for him in 2024, the loss of clean-energy incentives hit red states hardest.

With green investment canceled, paused, or at best uncertain, Marqees’s plans quickly unraveled. He left his program and returned to McDowell County, where adult labor force participation falls below 30 percent.

MOST COAL JOBS DISAPPEARED before the 1990s due to automation. Methods like strip mining and mountaintop removal required far fewer workers than traditional mining. Today, cheaper natural gas and renewables are simply driving it out of the market. Twenty years ago, coal accounted for about half of American electricity; today, as of 2023 it was 16 percent and falling fast. West Virginia therefore faces a dire economic situation, with a poverty rate well above the national average, falling life expectancy, and a declining population. When mines close with nothing to replace them, entire communities suffer as jobs vanish and spending falls. Lower tax revenues shrink public services. Local utilities have also passed the high costs of coal plants on to consumers, raising electricity rates.

The EPA has long backed solar development on former mine lands, especially closed mountaintop removal sites, which otherwise persist as devastated wastelands. Unremediated, the locations can leach toxins and emit methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Conversely, the sites often offer roads and transmission lines useful to renewable-energy generation. Reclaiming mined land, however, entails dealing with acid mine drainage, uneven high walls in the terrain, and contaminated soil, as coal company bonds haven’t covered the cost of repairing all the damage.

Cost-benefit concerns had stalled redevelopment until the IRA tipped the scales. The legislation gave federal agencies financial tools to help communities eliminate environmental hazards on abandoned mine sites and spur clean-energy production there. Then-Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) cast the deciding vote, insisting on fossil fuel support in the bill, but signaling West Virginia’s need to begin moving on from coal.

With the boost from the IRA, a trickle of renewable-energy plans grew into a flood of projects for old energy communities like Marqees’s. In 2022, a developer gained approval to build solar on two former West Virginia mines, creating over 300 construction jobs and powering 90,000 homes. The plans included a workforce center to retrain miners for renewable-energy positions. Construction was slated for spring 2026.

In lower-income neighborhoods, residential rooftop solar was previously far out of reach, due to high costs, but the IRA funded programs to ensure low-income West Virginians benefited. Over 3,000 residents installed panels, supporting hundreds of jobs, with more growth expected. Schools and churches were preparing to go solar.

Then Trump won. Alas, the very structure of the Biden-era legislation made it vulnerable. Unlike traditional government programs with up-front appropriations, the IRA used tax incentives to quietly rewire the economy by making clean-energy projects more profitable than fossil fuels. It was policy by encouragement, not mandate. Any whiff of repeal or reduction would send investors scrambling.

After the presidential election, Trump and other Republican leaders began targeting green-energy spending as bloated and ideologically driven, despite the fact that red regions like McDowell County—which Trump won by almost 60 percentage points—collected the vast majority of the benefits. In Ravenswood, West Virginia, BHE Renewables had broken ground on a 2,000-acre project. Almost immediately after Trump took office, talk of delays circulated. More companies that had made bold moves under the promise of stable federal policy began reconsidering the viability of their commitments. Residential projects in West Virginia were also floundering. A trainer mobilizing the solar construction workforce described his efforts as “terminated.”

LIKE MARQEES, ALISON, from outside Huntington, had unexpectedly begun to see a future for herself in solar. After dropping out of high school, she worked in retail, without stability or benefits, and married young. One Fourth of July, she spotted a Facebook ad for a program that prepared women for skilled trade apprenticeships. “What do I have to lose?” she thought. “I could just submit an application.”

Within a week, Alison began learning technical skills and also about herself. “The confidence boost was huge,” she said. “You can build a whole wrong idea about who you are based on the situation you’re in.”

The program required Alison to complete a job shadow, which she did at a local residential solar company. When she climbed a roof and saw a shed below plastered with pro-coal slogans, she judged the energy transition well under way. She gained experience in panel installation and project management and was offered roles in both. Project management provided a flexible schedule, stable income, generous benefits, and time to supervise her child’s homeschooling.

Soon after, Alison divorced her husband. He shirked child support, and without her solar job, she couldn’t have afforded her son’s school supplies or doctor visits. She felt grateful for her freedom. Her confidence and stability continued to grow. “When I see solar panels,” she said, “I feel proud to play a part in them. I don’t ever want to do other work.”

A FEW YEARS AGO, Lee, from Putnam County, bought a solar startup. Not long before, he hadn’t known solar existed in West Virginia.

Lee had worked for the county park system, where he performed the occasional electrical job, though he lacked professional licenses. When an inspector noticed, the park system paid for Lee to return to school. In night classes, he learned about circuits and maintenance, and familiarized himself with building codes.

When he completed the program, Lee saw an ad for an installation position at a residential solar company. It seemed like an interesting opportunity. He applied and got the job, then quickly learned what he needed to know. The tasks didn’t seem complicated. Turning on solar systems from his phone felt thrilling, and he enjoyed traveling to varied job sites.

Before long, Lee installed solar at his own house, saving $70 a month as electricity rates climbed. Others saw the same potential, and Lee’s installations picked up pace.

Lee joined another startup aiming for larger projects. Soon the company put the largest construction outfit in the state on solar, with 1,200 panels. Seeing opportunity solarizing schools and libraries, the construction firm acquired the startup. As the landscape at the federal level threatened to change, however, the construction company’s executives moved to shutter their new solar subsidiary.

Lee decided to buy the solar firm himself and paid with credit card debt. But the factors motivating the construction executives to divest from solar have only grown stronger.

In addition to the loss of Biden-era incentives, the developing trade war has led to a sense of panic in the renewables industry. Though solar costs fell more than 80 percent between 2009 and 2024, panel prices rose ahead of new Trump tariffs, echoing earlier trade barriers. 2018 taxes on imported solar panels had caused job losses and market disruption.

While the Biden administration left some of those levies in place, it paired them with subsidies for domestic clean-energy manufacturing now on the chopping block. The IRA gave panel buyers 30 percent tax credits for U.S.-made equipment. In two years, solar module production nearly quadrupled, and the U.S. became almost self-sufficient in panel production. But American solar panel makers continued to rely on other imported components—ones subject to Trump’s latest tariffs. Building just one new production facility would cost over $10 million and take time to certify. Meanwhile, increases in solar energy prices threaten existing distribution and installation positions in the domestic solar sector.

Lee had planned to partner with a state organization helping people with barriers to employment to double his installation staff. Knowing how to use tools, read a tape measure, and do basic math was sufficient to pick up the remaining skills on the job. Now he has frozen hiring, and keeping the firm afloat feels tenuous.

ON APRIL 8, as the S&P 500 hit its lowest level since President Trump started his global trade war, he signed an executive order to reinvigorate the coal industry. “We’re bringing back an industry that was abandoned,” he said. “We’re going to put the miners back to work.” The order proposed saving retiring coal plants and using emergency powers to boost output. Miners flanked the president in work gear in symbolic support.

Nearly simultaneously, however, the Trump administration slashed funding to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, limiting black lung prevention efforts. A rule to cut silica dust exposure limits stalled. Mine Safety office leases went under review. And the trade war prompted swift retaliation from China—15 percent tariffs on American coal and gas—with profound effects on West Virginia.

The White House had ignored the centrality of Chinese demand to remaining coal jobs. About half of West Virginia’s coal gets exported, supplying nearly half the U.S. metallurgical coal sold to China.

With the tariffs sparking debate about what American workers should be producing domestically, renewables seem to offer a smarter investment than coal. Even Chinese coal demand is falling fast, as the country embarks on a breakneck transition away from fossil fuels. Promises of the first Trump administration to revive the coal industry did not pan out; by the end of his term, the industry had fewer mining positions than when he took office. While the latest orders blamed coal job losses on regulation, the documents ignored the major economic shifts that have rendered coal increasingly uncompetitive, in addition to the danger and pollution.

ALISON’S SMALL-BUSINESS CLIENTS with federal funding for clean energy no longer knew whether the money would materialize, and some canceled projects. Alison still felt she had a future in the industry, if the political and economic turbulence abated, but she couldn’t foresee when that might happen.

Realistically, Alison understood some solar companies would fail, and other customers shared similar concerns. They were asking whether her firm would exist to service their systems.

Residential solar approvals took months, and cancellations stung when installations were ready to proceed. To Alison, energy was energy, and there was no need to play politics around the transition to a green economy.

Across town, a new curriculum for an associate’s degree in solar energy was moving forward, but one of the designers now worried about opportunities for graduates. He had already told 400 trainees their jobs installing mine-land solar might not start. He hoped solar technologies would eventually prevail.

In McDowell, Marqees attended a county commission town hall. “No one’s talking about solutions,” he said. To him, his neighbors’ presidential votes had reflected feeling unheard. He saw little improvement since. Before the meeting ended, he decided to challenge a political insider for mayor, on a platform of workforce training and future-oriented jobs. The election takes place this summer.",https://prospect.org/downloads/22899/download/Kirshner-WV%20green%20future%20052025.jpg?cb=9cce94d1501fe6233a8e9bb6a75422c0&w=1024,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:03.106629

Another New Jersey offshore wind project was recently halted after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the project's environmental permits.","In the last days of the Biden administration, the Energy Department dolled out billions of dollars for politically favored green energy projects. The Trump administration is looking to claw this funding back.

The Energy Department is getting ready to ""cancel seven major loans and loan guarantees that had been conditionally approved under the Biden administration,"" reports Semafor. This action will cancel approximately $5 billion worth of funding for a transmission project by a New Jersey utility company, a loan program for low-income homeowners to install rooftop solar panels by Sunnova, and a Monolith Nebraska factory to produce low-carbon ammonia. The remaining four projects, which collectively received over $3 billion, include three battery factories and a plastics and recycling facility, which ""were already previously cancelled by their companies because of other various headwinds,"" according to Semafor.

The three active projects that will have their federal loans axed have faced their own share of problems.

In September 2023, Sunnova received a $3 billion partial loan guarantee from the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office (LPO) for Project Hestia—a program that would make residential rooftop solar, battery storage, and virtual power plants ""available to more American homeowners."" Hestia was expected to provide loans to as many as 115,000 homeowners in the United States and Puerto Rico for these technologies, while creating ""3,400 good-paying, high-quality American jobs.""

After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova came under fire for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients, which led to subsequent congressional scrutiny. In April, Sunnova began filing for bankruptcy. The company recently said it was no longer planning to use the programming funding and was working with the Energy Department to return the remaining guarantees.

Monolith received a $953 million conditional loan guarantee from the LPO to accelerate its clean hydrogen and carbon utilization project in Nebraska. The company, which has received backing from BlackRock and NextEra Energy and was valued at over $1 billion in 2022, creates hydrogen fuel with renewable energy (which can be used to make ammonia in fertilizers) and carbon black. Despite the federal funding and private sector support, The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2024 that the company was ""running short on cash and facing project delays.""

The third project facing the ax is New Jersey's Clean Energy Corridor, ""a project to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate planned generation in New Jersey to meet growing electricity demand."" Run by Jersey Central Power & Light Company, the project received a conditional loan guarantee of up to $716 million in January to support the state's goal of ""introducing 11,000 MW of offshore wind-generated electricity by 2035."" When First Energy, which owns Jersey Central, first announced the project in 2022, Danish energy company Orsted was planning two large wind projects off New Jersey's coast. The projects were canceled in 2023. Another New Jersey offshore wind project was recently halted after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the project's environmental permits.

Despite these project cancellations and the LPO's history of questionable and risky investments, it does not appear that the office is going away soon; Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently told lawmakers that his agency would use the LPO to advance nuclear energy projects.

Assuming Wright fully cuts billions of dollars worth of wasteful projects and narrows the agency's scope to only fund nuclear power projects, it's possible that the LPO's budget—which ballooned to over $400 billion under the Biden administration—could meaningfully shrink.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/5-20-25-v4.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:07.161360

The latest generation of the RAV4 compact crossover available later this year comes equipped with a standard or plug-in hybrid powertrain, dropping the gas-powered option that makes up the bulk of current sales, the company said on Thursday (May 22). The move follows last year’s shift to an all-hybrid Camry sedan.

“The success overall that we have had with selling hybrids gave us complete confidence we could do it with this car too,” Mark Templin, Toyota Motor’s chief operating officer in the US, said of the new RAV4.

Toyota has long been sceptical on the industry push to go all-in on fully electric vehicles (EVs), opting instead for a multipronged approach that sees a place for hybrids, gas-guzzlers and even hydrogen-powered cars in its lineup. While the slow roll out of EVs left the carmaker open to criticism, the strategy has helped Toyota weather a cooling in demand for all-electric cars.

At the same time, demand for hybrids has skyrocketed in recent years and Toyota has emerged as the US market leader. Electrified models accounted for more than half of Toyota and Lexus volume in the US in the first three months of the year, up from just 37 per cent in the same period a year ago.

A 25 per cent US tariff poses a major threat to the new RAV4, with imports accounting for more than 60 per cent of US sales volume. Nearly half the 475,000 RAV4s sold in the US last year came from Canada and almost 20 per cent were made in Japan. The company has not disclosed pricing as it awaits more clarity on trade policy.

Templin said Toyota does not plan to stop importing RAV4s from its factories in Ontario and Japan, and remains hopeful for some reprieve on tariffs from US President Donald Trump’s administration.

“We need more capacity than we can crank out of any one of those plants. We need all three of them,” Templin said. “I believe there will be some form of tariff, I just don’t think it’s going to be 25 per cent.”

The RAV4 competes with similar compact crossovers such as the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue, Hyundai Tucson and General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox. Those models also have depended on foreign production for at least some US sales volume.

The current RAV4 debuted seven years ago and has begun to show signs of age. It ranked sixth of eight in a comparison test by Car and Driver magazine. But it’s still the top-selling vehicle outside of pickups.

Hybrid options

Michael Speigl, dealer principal at a Toyota in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said he’s confident the new version will be a hit with buyers, noting the current RAV4 hybrid is among his dealership’s most popular vehicles.

“I’m not in the business of second-guessing Toyota,” Speigl said. “The numbers speak for themselves.”

Toyota has vowed by this year to offer an electrified option for every model it makes globally. So far, just under 80 per cent of Toyota and its Lexus brand models sold in the US offer a hybrid or fully electric powertrain. The carmaker sells two all-electric vehicles in the US and last week announced plans to sell a third EV next year.

The latest RAV4 is not a complete redo: It uses the same chassis and underpinnings as the current version, and borrows the Camry’s hybrid powertrain. The hybrid version of the current model starts at US$32,300, which is about US$3,000 more than the cheapest gas-only RAV4.

Templin said Toyota aims to keep the vehicle affordable to new car buyers at the lower end of the scale.

“I’m not saying it’s going to be below US$30,000, but it needs to stay in that entry-level price,” he said. “And a lot of that depends on what happens with tariffs.”

The sixth generation of the RAV4, a model which made its US debut in 1996, boosts output by as much as 236 horsepower, up from 219 currently. Toyota did not specify expected fuel economy, but the plug-in’s electric-only mode range grows to 80 kilometres, which is 20 per cent greater than the current version.

That vehicle is made by Toyota Industries, which is the target of a takeover bid by Toyota Motor chairman Akio Toyoda. BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5ded60c53acfdd49a6982d31edafa7c20dd9ea9407c15c9be3fc5743255c8c91?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-05-21 05:04:59.309357

Since the time the Trump administration has taken office, American political scientists and scholars have encountered the phrase ‘constitutional crisis’ more than ever before. Executive Orders (EO) and presidential directives are at the heart of that debate.

During his first term, President Donald Trump signed 220 EOs. Just a month into his second term, Trump has signed 73 EOs, 23 proclamations and 12 memorandums as of February 20, 2025—108 executive actions in all.

Every president since George Washington has signed an EO, and their frequency has increased with modern presidencies. Trump, in his second term, has sped ahead of all presidents in signing the highest number of EOs in the first 100 days.

EOs have always been important in the American political scene, especially in the context of the presidential system, but in the context of the second Trump administration which took office on January 20 this year, it has acquired heightened importance.

The legal basis for presidents to issue EOs lies in the Article II of the American Constitution which establishes the Executive branch of the government and vests power in the president to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”. Living up to his campaign promise, President Trump has issued a slew of EOs targeting almost all-important areas of governance and policy, setting a net policy reversal from the Biden administration.

The Trump administration has cited a US Supreme Court ruling to justify the obligation of the Executive to defend the nation’s sovereignty. Increasingly, it is becoming clear that the ‘check and balances’ of the American constitution will kick in and some of the executive actions by president Trump will be challenged in courts, some blocked and some still, implemented.

Now in the second Trump presidency, it is perhaps timely to take a stock of the EOs signed and the impact they could have.

Table 1: Trump’s Executive Orders’ Status as of February 20, 2025

Note: The data has been updated as of 1 May 2025.

EOs have been a handy tool for US presidents to enforce the power of the Executive over the other branches of the government. For Trump, in his second term, it could be a contestable path with the other two branches, particularly the Judiciary. With quite a few of the EOs challenged in court and some overturned, it remains to be seen what role the legislature plays in all this. In the end, the EOs cannot replace the Congressional process in lawmaking. If anything, it is the Congress that retains the power to override a presidential veto.

Amidst a flurry of EOs by the Trump administration that may change the quintessential nature of America as a country internally and externally, it will be interesting to see if the checks and balances by the other two branches of the government manage to reign in an Executive on steroids.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-181.jpeg,N,,2025-05-21 04:02:51.371449

The move happened ahead of President Donald Trump’s meeting with GOP lawmakers Tuesday morning. His goal was to urge them to advance the tax cut, energy and national security budget reconciliation package as soon as possible.

One point of contention delaying progress is the fate of climate law tax credits. Trump also discussed pipelines after leaders struck a provision on permitting.

When it comes to the language affecting nonprofits, the package had at one point included a measure to allow the Treasury secretary to revoke tax-exempt status for groups deemed to have supported terrorist organizations.

Environmental group leaders sounded alarm bells that Trump could use such authority to punish organizations who countered his objectives.

But the language was struck from the megabill in an updated version posted on the House Rules Committee’s website Monday.

A spokesperson for Rep. David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), who championed the proposal, said the language did not adhere to Senate rules requiring budget reconciliation legislation — meant to bypass the filibuster — to have a clear fiscal nexus.

Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the group was surprised to see the provision stripped out while the megabill moved through the House. They were expecting to have to appeal to the Senate parliamentarian.

“We’re cautiously optimistic,” Hamadanchy said. “It looks like we’re OK on reconciliation, but the expectation is this will come back from the dead at some point, and we’re going to have to continue to make sure it doesn’t become law.”

Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said that the elimination of the provision from the megabill is “good news for all nonprofits.”

Pipelines

Republicans on Monday axed two measures that would have allowed accelerated permitting for pipeline developers willing to pay high fees. And they removed a number of funding clawbacks at the Department of Energy.

Trump spoke about the need to accelerate pipeline permitting. The legislation still includes measures to accelerate National Environmental Policy Act reviews and natural gas exports.

“He talked about getting pipelines approved,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said. “We’ve been trying to get some kind of approval on pipelines in the bill to expedite permitting. This has been a problem for a long time.”

Asked whether stripped provisions could be inserted back in the legislation, Scalise demurred. “We’re going to go talk about what we’re going to do to expedite permitting in America.”

Tax credits

Still up for debate is the future of clean energy credits established in the Democrats’ 2022 climate law. Some GOP hardliners have said the current bill does not go far enough in repealing the credits. But over a dozen moderates want the bill revised to make the credits usable for a longer period of time.

One of those lawmakers, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), who is also pushing for higher state and local tax deductions, said Trump did little to quell concerns.

“There’s a lot of problems if they put the bill on the floor as is,” Garbarino said.

Industry pressure has been increasing. The Solar Energy Industries Association launched a new campaign, Solar Under Threat, in response to GOP plans to scrap or limit Inflation Reduction Act incentives.

On Tuesday, the American Clean Power Association released a report saying clean energy manufacturing pumps in $18 billion a year into the gross domestic product and that nearly three-quarters of new clean energy manufacturing plants are in red states.

“For American energy manufacturers to continue creating jobs and strengthening our economy, we need policy certainty,” ACP said, specifically naming the clean energy credits.

The Trump administration selected McNeese State University as the site for a new center of excellence.

The Transportation Department’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has selected the Lake Charles-based university as its first National Center of Excellence for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Safety. It’s the first undergraduate institution in the U.S. to offer a certificate program in LNG Business. The university already offers its own LNG Center of Excellence.

“Producing and exporting LNG is one of the most powerful ways we can unleash American energy, and the Lake Charles region is a critical hub of LNG activity in the U.S.,” Duffy said. “The sheer volume of product supplied by the state of Louisiana is unparalleled and growing, and there is no better place to locate our Center of Excellence.”

The designation came after U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-LA, established the PHMSA National Center of Excellence for LNG five years ago in the 2020 PIPES Act under the first Trump administration. Included in the law was a provision Kennedy added to create “the first-ever National Center of Excellence for LNG Safety, but I didn’t stop there,” Kennedy said. “I made sure in that bill that the newly created Center was required to be in Louisiana.”

Under Trump’s second term, the center was chosen to be headquartered at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, an oil and natural gas powerhouse in Calcasieu Parish along the Gulf of America.

The PIPES Act, which improves pipeline safety and infrastructure, created the PHMSA center to “enhance the United States as the leader and foremost expert in LNG operations by furthering the expertise of the Federal Government in the operations, management, and regulatory practices of LNG facilities; acting as a repository of information on best practices for the operation of LNG facilities; and facilitating collaboration among LNG sector stakeholders.”

The center will facilitate research and development, training, and regulatory coordination to develop “LNG safety solutions to real-world challenges through global and domestic collaboration among LNG stakeholders.”

“The Center will advance LNG safety by promoting collaboration among government agencies, industry, academia, and other safety partners,” PHMSA Acting Administrator Ben Kochman said. “Consolidating such remarkable levels of expertise will benefit the LNG sector for many generations to come.”

Being located at McNeese “will be a game-changer for our region in terms of workforce development and groundbreaking research,” McNeese State University President Dr. Wade Rousse said. “We are excited to be on the forefront of helping ensure safety and sustainability in the energy sector and look forward to working with PHMSA to develop a world-class facility to house their staff.”

The U.S. is the top LNG exporter in the world, with the U.S. oil and natural gas industry and Louisiana and Texas ports propelling it to its number one status, The Center Square reported.

Lake Charles also found itself at the center of a Biden administration LNG export ban. Applications for exports had been frozen until a federal judge reversed the Biden policy last year. Under the second Trump administration, LNG exports projects are expanding in Louisiana.

Major projects underway in Calcasieu Parish include an Energy Transfer subsidiary Lake Charles Exports LNG export project approved under the first Trump administration in late 2019 for a five-year extension.

While BEVs are making up a larger portion of automobiles sold, with sales accounted for more than 9% of new vehicle sold in the U.S. and 10% of new vehicles sold in Canada in March, adoption of EVs “is now being threatened by tariffs and the anticipated impact to manufacturing costs and, ultimately, the MSRP of new BEVs as well as the supply of used BEVs,” the report states.

The report also shows that original manufacturing equipment parts are more frequently used in the repair of BEVs: In Q1, 88% of the parts dollars on estimates for repairable BEVs were for OEM parts compared with 64% for ICE automobiles.

But renewable energy stakeholders argued the proposal could add chaos “to an already complex process.” In a 2-1 vote, FERC commissioners denied the proposal.
“MISO proposes up to 14 opportunities to enter the ERAS process through 2028, which could further impede MISO’s ability to process ERAS requests on an expedited basis,” according to the decision.
“We worked closely and collaboratively with stakeholders to develop ERAS as a temporary process that will enable urgent generation projects to be built more quickly.
Environmental groups celebrated the decision, saying the ERAS proposal would favor the construction of gas-fired power plants over renewables and batteries.","Federal regulators on Friday rejected the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s plan to fast-track new generation interconnections, arguing the proposal lacked limits on the number of projects that could be considered.

MISO filed its Expedited Resource Addition Study process, or ERAS, in March, to provide a framework for the accelerated study of generation it said could address urgent resource adequacy and reliability needs. Under the proposal, projects entering the ERAS process would have been studied serially each quarter and granted an expedited interconnection agreement within 90 days.

But renewable energy stakeholders argued the proposal could add chaos “to an already complex process.”

In a 2-1 vote, FERC commissioners denied the proposal.

The ERAS proposal “places no limit on the number of projects that could be entered in the ERAS process, which could result in an ERAS queue with processing times for interconnection requests that are too lengthy to meet MISO’s stated resource adequacy and reliability needs,” Commissioners David Rosner and Lindsay See wrote in their decision.

MISO’s proposed tariff language, for example, did not limit the number of interconnection requests or total megawatts of interconnection requests that are eligible to enter the ERAS queue, they noted.

“MISO proposes up to 14 opportunities to enter the ERAS process through 2028, which could further impede MISO’s ability to process ERAS requests on an expedited basis,” according to the decision.

FERC Chairman Mark Christie dissented, though he said he did not disagree with the majority’s criticism.

“I am willing, however, to extend to both the states and MISO a trust that they would implement the ERAS proposal in a manner that would promote the construction of badly needed generation capacity that serves resource adequacy and reliability,” Christie wrote. “One thing we know with no need for further proof: This country, including MISO, is heading for a reliability crisis caused by early retirements of dispatchable resources coupled with the failure to construct sufficient equivalent capacity, all while demand rises at an unprecedented pace largely driven by data center growth.”

The MISO region has less supply capacity available now than it did last summer due to generator retirements and less firm imports and “could face supply shortfalls during above-normal peak demand,” North American Electric Reliability Corp. said Wednesday in its annual 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment. MISO officials have said they expect peak demand may reach nearly 123 GW, but they say there is about 138 GW of regularly available generation expected across the operating footprint.

MISO is reviewing the commission’s decision and “determining our appropriate next steps,” a spokesperson for the grid operator said.

“We worked closely and collaboratively with stakeholders to develop ERAS as a temporary process that will enable urgent generation projects to be built more quickly. We will continue to engage with stakeholders as we evaluate options,” MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris said.

Environmental groups celebrated the decision, saying the ERAS proposal would favor the construction of gas-fired power plants over renewables and batteries.

“It’s good to see FERC taking a deep look at extreme proposals like MISO’s here. Interconnection fast-track proposals like ERAS are fundamentally discriminatory, and the Commission made clear that discriminatory tools should only be used to address the most severe emergencies,” Sierra Club Senior Attorney Greg Wannier said in a statement.

“FERC rightly rejected the proposal from MISO to fast track connection of utility-owned methane gas projects over the queue of clean energy projects that have been waiting years to connect to the grid,” Christine Powell, deputy managing attorney for Earthjustice’s clean energy program, said in an email. “FERC’s role as an independent agency is to protect consumers, and ensure reliable affordable energy. The best way to do that is let clean energy compete fairly and openly.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xeDhr5lxGJaRE_xF6sx3i2U0nYJYU-Gkg4NYmKBzogk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTc2MTM5NzlfaUdWNURJdC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:21.397202

The sheer complexity of coordinating a diverse set of distributed energy technologies, however, takes a lot of time and design calculations. And with distributed energy possibly expanding to account for 40% of U.S. electricity generation within the next two decades, the collaborations around connection must accelerate or risk projects dying in long interconnection queues.

For those reasons, microgrid design, automation and management firm Schneider Electric unveiled its EcoStruxure Microgrid Flex solution to work on creating synergies with partners which, united as one, can reduce project timelines to meet critical customer needs.

New York-based developer Sprocket Power is becoming the inaugural partner of the Microgrid Flex Partner Program, which will bring companies into collaboration around microgrid projects for many types of facility customers seeking on-site power solutions. Both companies bring expertise that together are designed to enhance streamlining of the microgrid project process.

“Microgrids are being installed throughout the U.S. at hospitals, universities, businesses, schools, and airports, as the country’s grid experiences failures due to age and weather-related disruptions,” said Don Wingate, Vice President Sales – Strategic Customers and Solutions – New Energy Landscape at Schneider Electric, in a statement. “We recognized Sprocket Power as a trailblazer in the implementation of microgrid systems. Their expertise and collaborative approach have made them an invaluable partner in advancing this dynamic and rapidly growing sector of sustainable energy.”

Sprocket Power has led several higher-profile commercial microgrids lately, including distributed energy solutions at five automobile dealerships in New York. It has developed specific capabilities in on-site power development for EV charging infrastructure, while Schneider Electric is a long-time integrator of microgrids totaling more than 350 microgrids generating about 100 GW of capacity throughout the U.S.

The increasing frequency of extreme weather forcing grid outages, as well as concerns about utility resource adequacy for a variety of economic sectors such as data centers and manufacturing, is accelerating the adoption of microgrids through this decade.

“Microgrids are deeply valuable, but potential host sites often face barriers to accessing and maximizing that value,” Maria Fields, CEO and co-founder of Sprocket Power, said. “Schneider Electric brings critical resources, a well-earned reputation, and a smart approach to opening this market, and we are looking forward to partnering with the company to deliver on this promise.”

The standardization and simplification movement behind EcoStruxure Microgrid Flex helps combine and coordinator microgrid control, electrical distribution, software and battery storage components within systems.

Sprocket Power, already adept at working within the commercial customer markets, will identify candidates for the Microgrid Flex system and help develop projects from concept to execution and operation. Schneider itself has completed a fleet of microgrids across multiple sectors, from wineries to public transportation depots.

The 2-year-old Flex program expects to mature this year with additional collaborations across various partners within the microgrid ecosystem.

“Schneider Electric is expanding the Microgrid Flex partner network with a handful of select partners this year. It is our ambition to go to market with a focused group of highly qualified companies who are developing portfolios of microgrids,” added Samantha Childress, Director, Microgrid Partner Strategy & Channel Sales at Schneider Electric.

“Recruitment and selection of Microgrid Flex partners is dependent on an organization's experience determining and pitching the business case to end users, defining the appropriate use cases and site-level engineering, and the ability to install and maintain the microgrid solution for years to come,” Childress said.

The global microgrid market rose to between $32 billion and $35 billion last year, according to various reports, and could more than double by 2033. The expanded power needs of artificial intelligence, reshoring of U.S. manufacturing capacity and fleet electrification are drivers of this anticipated growth.

In addition, repairing and upgrading an outdated utility grid transmission and distributed system likely benefits from capital investment in modernization at the edge of the grid. The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. energy instructure at a D+ and lacking some addition $700 billion of capital investment needs.

The value proposition of microgrids not only resides in the power resiliency benefits of the distributed energy resources but also is aggregating that capacity into grid services such as demand response and virtual power plants.

Without the rolling chassis design, it is impossible.” He also related a commercial EV example: U Power’s own cargo van.
Zhai said the skateboard chassis makes it easier for truck body outfitters to implement unique designs for specific applications.
“With a skateboard chassis design, that enables them to do it very easily compared to a traditional EV chassis.” The ability to customize is enhanced further by the role the chassis plays in a crash.
“With the skateboard chassis, most of the impact will be absorbed by the skateboard itself.","The “skateboard” vehicle chassis is not a new development. In a November 2023 article posted to the website Medium, commercial electric vehicle (EV) maker U Power Tech said General Motors first unveiled it at the 2002 North American International Auto Show.

Designed specifically for alternative power supplies such as batteries, the skateboard chassis — so named because its flat profile and four wheels resembles a skateboard — incorporates all a vehicle’s core capabilities into a single integrated platform. These include propulsion, suspension, braking and steering. Such an approach offers certain advantages to vehicle makers.

U Power, which is based in China but has its North American headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., aims to apply its own skateboard chassis design — the UP Super Board — to light-duty commercial electric vehicles involved in urban logistics and specialty applications.

“The lack of options in the North American market for EVs really means that there are a lot of opportunities,” said Yao Zhai, co-founder of U Power and general manager for the company’s North American business, of the Class 2 vehicles that are U Power’s focus. “When we bring a new product to this market, we really don’t see a lot of competition.”

Speed to Market

U Power sees a number of advantages to its skateboard chassis in developing its own EVs and supporting customers seeking to do the same. One is development speed.

“The benefit of that is that you can roll out new electric vehicles much faster than the traditional way of developing and manufacturing new EVs,” Zhai said. This is because the components integrated into the chassis do not have to be engineered and integrated separately.

Zhai shared two examples of this efficiency as it relates to U Power’s chassis. One was in a consumer vehicle — a new SUV produced by New York EV maker and U Power customer Olympian Motors.

“From scratch, on the whiteboard, all the way to a prototype running on the road — they had a tech day in San Francisco [when] they drove the car on the road — that took almost eight months,” Zhai said. “This is something that has never been done before. Without the rolling chassis design, it is impossible.”

He also related a commercial EV example: U Power’s own cargo van.

“From the first design phase all the way to the end, which is the SOP (standard operating procedure) for large quantity production, it took us only 16 months,” Zhai said, adding that such a timeline was similarly unprecedented, with 24 months from concept to mass production being more typical with traditional chassis.

According to Zhai, the skateboard chassis offers other benefits to EV makers. These include a reduced bill-of-materials (BOM) cost for an EV.

“Imagine different vehicles, all sitting on the same skateboard chassis,” he said, “or very similar in terms of size and dimension. That gives you a lot of volume and negotiating power with your supply chain, thereby lowering the key component cost and then yielding that value to your customer.”

Another key advantage is in vehicle customization. Zhai said the skateboard chassis makes it easier for truck body outfitters to implement unique designs for specific applications.

“Players like Shyft or Morgan Olson, they do those highly customized vehicles,” he said. “With a skateboard chassis design, that enables them to do it very easily compared to a traditional EV chassis.”

The ability to customize is enhanced further by the role the chassis plays in a crash.

“The upper body also bears a lot of responsibility to absorb the impact,” Zhai said of traditional commercial vehicle bodies. “With the skateboard chassis, most of the impact will be absorbed by the skateboard itself. So, the upper body has very little — I think probably 10 to 15 percent — of the impact absorption.”

As such, Zhai said that truck body makers can be even more creative in designing commercial EVs.

EV Adoption Challenges

With an eye for making inroads in the North American market, U Power exhibited several of its electric vehicles at the recent ACT Expo. Nonetheless, Zhai noted several headwinds regarding commercial EVs in North America. The most obvious are in the U.S., with the tariffs applied by the current administration.

“It’s very challenging to make long-term investment decisions,” he said. “I think it’s moving toward the right direction, and we’re hoping that it settles down quickly.”

Another key challenge is infrastructure, particularly compared to China. Zhai said that while U.S. states like California as well as certain parts of the East Coast have invested in charging infrastructure, large swaths of the country remain underserved.

“When I visit, for example, Indiana or Ohio — even Detroit (Mich.) — I don’t really see a lot of charging infrastructure, which is quite challenging for customers who really want to buy. They don’t know where to charge, and it gives them anxiety,” he said.

Then there is what Zhai sees as fragmented government incentives and an inconsistent regulatory environment among the U.S. states.

“Sometimes they [have] policies coming out, and then they take [them] away, so it’s really not very stable,” he said. “In the end, investment decisions cannot be made based on the fragmented regulatory environment.”

Forecast for EVs

In terms of commercial EVs in the future, Zhai said that not all classes will enjoy the same adoption rates.

“The low-end EVs in terms of class, I see that’s going to grow significantly, from Class 1 to maybe Class 3 or 4,” he said. “I think the reason is the fast development and growth of e-commerce.”

He added that total cost of ownership (TCO) will play a similarly important role.

“I think because of high gas prices and also high maintenance costs, the transition from gas vehicles to commercial EVs in the commercial space — I think it will accelerate quite significantly as the infrastructure matures,” Zhai said.

However, he added that he doesn’t see similar rapid growth for heavier-duty commercial EVs.

“Battery technology has not reached the point where it is mature enough and the energy density is high enough to support those vehicles,” Zhai said. “You need to have a really huge and very heavy battery to support Class 8 vehicles.”

He added that batteries of such size and weight can affect the vehicle’s overall payload.

“If there are breakthroughs in terms of battery technology where you can pack more energy with the same dimensions and same weight, then we might see acceleration in that higher-class vehicles space also,” Zhai said.",https://www.powerprogress.com/Images/1260x628/index-20250520-194024-Skateboard-chassis.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 12:31:03.981063

How to meet rising demand is the million dollar question with billion dollar solutions, like building new natural gas power plants.

Natural gas power is relatively cheap, cleaner than coal and it can generate power all day and all night, unlike wind and solar. But it’s got a supply chain problem.

There’s a bit of a scramble right now to get the supplies needed to keep the lights on as demand for electricity goes up, said Ramteen Sioshansi, an electrical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

Take natural gas turbines, which are in relatively short supply:

“Suppliers have fairly lengthy backlogs to be able to get those components to utilities and others who are building electricity infrastructure,” Sioshansi said.

So why can’t manufacturers just ramp up production of gas turbines?

“These are big industrial machines, right? So you need big, heavy forging and casting components. You need really skilled labor,” said Sam Huntington, director of Climate & Sustainability: North American Power at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Plus, turbines require a lot of specialty materials and manufacturers are hesitant to make a big investment in ramping up production when there could be an overcount of how much electricity data centers will need.

“There's just a ton of uncertainty about the sort of range of projections of how much load growth could we actually see,” Huntington said.

He said the wait for some natural gas turbines is four years.

And the limited supply of turbines, which are a critical component to a natural gas plant, can add challenges and delays to these energy projects, said Tom Mergen, a vice president and Central/East U.S. business development lead at Stanley Consultants.

“It is difficult to get equipment,” he said. “There's definitely a race to get your orders in now.”

Mergen said projects will place turbine orders early on if they can. “But there's some risk in that, right? You're going to be starting to order equipment before you've done the environmental due diligence,” he said.

And it’s getting worse. It’s not just the gas turbines for big power plants that are in high demand.

“Now you've got the market kind of converging that the demand is for any type of technology, and pretty much any size is in high demand,” Mergen said.",https://img.apmcdn.org/460fb5875530b2512a6d9f28f037152e4385352e/widescreen/8b7ab2-20250520-aerial-view-of-a-natural-gas-plant-in-texas-2000.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:28.715729

Introduction

On May 12, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an interim final rule significantly extending the reporting deadlines for PFAS reporting under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The extension postpones the start of the reporting period by nine months—from July 11, 2025, to April 13, 2026—and sets a new submission deadline of October 13, 2026, for most manufacturers. Small manufacturers who import PFAS-containing articles will now have until April 13, 2027, to comply.

This extension responds to feedback from stakeholders and is designed to give EPA additional time to finalize and test the electronic reporting system. Significantly, EPA’s delay also provides industry more time to prepare for what many have described as a complex and demanding reporting obligation. According to its May 12, 2025 update, “EPA is separately considering reopening certain aspects of the rule to public comment,” and the “delayed reporting date ensures that EPA has adequate time to consider the public comments and propose and finalize any modifications to the rule before the submission period begins.” That statement, coupled with EPA’s April 28 announcement that it would minimize the burden on article importers and small businesses, may mean that EPA is already considering future rule changes.

Scope and Purpose of the TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting Rule

The 2023 final rule marked a significant expansion of EPA’s data-gathering authority over PFAS. Issued pursuant to the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which amended TSCA to mandate reporting on PFAS, the rule requires any entity that manufactured or imported PFAS, including as components of articles, between 2011 and 2022, to report a broad range of information. This includes data on chemical identity, production volumes, uses, byproducts, disposal practices, worker exposure and known environmental or health effects.

EPA’s stated objective is to build a comprehensive inventory of historical PFAS manufacturing and importation in the US to support future regulatory action, risk evaluation, and risk management efforts. Given the growing regulatory and public health focus on PFAS as a class of persistent and potentially harmful chemicals, the reporting rule represents a critical step in the federal government’s effort to close longstanding data gaps.

Implementation Challenges and the Basis for Extension

In issuing the interim final rule, EPA cited the need for additional time to develop and test the electronic reporting platform that will be used to receive the required information. The agency emphasized that the extended timeline will not only allow for technical improvements but also enable regulated entities to provide feedback on the tool’s usability and to request clarifying guidance on reporting expectations.

Stakeholders across multiple industries have raised concerns about the complexity of the reporting requirements and the burden associated with reconstructing over a decade of historical data. In particular, trade associations such as the RV Industry Association (RIVA) have highlighted the difficulty for article importers—especially small businesses—with limited access to upstream supplier information. These concerns appear to have factored heavily into EPA’s decision to issue the interim final rule, as the agency acknowledged the need to provide reasonable timeframes for compliance and reduce the likelihood of widespread reporting errors.

Implications for Manufacturers, Importers and Article Handlers

The extended deadlines offer short-term regulatory relief but underscore the need for companies to begin preparing now. Manufacturers and importers must identify all PFAS that they handled from 2011 to 2022. Importantly, the reporting obligation applies even if the PFAS was imported unintentionally or as part of a complex product. The scope of required data, such as information related to environmental and health effects, will necessitate significant internal coordination and engagement with suppliers.

While EPA has not yet modified the substance of the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements, companies should not postpone their due diligence efforts to determine whether any such changes may impact their reporting obligations, as the delay is an acknowledgment that compliance will require substantial, time-consuming effort and that additional guidance and outreach will be critical. The final version of the reporting tool, once released, may also influence how companies structure their data collection efforts in the coming year.

Conclusion

By balancing regulatory objectives with industry feedback and technological readiness, EPA aims to facilitate more accurate and complete PFAS reporting submissions. The regulated community should view this extension not as a reason to delay preparation, but as an opportunity to carefully align compliance strategies with EPA’s guidance and technological updates. As EPA advances its broader PFAS agenda, including potential future restrictions and risk management rules, early and thorough compliance with the reporting rule will be essential.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16215_5618.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 11:12:17.408959

The action, expected Wednesday, would be illegal. Both the Government Accounting Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the waivers are not subject to the CRA since they are adjudicatory orders, not rules.

“The Senate vote would be illegal and a fundamental betrayal of democracy. Republicans plan to kill clean air protections based on a lie about the law,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. “In their fervor to repay Big Oil and Big Auto campaign donors, Republicans are willing to defy the law, poison the air and cook the planet. We’re now witnessing one of the greatest payoffs in history.”

Congress voted decades ago to allow California, with the nation’s most smog-choked cities, to adopt stronger vehicle air pollution standards than the federal government as long as the EPA grants the state a waiver under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has issued these waivers to California more than 100 times. Although California’s waivers have dramatically improved air quality, more work needs to be done. Five of the 10 cities with the country’s worst smog pollution are in California.

Apex Power Conversion Celebrates Ribbon Cutting Of U.S. Headquarters In Mesa

Earlier this month, Apex Power Conversion, a solar and storage company, celebrated the ribbon cutting of its U.S. headquarters and manufacturing facility in Mesa. The event took place in conjunction with the American Clean Power Association’s CLEANPOWER 2025 Expo in Phoenix. Apex Power will initially employ up to 300 people, with plans to employ up to 700 by 2029.

Representing an over $60 million investment, the 206,000-square-foot facility is currently used for customer engagement and product training, and will be expanded for advanced multi-megawatt power conversion manufacturing for integrating renewables and energy storage with the grid. The first full units are expected to be manufactured in the first quarter of 2026.

“At Apex Power, we are relentless in pursuing our mission to develop and manufacture the most advanced power conversion systems – technologies that directly enable the integration of renewable energy and storage onto our power grids,” said Jacob Marshall, President & Co-Founder, Apex Power Conversion. “It is a humbling honor to launch Apex Power’s headquarters and manufacturing operations in my family’s hometown of Mesa. Apex’s culture is grounded in our purpose and our partnerships, and we look forward to showing the world exactly what we are capable of.”

“We’re incredibly proud to celebrate the opening of Apex Power’s U.S. headquarters and power conversion manufacturing facility,” said Watson. “With a commitment to quality and reliability, Apex Power will manufacture high-performance inverter systems, strengthening the state’s power grid resilience to support the growth of our renewable and clean energy sectors.”

“The opening of Apex Power’s United States headquarters furthers Greater Phoenix as a hub for climate technology and alternative energy production,” said Camacho. “The accessibility of partnerships, growing power grid, and diverse clusters in advanced technology will help Apex cement itself to play a key role in the region’s efforts to advance clean energy.”

In Mesa, Apex Power will access the growing infrastructure, supply chain and workforce pipeline in Arizona. Located on Elliot and Signal Butte roads, the facility will complement the company’s research & development and manufacturing production in Spain.

With the maturation of advanced manufacturing combined with a growing population in the market, Apex Power will support the state’s power grid expansion and clean energy demand with its manufacturing of advanced inverter systems.

“Apex Power’s decision to locate in southeast Mesa reinforces our position as a hub for energy innovation and advanced manufacturing,” said Mesa Vice Mayor Scott Somers. “This investment means high-quality jobs, cutting-edge technology, and a stronger, more resilient energy future for our region. We are proud to welcome Apex Power to the Mesa business community.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/apex.az_-e1747758591537.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 04:03:03.137279

A group of Congressional Republicans are asking their party to further tweak proposed changes to clean energy tax credits that the House Ways and Means Committee included in its reconciliation bill text.

The proposed budget reconciliation bill would decrease the credits for a number of clean energy technologies after 2028 and phase them out entirely after 2031, as well as additional requirements to qualify for the credits and an early sunset for their transferability. Rep. Jen Kiggans, a Virginia Republican, led 13 other House members in a joint statement Wednesday seeking to extend the transferability mechanism through the phase-out period and make other changes.

The GOP tax bill, as currently constructed, passed the House Budget Committee late on Sunday, after the committee failed to clear the bill on Friday. However, as Kiggans and the other lawmakers seek changes to the bill to further protect the clean energy tax provisions, others in the party are looking to speed up the phaseout.

Dive Insight:

While the original Inflation Reduction Act had technology-neutral clean energy production and investment credits available until 2032, the House Ways and Means Committee’s bill text would move the sunset dates up and phase them out over a four-year period. Companies would be able to receive 80% of the credit values in 2029, 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031, with the credits phasing out entirely in 2032. Another nuclear power production credit would be phased out on the same schedule.

Kiggans and her colleagues said they commended the committee “for including reasonable phase-out schedules” for the credits, but said in the May 14 joint statement that a few more changes are needed “to fully realize the intent of these phase-out schedules.”

“While many of these provisions reflect a commitment to American energy dominance through an all-of-the-above energy strategy, we must ensure certainty for current and future energy investments to meet the nation’s growing power demand and protect our constituents from higher energy costs,” the statement said.

Kiggins was joined on the statement by Reps. Andrew Garbarino, Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota of New York; Mark Amodei of Nevada; Don Bacon of Nebraska; Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania; Juan Ciscomani of Arizona; Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado; Dave Joyce of Ohio; Young Kim and David Valadao of California; and Dan Newhouse of Washington.

The members said retaining the transferability mechanism for the entirety of the credits’ lifecycle would provide companies “with the flexibility necessary to make long-term investments in American energy.”

In addition to extending the tax credit transferability mechanism through the entire phase-out period, the House lawmakers are also asking that adjustments be made to the “Foreign Entity of Concern provisions” and for a “placed in service” standard to be included in the proposed changes.

The foreign entity of concern provisions are “overly prescriptive,” according to the lawmakers, and “should be revised to allow companies additional time to reorganize their supply chains, ensuring a strategic and successful transition.” The “placed in service” provision, which adopts an Internal Revenue Service standard of preparedness for the credits, would require a project to be ready and available for use to qualify.

Kiggins and other moderate Republicans backing last week’s statement said the “placed in service” standard is misaligned with the phaseout schedule, and should be replaced in the text with a “start construction” standard. They said that adjustment “is essential to supporting the energy development needed to meet the growing power demand and protect thousands of high-quality American jobs in communities across the country.”

Clean energy developers and industry groups are “hoping that this draft isn’t the final text,” Robert Neifert, commercial and residential solar developer Solar Gain’s director for business development, said on a press call organized by Clean Energy for America last week.

“The way that the current rules are written with the placed in service rule … we're going to have to stop selling projects at the current tax rates in a year-and-a-half,” Neifert said.

Gilbert Campbell, founder and CEO of utility scale solar developer Volt Energy Utility, said on the May 13 call that the bill as written would lead to less private investment, increasing the price of building projects and leading to small businesses taking a “big hit.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mcX2Wcd05a1EileaQQSrCfEcbF8u4H7N39yugFqI2mg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODY1MjkwMTJfVFBrNm5uTy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:32.019916

Members of Congress and candidates for state office were also questioning the role of other fossil fuel companies in spreading disinformation on the climate crisis.
“It is a transaction that furthers BP’s business interests, resulting in more fossil fuel expansion, and empowering their broader political lobbying to impede international climate action,” he said.
“Big Oil’s multi-pronged scheme to lock in fossil fuel dependence relies on masquerading as a trusted clean energy partner,” said Sen. Whitehouse.
Sponsorships of the Girl Scouts, museum exhibitions, and marathons “in no way make up for the damage that the fossil fuel companies are causing.","In the fall of 2017, the American Petroleum Institute (API) sponsored a workshop for Pennsylvania Girl Scouts, featuring “activities that mimicked work in the energy industry.” Each scout left with a “coveted patch and a greater understanding of natural gas and oil,” API’s CEO Jack Gerard reported in an “Executive Update” email — one of the API member companies that co-funded the event.

What America’s most powerful oil lobby likely did not tell the Girl Scouts, however, was that API had hosted the seminar as part of its mission to cultivate “nontraditional local allies,” described by Gerard as some of the “best and most influential voices with targeted policymakers on industry issues.”

For years, campaigners have warned cultural institutions against accepting oil money, arguing that sponsorships are a key weapon in the public relations arsenal the industry deploys to thwart climate action.

Dozens of documents uncovered by a U.S. Congressional investigation appear to confirm those suspicions – demonstrating that API and oil giants BP, Shell, and Chevron have used sponsorships to allay public concerns over their role in the climate crisis while simultaneously lobbying against policies aimed at tackling it.

DeSmog discovered the documents by combing through thousands of internal memos, emails, and other communications subpoenaed by the Congressional investigation into climate disinformation by the fossil fuel industry, which published its report last year.

Dated between 2015 and 2021, the documents show oil companies funding sponsorship programs meant not only to enhance their reputations as socially responsible corporations, but also to ward off anti-climate change regulations that might undercut their oil and gas business.

The documents (which can be viewed online) reveal how BP America communications staff were instructed to use the company’s sponsorships to protect BP from “external threats” such as “the policy and politics of climate change,” how Chevron leveraged its sponsorship programs to “advance business objectives” with investors, government and customers, and how Shell used philanthropy to tackle the problem of “low credibility and trust” amid “rising societal expectations on climate action” while ensuring that oil and gas remained “a profitable cash engine.”

As the Trump administration rolls back environmental protections and slashes U.S. climate commitments, the documents cast new light on the oil industry’s long-term strategy to burnish its reputation and influence policy through partnerships with groups as diverse as the Girl Scouts of the USA, Ford’s Theatre, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Chicago Architecture Biennial and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

“Big Oil exploits its partnerships with some of America’s most trusted institutions, to greenwash its image, block progress on climate safety, and avoid accountability for the escalating costs of climate-driven disasters,” saidSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), who helped lead the congressional investigation as then-chair of the Senate Budget Committee.

The congressional investigators’ final report, published in April 2024, found that while BP, Chevron, and Shell publicly claimed to support pro-climate reforms between 2015 and 2021, they continued to underinvest in cleaner energies and increase oil and gas production.

All three companies also lobbied against climate policies during this time through trade groups such as the API, the Western States Petroleum Association, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The measures ranged from export restrictions on liquefied natural gas (LNG), certain state carbon taxes, and fracking moratoriums to policies relating to electric vehicles as well as regulations designed to reduce emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. These efforts were documented in their own in-house publications, as well as reports by climate accountability groups including Lobby Map and the California Climate Accountability Project.

Most of these climate protections have now been revoked or placed under review by the Trump administration, whose first-day executive order to “unleash American energy” was immediately “applaud[ed]” by current API CEO Mike Sommers.

In his 2017 “Executive Update” email to BP praising the value of partnering with the Girl Scouts, API’s then-CEO Gerard also referenced an API-sponsored “Tribute to Black Women luncheon” in Colorado, attended by “1,500 female leaders including more than 27 elected officials and candidates for state office.” The event “allowed API to reach many of the most influential and strong voices for public policy across Colorado.” Gerard also described a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) tour in Michigan by Grand Hank, a “scientist entertainer who engaged more than 700 students in an interactive way through music, dancing, and experiments.”

API’s efforts had “cemented existing relationships and laid the groundwork for new ones that could make the difference in future campaigns,” concluded Gerard.

“What these sponsorship programs really amount to is an attempt to enhance reputation while continuing to produce fossil fuels, which are leading to the collapse of the climate system,” said Robert J. Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Brown University’s Institute for Environment and Society.

“It’s sort of like giving out life jackets to hurricane survivors,” Brulle said, “while at the same time contributing greenhouse gases to cause the hurricanes.”

BP, Chevron, Shell, and API are among the companies and groups being sued by several U.S. states and municipalities for allegedly defrauding consumers with climate denial and disinformation campaigns.

Speaking on behalf of the industry in 2024, an API spokesperson described such litigation as “meritless” and “politicized,” arguing that “climate policy is for Congress to debate and decide — not the court system.”

BP, Shell, Chevron and API did not respond to requests for comment on their sponsorship programs or the contents of the documents.

ExxonMobil has been another major sponsor of cultural and community organizations. While the subpoenaed documents contain little information relating to its sponsorship programs, Congressional investigators noted that “Exxon withheld multiple documents “for privilege” without specifying the privilege it was claiming and notwithstanding that Congress is not required to recognize common law privilege claims.”

ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.

BP’s Strategy to Address ‘Negative Sentiment’

Between 2010 and 2015, BP America’s PR strategy largely focused on rebuilding its reputation following 2010’s deadly and environmentally devastating Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

By 2016, however, the documents show that Deepwater Horizon was receding as BP’s biggest reputational concern, with the company pivoting its PR strategy to address threats related to climate action. An internal 2016 summary of “BP America Group-Level Risks,” reported that “although DWH [Deepwater Horizon] is increasingly less of a drag on reputation, other litigation issues present risk to our public standing. Overall negative sentiment about the oil and gas industry also threatens to drag down BP’s reputation.”

The summary identified the “policy and politics of climate change” as one of the risks capable of causing “damage to BP’s reputation,” with the potential to undermine not only BP’s “public standing and credibility but also investor confidence in the company.”

In response to these threats, a separate “2016 Plan” instructed BP America’s Communications & External Affairs team to “position BP as a leading and trusted voice in the national dialogue” while at the same time to “expand the company’s capacity to influence regulators on key climate-related initiatives.”

The team was told to mitigate the potentially harmful impact of “detrimental policy and political developments” by “leveraging our distinctive position as a champion of STEM education” as well as demonstrating the company’s “commitment to communities,” through sponsorships, which were described as “focused community investments.”

A separate “Strategic Objectives Overview” for 2016 further instructed BP’s communications team to “leverage” sponsorships to “develop support for BP’s business objectives and stimulate advocacy on the company’s behalf.”

These “business objectives” included expanding an Alaskan liquefied natural gas (LNG) operation and developing “major Gulf projects” such as BP’s giant “Mad Dog 2” oil field located several hundred miles east of the Deepwater Horizon disaster site in the Gulf of Mexico.

To “protect current operations” and “support business growth,” the team was told to promote policies that favored BP’s business while preventing those that might cause harm — specifically those related to climate. The team should “influence the political, policy, legislative and regulatory environment to support policy outcomes that benefit business operations while preventing harmful legislation or regulation (examples include climate, ozone, RFS [renewable fuel standard], Dodd Frank, exports and taxes),” declared the memo.

In 2016, BP America’s sponsorships included the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the “BP MS 150” bike ride from Houston to Austin, the National Urban League, the Women’s Energy Network, and the Valor Games competition for veterans. The BP Foundation also sponsored multiple STEM programs across the country.

‘Strategic Relationships’

That same year, a BP External Affairs memo demonstrated different ways that sponsorships, referred to as “strategic relationships,” presented opportunities to “advance business interests” by securing “public support” from partners, as well as to “mitigate risks including those posed by “potential litigation.”

By April 2016, three attorneys general – from Massachusetts, New York, and the U.S. Virgin Islands – were investigating whether to sue BP rival ExxonMobil for deceiving the public about climate change risks, or misleading investors over how those risks could hurt business. Members of Congress and candidates for state office were also questioning the role of other fossil fuel companies in spreading disinformation on the climate crisis.

Outlining the precise “Business Benefit” afforded by sponsorships, the BP External Affairs memo stated: “Direct benefit comes when our partners engage as influencers, supporters or defenders regulatory, legislative, or other policy matters, while indirect benefits comes [sic] in our ability to access the network and platform provided by our partners to deliver our messages.”

A further goal was to “leverage” BP’s “strategic relationships to mitigate potential litigation or other sensitive matter [sic],” the memo said.

‘Defend BP Budget’

In June 2017, hundreds of thousands of people took part in the People’s Climate March in Washington, D.C. to protest the first Trump administration’s withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement

Six weeks later, a BP America “Key Priorities Review” directed communications staff to use sponsorships as a way of “mitigating external threats” as well as “building and maintaining relationships with government and communities to ensure strong business support.”

According to the review, sponsorships should deliver “functional support” for the company’s central “mission” of defending and supporting its U.S. business.

The review described “community investment” and sponsorships as key “ongoing activities to protect and grow BP’s reputation and license” — a reference to maintaining sufficient legitimacy, credibility and trust to sustain the public’s acceptance of its business practices.

A “Defend BP Budget” document that accompanied this review listed some of the company’s U.S. sponsorship payouts, including $1.2 million to the U.S. Olympic Committee for the paralympics team, $500,000 to the Chicago Architecture Biennial, and $300,000 to the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

In 2019, a “Strategic Plan” for the launch of BP’s partnership with the American Heart Association (AHA) revealed that the launch event was designed both to “utilize the AHA’s brand to reach thought leaders, policy makers” and “to raise BP’s brand and contribute to a healthy workplace.”

In response to a request for comment, the AHA stated that “more than 85% of revenue the American Heart Association receives is from individuals, their estates, sale of our educational products and other non-corporate sources. Any funding from the energy industry is an infinitesimal part of that 15% of total corporate revenue from all sectors.”

A separate 2019 “Executive Team Meeting” memo suggested that BP tailor its sponsorship programs according to prevailing cultural trends, in this case by aligning with the #MeToo movement.

The company’s “strategic relationship matrix” had been “refreshed,” stated the memo, with a “special focus on women’s organizations.” Handwritten notes on the subpoenaed copy of the document described the #MeToo movement as an example of a rapidly mobilizing “new agenda.”

BP’s “tweaks” to its sponsorship plans included an upcoming International Women’s Day event called “Pink Petro.” Melody Meyer, a female BP board member, was to “participate in this program [and] host a reception at her home as part of the programming.”

A confidential internal memo, dated July 29, 2020, argued that BP’s $200,000 annual sponsorship of Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C. was justified on the grounds that it boosted the company’s public image via “on-stage recognition and program recognition,” and provided “elevated access to and recognition with critical Washington stakeholders.” “Members of Congress, the Administration [sic] and more” regularly attend Ford’s Theatre VIP Opening performances, receptions, and events,” noted the memo, which also extolled the benefits of BP America’s then-president and board chair Susan Dio’s seat on the theatre’s board of trustees: “The value of the Trustee role is access to DC political figures.”

Backing the British Museum

Beyond BP’s operations in the U.S., an April 2016 internal “BP position” document, instructed “authorized recipients” to emphasize the message that over 50 million people in the UK had “engaged with a BP-supported activity” thanks to its arts and culture sponsorship of the British Museum, Royal Shakespeare Company, Tate Britain, and other institutions.

Another message for staff to convey while discussing these UK sponsorships was that BP was “a fossil fuel company that is playing its part in addressing the climate challenge by advocating for a carbon price, providing lower carbon products like gas and renewables, pursuing energy efficiency and supporting research.”

According to a “2020 review” produced by the company’s Policy and Advocacy Working Group, official positions like these formed the basis for ‘high-level’ external messaging” to be used at BP “investor events,” in “executive speeches and opeds [sic],” as “responses to press inquiries” and during “civil society (NGO) engagement.”

The following year, in 2021, a BP communications and advocacy team memo instructed staff to “pivot existing sponsorships” to “mitigate social risks of the business” and “showcase bp as a British champion.”

“These documents make it abundantly clear that BP’s cultural sponsorship has nothing to do with philanthropy,” said Chris Garrard, director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, which is calling on those UK arts and cultural institutions that have not already cut ties with the fossil fuel industry to do so.

Rather, he said, sponsorships are “a strategic attempt to access high-level decision makers, to secure the public backing of leading cultural figures, and to craft a positive public image.”

In Garrard’s opinion, sponsorship is not a donation. “It is a transaction that furthers BP’s business interests, resulting in more fossil fuel expansion, and empowering their broader political lobbying to impede international climate action,” he said.

Shell Seeks a Buffer Against ‘Negative News’

In 2016, Shell was also pursuing sponsorships as a means to improve its reputation with the U.S. public.

A PowerPoint presentation for a 2016 Shell “Reputation Workshop” noted that “trust in the energy industry” was “low,” and declared climate change “an emerging issue.”

To aid the company’s reputational planning, Shell identified social and community-based groups as well as emergency and other aid organizations, as potential “business-critical US stakeholders,” which should be assessed “for opportunities that advance Shell business and reputational objectives.”

The following year, an “influencer insight” report revealed why the company saw not-for-profit partners as “stakeholders/influencers.” According to this report, “community engagement” and “philanthropy” were helping Shell cultivate public trust, which in turn would “buffer” the company “in the face of negative news.”

Shell’s hoped-for outcomes were to strengthen “stakeholder inclination to speak up for Shell” and “in some circumstances [defend] Shell from critics.”

In 2019, following Trump’s withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Shell saw an opportunity to take on “an increased leadership role to shape effective policy at multiple levels,” according to a high-level internal discussion document produced for the company’s executive committee. The policies mentioned ranged from carbon pricing, to boosting support for government subsidies of carbon capture and storage technology.

According to the document, this could be done “while maintaining a strong societal license to operate.” The document emphasized the importance of protecting Shell’s traditional business, stating that its oil and gas operations required “continuous efforts to remain a “profitable cash engine,” identifying “an opportunity to leverage America’s abundant shale gas for LNG exports” and pronouncing that “in the near to medium term, oil and gas will continue to play a key role for the US, both at home and globally.”

However, the discussion document also noted that “following the 2018 midterm elections, climate change has once again become a topic in Washington, D.C.” and that the Green New Deal legislation proposed by Democrats “has helped propel climate change onto the agendas of both the Democrats and Republicans.” Shell predicted that climate change will be a key issue in the upcoming presidential campaigns.”

An accompanying “Reputation Plan” also highlighted the problem of “low credibility and trust” amid “rising societal expectations on climate action,” especially for “onshore unconventional exploration and production,” a reference to fracking.

Shell outlined key ways to overcome this problem, such as “secure partnerships with credible external influencers” that “support and strengthen societal license to operate and grow at country and asset level,” and “make meaningful, authentic connections with people.”

By engaging with “Non-profit (NGO) Influencers / Special Publics,” Shell believed it could develop a “network of third-party advocates” and portray itself as a “preferred partner in energy transitions.”

The reputation plan included a list of influencers to engage with — which Shell blacked out before giving the document to Congress.

Records show that in 2019 Shell sponsored the Houston Open (a golf event the company had sponsored for 26 years); the Houston Mayor’s Back 2 School Festival; the Shell Game-Changer Open House at the SXSW Festival in Austin; the Shell Eco-Marathon Americas in California (a U.S. chapter of the company’s global student competition program); the 100 Resilient Cities Network (which Shell began sponsoring following Hurricane Harvey); the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (which the company began sponsoring in 2006 following Hurricane Katrina); and the United Negro College Fund Walk for Education.

In response to a request for comment the SXSW Festival said: “Neither Shell nor any other fossil fuel companies are participating at SXSW 2025 as clients or sponsors.”

None of the other organizations or individuals receiving sponsorship from oil companies referenced in this story responded to requests for comment.

Shell did not respond to inquiries about the redacted material.

Chevron saw its sponsorship programs — which it termed “social investments” — as “a key engagement tool to build and reinforce brand awareness and favorability.”

A 2015 confidential briefing document, produced for the Chevron board’s public policy committee, stated that the company’s “social investment programs advance business objectives and establishes [sic] the company as a leader in corporate responsibility.”

The internal brief identified “U.S. Federal Climate Policy” as one of the risks that could affect the company’s business, highlighting that the Obama administration continued “to drive an aggressive regulatory agenda designed to cement the President’s climate and environmental legacy.” On the state and local levels, the brief noted that “activism continues against industry.”

The brief highlighted two areas of special concern: Some communities and civil society organizations were “attempting to link human rights to climate change and hydraulic fracturing debates,” and others were calling for fossil fuel companies to pay for the costs of climate impacts.

The brief also summarized the positive value of Chevron’s sponsorship efforts, citing public opinion surveys showing that when people were familiar with these sponsorship programs, their attitudes about the company were more favorable, increasing “support for our operations in their communities by a margin of 2:1.”

By 2017, records show that Chevron was sponsoring organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering. The company’s own Appalachia Partnership Initiative was directing funding to projects in communities located near Chevron’s fracking operations in the Marcellus Shale, such as ShaleNET scholarships for regional workforces and the Inquire Within rural library program.

In July 2017, two months after the People’s Climate March, “an updated list of key global policy issues that can impact Chevron’s business” (prepared for a meeting of the same public policy committee) included “off-oil activism” in the U.S. The document characterized this activism as “aimed at transitioning to a low carbon economy” by “convincing the public and policymakers that economic growth can be decoupled from [greenhouse gas] emissions and that society can be powered by renewable energy.”

Chevron noted that this message was “being propagated to strengthen public support for anti-fossil fuel ballot initiatives, pressure consumer facing companies to make renewable energy and climate commitments, provoke protests involving physical disruption of infrastructure development, and significantly increase non-governmental organization (NGO) fundraising.”

In light of these threats, board members were assured that “Chevron’s global [social investment] activity remains focused on areas aligned with our business needs.”

That year, Chevron sponsored the annual Chevron Houston Marathon, attracting over 300,000 people (an event the company, according Feldman, began supporting in 2005), along with famous cultural organizations such as the San Francisco Symphony and the Smithsonian Institution.

A separate “Brand Positioning Brief,” also prepared for the July 2017 committee meeting, declared that “[T]oday more than ever, effective brand and reputation management is critical.” The brief described Chevron’s sponsorships as “a key engagement tool to build and reinforce” the company’s “brand awareness and favorability.”

The documents show that at the same time Chevron was seeking to bolster its reputation through sponsorships, the company was also closely monitoring developments in domestic climate policy, as well as tracking the continued momentum of what it termed an “anti-fossil fuel agenda” being pursued by climate activists and “leading environmental NGOs.”

A 2017 Chevron “Public Policy Update” reported that while activism was a continuing challenge at the state level, the fossil fuel industry was increasing its “ability to counter activism.”

On international climate policy, Chevron noted that “many governments in countries key to Chevron are adapting policies…to address climate change and to meet their [Paris] Agreement goals.”

An internal briefing document, prepared for the company’s board of directors ahead of a 2016 tour of Australia, stated that “partnerships are essential to our ability to develop energy resources. We build long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with host governments, national and international energy companies, and nongovernmental organizations.”

The briefing listed the community benefits achieved through Chevron’s support of Australian cultural events and groups such as the Chevron Focus Environment photography competition, the Perth International Arts Festival, and Many Rivers Microfinance. The document also emphasized that the company’s strategic partnerships “focus on maximising return on investment and help the ABU [Australian Business Unit] achieve its long-term business objectives.”

Chevron did not respond to a request for comment.

‘Denial and Doublespeak’

In their final report, titled “Denial, Disinformation, and Doublespeak,” the congressional investigators who subpoenaed the documents found that between 2015 and 2021, all of the companies examined (which also included ExxonMobil) “routinely misled the public and investors” about their emission reduction targets, plans to comply with the Paris Agreement, and commitments to support various climate policies.

“Big Oil’s multi-pronged scheme to lock in fossil fuel dependence relies on masquerading as a trusted clean energy partner,” said Sen. Whitehouse. “Just as Big Tobacco lied about the harms of its products to deceive the public, Big Oil is perpetrating a similar disinformation campaign against the American people, policymakers, and its investors.”

In the U.S. and around the world, oil and gas companies continue to sponsor cultural and community groups.

Following Hurricane Helene in September 2024, Chevron announced a donation of $250,000 to groups assisting with relief and recovery efforts. In January, as wildfires devastated parts of Los Angeles, Chevron announced a $1 million donation “to support relief efforts.”

The costs of these disasters are markedly higher. Hurricane Helene is estimated to have caused $59.6 billion worth of damage, and its destructive power was made 200-500 times more likely by the burning of fossil fuels, according to scientists at the World Weather Attribution project. Damages from the Los Angeles fires are estimated at $250 to $275 billion, according to AccuWeather.

A January study involving over 30 researchers worldwide found that climate change made the chances of such fires 35 percent more likely in 2025 compared to pre-industrial times.

Sponsorships of the Girl Scouts, museum exhibitions, and marathons “in no way make up for the damage that the fossil fuel companies are causing. It also buys the corporations more time to continue their business-as-usual model,” said Brulle, the sociologist at Brown University. “It fits to the larger strategy of the fossil fuel companies to maintain their business practices as usual for as long as possible to maximize their profits.”

Re: Oppose the Anti-Environmental Billionaire Tax Scam

Dear Representative:

The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) believes that everyone has a right to clean air, clean water, public lands, and a safe climate protected by a just and equitable democracy. Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of members of Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and the media.

We urge you to oppose the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” more accurately named the anti-environmental billionaire tax scam, the most extreme and sweeping anti-environmental piece of legislation in U.S. history. With nearly 100 separate anti-environmental provisions, it would increase costs for working families through higher energy bills, compromise the health of our communities by rolling back and cutting funding for critical environmental protections, and harm our global competitiveness in the race for a clean energy future, all to justify cutting taxes for billionaires and wealthy corporations and giving further handouts to polluters.

Clean energy is the fastest, cheapest way to bring new electricity onto the grid, increasing reliability and lowering household energy costs. Unfortunately, this partisan reconciliation bill would enable Congress to rescind hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and funding for clean energy, transmission, and energy efficiency, including rebates for household energy performance, increasing costs for working families while harming our environment. The bill uses these cuts to finance tax breaks for billionaires and polluting corporations who need it the least, while creating pay-to-play permitting schemes that allow polluters to pay for fast-tracked environmental reviews that block harmed communities from having their day in court. Rescinding tax credits that have already been promised to consumers and businesses to help them save money, create jobs, and reduce their carbon footprint in all 50 states will increase energy costs by hundreds of dollars per year for families, cut over 800,000 jobs, and stifle economic growth by risking over $500 billion in private investments.

In addition to cutting programs that lower costs in the first place, the bill cuts programs meant to provide assistance to those who need it most, including critical lifelines for millions of people like Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC. What’s more, this resolution plans to offset the costs of these cuts by selling off our pristine public lands and waters to the oil and gas industry for drilling, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, despite the fact that the most recent lease sale raised $0.

This partisan reconciliation bill puts our health and safety at risk. It cuts funding for all manner of environmental protections. It eliminates the penalty for fossil fuel companies that fail to reduce their dangerous methane pollution while cutting funds to monitor, enforce, protect and improve air and water quality. It also directs hundreds of billions of dollars to turbocharge mass deportations, militarize the border, fund immigration raids in schools and other community spaces, and tear families apart.

For all these reasons, we strongly urge you to vote NO on the anti-environmental billionaire tax scheme. While our typical vote recommendations note that we will consider including votes in our Scorecard, in this instance we are stating unequivocally that we will score this extremely damaging legislation in our 2025 National Environmental Scorecard.

The United States biodiesel market is expected to expand at a large scale, reaching US$ 20.29 billion in 2033 from US$ 12.23 billion in 2024, with a CAGR of 5.79% from 2025 to 2033. This expansion is based on growing demand for renewable energy, government incentives for biofuels, and a move towards sustainable fuel options. Growing environmental issues and technology advancements also help drive market growth.

In the United States, biodiesel is also extensively applied in transportation, agriculture, and the industrial sector. It fuels trucks, buses, and marine vessels, lowering greenhouse gas emissions as well as fossil fuel dependence. The agricultural industry is also helped by biodiesel through powering farm machinery, while fleets of government and the commercial sector use it to achieve sustainability targets. Biodiesel is also employed in home heating systems (bioheat) and as a substitute fuel in power production. With renewable energy policies and federal incentives encouraging its use, biodiesel remains a key player in the clean energy revolution in the U.S.

Growth Drivers in United States Biodiesel Market

Government Policies and Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS)

The U.S. government is a major driver of biodiesel market growth through policies such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). This law requires refiners of fuel to mix a portion of renewable fuels, such as biodiesel, into their fuel supply. Federal and state incentives, such as tax credits and grants, also promote the use of biodiesel. Initiatives like the Biodiesel Tax Credit (BTC) make biodiesel more cost-effective, further increasing consumption and production.

These regulations, which are designed to cut carbon emissions and enhance energy independence, are major forces driving the growing demand for biodiesel in the United States. Dec 2023, The EPA must establish volume requirements for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2023-2025 under the Clean Air Act, including cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel. This move entails a second addendum standard covering the judicial remand of the 2016 rulemaking and a number of regulatory adjustments to enhance the RFS program, especially in relation to biogas. The EPA is not finalizing provisions for the production of RINs from renewable electricity at this moment.

Increasing Demand for Low-Carbon and Sustainable Fuels

With growing concerns about climate change and carbon emissions, industries and consumers alike in the U.S. are making a turn towards cleaner energy options. Biodiesel, which has a huge emissions reduction advantage over petroleum diesel, is becoming increasingly popular in the transportation, agricultural, and industrial markets. Corporations and governmental fleets are increasingly using biodiesel to achieve sustainability objectives. Moreover, countries with aggressive emissions cut-off targets like California and Washington are promoting biodiesel consumption, fueling business growth.

The increasing demand for green fuels makes biodiesel a leading contender for shifting to sustainable energy. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has published its ""Pathways to Commercial Liftoff"" report, where it emphasized the capability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. The report examines the preparedness of different SAF production technologies and provides recommendations for public and private sectors to make the U.S. a leader in SAF production by 2030.

Technological Advancements in Biodiesel Production

Ongoing technological advancements in biodiesel production are increasing efficiency and reducing costs, driving market growth in the U.S. Improved processing technologies, including transesterification and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) technology, enhance biodiesel yield and quality. Scientists also seek to develop alternative feedstocks such as algae-based and waste-derived biodiesel to further increase production capacity.

Enhanced refining processes make biodiesel more compatible with conventional diesel engines, leading to greater adoption by industries. With advancing technology and declining production costs, biodiesel grows into a competitive and potential substitute for conventional fossil fuels, boosting its market share. In 2023, Be8 moved into the US market and made investments in technology for biofuel production and a cereal-based ethanol venture. The firm wants to create a global tech company with a specialization in renewable energies.

Challenges in the United States Biodiesel Market

Feedstock Price Volatility

Production costs for biodiesel are greatly affected by feedstock prices, such as vegetable oils and animal fats. Price volatilities in soybean, canola, and other crops contribute to the cost of biodiesel, making it less competitive with traditional diesel when feedstock prices increase. Furthermore, supply chain disruptions in the global supply base, severe weather, and changes in agricultural policies also contribute to feedstock price volatility. This is a real challenge for biodiesel manufacturers since it influences production volume and profitability.

Competition from Other Renewable Fuels

Though biodiesel is the prime alternative fuel, other renewable energy options like renewable diesel, electric vehicles (EVs), and hydrogen fuel cells are increasingly posing competition to it. Renewable diesel, especially, has seen increased usage because it is chemically similar to petroleum diesel and can be integrated into existing infrastructure without any hassles or modifications. Government incentives for EV use and better battery technologies also pose a threat to biodiesel consumption in the long term. In order to sustain market share, the biodiesel sector needs to keep innovating and resolve issues of cost, efficiency, and scalability.

This funding, provided through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), will enhance Louisville’s ability to clean up contaminated properties and transform blighted sites into productive, sustainable spaces.

“We are excited to receive these federal grants, which will allow us to continue addressing environmental challenges and drive reinvestment in our communities,” said Mayor Greenberg. “By revitalizing brownfield sites, we are not only improving public health and environmental conditions but also paving the way for new economic opportunities.”

The first award, a $750,000 supplemental grant, will strengthen Louisville’s existing revolving loan fund. These funds can be used for programmatic expenses and to create additional and larger cleanup loans for eligible recipients. Louisville qualified for this funding due to its demonstrated success in managing a high-performing revolving loan program and maintaining a robust pipeline of potential projects.

Additionally, Louisville Metro Government was awarded an additional $2 million joint application Community-wide Coalition Assessment Grant with the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection and Russell: A Place of Promise. Funding from this grant will enable Louisville Metro Government to conduct environmental site assessments on properties within the Russell neighborhood, a priority focus area for concerted efforts to counter decades of disinvestment. The allocation of funds to Louisville Metro will be determined collaboratively with the State as the coalition develops a workplan, which must be approved by the EPA before any funds are expended.

The Japanese car giant said on Tuesday it would cut investment in EVs from a planned 10 trillion yen (£51.7bn) by 2030 to 7 trillion yen (£36.2bn). The company is to focus on hybrids instead. It now expects electric cars to represent 20pc of sales by the end of the decade, compared to a previous forecast of 30pc.

Bosses blamed disappointing demand and moves by foreign governments to roll back green regulations designed to encourage EV purchases, such as those recently announced by the US and UK.

Toshihiro Mibe, Honda’s chief executive, said: “Based on the current market slowdown, we expect EV sales in 2030 to fall below the 30pc that we previously targeted.

“EV investment hasn’t been abandoned, just pushed back.”

Pivot towards hybrids

Honda said it will pivot towards boosting sales of hybrid vehicles – as it reduces focus on electric cars.

Only in China, where EVs now dominate new car sales, will it focus on purely electric models.

Sir Keir Starmer’s Government amended green rules, known as the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, earlier this year to provide greater flexibility for car manufacturers on targets for electric vehicle sales.

Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” passing through Congress aims to remove tax credits for EV buyers over the next few years.

Honda now expects to sell 2.2m to 2.3m hybrids by 2030, out of a total of 3.6m cars. By comparison, Honda’s forecasts suggest it expects electric sales to total just 700,000 to 750,000 cars.

Honda said it will launch 13 new hybrid models in the four years from 2027.

Despite the changes, Honda has insisted that it continues to work towards the goal of all cars it sells being either electric or fuel-cell powered by 2040.

The company last week warned it faced a huge hit to profits from President Trump’s trade tariffs on cars imported to the US.

Some 60pc of Honda’s US-sold cars are made in the country, but the president’s tariffs have made it much more expensive for Japanese manufacturers to import cars or parts from Canada and Mexico.

Amid the trade chaos, Honda has paused plans for a C$15bn (£8bn) EV production hub in Ontario, Canada.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/05/20/TELEMMGLPICT000389883916_17477341594940_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBAv6lVOesLvutkytnWmMFxxYQMflB4Mfwu-Ty6YYI2E.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-05-20 22:06:19.750015

The Tennessee Valley Authority announced Tuesday that it is the first utility in the U.S. to submit a construction permit application for the GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy small modular reactor (SMR) BWRX-300 technology to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission – the agency that issues licenses for constructing, operating and decommissioning nuclear power plants. This CPA is TVA’s next step in pursuing an SMR at its Clinch River site, near Oak Ridge, Tn., and establishing America’s energy dominance to power artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing.

“This is a significant milestone for TVA, our region and our nation because we are accelerating the development of new nuclear technology, its supply chain and delivery model to unleash American energy. TVA has put in the work to advance the design and develop the first application for the BWRX-300 technology, creating a path for other utilities who choose to build the same technology,” Don Moul, TVA president and CEO, said. “TVA looks forward to working with the Administration to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that are key to our nation’s energy security. We believe deploying new nuclear is essential to providing American families and businesses affordable and abundant electricity for decades to come.”

Officials said, ""SMRs are advanced reactors with a smaller and more modular design than the nuclear technology that powers many U.S. states today. TVA is pursuing the BWRX-300 technology, with the potential benefits of enhancing safety, making them easier to replicate and more efficient. Their smaller footprint means they can possibly be built more quickly, are easier to operate and better fit into the landscape due to their compact size.""

The IRA, signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, offers tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV buyers.
Wood Mackenzie analyst Emil Koenig said his firm’s charging projections are based on the EV tax credit since it’s still in place, though WoodMac still lowered its charging outlook compared to last year.
The bipartisan infrastructure law also set aside $5 billion to build out charging infrastructure.
But some states have suspended charging projects tied to that pot of money after the Trump administration paused implementation.","(Bloomberg) — Installation of high-speed chargers across the U.S. fell by more than 21% in the first quarter compared to the year-earlier period, according to an analysis of Energy Department data.

And with House Republicans proposing ending Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for buyers while the Trump administration rolls back auto emissions standards, it threatens to create a negative feedback loop of fewer charger installations and lower EV adoption. Such an outcome risks setting the sector back to trying to rev up EV sales with middling installation growth rather than rapid expansion that would give buyers the confidence they’d be able to find electrons.

“The uncertainty has automakers scaling back EV investments,” BloombergNEF analyst Ash Wang said in an email. She added that “if we continue in this direction, BNEF’s outlook for annual U.S. charger installations in 2030 could be adjusted downward by 30% or more.”

The group has already reduced its cumulative estimate for U.S. charging installations to 285,000 from 360,000 this year due to the threats to EVs.

The IRA, signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, offers tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV buyers. Wood Mackenzie analyst Emil Koenig said his firm’s charging projections are based on the EV tax credit since it’s still in place, though WoodMac still lowered its charging outlook compared to last year.

Some Senate Republicans have indicated they’ll rewrite parts of the House proposal, so the tax credit may still survive. But its removal would “materially affect our forecast,” Koenig said.

The bipartisan infrastructure law also set aside $5 billion to build out charging infrastructure. But some states have suspended charging projects tied to that pot of money after the Trump administration paused implementation.

“President Biden’s ridiculous EV initiative promised much but delivered nothing, leaving American taxpayers to cover the cost of crony deals that enriched the Democrats’ base,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in response to questions about the slowdown in charging infrastructure. “President Trump was elected to dismantle the Green New Scam, and he is fully committed to doing so.”

A spokesman for Biden didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The U.S. currently has more than 208,000 public ports, according to the Energy Department. Additions are moving too slowly to meet EV demand, according to BNEF, with about 174,000 average installations required annually to keep up with its 2030 projection under a scenario that assumes no further energy policies are put in place globally. Halting government support for charging will deter investments in the sector, leading to plug scarcity and directly impacting EV ownership, according to an analysis by S&P Global.

Analysts are also closely watching how Trump’s tariffs will impact both EV sales and charging. About 35% of EVs sold in the U.S. last year were imported, and vehicles assembled locally with parts sourced overseas may see prices jump due to tariffs. That will keep price-sensitive buyers away, according to WoodMac.

Tariffs could delay the rollout of EVs in the $25,000 range, said Koenig. “These low-cost vehicle models will be pivotal for broader EV adoption and charging infrastructure deployment, so any delay would also materially set back the adoption curve.”

The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.

It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.

CATL also has shares listed in Shenzhen, a business hub neighboring Hong Kong. They initially fell but then edged 1.2% higher.

A supplier to automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Toyota and Honda, CATL held a nearly 38% global market share for EV batteries in 2024, its listing documents showed.

The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China's military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a ""mistake.""

In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.

In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.

The U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the Chinese military and U.S. investors inside the U.S. were excluded from the ""Regulation S"" share offering. Such offerings do not require registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.

The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.

Government officials, including Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city's vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.

""Listing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it's also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,"" Zeng said.

Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.

In 2011, a team led by Zeng founded CATL, headquartered in the businessman's hometown of Ningde in Fujian province in southeast China. The literal meaning of the company's Chinese name is ""Ningde Era.""

CATL says it has the broadest coverage of EV battery users globally, with its batteries installed in over 17 million EVs, or one in every three EVs worldwide, as of the end of 2024.

Terence Chong, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong hasn't seen an IPO of this size in a while and the listing may boost such activity in the city.

The exclusion of U.S. investors had little impact since there was sufficient demand for CATL's offering, he said.

The amount of funds raised through IPOs in Hong Kong rose 89% year-on-year in 2024 following a double-digit decrease in 2023, according to Yujia Li, an analyst at the Hong Kong Financial Research Institute of the Bank of China.

CATL recorded a profit of 55.3 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in 2024, up 16.8% from 2023. Its listing surpassed JX Advanced Metals' $2.9 billion IPO in Japan in March, which was previously the largest this year, according to Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs.",https://img.manufacturing.net/files/base/indm/multi/image/2025/05/CATL.682c82b88e21b.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&rect=0%2C6%2C4000%2C2250&w=1200,N,,2025-05-21 05:05:13.824103

Honda (HMC) on Tuesday scaled back its electric vehicle targets, citing diminishing U.S. demand. The Japanese automaker had initially planned to invest $69 billion in an electrification strategy by the end of 2031 but has reduced the figure to $48 billion.

“The environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day. Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of the EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations,” Honda said in a statement.

The decision is “a switch in the planned course,” said Honda Motor Co. Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe. Although the company remains committed to its long-term electrification, the roadmap faces delays, he added.

And General Motors (GM) on Monday halted exports of Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicles to China, and announced it will forgo plans to export other high-end models there. G.M. began shipping the America-made Tahoes to China last year, a spokesman said, under a scheme called the Durant Guild, named after G.M founder, Billy Durant.

“Due to significant changes to economic conditions, we have decided to restructure the Durant Guild and correspondingly optimize G.M. China’s operations,” the automaker said in a statement. Yet, it’s worth noting, Durant exports account for less than 0.1 percent of the 443,000 vehicles that G.M. manufactures and sells in China.

There are several obstacles weighing on the domestic auto industry.

Trump introduced a 25% tariff on cars and parts imported into the U.S. in March. Shortly after, the S&P Global (SPGI) downgraded its 2025 forecast for U.S. vehicle sales by 700,000. This is on top tit-for-tax tariffs: a 30% levy remains on Chinese goods, and U.S. imports into China face a 10% tax.

The GOP also has launched an assault on EVs. House Republicans have proposed ending Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for buyers, and the Trump administration is rolling back auto emissions standards.

New data suggests that EV demand could be slowing as a result. Installation of high-speed chargers fell by more than 21% in the first quarter compared to the year-earlier period, according to a Bloomberg analysis of Energy Department data. BloombergNEF has reduced its cumulative estimate for U.S. charging installations by 20% this year, down to 285,000. BloombergNEF analyst Ash Wang foresees annual U.S. charger installations by 2030 even dropping by 30% or more, “if [we] continue in this direction,” she told Bloomberg.

Souring consumer sentiment toward Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk may also be hampering sales. An Axios Harris Poll 100 on Tuesday revealed a 30% drop in Tesla’s reputation over the last decade, plummeting from “Excellent” to “Poor.”

Shares in Tesla fell by more than 50% between December and April, although they have rebounded in recent weeks as Musk reassured investors he would be taking a step back from overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.","https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/df5f6b27198ae2341cb9b8c607b9fe19.jpg",N,,2025-05-20 22:06:29.038354

Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) is placing a hold on the Trump administration’s picks for key roles at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over Republican efforts to ax a California state rule that phases out new gas-powered cars in the state.

The hold may not ultimately block the four pending EPA nominees from being confirmed, but it will slow the process, requiring the chamber to spend hours debating and taking additional votes for each nominee.

With a handful of nominees, holds are more of an annoyance, though in some cases, like when Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) put holds on hundreds of military promotions, they have successfully delayed nominations for a significant period.

Padilla’s office said in a written statement that his hold would last “until Republicans stop their reckless attempts to overrule the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision regarding California’s clean air waivers.”

Republicans are attempting to overturn the Biden administration’s approval of a California state rule that bans the sale of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035. They’re similarly targeting approvals of state rules governing truck emissions and air pollution.

They’re trying to use a legislative tool called the Congressional Review Act (CRA) that allows Congress to target recently issued rules using a simple majority vote, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster threshold.

However, internal arbiters in both the House and the Senate have ruled that the Biden-era approval is not a rule and therefore is not subject to the CRA. The House has moved ahead anyway, and the Senate has said it will do so as well.

Padilla, in a new statement, criticized how the Trump EPA has handled the approval, saying the agency submitted its predecessor’s moves as “rules” to Congress rather than a “waivers” to help get rid of them.

“This objection is a direct result of the agency’s cynical attempt to weaponize the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by attempting to submit as ‘rules’ three waivers issued to the State of California under the Clean Air Act (CAA),” he said in a statement.

“If this attempt is successful, the consequences will be far-reaching, not only for our clean energy economy, the air our children breathe, and for our climate, but for the future of the CRA and for the Senate as an institution,” he added.

Democrats have accused their Republican counterparts of using the “nuclear option,” effectively eliminating the filibuster when it’s convenient for them. However, Senate Republicans argue that because their parliamentarian’s decision was based on a ruling from the GAO, it should not apply.

The conservative view Many conservatives are determined to repeal or at least delay and dilute most of the clean energy breaks.","Start saying goodbye to a lot of big clean energy credits if President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress have their way this week.

The GOP-run House is ready to vote on repealing or diluting a long list of measures that, among things, currently allow qualified buyers of energy-efficient vehicles to get $7,500 back. Or permit consumers to get credits for certain heat pumps and other household energy savers.

Opponents of the changes see environmental and economic disaster

Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, tried to keep the credits intact. His bid lost in a 25 to 19 party-line vote in the House Ways and Means Committee.

Thompson pointed out that the credits are helping create jobs in Republican as well as Democratic congressional districts.

“To say stop…is crazy,” he said.

Supporters of the changes countered that the legislation would end a system that’s complicated, favors higher-income earners and discourages the use of more traditional types of energy.

The changes are part of the “one big, beautiful” tax and budget bill the House is considering.

The bill would extend current income tax rates and breaks due to expire at the end of the year. Republican leaders see repealing most of the clean energy breaks enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration as a useful way to pay for the changes..

All this has a long way to go in Congress. A lot of more moderate Republicans are reluctant to repeal the clean energy incentives. A group of conservatives dislikes how the breaks add trillions to the nation’s debt.

Even if the bill does pass the House, and leaders are aiming for a Thursday vote, it has to survive the Senate, where it also faces strong Democratic and moderate Republican opposition.

Help for consumers

Under current law, consumers can qualify for a credit of up to $7,500 if they buy a new, qualified plug-in electric vehicle or fuel cell electric vehicles purchased from 2023 to 2031.

Buyers have to use it themselves, use it primarily in this country and have a modified gross income of no more than $300,000 for married couples filing jointly or surviving spouse, or $225,000 for heads of households and $150,000 for all others.

Another popular credit helps homeowners. The Residential Clean Energy Credit is 30% of qualifying products and services installed in a home in this country from 2022 to 2032. The credit can apply to solar electric panels, solar water heaters, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, fuel cells and battery storage technology.

The internal Revenue Service says credits can be used for “labor costs for onsite preparation, assembly or original installation of the property and for piping or wiring to connect it to the home.”

Clean energy advocates say that rolling back these credits will be costly not only in dollars, but in environmental damage.

“This bill would pull the rug out from under one of the most dynamic parts of the American economy. These tax credits have helped deliver billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy,” said Christy Goldfuss, Natural Resources Defense Council executive director.

The organization estimates that the cutbacks would increase residential electricity bills in California by 3% by 2032 and by 6% by 2040.

That means every state household would spend about $940 more on their electricity bills over the next two decades.

E2, a national nonpartisan business group, said clean energy and clean vehicle companies added 149,170 new jobs in just the first year after the passage of the 2022 law, including 21,600 jobs in California.

Today, about 3.5 million Americans work in clean energy-related jobs, including nearly 550,000 Californians, according to E2.

Overall, the credits and other grants are estimated to add $133 billion to the state’s economy and attract $246 billion in new investments over the next 10 years, according to the NRDC, supporting 91,500 jobs a year in the state.

The conservative view

Many conservatives are determined to repeal or at least delay and dilute most of the clean energy breaks.

The law “contains eight major energy subsidies, each of which burdens taxpayers, inflates energy costs, and threatens the reliability of our power grid,” wrote 38 Republicans – none from California – to Trump and congressional leaders last month.

“Each of these subsidies props up unreliable energy sources while displacing dependable, proven energy like coal and natural gas,” they said.

At the center-right Tax Foundation, Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst, had another take on why changes would be useful: The current system is a complex maze of laws that few consumers can understand. A more comprehensible tax code would make more sense, he said..

“Tax simplification has two aspects. The first is a code without a mess of targeted provisions for various social policy goals. The second is a code with provisions that are simple and easy to comply with,” he said.

While the bill succeeds at the first goal, he still saw it not going far enough in eliminating complex rules and establishing new ones.

A lot of conservatives remained adamant that the breaks get tossed.

“Congress has to stop repeating history — we know that keeping wind and solar credits in this bill will drain taxpayers, offshore American jobs, and prevent American energy dominance,” said Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla. “President Trump has been clear: it’s time to end the Green New Scam.”

They’re in for a fight, especially in the Senate, where Democrats are planning their battle.

The changes are not about compromising this country’s energy strategy, said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

“It’s about protecting their oil and gas donors, ceding the global clean car market to China, and keeping Americans dependent on polluting vehicles that poison our air,” he said.

That was really the root of conceptualizing energy insecurity.

Jason Bordoff: While we often associate energy poverty with developing nations, the reality is that tens of millions of Americans struggle to pay their energy bills every month. Oftentimes, they forgo heating or cooling their homes in order to pay rent or buy food. And ultimately, they risk losing access to energy altogether through utility shutoffs. For families living in inadequate housing with poor insulation and inefficient appliances, energy insecurity impacts health, comfort and quality of life. For some, government assistance programs are a lifeline. Yet despite rising energy rates, federal energy assistance programs like LIHEAP are in danger of losing funding. So what policy solutions could address the systemic causes of energy insecurity? How can government assistance be reframed to better support and empower energy insecure households? And will the transition to clean energy alleviate or worsen the problem of energy insecurity?

This is Columbia Energy Exchange, a weekly podcast from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. I’m Jason Bordoff. Today on the show, Professor Diana Hernández. Diana is an associate professor at Columbia University and she co-directs the Energy Opportunity Lab right here at the Center on Global Energy Policy, and she is just out with a fantastic new book, “Powerless: The People’s Struggle for Energy,” which she co-authored with Jennifer Laird, an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology at Lehman College. It was released this year in April. Diana joined me to discuss the book, which documents the lived experiences of energy insecure Americans. We talked about her personal story growing up in subsidized housing in the Bronx and how that informs her research. We explored how innovative policy solutions might address the inadequacies of our current energy assistance programs, and we discuss the connections between energy justice and the clean energy transition. I really hope you enjoy this conversation.

Diana Hernández, welcome to Columbia Energy Exchange. So great to have you on the program to talk about your work.

Diana Hernández: Thank you, Jason. So excited to be here.

Jason Bordoff: And so great to have you as a colleague and have you as part of the Center on Global Energy Policy. The work you do is fascinating and you’re a phenomenal person, so just thanks for being part of the organization and congratulations on the new book, “Powerless,” which I was just rereading again this morning and just an incredibly valuable contribution, I think, to a topic we don’t talk about nearly enough. So in the world of energy, there’s a lot of discussion of energy access, energy poverty, and when people say words like that, I think they tend to think of places like Africa. They don’t think of our neighborhood in Harlem or other areas of the United States. So just talk a little bit for our listeners about your book and your life’s work.

Diana Hernández: Yeah, well, Jason, such a pleasure to be in conversation with you and to have the opportunity to just be on the podcast. So yeah, I mean definitely I think you kind of hit it on the nose. We think about people that are impoverished and lack access to something as basic as energy in other places, these are remote issues and they affect other people in other places, but in the shadows of what is happening in the US and in other developed economies, people that are poor and/or have limited access to high quality housing, for instance, do experience issues. I call it energy insecurity, and I can kind of explain why that terminology is important. Other people call it energy poverty. There’s been kind of evolutions around fuel poverty or energy burden. The work that I do in talking about it as household energy insecurity is really rooted in a parallel to food insecurity and in many parts of both academic research, but also policy, food insecurity receives a lot of attention, and it’s understood that it’s two-pronged. One is about the quality of food that people have access to and the ability to afford it. And the same thing is true around energy. There’s an affordability aspect to it that’s so fundamental where people just don’t have the financial wherewithal to be able to pay their utility bills. And those utility bills have been increasing and kind of inching up, and that’s part of what’s driving it, but also more drawdowns on household budgets. And so the affordability aspect is there are many different reasons for it, and then there’s housing quality issues, and some of that is about the systems of a home.

Jason Bordoff: So it’s not, when you said food, it’s quality and affordability. There’s healthy food, non-healthy food. But energy, it’s like you have heat, you have the lights go on you, so you’re not talking about the quality of the energy, you’re talking about

Diana Hernández: The home as the system through which energy flows, and that is actually what delivers comfort. For instance, we’re in a hot room right now, right? Yeah. Air conditioning is not

Jason Bordoff: Working in this room,

Diana Hernández: And it’s actually in those instances where you realize what it means to be in a room that ought to be at a comfortable temperature, and it isn’t. Now when that intersects with poverty, that actually sometimes is by choice so that people are under consuming energy in order to save on their utility bills, and that is a big driver. Destiny Knox’s work really talks about

Jason Bordoff: One of our former faculty affiliates.

Diana Hernández: That’s right. And the energy equity gap where people are waiting six degrees for the temperature outdoors to be six degrees higher before they’re actually turning on their air conditioning units. That’s an example of what,

Jason Bordoff: And in your definition of energy insecurity, if you’re accepting discomfort, it is uncomfortably hot to sleep or whatever, you don’t want to turn the air conditioning on because it’s expensive. Is that captured in your definition, sort of foregoing those comforts or basic needs, however you define it?

Diana Hernández: It is. So coping is a big dimension. So there’s an economic dimension. There’s the home, the physical dimension of energy insecurity, and then there’s the adaptive coping strategies that households use to get by. And some of those are juggling bills. And that is the difficult choices of poverty where people have to choose between the basics around food, medicine, clothing for children, etc., and their utility bill. Then some of it is discomfort, and some of that is based on the housing conditions. And then some of it is just deprivation, like depriving oneself of the use of energy because of the affordability challenges oftentimes.

Jason Bordoff: Meaning living in uncomfortable or even dangerous cold weather because you don’t have access to heat. You either can’t afford it, you need for food or other things, or maybe have been disconnected because of unpaid bills or something else.

Diana Hernández: Yeah, I mean then one of the things that comes out of this book, so kind of delineating the essential elements of energy insecurity, I come from a public health background. I’m a trained sociologist.

Jason Bordoff: Tell people about how you came to do this work, which I think you started 20 years ago or something like that, 15 years ago,

Diana Hernández: It feels like that

Jason Bordoff: With, as I recall it, a home-based study in Dorchester, Massachusetts, which kind of brought you to this work.

Diana Hernández: So I trained in sociology through and through undergrad, and I got my PhD at Cornell and I was studying inequality, and those were the kind of conceptual roots of my work. And in a really open-minded way in graduate school, I just decided to take on this research project that my advisor just couldn’t do, and she was like, I would do this project, but I don’t have the time, so why don’t you do it? And I really did go in with an open mind and what I learned to be kind of an open heart in doing this work because I was sitting in people’s living rooms trying to understand the relationship between housing and health, equipped to look at crowding and mold and lead and asbestos, but totally surprised by the energy stories that came up again and again. That was really the root of conceptualizing energy insecurity was just sitting in homes in Boston and trying to understand what was happening and then realizing that this was happening in many other places where I was carrying out research. Some of the issues, actually some of the topical focus areas of the research were none to do with energy, but it was still coming up because we know that energy is everywhere. And then I wanted to intentionally do this, follow up a national study based in 10 different places around the country, really varied. Montana, Arizona, California, Tennessee, Detroit, Pennsylvania, here in New York City, of course Puerto Rico, and I don’t think that’s 10, but you get the point. It’s far and wide. And just to really track people that were inside of the energy assistance orbit, like seeking assistance and then people that were outside of the energy assistance orbit, so maybe getting help elsewhere or through social networks.

And that was an important strategy because some of our prior research had shown, in fact, the paper that I co-authored with Jennifer Laird, who’s the co-author on “Powerless,” showed that people that energy assistance is a last resort. People aren’t necessarily going to energy assistance first. They usually go there in a moment of crisis oftentimes because you’re facing a utility disconnection. So it isn’t necessarily the first order response, it’s the last order response. And that’s why in many ways what we have as an energy assistance response or safety net in the US is really rooted in people on the brink of or already shut off.

Jason Bordoff: I mean, there’s a variety of assistance programs for important needs. Society has determined are important needs, food stamps obviously and others. Is there something different with energy where people are not using what is available to them and waiting until crisis, is that different than other things where we have social assistance programs?

Diana Hernández: Yeah, well, so, great question, and I think it really has to do with the fact that those other assistance programs are considered to be entitlements. So if you are income eligible, you are entitled to those programs. The way that energy assistance works, that it is a block grant to states, states determine how it’s allocated, but it’s limited and it’s limited both in terms of the geographies, what states have access to bigger pots of funding. All states have some energy assistance, some have more funding, and that depends on heating and cooling degree days. So what’s happening outside that might render necessary to heat or cool the indoor space. And then also the proportion of a state’s population that would be eligible by virtue of where they are on the poverty – in relation to the federal poverty levels. So there’s complexity to it. I think there are other drivers too.

Energy used to be really inexpensive and it is not a priority. So the first order priority in terms of a household budget is often rent or a mortgage, then food and then energy may be tertiary. So that’s part of why it also doesn’t get as much policy attention from the poverty world is that it just doesn’t rise up to the same level as healthcare costs or education or whatever. It’s like in the universe of basic needs. It seems like it’s the throwaway and usually for people that are able to meet their energy needs, it is a throwaway, but for people that are unable to, for whatever reason, it’s everything. I think this book really kind of shows the human toll.

Jason Bordoff: So talk about the book. It is for people who are low income, of course it is much more difficult to afford things many of us take for granted, food, healthcare, energy, and we probably don’t talk about that enough, but we know that is true. So what’s the contribution you’re making with this book beyond drawing attention to the issue?

Diana Hernández: So “Powerless” really just, I like to say that it tells a story of energy insecurity in the US, which by itself is a gift. And I say that because I was saying that I’m a trained sociologist and have been a researcher in public health for a very long time, and there really isn’t a book that lays this out in such a comprehensive way. And it was kind of a necessary story to tell because we can’t solve for problems like energy burden if we still don’t have a good handle on the why. So this book is really an answer to why should people care and how does it impact people on a day-to-day basis? And not just the neediest of needy, but also people that are just working, they’re on fixed incomes. They may have had a shock, they might’ve lost their job, and then all of a sudden they’re thrust into this hardship that is not that difficult to get into. But really challenging I think for some households to get out of. And I think this book really lays out how all of that unfolds using a narrative based approach that’s coupled with statistics from two different national studies. So not just showing that it’s consequential, but also that it’s pretty common.

Jason Bordoff: And that I think is what’s such a great contribution and makes it such a great book. And some academics, not all are able to do this the way you can. It’s both the narrative, the stories that really do put this in personal terms and help you understand how this affects people. But also it’s analytically rigorous. I mean, it’s research. You’re a faculty member here for a reason. It’s research and really, so for people listening, tell them what the findings of that research is, how we’re talking about what the problem is, how widespread a problem is this?

Diana Hernández: So on super conservative terms, right? Conditioned on affordability, you have a demonstrated need. You’ve either fallen behind on your utility bills or you report having difficulty paying your utility bills. We estimate that 10 to 13% of the US population experiences, actively, energy insecurity. And so that means that they have an economic demonstration of need, a physical and/or coping kind of combination of two or more indicators, but premised on having an economic need. But we also show that 40%, an additional 40% of the US population has a non-economic experience around energy insecurity. And that could be as simple as you live in an old home and you have single pane windows that are drafty. And no matter what you do, that draft is coming in and maybe you even live in an exclusive neighborhood that has, I

Jason Bordoff: Mean, half the buildings in New York leave their windows open in the winter because the radiators too, so they’re wasting energy. But for many people, I shouldn’t say most, but for many people that’s not an economic strain. So I just want to be clear between the 10 and 13% and the 40%, how you distinguish those two things

Diana Hernández: Because

Jason Bordoff: Those are both big numbers.

Diana Hernández: I mean, it means that one in two people in the US experience some aspect, an energy insecurity. We have only half of the population that is energy secure, meaning that,

Jason Bordoff: But sorry, just to be clear about what that 40% means. It means someone is drafty windows, whatever, and that imposes economic burden or that, what’s that

Diana Hernández: 40%? It’s the next experiential burden. I mean, it’s the same kind of discomfort that one feels in a room that’s too hot or cold. And when you don’t have control over the thermostat or in the building that we’re in right now, this is set by a date when they start to kick in the air conditioning unit.

Jason Bordoff: Is that why it’s so hot in here? I don’t even know why it’s so hot in here.

Diana Hernández: Well, yeah, no, oftentimes it has to do, right? These are mechanical issues. This is not necessarily about, I mean, I think Columbia can pay their utility bills for now, so that’s not really,

Jason Bordoff: Things have changed in the last two months – morbid humor, sorry.

Diana Hernández: But this is right. This is more of the, that’s why the physical piece is so important. That’s kind of why we distinguish between people that are experiencing the economic iteration of energy insecurity from people that have these other symptoms or it’s all part of a syndrome, a social syndrome. That’s what we call energy insecurity in the book.

Jason Bordoff: I sort of read the book as saying 40% of Americans may not meet your conservative definition of energy insecure, meaning they are currently foregoing basic needs, having utility shut off, but they’re like a step away from that.

Diana Hernández: That’s right. Or that you could be a high income person that lives in a building where the heat is controlled by someone else and they might be warming your apartment excessively. And for three or more days of the year, you’re experiencing excessive heat. And part of the reason why we use the more conservative number of 10% is that for us, the energy insecurity aspect is really rooted in not having the financial means to make the circumstances better. But you could still have these different expressions of energy insecurity, and in that case it’s really relatable, but you might be three paychecks away from a financial hardship. So you’re kind of at risk because we condition it on having two or more of the indicators at once. So these are people that already have one, and then they might be at risk of an economic circumstance that might render them, really put them in that 10% pool.

Jason Bordoff: And just to make sure our listeners understand, the 10 to 13% explain just again, that’s defined by

Diana Hernández: So yeah, prevalence rates, that’s usually in public health. You want to measure what proportion of a population is impacted by a particular disease state or diabetes, which is also 10% of the population in the US is impacted by diabetes and cancer. And in that sense, then you really do start to see the distinguishing factors around how much attention is given to conditions like diabetes and/or cancer, and not necessarily something like energy insecurity.

Jason Bordoff: And the actual utility shutoffs. What percentage of Americans are experiencing that?

Diana Hernández: So about 3% of the US population experiences disconnections and disconnections are the crisis point of energy insecurity. So it’s like what we call the tip of the iceberg. If you only focused on disconnections, you would only get the very worst cases, but you wouldn’t actually get all of the other indicators and escalations of risk that happen when people are experiencing difficulty paying, they’re missing or paying late, they’re only paying a portion of their utility bills, they’re accumulating debt, a lot of that debt that then becomes very difficult to get out of, especially for households that are on the financial margins.

Jason Bordoff: First, say a little more about how you came to this work because you grew up here in the Bronx, not far from where we’re sitting right now. And just talk a little bit about your personal story and why you’re passionate about this work.

Diana Hernández: I mean, this is not “me-search,” but there are ways in which growing up, I grew up in section eight housing. I grew up in a working class family. My surroundings were very much where there was just concentrated poverty because the US very much is segregated based on race, and my family is Puerto Rican, black Puerto Rican. And so that limited where we could live, right? In many ways, and that’s still true. I mean, we know redline communities still exists. There are still health consequences that are present day based on that. But I think what brings me to the work and where I can be a little more empathetic about it is that, first of all, I’m a nontraditional academic. I started my PhD too when I was 19, and I was sitting in people’s homes in my early twenties doing this dissertation research.

And first of all, the experience felt familiar. I was going in and out of people’s homes, but the people were people that I grew up with and I heard them and I heard their stories, and I trusted that they were true even if the academic literature had not yet caught up to the idea that this was happening. I feel like because I grew up under circumstances of need, my work is also informed by not just documenting the need and validating it, though I think that’s super important, but also really thinking about solutions. What do we do with this information, this book, I would not have felt that the book were complete if it didn’t also have an action framework, some sense of solutions that first we have in front of us and are available and need to be enhanced and amplified. But I think the other piece of it is we might just need to be a little bit more inventive. How do we absorb and support and center innovation community-based solutions really getting a little closer to the folks that know what’s going on so that we can also hear and imagine new ways forward. And I think this book really is, it lands there. It lands in this place where it’s like, okay, there’s hope.

Jason Bordoff: Is the problem getting worse or better?

Diana Hernández: Well, I

Jason Bordoff: Think in the data, do you see these numbers are going down or up?

Diana Hernández: There’s two ways that I can answer that. When you have a data-driven approach, you will always have nuance. So the way that I think about that in terms of rising rates and the fact that our utility bills are just more expensive is to me an indication that many more people will actually have energy affordability problems. And it’s not just because the utility bills are going up, but everything because of inflation is going up. Now we have the situation of tariffs. The cost of living is just higher. And so to meet basic needs, you just need more money. And that really is the root of the problem. But the other thing is that the health of our housing stock is also at best staying the same or getting worse. And so if we think about efficiency, installation drafts, all of the physical indicators of energy insecurity that we use over time, those are actually looking worse. And so if we think about the end, then we have issues like extreme heat where years ago you could be in New England and never have to even think about having an air conditioning unit that more and more places is less and less the reality.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, for sure. And so talk about the set of solutions that exist today. I presume you think they’re probably inadequate, but we have the low income heating assistance program. And what’s, what is the policy, the set of policies today to address this? What does that look like and how adequate is it?

Diana Hernández: Yeah, so the energy safety net in the US is really made up of two programs, and this is at the federal level. This is the low-income Home Energy assistance program, LIHEAP and the Weatherization Assistance Program, WAP. LIHEAP is administered through Health and Human Services, HHS. WAP is administered through the DOE, the Department of Energy. And that distinction is actually important because even though the energy safety net started in the same place, 1970s, the oil crisis, the need to provide heating fuels to homes around the US especially cold weather states, is

Jason Bordoff: Really, which disproportionately use oil for heating and oil tends to be more expensive.

Diana Hernández: Exactly. And that was really the beginnings of it. And at first it started out as a weatherization program, and then in kind of future iterations, it became a bill assistance program, but largely designed around being a heating assistance program. Still 40 plus years later, it remained largely a heating subsidy where the kind of secondary piece of it is around crisis. So this is why people are showing up to the energy assistance offices with a disconnection notice or an active disconnection. And then really down the line is cooling assistance and weatherization, much, much smaller parts of the energy assistance safety net. That is LIHEAP. And then you have weatherization assistance, which is really about improving people’s homes. Weatherizing, that’s usually a grant that’s just shy of about $5,000. So imagine the kind of home improvement projects that you could do with $5,000 where you also have the stipulation of a savings to investment ratio. And this savings to investment ratio means that you can only do the things – like maybe sealing and caulking – that would save enough money to actually justify the investment. So the big ticket items, those windows, we know the windows really matter, or sometimes upgrading the heating and cooling units to some more efficient version. Those are bigger ticket items that of course, exceed that limit and then also

Jason Bordoff: Exceed $5,000,

Diana Hernández: Exceed the 5,000, but they do

Jason Bordoff: Pay for themselves over

Diana Hernández: Time, over time, but that’s not how this kind of savings to investment ratio works. It’s a shorter time horizon. Plus the fact that, and we know this to be true also around heat pumps and other clean energy appliance upgrades, is that it’s much easier for homeowners to take that action than it is for renters to take those actions. So probably not surprisingly than many more renters –

Jason Bordoff: Just for people listening, the renters are not, you’re making a capital investment in the home, and if you’re renting, you’re not necessarily benefiting from the increased value that would provide. Right?

Diana Hernández: Exactly. Well, and then also if you’re a landlord and you don’t pay the utility bills, then you also don’t have as much incentive to incorporate these energy efficiency measures. And so there’s the split incentive problem, and then you also have the kind of decision making constraints and then the justifications around, I’m a renter, why would I actually go get into a program? I mean, there’s so many different administrative barriers to getting linked up so that only 20% of the US population, less than 20% of the US population, actually has access to LIHEAP and 0.2% of the US population. This is eligible households that have access to WAP.

Jason Bordoff: Oh, when you say only 20% has access to LIHEAP, in a sense, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Because it means you don’t want a lot of people to qualify for LIHEAP, right?

Diana Hernández: Oh, eligible, right? Well,

Jason Bordoff: You mean of the

Diana Hernández: Eligible household, so less than 20% of all eligible households.

Jason Bordoff: Oh, I see. Okay.

Diana Hernández: So if you’re eligible, right? If

Jason Bordoff: You’re eligible, you want people to

Diana Hernández: Be able to

Jason Bordoff: Access it.

Diana Hernández: Food stamps or SNAP, which is a supplemental nutritional assistance program, supports 82% of all eligible households. It’s an entitlement program. Meanwhile, LIHEAP, you’re looking at less than 20% of all eligible households.

Jason Bordoff: And the reason 80% of people who technically qualify just to say again, they don’t take advantage of it or,

Diana Hernández: Yeah. Well, I think it’s kind of limited and it’s understood to be a scarce resource. There are so many challenges to actually going to the energy assistance office, showing up with all the paperwork that’s necessary, usually reaching a point of crisis.

Jason Bordoff: But just to be clear, the 20% figure is the percent of eligible households who take advantage of the program would

Diana Hernández: Take advantage, who receive LIHEAP benefits. So a lot of the people that I met then in these energy assistance offices, so there are these networks of community action agencies, and they support households in different ways, including by providing access to energy assistance resources. Oftentimes when they’re showing up, they’re showing up not necessarily preventively. Again, if we use that health analogy, preventive health is the screening is all of the support that you need to maintain health, but then you have acute care, which is the emergency room or a hospital. So basically our energy insecure populations are going to the equivalent of an emergency room. They have an energy emergency that they’re facing oftentimes, and that’s when they’re actually going to seek help. But imagine that we structured our healthcare system in that way, in the way of supporting only people that are coming in with a crisis. We would never have health or longevity.

Jason Bordoff: We don’t do a good enough job with preventive care and we pay more for that treatment. You talked a lot about homes, right? Weatherization and heat and cooling. Your statistics in this book covers transportation, gasoline prices as well.

Diana Hernández: It doesn’t.

Jason Bordoff: Oh, it doesn’t. It’s just homes. No. Okay.

Diana Hernández: It’s just homes. So natural gas, electricity of course, and fuel oil would in some cases as well, but we really focus in on expenses for energy services, not necessarily transportation, although the government would actually think about it more in inclusive terms. Now, water, we do include. And water because it is a utility, not necessarily. We went in asking about difficulty paying water bills, and actually during the pandemic there was a water assistance program, the low income water assistance program that started and ended actually in a really short period of time. It didn’t have a long shelf life.

Jason Bordoff: So if you were policy maker of for the day and you could just make whatever policy you wanted, is the key simplifying these programs so everyone who’s eligible takes advantage of them, or is there a whole policy toolkit we don’t even have that we need to address this issue?

Diana Hernández: Yeah. Well, first of all, I think we need to, I mean, this is what I talk about in the book is reframing how we think about the safety net. So the safety net is really meant to catch people as they’re falling to break their fall. But if we want to actually take a more preventive approach to dealing with energy insecurity, we actually need to be rethinking how we actually provide coverage. And I think of that as being more like an umbrella. An umbrella covers someone, allows them to function, get around, operate, but they have a cover from the elements. And that cover in this book comes in the form of an action framework that stands for something. It’s called the SPARK action framework. The S is for screening surveys and public health surveillance. We actually need data. A lot of the data that we have is very dated, and it’s infrequent.

It’s also not localized. It’s really at the national level at best, at the state level. But what we really need are localized data sources, which is why anchoring public health surveillance actually is very helpful. This assumes that a lot of what we know will stay, but we’ll talk about that later. Then participation in energy, decision-making. Energy decisions are being made in terms of regulated utilities, for instance. It’s really meant to be in the public’s interest. Even municipal utilities, rural electric co-ops, same thing, right? There are really these missed opportunities for engaging energy consumers in all walks of life. And I’m talking about the other day I was presenting with college students and they’re like, I don’t even know where to begin. Well, they were graduate students, so they were actually paying their utility bills in terms of thinking about these issues. So that’s the P participation and energy decision making.

Affordable bills. I really do think we need to decouple all of the clean energy programs, for instance, from the fundamentals of making sure that bills, utility bills are affordable and affordable for households. So one of the big things that we talk about is that there isn’t a rate of variability in the same ways that other goods and services have different rates. So not everybody is living in an apartment that’s $12,000 a month. Some people are able to actually live in apartments that are based on their income and they pay what they can. And I think that we need to be thinking about rates not necessarily so evenly. Everybody pays the same amount per kilowatt hour. Well, that’s really, you have equal rates, but unequal burdens, right? And I think that that’s,

Jason Bordoff: So are you’re saying you would make electricity prices or even gasoline prices, income-based, like somehow different people show up at the pump, and I’m just giving that as an example. I know you were focused on homes and see different prices.

Diana Hernández: Yeah, I think if we really understand the human risks of, I mean in terms of health and survival, we would actually not overburden some households by paying one standardized rate. I think we would absolutely be able to slot people in and if they can afford more, they should pay more. And if that’s not within their means, we still have a societal obligation to ensure that people can meet their energy needs. I believe that strongly.

Jason Bordoff: How do you think about the policy responses – are they energy specific or are they broader issues of economic inequality? So I mean, I guess we’re talking about a theoretical world. You don’t get a first best set of policy solutions, but if you’re lower income, a lot of things are more expensive and a lot of things that are important to many others take for granted are a struggle day to day. The idea that you have the earned income tax credit or a host of other things we should do to reduce levels of inequality and give low income people more resources to work with, and then maybe they want to be a little colder or a little warmer, maybe they prefer to spend it on food. How much of the policy response is about economic policy and how much is about energy policy

Diana Hernández: That goes to the R though. I mean, this is literally about differentiating between a robust energy safety net, which actually would mean dealing with the gaps in LIHEAP and WAP, and then also a robust social safety net so that people had a living wage and they have affordable housing and they’re able to plug into an earned income tax credit. We know that the economic policy actually really does support low income households, and when they have relief from the economic pressures, they can go on to be professors at Ivy League universities. I feel like if I have to think about some of the investments in my own childhood, that was section eight housing, it was headstart, it was free lunch programs. You have to be able to provide those economic supports so that people can rise up to be all of the different things that are within their set. Those are the new imaginaries for their futures, but we have to believe first of all, that they’re deserving. And secondly that we have the social investments that we can see into the future that these are not just about right now investments and quick returns, but that these are also about, there’s real societal benefits. Let me just go through the SPARK framework.

Jason Bordoff: No, sorry.

Diana Hernández: The other pieces that came so many letters, we lost track. No, I know, but we were talking through, this is the umbrella, it’s comprehensive is about knowledge and energy literacy.

Jason Bordoff: That’s the K.

Diana Hernández: And you might appreciate this probably more than anybody because you’re such an important voice in energy thinking about energy policy, all of the different dimensions. But you know that this is kind of – the sliver of people that care about energy and think about it seriously is really small, but it impacts us in so many different ways. And it’s only in its absence that it becomes everything, otherwise it’s something that we just kind of take for granted and move on from. But I do think that there’s a lot of potential in building out energy literacy, and we need to do that well and better across populations. But I think specifically, and actually there’s a lot that poor people can teach us about energy and its consumption. It’s ethical consumption that I think makes it a bi-directional learning opportunity too. And then of course, energy efficiency and clean energy access.

Jason Bordoff: Sorry, when you say ethical consumption, are you talking about waste and inefficiency and is that what you mean?

Diana Hernández: Yeah. One of my first papers on energy justice before it became a very big field was about the ethical consumption of energy and how ethics are really about responsibilities. And responsibilities are also attached oftentimes to privilege. And as a society, we have to be thinking about places where we just use way too much energy. Part of the reason that our energy prices are increasing is because we have to be able, our utility providers are preparing for the worst case scenario, and they need to be able to provide enough energy when the temperatures are really high and everybody’s using their air conditioning units, etc. And I think that there’s so many drivers, but definitely the idea that ethical consumption falls on people that do have the privilege to not waste to be much more diligent and careful and leaving space and opportunity for people that are just trying to get by, make sure that their children are well taken care of, that they could be in their homes and be comfortable. Because right now we have haves or the energy haves and the energy have-nots. And I feel like the ethical consumption is really about checking the people that are the energy halves and waste.

Jason Bordoff: And part of that is about these domestic issues we’re talking about as I think I was just in India with our India program here at the center. And of course, that’s a whole different dimension where everyone there is, every time I come to New York, every light is on in the entire city and the middle of the night at three in the morning, and every time I go anywhere, everyone’s driving massive vehicles that use it. So this is a whole conversation with how the rest of the world views wealthy countries, particularly the United States.

Diana Hernández: No, I mean, I think that’s exactly right. And I think people don’t like to be uncomfortable or restricted in, definitely not in terms of energy use, but I think this book really just shows how restricted the poor operate when it comes to their footprint and energy consumption, and how much of that do we need to be thinking about for other populations that are not making decisions just solely based on affordability and then disconnection reform. And I really strongly believe that we need to revisit the practice of disconnections. What is the goal? We’ve moved a lot away from, or at least tried, let’s say in the realm of criminal justice, to move away from these harsh penalties and punishing issues that really are fundamentally rooted in poverty. And yet as a practice in the energy space, we still allow people to not have access to energy, despite the fact that this is not about grids and availability at a structural level, but it’s really about affordability. At what point do we take stock of this, make moral decisions about who has access to energy and who doesn’t, and under what circumstances should we extend more protections? And I just think that that practice has been increasing. There are more disconnections now. It is a very effective cost recovery strategy. And yet for households that are low income, it is jolting. It’s like,

Jason Bordoff: So, I mean, again, in a market based economy, if you don’t pay for something, eventually you won’t get it anymore. But is your point, whether it’s food or maybe even housing or energy for these basic needs, we just can’t think of it that way. And maybe it’s like public education. There are certain things that have to be a public good. Is that what you’re saying?

Diana Hernández: That’s exactly right. I, and remember that if you are hungry, and many, many, many millions of households are experiencing food insecurity, but there are resources like food pantries and SNAP benefits and other things that really allow people to meet their energy needs, people can get a hot meal somewhere. There are ways that that need can be met in kind in a way that is not true for energy, although one of the,

Jason Bordoff: You have cooling centers on very hot days, but it’s not about your home.

Diana Hernández: Exactly, yes. You have to leave your home, have to find a place. They’re usually not open 24 hours. So that means, and if they were, then that means that you have to sleep over in that cooling center. And again, those are important resources, and it’s not to take away from the importance of those kinds of resources, but it is to say that we just need to be thinking a little bit more robustly about why people might not have access to energy. And that might actually mean that in certain seasons we have more robust coverage, so people are not dying at home because it’s too hot or too cold.

Jason Bordoff: Can I ask you about the energy transition? If we want to move faster to a clean energy economy and install electric heat pumps and electrify and put more renewable energy on the grid, and does all that make this problem better or worse?

Diana Hernández: I think it makes it better. And

Jason Bordoff: Because it’s expensive to have an energy transition.

Diana Hernández: Yeah, no, it is of course. But as we think about public dollars and how we fund it, I think we should start with households that are presenting with energy insecurity and use that as a criteria for thinking about resource allocation and doing some of those upgrades for free. Because actually the payoff, right? Remember we were talking about the savings to investment ratio and weatherization assistance. If we broadened how we capture the investment, and we think about it as households that are relying on different public services as an example, we might actually, our investments could go further if they weren’t in the hospital,

Jason Bordoff: But in terms of the price of electricity,

Diana Hernández: Right?

Jason Bordoff: Coal super cheap. If you don’t think about negative externalities, if you don’t think about emissions and local pollution, and of course we know a lot of that in the environmental justice world related to energy justice like disproportionately falls on some of the communities we’re talking about. But if it means people talk about a carbon tax as a policy to reduce gasoline consumption or want people to drive electric vehicles, which might save money over the long run, but it’s more expensive to buy. So there’s a price impact in the transition. How do you think about that impact on the communities you’re talking about?

Diana Hernández: Alright, so I guess let me answer that question and just be a little bit more direct about what I think is the right pathway. So I think the right pathway is that people that can afford it should do more, and they might not necessarily have to have all of the subsidies or the same amount of subsidy, and that most of the subsidies that exist should really be targeted toward the lowest income groups. And in many cases, that actually might include not just some discount, but actually for some segments of the population upgrades that are done for free. And with the understanding that not doing it risks displacement and it risks other kinds of challenges on those households and communities. So I think that there are opportunities, and some of the work that we’ve done outside of the book here in New York City around upgrading appliances like stoves and access to solar.

There’s a lot of interest actually in solar. But if you’re living in a city, the question is how do I do that? And I’m living in a building and I don’t own this building, and even if I did, would I be the one that’s actually directly benefiting from the solar array on the rooftop? So there are really some big questions around the cost and the confusion and the logistics of getting access to solar in urban areas. Community solar subscriptions are a way around that. And though it may mean that the solar array isn’t necessarily on the rooftop, it does mean that there are benefits to the clean energy economy and that those are actually, there could be transfers of kilowatts. So one of the things that we talk about in the book is in-kind energy so that there are transfers. Your household could use a subsidy of 200 kilowatts or whatever, and there’s a pool and that pool provides it.

So kind of expanding energy assistance. But the other piece of it, and I want to raise this as kind of the fundamental issue that connects more directly to your question around stoves. So we asked this representative sample of New York City residents about their interest in moving from gas to electric stoves. Meanwhile, 86% of New York City residents are actually relying on a gas stove. And the vast majority of energy insecure households were very interested in transitioning to cleaner electric induction stoves. But the most privileged New Yorkers higher income white residents were less likely to be interested in giving up their gas stoves. And that to me is part of the tension. Who gets to choose who’s most hopeful about

Jason Bordoff: Why were they more interested? The bills are cheaper. The initial stove would be probably more expensive.

Diana Hernández: So the initial stove, I mean, and who knows if they’re renters, they probably wouldn’t be the ones making those decisions anyway, but there is this kind of hope for what the energy transition will mean in terms of people being able to meet their energy needs. And I think that hope really is around people that are having trouble today, meeting their energy needs, not really, and that their vested hope is more on the basis of the relief that this could offer, not necessarily in environmental terms or for some future, but the relief that is more to temporarily set in the now. And I think that’s kind of an important, we think about, oh, we need to reach scale and that needs to happen fast. And I mean, innovation in some ways is oftentimes rooted in solving problems that people face and that feel more proximal. So one of the challenges around the rollbacks of clean energy investments is that people don’t really see climate as an immediate concern. But people that are experiencing energy insecurity very much see energy issues as a right now issue. And they’re so willing to do more, but they’re facing different kinds of barriers. And I think those are barriers that we can overcome, actually.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, it’s the very local version of Europe is committed, I think, to an energy transition. But when energy security is really at risk because Russian gas is cut off, that’s when people really jump through hoops and do whatever it takes to find alternative supplies, US natural gas or coal. And they also did more efficiency and renewables. And that very important program for low-income heating assistance has been proposed to be eliminated. Is that right?

Diana Hernández: Yeah. So I like to say that LIHEAP is the backbone of the energy safety net in the US And earlier in April, the skeletal staff that administers all of LIHEAP for all of the states was let go. And then days later in the proposed budget, the Trump administration basically said that LIHEAP was redundant and ineffective and that it was a pass-through to utilities. It supported certain states like New York and California that are investing in clean energy and thereby increasing, arbitrarily, rates. And that’s what’s really concerning for, that’s the root of energy affordability problems, and that this was no longer necessary. And I actually think that that’s a really big problem because it is the primary way that the very, very, very needy that are basically using this as kind of to overcome crisis. Where will they turn?

Jason Bordoff: We’re just about out of time, but you co-lead something here called the Energy Opportunity Lab and your broader research agenda, which this book is a part, has helped shape that. Just talk a little bit about what that is and the work you’re doing more broadly even beyond this book.

Diana Hernández: So the Energy Opportunity Lab, and I’m so grateful to you, Jason, for trusting me to co-direct the lab and also to manage the domestic program itself is really rooted in energy access and affordability, both globally with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and in the US. And the whole point is, well first to elevate these issues and to give them the visibility that’s necessary. And that could only really happen in such a well-established energy center that has broad reach and where we could actually say, this is an issue. Listen to us. Not only are we experts in coming in with the data, but also with the credibility of being affiliated with the center and then thinking about it as research translation. That’s what I think of the Energy Opportunity Lab is really about saying the evidence base is really clear, so what do we do about it?

And we have goals around modernizing energy assistance. I mean, we walked in with that goal. Now we think about preserving it, but also maybe thinking about ways in which states and cities and utilities can start to amplify the issue of solutions for energy affordability. Thinking about rates as another place where we are now working on ways of thinking, re-imagining the ways that rates are structured so that they more support energy affordability. We have partnerships with government agencies, with utilities, with other groups, really to think about, well, what are the action steps that can be taken to support solving these problems, which in the US really show up as energy insecurity? At least my work really kind of suggests that. But in the energy transition, in light of what’s going on in terms of climate change, these opportunities to think about a more micro level, not only understanding of the issues, but also thinking about solution sets that are across the board, but also include issues that are a little bit closer to the ground.

Jason Bordoff: Well, you were kind to say thanks to us, but thanks to you for your leadership of that program and just your life’s work and for being such an important part of the senior research team here at the Center on Global Energy Policy and for this fantastic book and for talking with us about it. So Diana Hernandez, thank you so much.

,EVs,2025-05-21 00:06:56+00:00,Buffalo Toronto Public Media,Canadian Beat: Concerns arise over the future of Canada's electric vehicle market,"Dan Karpenchuk, www.btpm.org",,,,,https://www.btpm.org/from-btpm-npr-and-our-partners/2025-05-20/canadian-beat-concerns-arise-over-the-future-of-canadas-electric-vehicle-market,"There are questions about the future of the electric vehicle market in Canada.
It was only just over a year ago that the electric vehicle market appeared rosy, with a bright future as Canadians began to move away from gasoline-powered vehicles.
With this announcement, we will be investing to create Canada’s first comprehensive electric vehicle supply chain from start to finish,” Trudeau said.
Brian Kingston is president and CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
“Even more striking is the share of EV sales in the Canadian market.","There are questions about the future of the electric vehicle market in Canada. They’ve been prompted by Honda Canada postponing a $15 billion Canadian project in Ontario for two years. Federal government rebates are no longer being offered to Canadians who purchase E-V’s. Sales of the vehicles appear to be falling as Canadian consumer interest wanes.

It was only just over a year ago that the electric vehicle market appeared rosy, with a bright future as Canadians began to move away from gasoline-powered vehicles. Premier Doug Ford and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were on hand to announce a $15 billion project from Honda.

“Today Honda is making Canadian automotive history. With this announcement, we will be investing to create Canada’s first comprehensive electric vehicle supply chain from start to finish,” Trudeau said.

The $15 billion project would include an EV assembly plant, two parts plants, and a stand-alone battery manufacturing facility. The Ontario and Canadian governments would pony up $2.5 billion each to help make it happen.

Then a week ago, with President Trump’s tariffs looming large on the automotive sector in Canada and sales of EVs slumping, Honda hit the pause button, for two years, sending Premier Ford scrambling.

“When I’ve talked to Honda, they’ve promised us they’re going to continue on with their expansion. They’re going to keep that facility moving forward. So, we’ll see how that moves forward. But we’re very confident that we’ll continue producing Honda vehicles here in Ontario,” Ford said.

That could be wishful thinking. Statistics Canada recently announced that sales of electric vehicles in Canada fell by 44% from April of last year to April of this year. The federal government no longer offers Canadians a $5,000 rebate to offset the purchase of an EV, and Ontario hasn’t offered any incentives since 2018.

Brian Kingston is president and CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association. Kingston said Honda’s postponement is of concern.

“The fact is the EV market has slowed, and it has slowed quite markedly. And so, manufacturers have to respond to that,” Kingston said.

A recent survey by Auto Trader found that just 42% of Canadians show interest in electric vehicles – down from 68% in 2022.

“Even more striking is the share of EV sales in the Canadian market. At the end of last year, 20 percent of sales were zero-emission vehicles. Last month that dropped to 7.5 percent. So, the EV market is effectively collapsing at the moment in Canada,” Kingston said.

Kingston sees the elimination or lowering of government rebates, at a time when Canadians are facing tariff issues and higher prices, as a major factor. There is also concern about the charging infrastructure, which he says isn’t keeping pace.

When it comes to industry investment, uncertainty plays a part. Dimitry Anastakis of the Rotman School of Business said revolving tariffs from President Trump have put many industries into just that.

“Every day up and down, the tariff roller coaster goes, and that uncertainty means that if you’re a business leader you can’t make any real decisions around investment until you have some stability, security consistency going forward,” Anastakis said.

The renewed questions about the future of the EV market have many worried, especially among industry watchers to see how other large-scale EV projects in Canada, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen, will proceed. That’s put pressure on Canada’s newly appointed industry minister, Melanie Joly.

She said Honda has told her it’s fully committed to major electric vehicle investments in Canada, and she’s been in contact with the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Stellantis.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0162656/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F81%2Fd7%2F2e3bab4140b5a36034cbf5c92264%2Fap25127694489452.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 22:06:47.896591

Cutting CO2e Emissions

Ascend Elements reports that its lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃) production emits just 2.3 kg of CO2e per kilogram. That’s 86% lower than spodumene mining and 37% lower than Chilean brine extraction. The company plans to cut emissions to 0.2 kg CO2e per kilogram by 2030—a 99% reduction compared to conventional methods.

The lithium recovery process also sharply reduces PM 2.5 emissions. Ascend Elements’ Li₂CO₃ product pollutes 97% less than spodumene mining and 81% less than Chilean brine. By 2030, the company expects to lower PM 2.5 by 99.7% compared to spodumene and by 98% compared to brine extraction.

Ascend Elements Builds North America’s Largest pCAM Plant

Ascend Elements operates a battery recycling facility in Covington, Georgia, and plans to produce up to 3,000 metric tons of Li₂CO₃ annually there. In Hopkinsville, Kentucky, the company is building a Hydro-to-Cathode pCAM plant. This facility will support battery materials for up to 750,000 electric vehicle batteries each year.

Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe is adjusting his company’s course after recent events drastically altered the global outlook for combustion and electric vehicles. During the company’s annual business briefing, Mibe justified slashing Honda‘s global sales estimate for EVs while expecting hybrid sales to double between now and 2027.

Last year, Honda announced it expected to move somewhere around 2 million EVs over the next two years. That projected figure now sits at around 700,000 to 750,000 units. According to Automotive News, hybrid sales could instead skyrocket to over 2 million during the same time frame.

“It has become increasingly clear that the environmental regulations, which held promise for the widespread adoption of EVs, are becoming relaxed, mainly in the U.S. and Europe,” Mibe said. “In addition, the recent development in trade policies of various countries makes our business environment increasingly uncertain.

“If the EV penetration period is pushed back a little, I feel that it will be pushed back by about five years, especially in North America,” Mibe added. “The Trump administration will remain in power for four years, but that doesn’t mean that EV demand will bounce back immediately. I think it will be pushed back by about five to six years.“

While insightful, Mibe’s comments don’t exactly come as a surprise. Automakers throughout the globe remain invested—and therefore, persistent—in EV manufacturing and sales. However, they’re all dialing back their original estimates, which many analysts would claim were bullish to begin with. Perhaps the current climate is acting as a sort of reset button that’s emphasizing hybrids and PHEVs as the bridge to EVs.

It’s worth noting that Mibe’s mention of the Trump administration’s stance on EVs backs up what Honda’s former electrification boss, Shinji Aoyama, and President and CEO of American Honda, Kazuhiro Takizawa, told The Drive in August of last year. When asked what a possible Trump second term (at the time) would do to the company’s EV plans, Aoyama explained that such a thing would be foreseen by Honda (and therefore not a surprise). He also alluded that nothing lasts forever, meaning that the trajectory of EV development would continue, only with a built-in delay due to the political climate.

Mibe’s comments that EV demand would eventually resume growing lines up with the company’s long-term thinking, first shared with us in 2024.

“In contrast to the slowdown in the EV shift, demand for hybrid-electric vehicles is growing,” Mibe said. “In the end, the value of battery-electric vehicles is not yet equal to or greater than the value of the existing hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles. That is the main reason why customers have not yet jumped on the EV bandwagon.”

Honda has been on the hybrid bandwagon for many years, but it’s intensified its presence in the segment considerably recently. Even its racing portfolio in North America is made up of hybrid offerings, such as its presence in the IndyCar series and IMSA under the Acura brand. This weekend’s Indy 500 is being touted as the first hybrid 500 in history, something that Honda is very invested in, specifically from a marketing perspective.

Rival Toyota’s stance on EVs and hybrids has been drastically different from Honda’s, though both companies agree that having a balanced portfolio of vehicles is vital to surviving current market conditions. Both Honda and Toyota will continue to invest in EVs, but it’s clear that it’ll be done at a different rate than expected.

Under the Velvet-Wood deposit’s previous owner, Russian mining company Uranium One, a draft feasibility study did find economically viable uranium.
“Every mining company does this.
If you’re a publicly traded mining company and you want investors to give your mine money, you must provide a feasibility study.
Then there are special cases like the Resolution copper mine in Arizona, where the government’s hands are essentially tied under federal legal requirements to approve the conveyance of land to a mining company.","So far in his second term as president, Trump’s administration has claimed to have approved, expedited, or publicly endorsed at least 28 different mines and mineral exploration projects, according to a review of Bureau of Land Management notices and federal permitting databases, with more likely in the offing. Many of these projects may very well produce minerals required for key energy or defense purposes, and some of them are guaranteed to do so. But at least a few have not yet been proven to be economically viable in the way investors typically expect from mining companies.

Conservationists have decried these actions as an unnecessary risk to sensitive landscapes, which could be irrevocably changed without a guarantee of improved energy security. And even some in the mining industry are quietly noting these examples, saying they could represent a paradigm shift in how America treats the mining industry.

“This is what you’d expect from China,” a former veteran mining industry lobbyist told me, requesting anonymity to protect their current business from retribution. “The U.S. prides itself on mines that are good neighbors. The U.S. doesn’t have a perfect record, but those are things that it values.”

“I’m not saying the companies are going to do something wrong here,” the source continued, “but we don’t know that.”

The most headline-grabbing example of this rush to permit came last week, when the Interior Department said it would for the permitting of a large uranium mine in Utah known as Velvet-Wood. The department said it would complete Velvet-Wood’s environmental review within two weeks — a process that has historically taken years.

On first blush, abbreviating the approval process for a mine that will produce energy fuel for nuclear power plants resembles the sort of permitting reform that climate hawks and centrist policy wonks have craved for years. Velvet-Wood’s developer, Anfield Energy, claims the site will also produce vanadium, a strategic mineral used in defense-grade steel.

A deeper examination, however, exposes signs of haste that go beyond all deliberate speed.

Ordinarily, mines take years to develop for reasons wholly unrelated to the federal permitting process. Usually a project requires years of exploration and study to verify that the area where digging will happen holds proven “resources” and then “reserves.” Think of resources vs. reserves as the difference between lukewarm and high levels of confidence that minerals are not only present but also economic to mine and process. It is unusual for any mine to be built without proven resources, let alone reserves, and feasibility studies are the way companies usually communicate that level of proof to investors. These studies have also been a primary mode of conveying a project’s value and design to the government.

Until our present policy moment, the permitting process was so lengthy that it made little sense to pursue it without first giving investors the certainty brought by a feasibility study. Anfield and other companies appear to have found a work-around to demonstrate that certainty, however, at least to the government: Asking to dig in places where mines used to be decades ago.

Anfield has not yet completed a feasibility study for Velvet-Wood, which would include the site of a former underground uranium mine. The most recent study of the project was a 2023 “preliminary economic assessment” that documented some of the old mining infrastructure and otherwise largely referenced historical data about mineralization. The company stated in the report that the study was “too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them,” and that “there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.”

In Anfield’s own press release announcing the Trump administration’s decision to quickly permit the project, the company states that it “has not done sufficient work to classify these historic estimates” for uranium and vanadium at the site. Anfield did not respond to requests for comment on why the company requested government permits before finishing a feasibility study.

Under the Velvet-Wood deposit’s previous owner, Russian mining company Uranium One, a draft feasibility study did find economically viable uranium. But that study is more than a decade old and was not made public, according to press materials at the time.

In order to become operational, Anfield expected to have to update the decades-old plan of operations for Velvet-Wood, according to the 2023 economic assessment, which also said BLM would need to take into account the impacts of restarting a formerly operational mine, as well as mining in areas that have not previously been mined before. That’s quite a lot of work to complete in only two weeks. While it’s possible that staff at Interior got a head start on their review when Anfield submitted its mine plan last year, they have not confirmed anything to that effect since the department’s announcement about permitting the project.

Aaron Mintzes, senior policy counsel for the mining reform advocacy group Earthworks, told me the practice of approving a mine before feasibility studies have been done carries the risk of painting a misleading portrait to investors about a project’s viability.

“Every mining company does this. All of them. If you’re a publicly traded mining company and you want investors to give your mine money, you must provide a feasibility study. That’s how you know they’re telling the truth,” Mintzes said of this approach. “Investors should be upset about this.”

In an email, BLM press secretary Brian Hires told me that “feasibility studies are not legally required by BLM for mining projects.”

“The BLM continues to ensure appropriate environmental oversight including coordination with other agencies, balancing mineral development rights and responsible public lands management,” Hires stated.

On Velvet-Wood, Hires said the agency acted under “recently established emergency procedures” created under the Trump administration to quickly approve new resource projects. “The expedited review is expected to significantly contribute to meeting urgent energy demands and addressing key threats to national energy security.”

Time moves slow

Velvet-Wood is not the first mine Trump’s Interior Department has expedited so early in the approval process.

On April 8, the Trump administration gave Dateline Resources, an Australian company, a green light to build a large mine inside of the Mojave National Preserve. Like Velvet-Wood, the project, known as Colosseum, got this approval without a feasibility study. Colosseum would be a gold mine, according to Dateline’s website, which also states that the project is “prospective” for producing rare earth elements as a byproduct. The company cites previous radiomagnetic reviews by the U.S. Geological Survey and the project’s proximity of roughly 8 kilometers — or about 6 miles — from an operating rare earths mine, Mountain Pass. The company also cites decades-old information about the site from when it used to be an operating gold mine in the 1970s and 1980s.

Are there rare earths at the Colosseum dig site? There may be — but how much and how commercially useful they’d be are normally determined through a feasibility study process.

BLM approved Colosseum without any new environmental review, or at least nothing that was public at the time it made the decision known. Instead, it said in a five-sentence press statement that Dateline could rely entirely on a construction and operations plan from the previous mine, which shut down in the 1990s.

BLM’s press release also referred to Colosseum as a rare earths mine, with no mention of gold.

“For too long, the United States has depended on foreign adversaries like China for rare earth elements for technologies that are vital to our national security,” the release stated. “By recognizing the mine’s continued right to extract and explore rare earth elements, Interior continues to support industries that boost the nation’s economy and protect national security.”

Hires, the BLM press secretary, told me that the agency made this claim to highlight “the project’s potential to produce rare earth elements, which are required for economic and national security.”

On April 21, investors were informed that a “bankable feasibility study” was now “underway.” But that didn’t stop Trump from jumping far ahead of the usual process a few days later, publicly calling the project “America’s second rare earths mine” on Truth Social.

There’s a big reason this area stopped being mined, by the way: According to the National Park Conservation Association, the area is heavily restricted from mineral development under a law Congress passed in the early 1990s, the California Desert Protection Act.

There is a separate law that provides companies the ability to mine in national preserves and parks under very specific and limited conditions, and with the approval of the National Park Service, the association told me. Kelly Shapiro, an attorney representing Dateline, told E&E News in a story published last week that Interior told the company its mine plan of operations was “valid.” Shapiro also told the news outlet that “rare earths have been found at the Colosseum mine site.”

Dateline has now begun work at the mine site and conservation activists are sounding public alarms. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

Asked why BLM gave Colosseum the right to construct a new operating mine, Hires said the project site, which has not been active for decades, “is not a new mine.” He said the facility was granted the “right” to “continue mining operations” under the plan from when the site was active in the 1980s, which the agency said “includes exploration for rare earth minerals.”

A ‘critical’ issue

Before I came to Heatmap, I spent years writing about the mining industry. One of the stories I’m proudest of was an investigation into the amount of mining needed to build the vastly different energy and transportation systems we’ll need to fully decarbonize. So I can safely say this: We truly will need more minerals like lithium, copper, nickel, graphite and cobalt to decarbonize, and we might need to open more mines to get them, although recycling and technological innovation could easily reduce the tonnage required over time.

The Trump team has a different argument for mining this much. It says our country needs to wean off foreign sources of metals because relying on imports is a weakness in the eyes of hawkish security experts.

For the past decade, U.S. policymakers of both parties have rallied behind the basic notion that the country should stop relying as much on minerals from nations considered to be adversaries by the national defense apparatus, including China and Russia, as well as companies perceived to be substantially controlled by those nations. The idea first gained traction under Trump 1.0, leading to the creation of a list of so-called “critical minerals” that the military and domestically essential businesses rely on but are generally mined or refined in other countries.

Under Joe Biden, the “critical mineral” concept was magnified by multiple signature laws, including the 2021 infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which together established large grant and tax credit programs intended to stimulate a new American mining economy.

Trump has sped up the federal permitting process for some copper, nickel, and lithium mining and exploration projects. These commodities markets are ones in which China genuinely has an outsized influence, per national security experts, through market share and existing business relationships held by Chinese state-owned mining and refining companies.

Some of these U.S. mining projects likely would’ve been permitted no matter the outcome of last year’s election, either because their environmental impacts would be relatively limited or because they’d produce metals crucial for the energy transition that a Democrat-led government would have supported as a trade-off. Take South32’s Hermosa copper mine in Arizona, which the Biden administration fast-tracked and Trump 2.0 has signaled it will approve. A handful of these mines would supply a meaningful amount of defense minerals for which we currently rely on China, such as the Stibnite gold mine in Idaho, which would yield antimony for military-grade ammo as a byproduct.

Then there are special cases like the Resolution copper mine in Arizona, where the government’s hands are essentially tied under federal legal requirements to approve the conveyance of land to a mining company.

Other “transition metal” mining projects fast-tracked or endorsed by Trump 2.0, however, likely would not have been given priority — or even a second look — under a more neutral federal regulator. That’s because they are located in areas that officials under previous administrations fretted would produce outsized pollution risk and potentially run afoul of environmental laws.

Take for example the NewRange copper mine in Minnesota, which the company says would be the state’s only active copper mine if approved and constructed. NewRange is better known in the mining industry as PolyMet, which was its moniker for most of the nearly two decades it has been in the works. NewRange/PolyMet has struggled to get requisite permits, to the point of being referred to by its opponents as a “zombie” project, because it’s situated in an especially porous area of northern Minnesota covered in protected wetlands.

In 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency under Biden said the Army Corps of Engineers should rescind a water permit issued under Trump 1.0 because the project would violate the pollution standards of the Fond du Lac Tribe, which relies on the wet ecosystem to cultivate wild rice for subsistence and cultural practices.

At the beginning of May, the Trump administration added NewRange/PolyMet to a federal “transparency” dashboard that it says will soon have a timetable for approving the project under the same authority it fast-tracked Resolution. Representative Pete Stauber of Minnesota, whose congressional district includes the mining project, reacted in a statement that said the designation shows Trump “understands the vital importance of this project,” and that he looks forward to “seeing NewRange meet and exceed every permitting standard in a timely manner.”

This is an example of mine that, if approved hastily, would probably create new litigation just as fast.

At the risk of repeating myself, it’s not the only example of such a case, and there are more examples where the Trump administration has opened the door to new, legally risky directions on a mine.

Most notable in that pile is the Pebble mine in Alaska, which Trump halted during his first term but may be given what appears to be a last shot at survival under his new government. Decades of battle between a would-be gold mine and the denizens of Bristol Bay have dominated conversations around American mining. Opponents across the political spectrum have tried to stop the project because they fear construction would pollute the bay and its world-class fishing grounds.

The first Trump administration actually opposed Pebble after a private lobbying campaign by Donald Trump, Jr. and other conservative conservation advocates. Under Biden, the EPA issued a rare veto of the project area under a provision of the Clean Water Act. This was a step beyond simply rejecting the permit as it would, in the view of advocates, be a permanent restriction against development.

In February, the Trump 2.0 Justice Department requested a stay on the federal lawsuit filed against the veto by Pebble’s developer, Northern Dynasty Minerals, alongside top political leaders in the state of Alaska, who have argued that the agency overstepped its authority. On Wednesday, Justice Department attorneys filed a status report asking that the stay be extended for at least another month because while officials had been briefed on the subject, they “require additional time to determine how they wish to proceed.”

This indicates the government is still not ready to state its position, and leaves open a door for the Justice Department to flip sides. Northern Dynasty Minerals hopes a flip will happen. “This is an important position in any negotiation between a project proponent and a regulator, and for a process that could, hopefully, remove the veto and re-start the permitting process,” the company’s CEO Ron Thiessen said in a public statement made after the stay extension request.

It may be that even Pebble Mine is a bridge too far for Trump 2.0. But after all these other projects have gotten the skids greased, we must all wait with bated breath for the next shoe — er, pebble — to drop.

Everything’s going to be okay, Crux’s co-founder CEO Alfred Johnson told me late last week. In fact, “the business is in great shape,” he said. I was a tad confused. But as Johnson reminded me, the company always planned on being more than a mere tax credit marketplace. The question is whether developers will buy into this vision of Crux as the everything store for project financing.

In March, right before the company announced its Series B, Crux launched a debt marketplace, where developers and manufacturers can access financial tools such as short-term bridge loans, construction financing, and flexible lines of credit to fund the buildout of renewables projects. “The market size for transferable credits is $30 billion per year, while the market size for project finance debt is more than seven-and-half times as big: $230 billion,” Johnson told me.

This new offering may have come just in the nick of time. It’s also likely just the first in a series of platform expansions, some of which are already in the works.

“There are many more multibillion-dollar markets among the thousands of developers, manufacturers, investors, and corporate buyers that make up the market for U.S. energy and manufacturing project finance,” Johnson told me. Playing in all those markets is a lofty goal for a company that was founded just two years ago, but so far Crux has been good at defying expectations. After all, it’s been profitable since its second year, Johnson told me, a rare and rapid rise for an early-stage startup.

Crux shared some exclusive numbers with me that illustrate some ways in which it’s starting to outgrow its roots. For one, Johnson told me that Crux’s revenue for the first one-and-a-half quarters of this year is nearly 10 times higher than for the same period last year. While he wouldn’t reveal what portion of that was comprised of tax credit deals versus debt financing deals, he did say that in the two months since the debt marketplace launched, “lenders have issued $1.3 billion of term sheets.” Those are nonbinding loan offers, $700 million of which have turned into actual deals so far. “It took more than a year for the tax credit market to reach similar throughput,"" Johnson said.

In the meantime, Crux is by no means giving up on the embattled transferable tax credit marketplace. The company sounded a relatively optimistic note last week as it published a list of takeaways from the Ways and Means Committee’s proposal, stating, “This is the starting point and we anticipate that the final bill will take a more favorable stance on transferability and tax credits.” The company looks like it’s preparing to fight for that outcome, too, as a few months ago it hired new teams of tax lobbyists and brought on Hasan Nazar, former federal policy lead at Tesla, to direct these lobbying efforts.

Johnson said that the debut of Crux’s debt marketplace had developers, manufacturers, and investors rushing to its website in numbers not seen since the company launched. It logged more “inbound interest” on that one day in March than when it announced its Series A and its Series B — that is, more than on both of those days combined.

“We didn’t invest in Crux with the belief that this would be a transferable tax credit business forever,” David Haber, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, told me. The venture capital firm led the company’s $18.2 million Series A funding round. “We viewed that as a great wedge product to bootstrap a financial exchange that could help facilitate the types of financial products needed for this ecosystem,” he said. Clay Dumas of Lowercarbon Capital, which led Crux’s Series B, also saw the company as a so-called “wedge” into a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar opportunity to finance energy and advanced manufacturing through debt and a wide range of other products.”

Not all investors felt as confident that companies built around tax credit transferability could become a one-stop financing shop, however. As of now, most of Crux’s direct competitors — such as Basis Climate, Reunion Infrastructure, and Common Forge — haven’t expanded into other parts of the climate capital stack.

“We know the fundamental risk that a stroke of the pen can have in any of these sort of marketplaces,” Juan Muldoon, a partner at the climate software VC firm Energize Capital, told me. Thus far, Energize has not funded any tax credit-based marketplace, diligence platform, or underwriting tool. “We wanted to wait for signs of resilience and more complete platforms, more complete business models, versus solving for things that might be more transient in value,” Muldoon said. Last week’s committee proposals validate Energize’s core investment strategy, he added — supporting nimble software companies that can withstand political headwinds and change tacks quickly.

Crux certainly hopes that expanding into the debt market will put any fears of its potential transience to rest. After all, Johnson told me, “all parts of the capital stack are opaque, illiquid, bespoke and manual.” That includes not only transferable tax credits, but also debt and equity financing. “These are private transactions that require a ton of documentation, models, advisory lawyers. But it doesn't have to be as bad as it is,” he said.

But if the transferable tax credits do indeed disappear, many renewable energy developers may be forced to return to one of the most opaque funding mechanisms of all: tax equity financing, which Crux is not currently set up to facilitate. As my colleague Emily Pontecorvo recently explained, prior to the passage of the IRA, renewable energy developers who wanted to liquidate their tax credits had to partner with tax equity investors — usually banks — who would give them cash in exchange for an equity stake in their clean energy project and the benefits of their tax credits. But forming these types of partnerships is both legally complicated and costly, and thus not a viable option for many smaller developers.

Presumably, Crux could shake up and simplify this space, too. And while it’s made no official commitments to a tax equity product, the company’s website has been reconfigured to advertise it as the go-to platform to “source new opportunities for lending, equity, and tax credit transfers,” as it commits to “financing the future of energy.”

Crux has its work cut out for it, though, as often the more complex the financial transaction, the more customized it must be. “The competitors are offline advisors for the most part,” Haber told me. Thus, standardizing and digitizing as many esoteric and project specific elements of the capital stack as possible is going to be, as he put it, “their opportunity and their challenge.”

Johnson says Crux is up for it. “It’s never going to be, you know, one click buy it on Amazon. That’s a ridiculous and implausible concept for deals of this size and importance. But these negotiations and transactions can be so much better.” Efficiency, at the very least, seems to be something we can all get behind.

In its 2025 Business Briefing, an annual report outlining its strategy, chief executive Toshihiro Mibe said that Honda was reducing its planned global investment in EVs by 30 per cent — to $67.5 billion (7 trillion yen) from $96.4 billion (10 trillion yen) — over the next roughly half-decade because EV adoption has fallen behind the company’s initial projections.

As a corollary shift in strategy, the company plans to instead increase its production of hybrid-electric vehicles, a technology that allows consumers the comforts of both internal combustion engines and battery-electric vehicles.

Article content

But that shift means that its comprehensive EV project in Canada, which Mibe said has a “central focus on batteries” is taking a back seat.

Article content

“We are reassessing our EV strategy and road map, including the plans for the product lineup and the timing of relevant investments, including the one to build a comprehensive EV value chain in Canada,” Mibe said according to a transcript of his speech accompanying the Business Briefing.

Article content

The company said last week that the two-year delay to its planned EV project in Canada is not a prelude to a cancellation.

Article content

The project was announced in April 2024 with an original timeline to begin production by 2028, and included an EV assembly plant, as well as battery-cell manufacturing and active cathode material plants. A battery recycling operation was also a possibility.

Article content

The overall project was expected to have eventual production capacity of 240,000 EVs per year, and had attracted federal and provincial government support, such as tax credits, that were expected to defray $5 billion of direct and indirect costs.

Mibe said Tuesday that the project in Alliston, Ont. — where Honda has produced vehicles since 1986 — is still key to Honda’s electrification plans.

“One of our goals with this project is to take batteries in-house, as the core of electrification technology,” he said.

But Mibe added that electrification cannot be Honda’s responsibility alone, and must be done in collaboration with other companies and governments of various countries.

He added that “environmental regulations, which had been the premise of widespread adoption of EVs” are being relaxed in both the U.S. and Europe.

The six- or seven-seat SUV has room for families, youth soccer and the like, but feels a step above once you log a few miles.

SAVANNAH, Georgia — The 2026 Ioniq 9 three-row electric SUV is a dual-threat, with style and features to compete with premium brands like Acura, Audi, Buick, Lincoln and Tesla, but priced to take on upcoming three-row EVs from the likes of Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, and Toyota.

The six- or seven-seat SUV has room for families, youth soccer and the like, but feels a step above once you log a few miles. The Ioniq 9 is on sale now. Prices start at $58,955 ― about $3,000 more than the top models of gasoline mainstream brands like the Ford Explorer, GMC Acadia and Toyota Grand Highlander.

How big, how many, how much?

The Ioniq 9 seats six or seven, depending on whether the middle row is a bench or captain's seats.

The SUV’s wheelbase and overall length ― 123.2 and 199.3 inches, respectively ― are nearly identical to Hyundai’s Palisade internal combustion SUV, but the Ioniq looks tidier, lower and sportier, thanks to clever proportions and an elegant design that leans into elliptical shapes and body lines inspired by traditional Korean dress. A descending roofline and tapered “boattail” rear end contribute to a sleek and upscale appearance.

The base rear-drive model has a single motor that generates 215 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque rated 335 miles on a charge in EPA tests. Midlevel all-wheel-drive models have a motor on each axle, 333 hp, 446 pound-feet and 320 miles range. The top three trims also have AWD and are rated at 422 hp, 516 pound-feet and 311 miles.

A big 110.2 kWh battery can accept DC fast charging up to 350 kW and charge from 10%-80% in 24 minutes at a CCS charger. The same charge at less powerful Tesla NACS chargers takes 41 minutes, still pretty good.

Most owners generally charge overnight at home at 240v. That takes nine hours, 40 minutes for 10%-80%, enough to ensure starting most days with a full battery.

$7.6 billion invested and thousands of jobs created, without tariffs

Say what you will about Joe Biden ― and we all have ― the former president knew how to create manufacturing jobs and reduce prices. Hyundai built its “Metaplant America,” a $7.6 billion assembly and battery complex in response to incentives in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which encouraged U.S. manufacturing by offering tax credits on vehicles, batteries and materials sourced domestically.

Before the IRA, Hyundai planned to supply the U.S. with EVs and batteries built in South Korea for years before building any here.

Motivated by thousands of dollars per vehicle, the Metaplant plant shot up like a weed, building its first vehicle ― the smaller Ioniq 5 EV ― less than two years after groundbreaking. It's building 9s now, too, and will add other EVs or hybrids at a later date. The plant will eventually be able to build 500,000 vehicles annually.

A battery plant on the formerly wooded 2,906-acre site in Bryan County near Savannah will bring employment to 8,500 jobs paying 25% more than the county average, according to Hyundai.

Hyundai’s also building a second joint-venture battery plant in Georgia, raising total investment in the state to $12.6 billion, thanks to incentives passed into law years before the current flurry of tariffs. The current administration has threatened to eliminate the incentives.

'Here, Spot. Good robot.'

The Metaplant’s workforce includes two eerie but likable dog-like Boston Dynamics robots — both called “Spot"" — that inspect vehicle bodies with bright, digital eyes.

Management emphatically shot down social-media rumors they plan to replace humans with an all-robot workforce. Employment is rising, not falling, as demonstrated from a training center under construction and a welcome center that will include wings for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis, all of which are slated to build vehicles there.

Automatically guided vehicles that look a bit like self-driving card tables carry parts and vehicles through much of the plant, raising or lowering them as needed at each assembly station. Other automated equipment welds and positions heavy parts.

Driving impressions

I drove a loaded AWD Ioniq 9 Performance Calligraphy from the narrow cobblestoned streets of old Savannah over modern highways to its assembly plant, then on the winding, oak and marsh-lined country roads of the atmospheric Low Country.

It’s surprisingly maneuverable for a vehicle the same length as Hyundai’s hulking Palisade. The steering is responsive and direct. The suspension kept the SUV stable and level when accelerating, stopping and rounding curves quickly.

The Ioniq 9 is exceptionally quiet, thanks to active road noise cancellation, acoustic windshield and first- and second-row windows.

The seats are comfortable and accommodating, include a roomy second row and usable rear set. Cargo space is good. A small front trunk has room for charging cables or a little gym bag, but not much more

The displays are big and clear. Physical dials and buttons control temperature, volume, tuning and a handful of other features. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as is wireless charging.

What should be better?

The Ioniq 9 has few shortcomings. I wouldn’t mind a few more buttons in lieu of flat-panel touch points for climate control.

The base model’s power output ― 215 hp, 258 pound-feet of torque ― is unimpressive for a vehicle whose lightest model tips the scales at 5,507 pounds. Even peak output ― 422 hp, 516 pound-feet ― is mild compared with many EVs with flashy max-output settings.

The Performance Calligraphy I drove was more than capable in the kind of urban and highway driving most owners will do ― and I suspect few owners will use the other EVs' cutely named but range-sapping overdrive settings

Why buy a 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9?

A flood of appealing EVs has hit the market in the last year, but few SUVs with three rows of seats. That’s a surprise, given how popular those family haulers are with the public. The electric competition is limited to the Kia EV9, Rivian R1S, Tesla X, Volkswagen ID Buzz and Volvo EX90.

The Ioniq 9’s looks, comfort and advanced features should make it a leader in that class.

FLINT, MI – After nearly a decade of sustained effort, oversight, and advocacy, on March 19, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it is officially lifting the emergency order placed on the City of Flint under the Safe Drinking Water Act in 2016. This marks a historic milestone in Flint’s ongoing recovery and resilience journey.

The emergency order—issued in response to the water crisis—required the City of Flint and the State of Michigan to implement a range of corrective actions. Through partnership, investment and accountability, the City of Flint has met or exceeded all those requirements. The EPA has confirmed that Flint’s water system is now in full compliance with federal lead standards.

“This moment is about the people of Flint—about their voices, their strength, and their determination,” said Mayor Sheldon Neeley. “For nearly a decade, we have worked tirelessly to restore trust and integrity to our water system, as well as meeting rigorous standards. While this milestone marks progress, our commitment to clean, safe drinking water remains unwavering. We will continue to advance infrastructure, strengthen safeguards and ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated. Flint families deserve nothing less.”

Since 2016, Flint has implemented a corrosion control plan to minimize lead release in water, remained below federal lead action levels for eight consecutive years, and replaced over 97% of lead service lines. The City has also expanded its team of certified water operators, modernized water system operations and constructed a backup water line to enhance long-term reliability.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin noted the significance of this milestone:

“Today we celebrate nearly a decade’s worth of hard work and partnership at the local, state and federal level to ensure the residents of Flint have access to clean, safe drinking water. Even though the emergency order is lifted, our shared responsibility to Flint continues. EPA will remain a committed partner in supporting Flint’s water system long into the future.”

EPA Region 5 Administrator Anne Vogel added, “This achievement reflects the dedicated efforts of the City of Flint, the State of Michigan and the EPA in addressing the lead crisis. Flint residents can trust in the quality of their water supply.”

With the order lifted, regulatory oversight will return to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), which will continue to work closely with the City to monitor compliance and ensure long-term system performance.

Background

The EPA emergency order was first issued in January 2016 in response to the Flint water crisis. In the years since:

EPA invested more than $100 million through the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act to help Flint upgrade its water system.

Flint conducted a corrosion control study and successfully implemented optimal treatment techniques.

A new backup pipeline was constructed to ensure continuity of service during emergencies or maintenance.

Flint strengthened staffing, training and standard operating procedures, resulting in 13 fully-certified drinking water operators.

In 2024, the City of Flint entered an administrative consent order with EGLE to ensure long-term compliance with both the Safe Drinking Water Act and the federal Lead and Copper Rule.

Mayor Neeley concluded, “The road to this day has been long and hard-fought—but Flint stood strong. We thank every resident, worker, and partner who helped us get here. This is a milestone for Flint, but not the end. Our eyes remain on the future—on healing, growth, and protecting our people.”",,N,,2025-05-20 21:01:31.405129

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?","The Cadillac six-passenger Vistiq electric luxury vehicle is expected to have a 305-mile range on a charge.

With the Vistiq all-wheel drive is standard.

The question isn’t whether buyers will love Cadillac’s six-passenger 2026 Vistiq electric luxury SUV. They will.

The question is why it took Cadillac decades to build this baby Escalade ― easier than the massive original to park and helm through city traffic, but still packing the luxury, technology and sheer presence that’s made the Escalade an icon; arguably the most successful and important vehicle in Cadillac’s 122-year history.

Infusing the Escalade’s essence into a vehicle in the higher-volume midsize SUV segment seems obvious in retrospect, but Cadillac never tried. It built smaller SUVs, some very good, but none approached the Escalade’s status and swagger.

Honestly, though, who cares? The Vistiq rolling into Cadillac dealers now is such a natural fit for the brand that asking what took so long is the cheapest Monday morning quarterbacking. If you didn’t have the idea, you don’t get to call other people slow for not thinking of it sooner.

What matters is that the Vistiq has arrived, with the bravado, power and sheer heft that make the Escalade ― and the new Escalade IQ EV ― impossible to ignore in a market crowded with luxury and electric SUVs.

Built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the Vistiq is on sale now. Prices run from $77,395 to $96,495, excluding a $1,695 destination charge.

What makes the Vistiq special?

Cadillac has bet big on EVs. They account for 23% of sales so far this year, with a target of 35% by year end.

The Vistiq’s calling cards are:

Road presence

Advanced features

Comfort

Style

Room

Big battery, good range, poor charging transparency

A midsize three-row SUV with six or seven seats, the Vistiq plays in one of the most popular vehicle segments.

All-wheel drive from a pair of electric motors is standard. They produce 615 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque that blast the SUV to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.

A 102 kWh battery provides up to 305 miles range.

Cadillac continues GM’s refusal to quantify DC charging speed by the commonly used and easily understood, “xx minutes from 10%-80%” of battery capacity, but the Vistiq’s battery can accept 190kW current, adding “up to 79 miles in about 10 minutes.”

On the possibly naive assumption that GM’s acting in good faith, simple math suggests 10%-80% could be achieved in less than 30 minutes ― fast enough there’s no reason not to announce it.

When reality just isn’t good enough

An advanced new augmented reality system projects navigation information ― including arrows floating in front of the Vistiq to indicate turns ― and alerts. New optics make the display, which appears to be projected in space 10 meters in front of the Vistiq, clearer and more effective than earlier AR systems.

The Vistiq is one of a handful of vehicles that uses active noise cancellation to reduce road noise from the tires and suspension. That’s particularly welcome given that its electric drivetrain eliminates many sounds and vibrations that mask those noises in internal combustion vehicles.

Driving impressions

The Vistiq drives like a smaller vehicle. That’s a very good thing, particularly for a vehicle that can haul six or seven adults in comfort. The optional four-wheel steering tightens its running radius and enables quick, stable maneuvers at highway speed. An air suspension that’s packaged with the 4WS (four-wheel steering) smooths rough surfaces and virtually eliminates body roll, squat and dive in enthusiastic driving.

And it’s hard not to drive enthusiastically in a vehicle that combines inherently quiet EV operation with active road-noise cancellation and plenty of acoustic insulation.

The Vistiq’s smooth, quiet progress makes it easy to underestimate your speed. GM’s advanced Super Cruise hands-free driving system becomes appealing not just for driver comfort, but also because it maintains the speed you choose ― regardless of how quiet and smooth the Vistiq is at high speeds

Elegant, advanced interior

The interior is roomy and comfortable, with materials including carbon fiber, open-pore wood. Highlights include metal inlays in wood trim, ambient lighting and woven accent fabric made from recycled feedstock. The 23-speaker audio system has jewel-pattern metal grilles.

The instrument panel has 33 inches of continuous screen for displays and controls ― and eventually to stream videos when parked and charging. A separate touch screen handles climate, infotainment and other features, including apps from the Google Play store.

There’s useful luggage and cargo room. The third row of seats provides adult legroom when the second row is moved forward.

What could be better?

The touch screen is not responsive enough for some functions, including adjusting lumber support and other seat features.

Polarized sunglasses significantly reduce the augmented reality display’s visibility.

While GM makes third-party apps available through its Google operating system and adopts other Android smart phone features, the automaker’s EVs don’t allow Apple CarPlay, complicating some drivers’ accustomed smart phone use.

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?

The Vistiq’s broad stance, vertical lights and illuminated badges stand out. Like the Escalade ― like all Cadillacs should ― the SUV announces your arrival. It’s responsive on the road and in parking lots, thanks to well-tuned steering and suspension. The interior is elegant, roomy and easy to use, with contemporary touches like metal-inlaid wood, fabric from recycled materials, large and legible displays.

Advanced technologies improve everything from driving to enjoying music and flowing navigation instructions.

It launched a battery module compatible with most electric trucks and is setting up a network of battery-swapping stations.

EVs made up 20.9% of all heavy-duty trucks sold in China in December 2024.

China has become a global leader in electric cars and car tech, with one of the highest personal EV adoption rates in the world. But it's also ahead of everyone else when it comes to electric heavy-duty truck sales.

Electric trucks accounted for 10% of all Chinese heavy-duty truck sales last year. Gasgoo quotes the boss of Chinese battery manufacturing juggernaut CATL, Zeng Yuqun, saying that this will keep rising and hit 50% by 2028. If this trend prediction proves accurate, then diesel will cease to be the most popular means of propulsion for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, since natural gas and fuel cell electric vehicles are also increasing in popularity in China.

This popularity is spurred by new policies that encourage businesses to choose EVs over combustion vehicles and machinery. China is looking at ways of cutting carbon emissions, 60% of which it estimates come from commercial vehicles hauling freight.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) says the percentage of new electric trucks bought last year was even higher, 13%, and it rose to 20.9% in December of last year, showing clear signs of growth. It also notes that diesel truck sales made up 57% in 2024, down from 70% in 2023. Some 581 fuel cell electric trucks were also purchased in China last year, gaining a 0.8% market share.

Thanks to recent advancements in charging speeds—there are chargers capable of delivering 1 megawatt of power, which is needed to replenish trucks’ vast batteries without too much downtime—the People’s Republic is in a great position to transition to heavy-duty EVs quicker than other countries.

CATL also wants to establish battery-swapping station networks specifically for electric trucks. It recently unveiled the 75# standardized battery module, which the company says will be compatible with around 95% of all electric trucks. One station will be able to handle 700,000 kWh of swaps in one day, with each battery swap taking around five minutes.

It plans to build 300 such stations by the end of the year, and this battery-swapping network is the key to pushing the market share of heavy-duty EVs to 50% and beyond. By 2030, CATL intends to expand this network to cover 93,000 miles (150,000 km) of roads between 16 major cities, which would be enough to meet 80% of the country’s road freight needs.

The incentive for truck operators to switch to electric trucks is not just to reduce emissions and improve air quality, which is a big issue around major urban centers in China. There’s also an economic incentive. CATL says that using its battery swapping stations will bring savings of $8,300 (60,000 yuan) for every 62,000 miles (100,000 km) traveled.

Manufacturers of heavy-duty EVs in China don’t just want to sell locally. Long-haul trucks like the Windrose E1400, which looks like a Tesla Semi copy complete with a central driving position, are expected to enter production soon, with its claimed range of 416 miles with a combined tractor and trailer weight of 98,000 pounds (49 tons).

That’s thanks to a massive 729 kilowatt-hour LFP battery pack that can be recharged at almost 1 megawatt if sufficiently powerful chargers are hooked up to both of its two charging ports. Its efficiency, going only on the manufacturer’s claimed figures, works out to around 1.75 kWh per mile, which makes it more frugal than the Tesla Semi, whose claimed consumption is 2 kWh per mile while fully loaded with a gross combined weight of 82,000 pounds (41 tons).

This is just one of the many heavy-duty EVs coming out of China. There are dozens of them. Some offer even bigger batteries, with one from Sany packing a 1,165 kWh battery. That gives it a claimed range of 497 miles (800 km).

It's not hard to see a future where one of these is a hit. And with the infrastructure to support a true long-haul battery swapping network, a future where 50% of trucks are electric seems within reach.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qkqLlv/s1/catl-truck-battery-swap-station.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 22:07:05.072262

The General Motors brand reports nearly 8 out of every 10 customers purchasing a Cadillac EV are new to Cadillac, with around 10% of those customers trading in a Tesla.
That includes roughly 25% of customers trading in a Tesla this year for a Cadillac Lyriq SUV, up from prior levels of about 10% to 15%.
""We've always had good interaction with Tesla customers, but in the past, that's been in that 10% to 15% range [for Lyriq].
1, tier-one EV luxury brand.""","DETROIT — Cadillac's expanding all-electric vehicle lineup is attracting a notable number of new buyers to the American luxury brand, including an increase this year of Tesla owners trading in their EVs.

The General Motors brand reports nearly 8 out of every 10 customers purchasing a Cadillac EV are new to Cadillac, with around 10% of those customers trading in a Tesla. That includes roughly 25% of customers trading in a Tesla this year for a Cadillac Lyriq SUV, up from prior levels of about 10% to 15%.

""We see the opportunity to increase the conquest rate for Tesla, absolutely,"" Brad Franz, Cadillac director of global marketing, told CNBC during an event for the Vistiq three-row SUV — the brand's latest EV to hit U.S. showrooms.

That increase in customer conquesting, as the industry refers to it, comes as Cadillac offers a relatively full lineup of EVs and as Tesla faces declining sales and boycotts this year amid CEO Elon Musk's support of President Donald Trump and his actions as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Cadillac declined to speculate on if Musk's politics played into Tesla owners' thinking, saying the carmaker is ""building great Cadillacs that are conquesting customers from other brands on the merits of the products.""

Cadillac's current EV lineup includes an entry-level crossover called the Optiq, the midsize Lyriq SUV, the Vistiq, the Escalade IQ full-size SUV and soon a $300,000-plus bespoke Celestiq car. It also offers a performance variant of the Lyriq and a larger version of the Escalade IQ.

""The portfolio is the key,"" Franz said. ""We've always had good interaction with Tesla customers, but in the past, that's been in that 10% to 15% range [for Lyriq]. So, certainly, we're seeing a good jump in conquest rate.""

While Cadillac has had some luck luring Tesla owners, there's still room for improvement.

No Tesla vehicle is in the top 10 of any cross-shopped Cadillac EV over the past six months, according to Edmunds.com, meaning the majority of those customers aren't searching for Teslas against a Cadillac. The consumer vehicle research and data firm reports the top cross-shopped vehicles on its website for Cadillacs are largely other Cadillac EVs, as well as other domestic nameplates.

A potential reason for that could be that Tesla owners are not actually cross-shopping against their vehicle, just trying to find a new one, according to Joseph Yoon, Edmunds' consumer insights analyst.

""People leaving Tesla cars now, they're, in my opinion, making a very deliberate choice to get out of that car,"" he said. ""If your priority is to get out of the Tesla ASAP, then they're not, technically, cross-shopping Tesla for their next car.""

Yoon said it's common for vehicles from the same brands to be highly cross-shopped, adding the data is from its website and not representative of dealer trade-ins.

Edmunds reports the top cross-shopped vehicles for the Cadillac Lyriq — the brand's EV sales leader — are the Cadillac Optiq, Acura ZDX, Ford Mustang Mach-E and BMW 1X. They are followed by the Kia EV9 and the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox EVs.

For Tesla models, Edmunds reports other Tesla models top consumers' cross-shopping searches, as well as many Honda, Hyundai and Kia vehicles. The Chevrolet Equinox EV, GMC Hummer EV and Ford Mustang Mach-E are in the mix as well, depending on the model.

Yoon also noted that although Tesla and Cadillac may offer vehicles in similar price points, Tesla's top-selling models — the Model 3 and Model Y — are more mainstream cars than luxury.

Cadillac's target this year is to be the bestselling luxury EV brand, which does not include Tesla, although there is a valid argument that the more pricey Model S and Model X are luxury vehicles.

""Cadillac is leading the way with our EV lineup,"" Franz said during the Vistiq event. ""We're really poised for success. We're going to take this portfolio, now that Vistiq is rounding out the SUV portfolio, and become the No. 1, tier-one EV luxury brand.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107301197-16947288232023-09-14t213141z_126768134_rc2j83a61xi9_rtrmadp_0_autoshow-detroit.jpeg?v=1694728876&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-05-20 21:04:20.095617

Congress is set to claw back $6.5 billion in climate-related Inflation Reduction Act investments to help pay for the Trump administration's priorities, including tax cuts and mass deportations but critics said the move would cost jobs and blunt the administration's goal of energy dominance by reducing domestic energy sources.

Saul Levin, campaigns and political director for the Green New Deal Network, said if passed, $580 million in funding would disappear from Colorado's 4th district, represented by Representative Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.

""In the 3rd District, which is represented by (Republican) Jeff Hurd, there's an estimated $1 billion that has been invested through the IRA,"" Levin pointed out. ""Regardless of people's exact politics, most people don't want that money to be pulled out.""

The House Ways and Means panel plans to revoke tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and home energy efficiency improvements, according to Reuters. The House Energy panel's plan would cut funding for limiting methane emissions at oil and gas facilities, reporting greenhouse gas emissions, reducing air pollution near schools and expanding electric grids to bring wind and solar power to homes and businesses.

Philip Rossetti, senior energy fellow for the think tank R Street Institute, believes the subsidies for clean energy were too costly but did reduce climate pollution. He added the investments will need better transmission infrastructure to be effective.

""Princeton University did a study on this, and they estimated that about 80 percent of the emission benefits in the electric power sector from the IRA subsidies are locked behind additional transmission infrastructure buildout,"" Rossetti explained.

The automaker has reintroduced the compact crossover as a fully electric SUV, and it’s making a bold entrance with coupe-inspired styling, all-wheel drive, and a manufacturer-estimated 290-mile range.

Unveiled on May 14, the all-new 2026 Toyota C-HR Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) trades in its gas-powered roots for a high-performance electric setup. It boasts 338 horsepower and can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in around five seconds.

Bush under the authority of the Clean Air Act and expanded by subsequent administrations, the ENERGY STAR label is the mark of efficient appliances, electronics, new homes, and more.
By choosing ENERGY STAR products, a typical household can save approximately $450 on its energy bills each year, according to an estimate from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Many energy efficiency incentive programs—run by utilities, states, and others—use the ENERGY STAR certification to set which products are eligible for rebates.
Last month, nearly 1,100 companies and organizations urged the EPA to maintain full funding and staffing levels in the ENERGY STAR program.","When asked about the future of the ENERGY STAR program in a congressional hearing Tuesday, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin said that “this is not a statutory obligation set by Congress” and “this program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government.” In response, Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), said:

“Congress directed the government to run the ENERGY STAR program. Until now, the EPA has implemented that statutory obligation, and it’s been an enormous success. This program saves families and businesses more than $40 billion every year with a budget of less than $40 million. It’s an astonishingly good deal. Major industry associations have rightly rejected this notion that someone else could simply pick up this program and run it as EPA has, with the decades of trust it has built with manufacturers, builders, and consumers. Congress needs to step up now and ensure that the government keeps running this remarkably effective and popular program.""

Background:

In a hearing Tuesday in the Environment Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, Representative Darren Soto discussed the benefits of ENERGY STAR and asked Zeldin if he intended to ask Congress to shut it down. In response, Zeldin incorrectly claimed that the program was not required by Congress and could simply be run by a private entity.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005—passed on a bipartisan basis and signed by President George W. Bush—included a specific legal requirement for federal agencies to run the ENERGY STAR program. The law says that “responsibilities under the program shall be divided between the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements between those agencies.” It directs the heads of those agencies to “regularly update Energy Star product criteria for product categories” and “work to enhance public awareness of the Energy Star label” and “preserve the integrity of the Energy Star label.”

The ENERGY STAR program helps consumers and businesses save energy. Created in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush under the authority of the Clean Air Act and expanded by subsequent administrations, the ENERGY STAR label is the mark of efficient appliances, electronics, new homes, and more. By choosing ENERGY STAR products, a typical household can save approximately $450 on its energy bills each year, according to an estimate from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Last year alone, more than 330,000 buildings—comprising nearly 25% of all commercial building floorspace in the United States—used EPA's ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager® tool to measure and track their energy use, water use, and waste and materials.

Many energy efficiency incentive programs—run by utilities, states, and others—use the ENERGY STAR certification to set which products are eligible for rebates. Manufacturers and retailers use it to market efficient products.

Last month, nearly 1,100 companies and organizations urged the EPA to maintain full funding and staffing levels in the ENERGY STAR program.

Tuesday’s operation, carried out under the mandate of Executive Order 143, targeted structures unlawfully erected by Chinese developers who were warned but continued work under the cover of darkness. The Presidential Executive Order established a Taskforce Against the Encroachment on Beachfronts and Waterways, made up of key government institutions including the Ministry of Public Works, the Liberia Land Authority, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and local city corporations.

Speaking to the media at one of the most damaged sites in Johnsonville, Dr. Yarkpawolo expressed frustration that despite previous stop orders, developers blatantly violated Liberia’s environmental laws.

“When this backfilling started, I personally came here and instituted a halt order,” Dr. Yarkpawolo said. “But the Chinese continued to backfill at night. We’re here today to send a strong message: these actions will not go unchecked.”

The site is near several schools, including the Multee International School System, and residents have reported worsening flooding as a result of the altered landscape.

“This is not just illegal — it’s dangerous,” Dr. Yarkpawolo stressed. “We cannot allow individuals or companies, whether Liberian or foreign, to destroy our wetlands and put entire communities at risk.”

He clarified that land ownership does not give anyone the right to build without an environmental permit, which is required for any development project, including excavation and dirt transportation.

“Whether you’re building on dry land or swamp, you need a permit,” he said. “Section 75 of the Environmental Protection and Management Law strictly prohibits draining, blocking, or building in wetlands.”

Dr. Yarkpawolo confirmed that Ruixu Commercial Concrete, the Chinese company responsible for the damage, was never issued an environmental permit. As a result, their structures are being demolished in line with the law.

The EPA CEO also called on truck drivers to stop being accomplices in the illegal backfilling of wetlands. Dr. Yarkpawolo said any transportation of dirt for development purposes requires two permits — one for the site being excavated and another for where the dirt is being dumped.

He urged the Truck Drivers Union and the Ministry of Transport to enforce these rules more strictly.

The EPA issued a strong warning to both Liberians and foreigners:

Do not backfill or build in wetlands;

Always consult the EPA before altering natural environments;

Report any suspicious construction activity near water bodies.

“We are serious. We are not backing down,” Dr. Yarkpawolo added. “Liberia’s environment is not for sale. We are protecting it for our children and their children.”

The EPA reaffirmed its commitment to upholding Liberia’s environmental laws and protecting critical ecosystems for the future.

The planned vote sets up a battle between Republicans and Democrats over whether the waiver is a government ""rule"" subject to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to get rid of regulations with just a simple majority, as opposed to the typical 60-votes required to pass a bill. Democrats have described the GOP maneuvering as a ""nuclear option"" aimed at upending formal Senate rules.

""The administration says it's a rule. The GAO has said it's not.

The waiver, which gives California officials latitude to make their vehicle emissions standards stricter than those at the federal level, also allows other states to choose whether they want to follow federal standards or California's stricter ones.

""Obviously, the Democrats are going to make a lot of noise,"" Thune added during the Tuesday afternoon press conference, referring to the party's criticism of Republicans' procedural maneuvering.

""But the truth of the matter is, this has nothing to do with the legislative filibuster,"" Thune continued. ""This is the Congress and the United States Senate submitting to the body the question of whether or not the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, ought to be able to determine for us what it is and isn't a rule.""

Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian who interprets and advises on the congressional rules officials must follow, agreed with the Government Accountability Office's determination that California's EPA waiver is not considered a ""rule."" The discrepancy has led Democrats to claim Republicans are attempting to upend the Senate filibuster, an important tool for the minority party to gain leverage in the legislative process.

However, during Tuesday's short press conference, Thune slammed Democrats for complaining about the GOP's maneuvering around the filibuster, pointing out they have tried to knock it down themselves in the past when convenient for their party's priorities.

Concerns abound surrounding cost increases on imported parts, a depleted EV inventory, potential supply-chain disruptions, and uncertainty about future US tax credits for EVs.

Recent coverage of prominent EV manufacturer Tesla TSLA reflects such volatility. As Tesla stock jumped after temporary cuts to tariffs between the US and China on May 12, 2025, Morningstar equity strategist Seth Goldstein wrote, “Tariffs can cause inflation and result in consumers purchasing fewer items. In autos, Tesla’s primary business, this includes the risk that consumers will delay or forgo a purchase or trade down to a less expensive vehicle.”

Against this backdrop of uncertainty, we highlight two stocks integral to EV vehicle design that Morningstar analysts believe are currently trading at a discount to their respective fair values and possess wide moats: Analog Devices ADI and NXP Semiconductors NXPI. Wide moat designations are awarded to companies that Morningstar believes will maintain durable competitive advantages. [For more on the Morningstar Economic Moat Rating, read here.]

Analog Devices

Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide

Price/Fair Value: 0.93

Morningstar Rating: 4 stars

Sector: Technology

Analog Devices is a leading global manufacturer of mixed-signal and analog chips. Analog chips function by translating environmental conditions like temperature and sound into viable digital signals. The company supplies chips to a diverse range of end markets, including automotive companies, as well as manufacturers of medical devices, robots, and industrial machinery. In both fiscal 2022 and 2023, the adjusted operating margin for the firm hit 49%, though it has since declined to 41% in fiscal 2024. Morningstar anticipates, however, that the adjusted operating margin for Analog Devices could reach 50% by fiscal 2028, bolstered by a projected 9% average annual growth in sales. Considering Morningstar’s current fair value estimate of $245 per share, projections for fiscal 2025 are in line with a 3% free cash flow yield.

In recent coverage of Analog Devices, Morningstar equity strategist Brian Colello wrote, “We believe ADI has a wide economic moat because of its proprietary analog designs and high customer switching costs; since analog chips are neither particularly expensive nor do they require cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, high-quality analog chipmakers tend to retain design wins as the end product is being built, all while maintaining healthy pricing and strong profitability over time. An especially promising end market for the firm is the automotive sector. Semis are required to enable the sensors, active safety systems, and advanced infotainment systems added to cars today. Electric vehicles have even more chip content per car, and ADI is well-positioned, with a market share lead in battery management systems for electric vehicles.”

At a recent $226.68 per share, Analog Devices was trading at a 7% discount to Morningstar’s fair value estimate.

NXP Semiconductors

Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide

Price/Fair Value: 0.76

Morningstar Rating: 4 stars

Sector: Technology

NXP Semiconductors is a prominent player among automotive semiconductor manufacturers. Like Analog Devices, the firm’s expertise is not limited solely to automotive chipmaking, as it also sells to the mobile, communications infrastructure, and industrial markets. Moreover, through enabling near-field communication, or NFC, NXP Semiconductors powers the mobile wallet offerings of multiple high-profile clients, the likes of which include Google GOOGL and Apple AAPL. Although the firm lost 5.0% in revenue in 2024 and Morningstar models an 8.5% decrease in revenue this year amid tariff-related market challenges, Morningstar anticipates a recovery by 2026. Indeed, Morningstar models indicate that NXP Semiconductors’ revenue could increase 6% in 2026 as EV designs call for an increasing proportion of chips embedded into their systems. Morningstar’s fair value estimate for NXP Semiconductors currently sits at $280 per share, indicating a 6% free cash flow yield for 2025.

“We believe the company has a strong position in the automotive, industrial, mobile, and communications infrastructure markets through a combination of high customer switching costs and intangible assets,” Colello wrote. “Although the company sells into cyclical industries, the strength of these competitive advantages gives us confidence that it will generate excess returns over the cost of capital over the next decade and beyond. The merger of Freescale and the former NXP in 2015 led to a powerhouse in automotive semiconductors, which makes up more than half of the company’s total revenue. Like many of its chipmaking peers, NXP is well-positioned to benefit from safer, greener, smarter cars in the years ahead. It is among the market leaders in automotive semis, especially in microcontroller units, or MCUs, which serve as the brains of a variety of electronic functions in a car.”

Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, is beginning to scale up EV sales.","Electric vehicle (EV) sales around the world have grown fast in recent years. In 2024, global electric car sales topped 17 million, representing over 20% of all new cars sold worldwide. That’s more than triple the number sold just 4 years earlier, according to the latest report by the International Energy Agency.

The momentum continues into 2025, with EV sales expected to exceed 20 million, or more than one-quarter of all new vehicle sales globally. The year kicked off strong: in the first quarter alone, more than 4 million EVs were sold, marking a 35% increase compared to Q1 2024.

This explosive growth shows how quickly the global auto market is shifting toward electric mobility—driven by falling battery prices, better infrastructure, and strong policy support in key markets.

Countries like China, the United States, and several in Europe are leading the charge in this shift. Their efforts are helping to reduce emissions, cut oil use, and push new technologies into the spotlight.

Let’s take a deeper dive into the IEA’s Global EV Outlook 2025 Report to see who’s leading the electric car revolution and other key industry trends.

China’s EV Empire Expands

China has once again proven itself the global leader in electric car adoption. In 2024, electric vehicles made up almost 50% of all car sales in the country. China also accounted for nearly two-thirds (65%) of all electric cars sold worldwide that year.

What’s driving this boom? One reason is cost. Over half of all electric cars sold in China now cost less than similar gasoline-powered models.

RELATED: Experts Say China’s Emissions Peak Is Near: How EVs and Renewables Are Playing a Big Part

Government support has also played a big role. For example, in April 2024, China launched a trade-in program that encourages people to buy new electric or gasoline cars by giving them money to exchange old ones. While this scheme supports both types of vehicles, it has helped electric cars become even more attractive to buyers.

As seen below, the Chinese government has spent USD30 billion on EV production.

In addition, the Chinese government has extended EV tax exemptions through 2027 and trade-in grants through 2025. These policies give people more reasons to go electric. With all these efforts, under current policies, China is expected to hit an 80% EV sales share by 2030.

Europe Charges Ahead Despite Road Bumps

Europe continues to be a strong performer in the electric car space. Many European countries are seeing electric cars take up a larger share of new vehicle sales. In places like Norway, the share is already above 80%, while in others like Germany, France, and the Netherlands, the share is steadily rising.

The European Union supports this growth by setting strict emissions limits, offering purchase incentives, and investing in charging infrastructure.

In fact, some countries have already announced bans on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by the early 2030s. This sends a clear signal to both consumers and automakers to prepare for an all-electric future.

Even though sales dipped slightly in some parts of Europe during the first half of 2024 due to inflation and policy changes, demand bounced back in the second half of the year. Falling battery costs and a wide range of available models helped fuel this recovery. Europe remains a critical market, making up around 20% of global EV sales.

The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) reports that new electric car registrations in Europe, including the UK, grew by 28% in the first quarter. This increase brought the total to 573,500 units, mainly driven by a strong rebound in Germany.

America Hits the Accelerator

The United States also saw strong growth in electric car sales in 2024 and early 2025. Sales rose about 20% compared to the previous year.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, played a big part in this rise. The IRA gives buyers tax credits for new and used electric vehicles and helps manufacturers build EVs and batteries in the U.S.

By the end of 2024, EVs made up about 10% of new car sales in the U.S. California leads all states, with EVs making up over 25% of new car sales. Other states, such as New York and Washington, are following closely behind.

New models from both U.S. and international carmakers are giving buyers more choices than ever. At the same time, the charging network is expanding, making it easier for people to switch to electric.

Other Countries Show Promise

While China, Europe, and the U.S. lead in total sales, several other countries are making big progress in 2025:

India is seeing fast growth, especially in two- and three-wheeled EVs. Affordable electric scooters and rickshaws are helping more people go electric. While electric car sales are still low, the numbers are growing quickly thanks to local manufacturing and incentives.

Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, is beginning to scale up EV sales. Thailand aims to make 30% of its electric car production by 2030 and has started to attract foreign EV investment.

Latin America is still in the early stages, but countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Chile are rolling out policies to support EV growth. Charging networks are expanding slowly, and imports of electric vehicles are increasing.

Charging Infrastructure Supports Growth

One major reason behind the EV boom is the growing number of charging stations. In 2024 alone, the world added over 2 million public chargers, with most of them in China and Europe.

Fast chargers, which can charge a car in under 30 minutes, are becoming more common, making EVs practical even for long trips. Chinese carmaker BYD has announced its breakthrough in EV battery charging in just 5 minutes last month.

SEE MORE: BYD’s 5-Minute EV Charging: A New Era for Electric Cars or Just Hype?

In the U.S., public charging infrastructure is also improving. The federal government has invested billions in new charging stations, with a goal of building a nationwide network that works for everyone. More reliable and widespread charging reduces “range anxiety,” the fear that an EV will run out of battery far from a charger.

However, a major news came out recently that the Trump administration froze the $5 billion funding intended to EV chargers. This led some US states to bring the matter to court. The final decision will greatly impact the industry.

Automakers Race to Meet Demand

Automakers worldwide are responding to this demand shift. Nearly every major car company now offers electric models, and many plan to go fully electric in the next 10 to 15 years. For example:

General Motors aims to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035.

Volkswagen plans to make EVs 70% of its European sales by 2030.

BYD has already stopped making gas-only cars and is expanding rapidly into global markets.

The competition helps lower costs and improve technology. Battery range is improving, and newer models are becoming more affordable. As EVs get better and cheaper, more people are choosing them over traditional cars.

The EV market shows no sign of slowing down. If battery prices continue to fall and policies stay strong, sales in 2025 may hit a new record. With continued global effort, EVs could become the norm by the end of the decade.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2464612645.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 22:07:20.894380

If we want to stay globally competitive, reduce grid strain, and keep energy costs down for households and businesses, we can't afford to lose Energy Star.","One of America's most effective public-private partnerships is under threat. Not from foreign adversaries, but from proposed budget cuts that would eliminate the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program.

At first glance, Energy Star might seem like just a government label slapped on refrigerators or laptops. But behind that small, bright blue star, recognized by 90 percent of American households, is the nation's most trusted and impactful energy efficiency program. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, eliminating Energy Star would create chaos for consumers and businesses alike, replacing a consistent, science-based standard with a confusing tangle of inconsistent, often pay-to-play private certifications.

Energy Star is more than a label. It's infrastructure. As of 2024, the EPA reports that the program saves American families an average of $450 per year on energy bills. It keeps mission-critical facilities—like hospitals, schools, and data centers—running efficiently and reliably. And it's a foundational tool for grid stability, helping utilities and building operators cut demand and emissions without sacrificing performance. By reducing overall energy consumption and improving the resilience of critical infrastructure, Energy Star also strengthens national security. Lower energy demand makes the grid less vulnerable to disruptions—whether from cyberattacks, natural disasters, or supply shortages—while energy-efficient buildings are better equipped to maintain operations during emergencies. In an era of growing threats to our energy infrastructure, programs like Energy Star are essential for safeguarding both our economy and our national security.

In an age of soaring energy demand, aging infrastructure, and rising utility costs, Americans need more tools to improve efficiency, not fewer. Gutting Energy Star would pull the rug out from under efforts to modernize our buildings, decarbonize our economy, and keep costs manageable for families and businesses alike.

I've spent over 30 years helping health systems, schools, and commercial real estate owners achieve Energy Star certification and realize measurable savings and resilience. In the early 1990s, I worked with the EPA to help design and scale the very tools that underpin the program's commercial building platform. Today, through my work with RE Tech Advisors and Legence, we've helped more than 25,000 buildings—totaling 5 billion square feet—track and improve performance using Energy Star tools.

This work has real, tangible impact. Take our recent partnership with Avanath Capital Management, a national affordable housing provider. Since 2021, Avanath has used Energy Star tools to analyze utility usage and create best-practice operating standards that ensure greater efficiencies and economies of scale. More than a quarter of its properties are now Energy Star certified, and they were recognized as an Energy Star Partner of the Year in 2024. These improvements helped the company reduce energy and water use by 10 percent—years ahead of schedule—freeing up capital for property repairs while keeping rents affordable for residents.

At Harvard Law School, our team developed a decarbonization roadmap across 22 buildings and 1.2 million square feet. Energy Star tools were critical to ensuring compliance with local building performance standards and benchmarking ordinances. But beyond compliance, the plan is delivering lower emissions, cleaner air, and improved energy performance.

This is why federal agencies, per the U.S. General Services Administration, require the office space they lease to meet Energy Star certification standards. It's not about politics. It's about performance. Energy Star-certified buildings use, on average, 35 percent less energy than non-certified ones. If the program disappears, those gains evaporate—and utilities, taxpayers, and the planet all pay the price.

Despite decades of bipartisan support, Energy Star now faces the chopping block. Yet no private organization has the impartiality, scientific rigor, or nationwide trust to replace it. The federal government has the data, lab research, and technical expertise needed to run Energy Star effectively and transparently. Eliminating it would be a reckless mistake—and a costly one.

Congress and the administration must recognize Energy Star for what it is: critical national infrastructure that has saved billions of dollars, reduced pollution, and strengthened our energy system for more than 30 years. It's a rare government success story—one where the public and private sectors work together to solve complex challenges and deliver real results.

If we want to stay globally competitive, reduce grid strain, and keep energy costs down for households and businesses, we can't afford to lose Energy Star. Contact your representatives. Tell them to protect a program that works—for all of us.

The report comes amid the scale-back in climate initiatives and spending by the US, such as laying out plans to phase out clean energy tax credits and slash spending on electric vehicles and renewable energy .
The report also found that intentional and transparent policy by Asean countries can increase investor confidence in the energy transition.
Power grid integration was first mooted in 1997 to enhance cross-border electricity trade in South-east Asia to ensure energy security.
Eighteen key interconnection projects have been identified under the Asean power grid, of which half have been completed.","SINGAPORE – South-east Asia is a developing region with a huge appetite for energy, and investors in China, South Korea and Japan are now finding promise in investing in renewable energy projects in Asean.

A new report released on May 20 found that the number of international investment projects for renewable energy in Asean has increased by an average of about 15 per cent per year since 2020, with investments reaching US$43 billion (S$55.8 billion) in 2022.

This growth rate is higher than the global average of 11 per cent , according to the report by climate and energy research group Zero Carbon Analytics.

In terms of public financing, China was the largest investor in Asean clean energy with over US$2.7 billion between 2013 and 2023, followed by Japan with US$2.45 billion.

Meanwhile, South Korea invested US$583 million and Australia put in US$51 million.

The four countries are some of Asean’s largest clean energy investors, according to the report, adding that they are the major external powers shaping South-east Asia’s energy transition.

The five Asean recipient countries in the report are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

Asean’s electricity demand is expected to grow 41 per cent by the end of the decade , and renewable energy capacity is expected to increase by 300 to 500 per cent by 2035 , said the report.

However, the developing region – which is still heavily reliant on coal for its energy needs – needs foreign investment for the energy transition, with major financing gaps in renewables and grid development.

The report comes amid the scale-back in climate initiatives and spending by the US, such as laying out plans to phase out clean energy tax credits and slash spending on electric vehicles and renewable energy .

The US – one of the world’s largest emitters – also said in January that it would pull out of the Paris Agreement, a pact signed by nearly 200 countries in 2015 to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Ms Sharon Seah, coordinator at the Asean Studies Centre and Climate Change in South-east Asia Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore and one of the experts speaking at a webinar for the report on May 20, said that the global climate vacuum is “very concerning”.

“There’s been a lack of leadership... and the concern within the region really is about the normative effect that this can have on the other countries,” she said.

But the report showed that some economies in Asia seem to be rising to the occasion.

For example, China leads in the investments for wind and hydropower among the four countries, and provided US$1.83 billion for clean energy financing in South-east Asia in 2024 under its Belt and Road Initiative.

It also led in clean energy trade with the five South-east Asian countries , driven by strong exports of electric vehicle batteries, solar modules and wind components.

Meanwhile, Japan is the region’s bigger investor in geothermal and solar energy, with investments of US$1.3 billion and US$142 million, respectively.

South Korea was the largest exporter of battery components to Indonesia and Malaysia between 2017 and 2024. It also has a hand in financing mechanisms to support climate projects in Asean, albeit on a smaller scale.

The report also found that intentional and transparent policy by Asean countries can increase investor confidence in the energy transition.

The Asean power grid, for instance, finally made headway after Singapore said in 2021 that it plans to import around 30 per cent of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as renewable energy plants, by 2035.

Power grid integration was first mooted in 1997 to enhance cross-border electricity trade in South-east Asia to ensure energy security.

However, it was the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore (LTMS) electricity import pilot launched in 2022 that finally saw the region’s first multilateral electricity trade take place.

That same year, Singapore started importing up to 100MW of hydropower from Laos via existing interconnectors – cross-border electricity transmission lines – between the four countries.

An Asean grid will allow the Republic, which lacks access to most renewable energy options other than solar, to tap sources such as wind energy and hydropower in other countries.

Such a grid also allows countries in South-east Asia, where renewable resources are unevenly distributed, to trade electricity freely to meet rising demand. It would hedge against the intermittency of renewables by distributing energy more efficiently.

Eighteen key interconnection projects have been identified under the Asean power grid, of which half have been completed.

Ms Seah noted: “What (other) countries are interested in right now is to just explore what opportunities there are in the Asean power grid ... and assess whether (Asean) countries are serious about completing those other nine interconnections.”

On the heels of the L T MS project, t he Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines power integration project was announced in August 2023 . It aims to create multiple interconnections across the grids of the four countries, drawing on key lessons from the LTMS project.

Feasibility studies on the interconnections must be done before financing support can be sought for the subsea cables, said Ms Seah, who added that she expects to see more progress on the project in 2025 with Malaysia chairing Asean.

Ms Dinita Setyawati, a senior energy analyst at energy think-tank Ember who also spoke at the webinar, said that while the Asean power grid has attracted “a lot of interest” from development partners who are interested in selling their technologies, the project has to first materialise before investors crowd in.

She added that energy transition is not only about replacing fossil fuels with renewables or financing renewable energy projects, but also about looking into investment in infrastructure like power grids and upskilling of workers in the industry.

The Asean power grid would have many benefits for countries in the region other than providing green electricity, including the creation of new jobs, reduced air pollution, and significant investments generated for the energy sector.

According to the first phase of the US-Singapore feasibility study on regional energy connectivity, the regional grid can generate US$2 billion annually in research and development, and create as many as 9,000 jobs a year.

Ms Seah said: “It’s a good thing that the region has actually decided that physical interconnectivity will be a manifestation of what they really want to do, which is to integrate economically.”

She added: “But the Asean power grid has been discussed for the last three decades, so it really needs a few countries to be a champion of the Asean power grid and to bring it to fruition.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1303f6a29d4c81f54f1e2b55b12569e8b4c359b1d83c89a1610294c8ebc18d45,N,,2025-05-20 22:07:25.093443

Watch the full hearing here.

Below are key excerpts from today’s hearing:

Congressman Bob Latta (OH-05): “For far too long, the EPA has ballooned well beyond its original scope. Over time, the agency has amassed sweeping regulatory powers that increasingly bypass legislative oversight. What does that leave us with? High costs for the taxpayer, burdensome, unworkable regulatory conditions for industry, stifled innovation and manufacturing, and energy insecurity with decreased domestic production, high costs, and federal overreach for our energy mix. We had heard extensive testimony from industrial leaders across the board that the Biden Administration’s EPA stands for is technologically unfeasible. President Trump proposed a discretionary budget that decreases the EPA budget by over half of last year's budget, making many commonsense reforms to spend American taxpayer dollars in thoughtful ways to effectively improve our environment. What are your thoughts, especially when we hear from the industry that the Biden-Harris Administration’s EPA would come up with some kind of a standard—that there was no existing technology to even meet—but they were demanding that it be done? In a lot of cases, it was just going to put businesses out of business, because they couldn't meet these standards. So, how do you see the EPA dealing in with issues like this in the future?” Administrator Zeldin: “We inherited a lot of regulations that were enacted in 2023, 2024 seeking to strangulate the economy, choosing to suffocate the economy as if it's a binary choice between protecting the environment and growing the economy. The Trump EPA chooses both.”

Congressman Jay Obernolte (CA-23): “I wanted to ask you specifically about a concern I have about some of the reductions in force that have been occurring at the EPA, and I understand this is out of desire to right size the agency – that’s something I certainly am very supportive of that. However, many agencies rely on the EPA to do things like issue permits or issue approvals or review plans, and there has been concern expressed that the reductions in force, even though we're transforming the EPA into a more streamlined organization, will result in delays in those approvals and permits getting issued. Can you give us some assurances that that is not the intention?” Administrator Zeldin: “Congressman, yes, we are going to fulfill all of our statutory obligations, and the way that the reorganization was proposed a couple of weeks ago allows us to better focus on those statutory obligations and reduce the backlogs. So, for example, as I referenced earlier with a couple of your colleagues, we inherited a massive backlog with the pesticide review, a massive backlog with chemical review with state implementation plans with small refinery exemptions, and much more. We are putting resources into getting through those backlogs we inherited as quickly as possible. And, with the pesticide review backlog as one of the examples, we have already worked through over 2,300 of those backlogged cases. We'll continue at that pace, and we're taking measures to increase the pace of working through the backlog we inherited.”

Congresswoman Julie Fedorchak (ND-AL): “One of the first actions I took in this role was to write to President Trump and Secretary Burgum to ask them to repeal 20 burdensome rules and regulations from the previous administration – and you're well on your way to doing that. You have outlined a number of grave abuses from the last administration, and I would say one of the gravest abuses was the impact the past administration had on our power sector. I come from the regulatory side of things. I was the most recently the president of the National Utility regulators Association, and in that role, I worked hard to get the last administration to be reasonable on their 111D rules. They completely ignored everything we said. They ignored the power grid operators, and that rule was completely disconnected from reality. Even though it's being pulled back, it had grave consequences on our power grid, and today we are short or dangerously short of having enough power to meet demand because of that agency's overreach in the last administration. So, thank you for your commitment to correcting that and getting us back on track.” Administrator Zeldin: “I often get asked what the biggest surprise or what was most shocking. Once I was confirmed as administrator, and I would say it was surprising how much we were able to do at once. We've heard your calls for action at the agency and we want to tackle it all at the same time. We don't want to pace ourselves.”

Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday morning that the Senate will take up the vote to overturn waivers the Environmental Protection Agency granted to California that allowed the state to phase out gas-powered cars. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the Congressional Review Act — the legislative vehicle Republicans plan to use to overturn the policy — does not apply to waivers.

Ignoring Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough could open the door to ignoring her decisions later this year, when she will decide which policies can be part of the reconciliation bill and which should be subject to a 60-vote threshold filibuster. Democrats have warned that overruling the parliamentarian foreshadows how Republicans approach Senate rules in the near future, particularly as it applies to the Byrd Rule, which restricts what can be part of a reconciliation bill.

Thune dismissed this possibility in this floor speech, saying that Democrats’ concerns “are entirely misplaced.”

Thune called concerns that overruling the parliamentarian on this waiver will eventually open the door to ending the filibuster “hysterical.”

“We are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate,” he said. “The EPA has submitted the waivers to Congress as rules, which is all that Congress has ever needed to decide something under the Congressional Review Act.”

Conservative and liberal legal experts are sharply divided about whether the Senate’s move can be subject to legal challenge, because the Senate is making a choice about its own procedures and has the authority to do so. The CRA has been used so rarely since its creation that its boundaries have not been thoroughly tested, and many gray areas remain, experts told NOTUS.

Many automakers and industry alliances lobbied for Congress to take up the repeal of California’s EV mandate, concerned more with the economic consequences of the EV mandate than any question of Senate procedure.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) criticized Senate Republicans’ decision to overrule the parliamentarian.

“The use of the Congressional Review Act resolution is inconsistent with past precedent and violates the plain language of the Congressional Review Act itself as recognized by both the nonpartisan and well-reasoned analyses of the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian,” a spokesperson with CARB told NOTUS. “The vote does not change CARB’s authority.

Be aware that state regulations may still apply even if federal CWA jurisdiction is not asserted.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plan to again redefine ""waters of the United States"" (WOTUS). This definition is critical. It determines the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act (CWA), the principal federal statute aimed at protecting the nation's waters from pollution.

This latest move follows years of fluctuating WOTUS interpretations across multiple administrations. It directly responds to the Supreme Court's pivotal 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which substantially narrowed federal jurisdiction, particularly over wetlands.

Sackett’s Effect and the 2023 Conforming Rule

The Sackett ruling established a more restrictive test for CWA jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that CWA jurisdiction extends only to wetlands that possess a ""continuous surface connection"" to waterbodies that are themselves WOTUS. This rejected the agencies' prior interpretations that could include wetlands separated by dry land. For other water bodies like streams and lakes, the Court limited CWA jurisdiction to those that are “relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing.”

While the Sackett decision clarified that temporary breaks in surface connection (e.g., due to low tides or drought) do not necessarily negate jurisdiction, it also affirmed that intermittent and ephemeral streams are generally outside CWA jurisdiction. Notably, the Court did not provide a definition for ""relatively permanent"" waters.

Historically, the treatment of ditches under the CWA has also been a point of contention. While agencies often considered ditches jurisdictional unless specifically exempted, the Supreme Court's earlier decision in United States v. Rapanos suggested most ditches are not jurisdictional. The Court classified them as point sources rather than navigable waters, noting their typically intermittent flow. The Sackett majority did not directly address jurisdiction over ditches, though Justice Thomas' concurrence observed that a roadside ditch in that case was not a jurisdictional tributary.

In response to Sackett, the Biden administration issued the “2023 Conforming Rule” to align the WOTUS definition with the Supreme Court’s directives. However, this rule, while removing language inconsistent with Sackett, did not define ""continuous surface connection"" or ""relatively permanent"" waters. Consequently, the WOTUS definition remains a subject of debate, with critics asserting the 2023 rule lacks necessary clarity.

The New WOTUS Initiative: Seeking Clarity and Consistency

The agencies' March 24 announcement signals an intent to further refine the WOTUS definition. The EPA reasoned that the 2023 Conforming Rule may not fully align with the Sackett decision and raised questions regarding its interpretation and practical application. In the announcement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stressed the importance of clear and consistent regulations for all stakeholders, including states, farmers and small businesses. He noted concerns that the previous definitions could impose undue burdens and increase business costs.

The new initiative will involve gathering public input on several key aspects of the WOTUS definition, specifically concerning:

The geographic scope of “relatively permanent” waters

The meaning of “continuous surface connection”

The jurisdictional status of ditches

The agencies emphasized a commitment to practical implementation and efficient regulatory processes, aligning with goals previously stated during the Trump administration. In the interim, the agencies issued a policy memorandum regarding “abutting” wetlands. This guidance aims to help distinguish non-jurisdictional wetlands near jurisdictional waters (but separated by features like uplands, berms or dikes) from those with a continuous surface connection.

Impacts for Regulated Entities

The ongoing evolution of the WOTUS definition creates continued uncertainty for landowners, developers, agricultural producers and other regulated entities. The scope of WOTUS directly impacts permitting requirements under the CWA, particularly for dredge and fill activities (Section 404) and pollutant discharges (Section 402). A narrower definition, as suggested by Sackett and potentially further refined by this new initiative, could reduce the number of projects requiring federal permits.

However, the current lack of definitive guidance on terms like ""relatively permanent"" and ""continuous surface connection"" means that jurisdictional determinations may still be subject to interpretation and potential challenges. Businesses and individuals undertaking projects that could affect water bodies or wetlands should:

Stay informed about the progress of this new WOTUS rulemaking initiative.

Carefully evaluate potential CWA jurisdiction for their specific sites, considering the Sackett decision and any interim guidance from the agencies.

Be aware that state regulations may still apply even if federal CWA jurisdiction is not asserted.

The definition of WOTUS remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental law. Regulated entities must remain vigilant and stay on top of these developments to ensure compliance, avoid potential administrative scrutiny and navigate potential litigation.",https://www.phelps.com/a/web/2oUhWNnp4Sdj6cab4ZPwwc/9BQDh1/environmental-alert-banner.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 17:08:30.377491

The bill’s architects characterize it as allowing a “demonstration project” of modular nuclear that would operate on a microgrid and support “community energy resilience.” Small reactors have about one-third the generating capacity of a traditional reactor, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and can power individual neighborhoods, factories and facilities such as data centers that consume large amounts of energy.

Bill sponsor state Rep. Bobby Levy, R-Echo, has touted it in hearings as a clean energy solution to growing power demand in the state. Levy declined an interview Monday, but she told the Capital Chronicle in an email that local residents and the state would benefit from “reliable, carbon-free baseload power, job creation, and potential economic growth through new infrastructure investments.”

“At the broader level, small-scale nuclear would also contribute to Oregon’s clean energy goals, supporting a resilient and diversified energy mix across the state,” she said.

Nuclear energy does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and it can produce more energy with less fuel than any other individual source of existing power, according to MIT.

But protesters Monday said they suspect House Bill 2410 is less about “community energy resilience” than powering Umatilla County’s booming data centers. The protesters said eastern Oregon lawmakers continue to treat the state’s northeast corner like an “environmental sacrifice zone,” noting that there is nowhere to safely store nuclear waste.

The bill passed 8-4 with recommendation in April from the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment, of which Levy is a vice-chair, to the Joint Ways & Means Committee. Another nuclear bill currently in the Ways & Means Committee, House Bill 2038, is also co-sponsored by Levy, and has drawn concerns from environmental and community groups as well as tribes. It would create a committee to study the benefits and risks of developing nuclear energy facilities in Oregon.

“The Umatilla Basin is one of the most polluted places in Oregon, some of the worst groundwater pollution in the state, some of the worst industrial air pollution in the state, and it just keeps getting worse. Now we’re talking about adding radioactive waste on top of that?” said Kaleb Lay, policy director at Oregon Rural Action, at the rally.

Representatives from nonprofit environmental groups Columbia Riverkeeper and the Sierra Club of Oregon and Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility also attended.

Data demand

Demand for power from the Umatilla Electric Cooperative, which supplies electricity to the region, has grown 556% in the last decade according to recent analysis by the nonprofit research organization Sightline Institute. Nearly all of that is from Amazon data centers in the county. Amazon and Microsoft are investing billions in small scale nuclear reactors to power their data centers, including those in eastern Oregon, and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates last year invested $1 billion into a nuclear power plant in Wyoming, operated by his new company TerraPower.

Levy said it is an “oversimplification” to suggest data centers are the only or primary beneficiaries of modular nuclear reactors.

“The reality is that all ratepayers benefit from a more stable, reliable, and carbon-free energy supply — especially as demand across sectors continues to rise,” she said.

The bill has so far drawn 168 letters of testimony, about 75% of them in opposition to the bill. Many expressed concerns about where nuclear waste would end up and environmental concerns about uranium mining, especially on native land.

The bill would bar “high-level radioactive waste” from being stored at the demonstration project site after the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission terminates the project’s operating license, but it does not include details about where waste would eventually end up.

It’s supported by members of the Morrow and Umatilla county commissions.

“I’m very excited that someone else is willing to take on the experiment risk, and they’re close enough that we can, hopefully if it goes well, benefit from it,” Morrow County Commissioner Jeff Wenholz recently told Elkhorn Media Group.

Across the river

Cathy Sampson-Kruse, 71, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, grew up in Umatilla County and went to high school in Echo. She said her family members that still live there do not support the bills.

“We have to ask ourselves, really, who is this supply for?” Sampson-Kruse said. “And what is it really taking away from generations of children that do not have a say in this — just like we’re going to have generations of children that are going to deal with the Hanford debacle.”

The problem with where to put nuclear waste continues to plague the Hanford Site across the Columbia River north of Richland, Washington, where the Washington Department of Ecology, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are trying to figure out how to move 56 million gallons of radioactive sludge. The sludge is a byproduct of World War II-era plutonium production that still sits 80 years later in 177 underground tanks, some of which are leaking.

The agencies are hoping to move at least 2,000 gallons of that sludge via rail or truck through Oregon to facilities in Utah and Texas that can process it into a grout cement and dispose of it. The proposal doesn’t yet detail a route, but critics have said it would most likely end up on major interstate highways through Oregon, or on a rail line through central Oregon along the Deschutes River, passing near areas like Bend and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek is opposed to the plan as proposed by the agencies.

House Bill 2410 is not the first time state or federal governments have proposed sacrificing the health of the environment for industry when it comes to power in the Northwest, Sampson-Kruse said. She was a child when the Dalles Dam was constructed, flooding the Celilo Falls where Northwest tribes traditionally fished.

“Now, one of our most beloved natural foods, the salmon, is on the list for extinction. It constantly begs the question, how much more? Where do we draw the line?” Sampson-Kruse said.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC09305-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 18:09:50.200202

DENVER — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced on May 16, 2025, that seven recipients across Colorado have been selected to receive over $11.6 million in Brownfields Grants to assess, clean up and revitalize local lands.

“This Brownfields grant funding is a smart investment in Colorado's future - cleaning up historic contamination while laying the groundwork for economic growth,” said EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western. “By empowering communities to turn abandoned properties into productive assets, we're strengthening local economies and ensuring clean land for generations to come.”

“Contamination at sites in our communities threatens public health and inhibits the use of those sites for productive use,” said U.S. Senator Michael Bennet. “This funding will help Colorado communities safely clean up polluted properties, protect their health, and rebuild in a way that creates jobs and economic opportunity.”

“Cleaning up contaminated properties reduces the environmental and health risks for the community and opens the door for new economic development,” said U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper. “This funding will help us safely clean up these sites and recharge the surrounding communities.”

“Redevelopment of Brownfields properties is often an insurmountable challenge for many communities, which may lack the resources to assess and clean up these contaminated properties,” said Tracie White, CDPHE Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division Director. “For this reason, CDPHE is thrilled that so many Colorado communities are receiving support from the EPA to clean up and redevelop their Brownfields properties. The Brownfields grant support provided by the EPA is instrumental in supporting community revitalization efforts, not only in Colorado but across the country. The award of EPA Brownfields funds is an exciting opportunity for the recipient communities, allowing them to return blighted properties to productive use and provide community benefits. CDPHE is excited to continue our partnership with EPA Region 8 and Colorado communities to facilitate Brownfields redevelopment across Colorado.”

These grants are part of $267 million in Brownfields Grants nationally announced by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. This funding put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

The following recipients in Colorado were selected to receive grant funding for Brownfields cleanup projects:

City of Canon City - $1,533,000 Cleanup Grant: Funding will be used to clean up a property that used to be a dry-cleaning business and is contaminated with tetrachloroethylene. Grant funds will also clean up a previous steel manufacturing site that is contaminated with heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

City of Cortez - $500,000 Cleanup Grant: Funding will be used to clean up the Cortez Municipal Airport, where three unused buildings on the property are contaminated with asbestos, lead-based paint and petroleum.

City of Fountain - $1,924,580 Cleanup Grant: Funds will be used to complete asbestos abatement from a vacant property that will pave the way for safe demolition and redevelopment that meets community needs.

Jaffa Opera House Foundation - $1,897,300 Cleanup Grant: Grant funds will be used to remediate asbestos contamination from the historic Jaffa Opera House in Trinidad. The Jaffa Opera House Foundation plans to revitalize the building and offer a mixed-use space on what is currently a vacant site.

City of Lamar - $764,838 Cleanup Grant: Grant funding will be used to clean up asbestos contamination from a vacant commercial building in downtown Lamar, redeveloping the property into a mixed-use site. Funding will also be used to complete asbestos abatement at a historic warehouse property.

Volunteers of America National Services - $4,000,000 Cleanup Grant: Grant funds will be used to clean up asbestos contamination at the Sunset Park Apartments located in downtown Denver. The reuse strategy is to preserve and upgrade the apartment’s current units, enhancing safety and modernizing the building’s energy efficiency systems.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment - $1,000,000 Revolving Loan Fund (RLF): Funding will be used to provide up to three loans and one subgrant to support cleanup activities through CDPHE’s RLF program.

Background

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfields Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, Brownfields investments leveraged more than $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 220,500 jobs.

President Trump’s budget is a blueprint for disaster. Trump doesn’t believe in government, and his budget continues his relentless assault on the federal agencies whose mission it is to protect the health and well-being of the American people.

This budget would cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by 55 percent – the largest cut in EPA’s history. This proposed cut would seriously threaten public health and the environment. It also fails to deliver on many of the promises the Trump Administration has made on dangerous toxins like lead and PFAS and prioritizes polluters over public health and the environment. While we only have the skinny budget to review at this stage, it does not give me confidence that anything more comprehensive will tell a different story.

The budget calls categorical grants to states a “crutch,” flying in the face of the cooperative federalism that has made EPA so successful in cleaning up toxic pollution and providing healthier futures for Americans. EPA is deserting the states to deal with serious climate and pollution issues on their own, while EPA focuses on giving polluters free passes to poison our communities with reckless abandon.

The skinny budget outlines major cuts to historically bipartisan programs that provide a lifeline to communities across the nation. It cuts $250 million from the Superfund program – undermining our ability to clean up toxic waste sites throughout the nation. It also seeks to decimate the Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds, which are the primary funding sources for water infrastructure projects. These state revolving funds are critical to ensuring communities have safe, reliable drinking water and wastewater services. This comes after EPA recently announced plans to rescind and delay the historic PFAS drinking water standard, raising serious questions about the Trump Administration’s commitment to safe, clean, and affordable water for all.

EPA is also walking away from its commitments by canceling competitively awarded grants where work is already underway in communities across the country with little or no explanation.

I remain outraged by Administrator Zeldin’s illegal freeze of obligated funds under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This fund is meant to make energy more affordable, foster economic development, boost supply chains, and create good-paying jobs – all the things that this Administration says it supports. Yet, the Administrator has engaged in a smear campaign where he is spreading false and misleading statements about the program in an attempt to undermine it and strip away these funds. I firmly believe the Administrator’s actions are a violation of the law, and I am hopeful that these funds will be released soon so that our communities can benefit from these investments.

It is clear to me that under Administrator Zeldin’s leadership, EPA is becoming an unreliable partner and illegally withholding congressionally directed funds.

I am also concerned about troubling activities that will endanger the health and safety of American families, children, and workers. The Trump Administration has made it clear that EPA cares more about polluters’ bottom line than the communities and American children who will bear the brunt of these fool hearty decisions. What is potentially most egregious is the attempt to roll back EPA’s landmark Endangerment Finding. It’s absolutely shocking that anyone in the year 2025 could look around and honestly say that climate change is not already harming Americans.

I’m also troubled by EPA’s recent reorganization plan. The effectiveness of the agency hinges on EPA having the career staff necessary to fulfill its mission. They are the backbone of the agency. Unfortunately, Administrator Zeldin’s actions to indiscriminately fire hundreds of employees with plans to relieve thousands more show a blatant disregard for the critical work career staff conduct on behalf of the American people every day. He continues to disingenuously claim to be fighting government waste, while simultaneously eviscerating EPA’s ability to appropriately manage programs and oversee issued grants.

Finally, Administrator Zeldin is thumbing his nose at Congress’ ability to conduct important oversight of this Administration. Committee Democrats have sent several letters to the Administrator demanding answers about certain actions he’s taken. We have received very few answers – some coming late yesterday. This is unacceptable. The Energy and Commerce Committee is your authorizer, and we are tasked with conducting oversight. As Administrator of EPA, you don’t just owe Congress an explanation, but also the American people.

And with that I yield back the balance of my time.

Catastrophic coal ash spills in Kingston, Tennessee and on the Dan River in North Carolina and Virginia show that health, environmental, and economic impacts of an unthinkable coal ash tragedy take decades to recover from.
“Other utilities across the South are cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps and moving waste to safer storage away from our waterways.
In Virginia, Dominion Energy is excavating all its unlined coal ash impoundments, and Appalachian Power is excavating its sole open coal ash impoundment.","GADSDEN, Ala. — On behalf of Coosa Riverkeeper, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) put Alabama Power Company on notice that the Riverkeeper intends to sue the utility to stop ongoing groundwater pollution from Alabama Power’s failed closure of its leaking toxic coal ash lagoon at the former Gadsden Steam Plant. This ongoing pollution has continued for years after the lagoon was capped, in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule, which regulate coal ash disposal.

Coal ash is the byproduct of burning coal for energy generation. Alabama Power chose to store nearly 1.5 million tons of toxic coal ash created at Plant Gadsden in an unlined pit, in the floodplain, on the banks of Neely Henry Lake and the Coosa River. Alabama Power “capped” the pond in an unlined leaking pit, but the company’s own reports show the ash underneath remains in contact with groundwater—in fact, nearly 40% of the ash remains saturated in water. As recently as October 2024, Alabama Power reported levels of arsenic forty times the legal standard in groundwater. This shows that Alabama Power’s preferred method of burying its toxic coal ash does not protect important groundwater resources. Alabama Power also relies on a faulty groundwater monitoring system that does not adequately measure how the coal ash is contaminating groundwater. These are clear violations of national coal ash disposal standards.

The notice was sent to Alabama Power, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Alabama state officials. Alabama Power has 60 days to correct its violations of coal ash storage standards. If the company does not eliminate those violations, SELC may file suit on behalf of Coosa Riverkeeper in U.S. District Court to require compliance with the rule.

“The stacks at Plant Gadsden may be gone, but Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution remains,” said Justinn Overton, Executive Director and Riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper. “Alabama Power cannot knowingly leave a leaking coal ash pond in place upstream from Gadsden’s drinking water intake and booming ecotourism developments and call themselves good neighbors. Coosa Riverkeeper has been saying this has been a problem for years, even before the pond was closed. It’s time for Alabama Power to do the right thing and move their ash.”

This is not just a threat to health and the environment, but to the local economy. The coal ash pond is less than a mile upstream from a drinking water intake for the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board that provides drinking water to over 14,000 customers. Neely Henry Lake’s estimated economic impact for the region was up to $570 million in 2017. Catastrophic coal ash spills in Kingston, Tennessee and on the Dan River in North Carolina and Virginia show that health, environmental, and economic impacts of an unthinkable coal ash tragedy take decades to recover from.

“Alabama Power has zero excuses for leaving its leaking waste dump in the middle of the commercial riverfront area of Gadsden and exposing the community to this hazard,” said Barry Brock, director of SELC’s Alabama office. “Other utilities across the South are cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps and moving waste to safer storage away from our waterways. Alabama Power must do the same in Gadsden.”

Coal ash contains dangerous heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic, which are known to cause cancer and other serious illnesses, according to the EPA.

Utilities across the Southeast have moved more than a quarter of a billion tons of toxic coal ash to safe, dry, lined landfills, or they are recycling ash into cement and concrete. Every unlined pond in North and South Carolina has been excavated or is being excavated, including Duke Energy who is excavating more than 145 million tons. In Virginia, Dominion Energy is excavating all its unlined coal ash impoundments, and Appalachian Power is excavating its sole open coal ash impoundment. The Tennessee Valley Authority is excavating 12 million tons of coal ash. Alabama Power’s sister company, Georgia Power, is excavating half of the coal ash it has stored in unlined ponds, and in May 2024 submitted plans to excavate another 16 million tons.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SELC_Logo_Horizontal_Social.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 17:08:53.557851

Tonko, Ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, today questioned Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin during an Environment Subcommittee hearing on the EPA’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget.

Listen to Rep. Tonko’s opening remarks HERE and see below as prepared for delivery.

President Trump’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget request for EPA has been called “problematic,” “an unserious proposal,” and “maybe a bridge too far to be achievable.”

These were the reactions of Republican Appropriators last week, and I expect you will hear even less charitable reviews from Democrats on this Subcommittee today.

This proposal includes a 55% reduction from FY25 levels, resulting in agency funding levels not seen since the mid-1980s.

If enacted, this would fundamentally dismantle the EPA as we know it and cripple the agency's ability to carry out its core mission of protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink.

The request includes devastating cuts that will undermine states’ efforts to protect public health and carry out their obligations, including a $2.46 billion reduction to the State Revolving Funds for water infrastructure and a $1 billion reduction for categorical grants, which are critical to supporting staffing of state environmental agencies.

I believe this is part of a disturbing trend we are seeing to force more costs onto state governments, as is being done with the proposed cuts to Medicaid in the majority’s reconciliation bill.

Similar to these funding cuts, earlier this year the Administration expressed a desire to reduce EPA staffing levels by 65%, which would return the agency to 1971 personnel levels — the agency’s second year in existence.

It is not credible to suggest that the agency can fulfill its statutory requirements — including all the major environmental laws and amendments to those laws that have been enacted since the 1970s — with these proposed staffing levels.

Cuts of this magnitude would not only hollow out the agency’s expertise and capacity, but they are insensitive to the public servants who have dedicated their lives to supporting the agency’s mission.

And it is worth reminding everyone of what that mission is: To protect human health and the environment.

In just a few short months, I believe the agency, under Administrator Zeldin’s leadership, has lost sight of this mission.

Mr. Zeldin launched the “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative focused on American energy, auto manufacturing, and artificial intelligence dominance.

And broadly speaking, I am not necessarily opposed to aspects of that agenda, but I also do not believe it is the appropriate role for our nation’s environmental regulator to be leading this effort.

Because EPA’s contributions to those goals more or less translate to how can we reduce environmental protections and enforcements of those protections for the benefit of energy producers, the auto industry, and Big Tech, even if ordinary Americans will pay the price by breathing harmful air pollution, drinking contaminated water, and being exposed to dangerous chemicals.

We have already seen a slew of agency actions that will result in greater pollution and reduce our scientific capacity to understand how that pollution will impact Americans’ health and well-being.

This includes reconsidering rules that protect Americans from pollution from power plants, vehicles, and industrial facilities, and weakening standards to keep PFAS out of our drinking water.

Each of these public health protections up for reconsideration went through robust rulemaking processes and economic analyses, which found that every one of these rules delivers greater benefits to the American people, in public health and economic benefits, than they cost.

I am also concerned by EPA’s efforts to terminate previously awarded grants without producing any evidence of fraud, waste, or abuse.

For each of those awards, the previous administration carried out competitive selection processes based upon requirements enacted by Congress.

Whether or not Administrator Zeldin personally believes Congress was wasting taxpayer dollars when it directed EPA to carry out those funding opportunities is irrelevant.

No Administrator should be the sole arbitrator of what is a good use of Congressionally-directed taxpayer dollars, and yet we have seen billions of dollars impounded without justification.

Finally, I am very concerned by reports that EPA is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, which is a voluntary, non-regulatory labeling program with strong support from industry and consumers.

Energy Star has been incredibly effective at supporting American manufacturing, enabling people to lower energy bills, and reducing strain on our electricity system.

This seems obviously in line with the President’s energy and economic agenda, and yet, there may be an effort underway to terminate the program.

If we cannot even find common ground on a broadly popular, voluntary, low-cost program to benefit consumers, I have serious doubts that we will be able to find anything to agree upon this year.",https://tonko.house.gov/UploadedPhotos/HighResolution/b28a80e3-b4a9-45ee-9de0-b2c6a0f6396e.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 17:08:56.341733

(March 19, 2025) – The City of Rensselaer recently learned it is one of ten communities in New York State to receive a Brownfield Assessment and Clean Up Grant from the US Environmental Protection Agency. ""The brownfield grants are essential for New York, allowing us to transform neglected sites into thriving community assets that instill pride and drive economic growth,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “By investing in these revitalization efforts, we not only protect our environment but also create job opportunities and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers.""

The City of Rensselaer, NY has been selected to receive $300,000 to conduct eight environmental site assessments to help prioritize polluted sites, develop four cleanup plans, and support reuse planning and community engagement. The target area includes the downtown and commercial corridor, waterfront areas, and properties near the Albany-Rensselaer Amtrak Station. This mixed-use redevelopment zone focuses on revitalizing underutilized properties for residential, commercial, and recreational uses. Located within the Hudson River floodplain, the area also presents unique flood risks and challenges that require robust planning to incorporate climate resilience into redevelopment initiatives.

The reuse strategy for priority sites supports the goals of the “Rensselaer Rising” initiative, which was developed through a Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA) study that relied on significant public input and coordination between City Administration and the Common Council. “Rensselaer Rising” strives to create a livable, vibrant, and sustainable urban environment that capitalizes on Rensselaer’s assets. These assets include a vibrant waterfront with phenomenal views of the Albany Skyline; a rich history that begins in the colonial era, includes significant industrial activities, maritime trade and railroad travel; and an integrated multi-modal transportation infrastructure.

The planned redevelopment of priority sites follows the BOA study’s recommendations for public-private partnerships and environmentally sustainable land use, aligning closely with Rensselaer’s long-term vision for economic and community growth that capitalizes on its prominent location within the Capital Region and the 800,000+ travelers that come through Rensselaer each year via the Albany-Rensselaer Amtrak Train Station.

""The City of Rensselaer is grateful to the US EPA for providing us with this assistance. This initiative will provide new opportunities for residential, commercial, and recreational spaces by remediating brownfield sites, particularly in our downtown and waterfront areas,"" said Michael Stammel, Mayor of Rensselaer.

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments leveraged more than $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 220,500 jobs.

The reporting rule also applies to importers of articles containing PFAS, which could include many consumer, industrial, and commercial products.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced significant changes coming for two of its major rules that regulate per- and-polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). First, EPA announced on May 12, 2025, that it is delaying the reporting period for the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting Rule and is also considering reopening the entire rule to make substantive revisions. Second, on May 14, 2025, EPA also announced that it plans to withdraw its drinking water standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for four of the six PFAS that EPA sought to regulate.

These announcements are consistent with EPA’s strategic plan released on April 28 to address PFAS across all program offices (see a previous blog post). These actions signal that EPA is taking steps to provide regulated entities more flexibility and much needed relief from overly burdensome requirements pertaining to PFAS.

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule

EPA released an interim final rule that extends the reporting period for the TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule by nine months. The prior reporting period would have begun on July 11, 2025 and closed on January 11, 2026, with a longer deadline of July 11, 2026, for small article importers. The new reporting period will now run from April 13, 2026, to October 13, 2026, with a deadline of April 13, 2027, for small article importers. The interim rule became effective on May 13, 2025. EPA is accepting comments on the interim final rule until June 12, 2025, on the topic of the reporting period only. After receiving comments, EPA may decide to reopen the rule again and make changes to the reporting period.

The reason for the delay is that EPA needs more time to prepare and beta test the reporting software being developed to collect information that companies will be submitting in response to the reporting rule. EPA believes additional time will also be necessary to take advantage of recently appropriated funds from Congress ($17 million) to improve functionality of the reporting application.

Notably, EPA is also considering reopening certain yet unidentified aspects of the rule for public comment. Stakeholders have been calling for revisions to the PFAS Reporting Rule for years because the rule is one of the most expansive TSCA reporting rules promulgated by EPA. The rule imposes detailed reporting requirements on entities that have manufactured or imported PFAS at any time from January 1, 2011 until December 31, 2022. The reporting rule also applies to importers of articles containing PFAS, which could include many consumer, industrial, and commercial products. The rule does not have any traditional TSCA reporting exclusions such as PFAS that are impurities, byproducts, used in commercial research and development (R&D), or only produced or imported in low volumes (see the previous blog post about the rule for more details). EPA also imposes a complex and highly subjective standard of diligence that companies must consider when gathering PFAS data from their own records and from their supply chains.

While EPA did not indicate what changes it plans to make, its April 28 announcement about PFAS suggests that it may consider easing requirements for small businesses or companies that import articles.

SDWA Drinking Water Standards

EPA also announced that it plans to maintain the national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) promulgated by the prior administration for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), two of the most well known PFAS. The maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) established for PFOA and PFOS, which are legally enforceable levels that are allowed in drinking water, will continue to be 4 parts per trillion (ppt). See our previous blog post for more information on the final rule.

Though it is maintaining the MCLs, EPA intends to propose a rule this fall to extend compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS to 2031, establish a federal exemption framework, and initiate outreach to water systems through its new PFAS OUTreach Initiative (PFAS OUT). EPA states that these steps will address the most significant compliance challenges EPA has heard from public water systems, members of Congress, and other stakeholders.

By contrast, EPA will rescind regulations setting MCLs and reconsider the regulatory determinations for four other PFAS that were included in the rulemaking: perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS). EPA seeks this rescission to “ensure that the determinations and any resulting drinking water regulations follow the legal process laid out in [SDWA].”

This announcement is in response to a court-ordered deadline for EPA to indicate its plans for the NPDWRs that are currently being challenged in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (American Water Works Association (AWWA), et al. v. EPA). EPA intends to support the US Department of Justice in defending any ongoing legal challenges to the NPDWRs for PFOA and PFOS.",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1747764306/201401.webp,N,,2025-05-20 14:10:04.868280

Subcommittee Chairman Griffith's opening statement as prepared for delivery:

“I’m glad to have Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, a friend and former colleague, back in the House today to testify before the Subcommittee on Environment on President Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request.

“This is certainly an important time for the EPA.

“After four years of economically disastrous, legally questionable, and expensive policies of the Biden-Harris Administration, it is a welcome sight to see President Trump and Administrator Zeldin focused on rebuilding the American economy and fixing the problems of the previous administration.

“I remember when Administrator Zeldin was in the House, representing the eastern part of Long Island, he was willing to work across the aisle in a pragmatic way to try and address environmental issues like protecting the Long Island sound or addressing emerging contaminants like PFAS.

“It is great to see him bringing these same problem-solving skills to EPA, and to be frank, there are a lot of problems there to solve.

“I’m pleased to see that the Administrator recognizes that there is a middle ground to tread, where environmental protection does not need to come at the expense of good jobs and a strong economy.

“I know that the Administrator is already working to closely examine the previous EPA’s spending spree on Green New Deal-style programs that provided unprecedented levels of taxpayer funds to environmental groups and consultants and to undo burdensome regulations that increased energy costs and made it more difficult to make things in America.

“The reconciliation bill passed out of this Committee last week is an important step in saving taxpayer money and redirecting EPA to focus on its core mission of cleaning up the environment and protecting human health.

“In February, Administrator Zeldin announced the broad pillars that the Agency will focus on under his “Powering the Great American Comeback” plan.

“In March, Administrator Zeldin announced 31 regulatory actions to support greater energy production, a more robust auto manufacturing sector, a more predictable permitting process, and a more state-based enforcement system.

“I’m glad to see that EPA is taking another look at a lot of the rulemakings from the last Administration, particularly those regarding air pollution.

“As many of those rulemakings didn’t take into account industry’s ability to meet compliance timelines or which pollution mitigation technologies were able to be installed.

“EPA has a duty to enforce the statutes that Congress passed, though I do believe encouraging co-operative compliance with industry will lead to better environmental outcomes and less economic disruption.

“In recent years, EPA’s budget has been about $10 billion per year.

“However, under the so-called Inflation Reduction Act EPA received an astounding $41.5 billion, or more than four times its historical budget, to spend on electric vehicles, environmental justice, and renewable energy programs.

“From its founding and up until the past few years, EPA mostly operated as a scientific investigator and regulatory agency, and with the exception of the water infrastructure and Superfund programs, it did not administer lots of large grants.

“President Trump’s proposed budget would reduce EPA spending to a more sustainable level after years of out-of-control spending on programs and rules that bore little relation to EPA’s traditional mission of regulating pollution, setting science-based standards for potentially hazardous substances, and cleaning up waste sites.

“It seems that the goals of EPA in the last few years were an attempt to force a change that Americans are not buying.

“I look forward to hearing more details from Administrator Zeldin about the reorganization and reform efforts he is making at EPA.

“The Environment Subcommittee stands ready to work with you, Administrator Zeldin, to help get EPA back on track.

“At this Subcommittee’s first hearing of the Congress, we examined the implementation of the 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act, often referred to as the TOS-CA law.

“We heard how the process for reviewing new and existing chemicals are in need of reform, particularly the ways in which EPA evaluates potential chemical risks.

“We also held a hearing in March on ways to maximize brownfield cleanups to support economic development.

“As we work on brownfield reauthorization, I hope to collaborate with EPA on ways to possibly setup some sort of pre-clearance permitting pilot program.

“Our national security, our economic competitiveness, the health of our families, and strength of our communities all depend on an EPA that is working hard and efficiently for the American people.

“Thank you again for appearing before us today, Administrator Zeldin, I look forward to your testimony.”

“We are excited to receive these federal grants, which will allow us to continue addressing environmental challenges and drive reinvestment in our communities,” said Mayor Greenberg. “By revitalizing brownfield sites, we are not only improving public health and environmental conditions but also paving the way for new economic opportunities.”

The first award, a $750,000 supplemental grant, will strengthen Louisville’s existing revolving loan fund. These funds can be used for programmatic expenses and to create additional and larger cleanup loans for eligible recipients. Louisville qualified for this funding due to its demonstrated success in managing a high-performing revolving loan program and maintaining a robust pipeline of potential projects.

Additionally, Louisville Metro Government was awarded an additional $2 million joint application Community-wide Coalition Assessment Grant with the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection and Russell: A Place of Promise. Funding from this grant will enable Louisville Metro Government to conduct environmental site assessments on properties within the Russell neighborhood, a priority focus area for concerted efforts to counter decades of disinvestment. The allocation of funds to Louisville Metro will be determined collaboratively with the State as the coalition develops a workplan, which must be approved by the EPA before any funds are expended.

Projected to contribute $86 billion to GDP annually and support over 575,000 jobs by 2030

Investments are concentrated in rural communities and 73% of active facilities are in Republican states

PHOENIX, AZ, May 20, 2025 – Today at CLEANPOWER 2025, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) released its State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report, showing a significant and sustainable ripple effect across states and economic sectors. The clean power manufacturing sector currently contributes $18 billion to U.S. GDP annually, spurs $33 billion in domestic spending annually, and supports 122,000 American jobs across the country.

If all announced manufacturing facilities become operational, clean power manufacturing is projected to support over 575,000 jobs and contribute $86 billion annually to GDP by 2030.

“Surging clean energy deployment is creating new manufacturing facilities across the country. This success will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and revitalize American communities if policy leaders place economic progress over partisan division,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of ACP. “Today’s report shows that the manufacturing activities across the clean energy sector drive a ripple effect of economic growth that extends far beyond factory walls, reaching every corner of the country. Reshoring this critical supply chain requires a shared commitment by both industry and policymakers to prioritize domestic economic growth and global competitiveness.”

Clean Power Manufacturing Driving U.S. Economic Boom

The report illustrates how the industry has laid the groundwork for a secure domestic supply chain, revitalizing manufacturing communities and driving American competition on the global stage.

Over 800 manufacturing plants currently contributing to the U.S. clean energy supply chain, with at least one in every state.

200 existing manufacturing facilities are actively building primary clean power components across 38 states to supply the booming demand for new energy in America.

Creating Generational Opportunities for Local Communities

New data highlights how clean power manufacturing is creating generational opportunities at the local level, providing opportunities across skillsets, industries, and generating wages well above the national average.

Clean energy manufacturing is booming in regions across the country, such as the Southeast, Midwest, and in states like Texas.

The clean energy manufacturing workforce made on average $42,000 more than the average worker in the U.S. economy in 2024.

These manufacturing jobs also generate additional employment across the economy: Upstream supply chain jobs paid an average of $75,000, while downstream jobs supported by household spending—such as those in retail, food service, and hospitality—averaged about $52,000.

Driving US Competitiveness and Global Leadership

The industry’s investments are critical to international competitiveness and innovation, positioning the U.S. as a global leader and strengthening our energy security.

America’s power needs are growing fast—projected to rise 35–50% by 2040—as data centers expand, domestic manufacturing rebounds, and our transportation and buildings electrify.

Energy manufacturing processes are considerably complex and capital intensive, often requiring multiple intricate steps, specialized equipment, and expertise. This intricacy often comes with trade exposure or a series of imports and exports before the final energy component is ready for installation.

A resilient, American-made supply chain for clean energy technologies makes the economy stronger, the country’s energy more secure, and serves as the foundation for innovation and growth.

The Path Forward

There are 200 manufacturing facilities in the pipeline representing over $150 billion of investment. If all announced facilities become operational by 2030, the impact could be transformative.

Clean power manufacturing could support over 575,000 jobs

Generate over $40 billion in earnings

Contribute $86 billion to the GDP

Add $164 billion in output to the economy annually

Employment from existing and planned facilities by 2030 by region is projected to be:

Northeast: 4,300+

Mid-Atlantic: 123,000+

South: 172,000+

Midwest: 86,000+

West: 173,000+

Policy and Business Certainty Critical to American Manufacturing Leadership

The report details how these economic and job benefits have largely been made possible because of federal clean energy tax credits enacted in 2022. The report calls on policymakers to build on this historic American manufacturing legacy with a suite of targeted policy tools to continue the momentum. They include:

Preserving energy tax credits (45X, 45Y, 48C, 48E)

Creating a stable and strategic trade environment

Facilitating a true all-of-the above energy strategy

Streamlining permitting to benefit American manufacturers and their customers

Ensuring critical minerals policy appropriately leverages demand from downstream domestic clean energy manufacturers.",https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-8.png,N,,2025-05-20 11:06:10.138663

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, placed a hold on the four pending Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) nominees until Republicans stop their reckless attempts to overrule the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision regarding California’s clean air waivers that allow the state to implement more protective air quality standards.

The Trump-led EPA recently submitted three California waivers as “rules” to Congress — despite knowing full well that these waivers were not rules — in a cynical attempt to overturn the waivers with a 50-vote threshold under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The Senate Parliamentarian determined that any resolutions aimed at overturning California waivers would not be entitled to the CRA’s expedited procedures and would therefore require 60 votes to secure Senate passage. Reporting indicates that Senate Republicans may soon move forward to bypass the filibuster to rescind these waivers, which would require overruling the Parliamentarian.

Revoking California’s waivers would not only cause disastrous public health, environmental, and economic impacts, but would also mean Republicans took the “nuclear option,” undermining longstanding Senate procedures that could be applied to legislation far beyond the CRA and giving agencies significantly more control over the Senate floor.

“This objection is a direct result of the agency’s cynical attempt to weaponize the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by attempting to submit as ‘rules’ three waivers issued to the State of California under the Clean Air Act (CAA),” wrote Senator Padilla. “If this attempt is successful, the consequences will be far-reaching, not only for our clean energy economy, the air our children breathe, and for our climate, but for the future of the CRA and for the Senate as an institution.”

Padilla detailed the longstanding precedent making clear that EPA’s waivers are not rules subject to the Congressional Review Act. None of the more than 100 individual waivers or waiver-related decisions to California — under both Democratic and Republican Administrations — have ever been submitted as a rule since Congress granted the EPA this waiver authority in 1967 in bipartisan fashion. He also underscored the enormous stakes of overruling the Senate Parliamentarian, including for providing essential checks against executive branch agencies trying to exploit the CRA to enact their own agenda on matters that are not rules.

“Here, for the first time in the history of the CRA, an agency submitted matters that they knew were not rules. Some of my Republican colleagues are now arguing that the Parliamentarian should have no role to limit this partisan gamesmanship, and the Senate should throw out the rulebook and overturn the Parliamentarian,” continued Senator Padilla. “If the Trump EPA and Senate Republicans are successful at this ploy, the Senate will have no choice but to accept this as status quo in the future. This would grant agencies unchecked control over the Senate floor — an unprecedented encroachment by the executive branch into the Senate’s internal operations.”

Padilla laid out a list of potential actions that the Trump Administration could take to abuse the CRA, including revoking the broadcast licenses or other approvals for media outlets when they disagree with their news coverage; rescinding Food and Drug Administration approvals of vaccines, birth control, or mifepristone; or targeting the organizations of President Trump’s political opponents for retribution.

“None of these actions are rules, which is why they’ve never been submitted to Congress as rules. But if my Republican colleagues open this door and overturn the Parliamentarian’s wise safeguards on this type of abuse, there would be no practical limit, and the Senate could be forced to vote repeatedly on such matters that are clearly not ‘rules’ notwithstanding the plain language of the CRA,” added Senator Padilla.

By taking the nuclear option to overrule the Senate Parliamentarian, Padilla noted that a future Democratic Administration could target approvals for fossil fuel project leases, loan agreements, or permitting as well as for liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals. They could also use the CRA to try to reverse the Trump Administration’s actions on matters including immigration, foreign policy, and staffing cuts.

“Since this cynical attempt to weaponize the CRA was triggered by the administration’s political leadership at the EPA, at the urging of their Big Oil allies, I must object to proceeding to any nominations for the EPA pending on the Senate’s executive calendar,” concluded Senator Padilla. “I will continue to object until the agency withdraws its false submissions to Congress or the Majority Leader commits not to overturn the Parliamentarian’s determination on this matter.”

A Senate hold blocks unanimous consent to speed up consideration of a nomination and forces the body to spend time debating and voting on the nominee. The EPA nominees currently pending on the Senate floor include Deputy Administrator nominee David Fotouhi, Chief Financial Officer nominee Catherine Hanson, and Assistant Administrator nominees Jessica Kramer and Aaron Szabo.

Senator Padilla has been outspoken in pushing back against Republican attacks on California’s Clean Air Act waivers. Earlier this month, Senators Padilla, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, took to the Senate floor to sound the alarm on Senate Republicans’ consideration of moving forward with their plan to revoke California’s Clean Air Act waivers. Padilla, Whitehouse, and U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also led Democratic Ranking Members in strongly warning Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) of the dangerous and irreparable consequences if Senate Republicans overrule the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision on California’s waivers.

Last month, Senators Padilla, Whitehouse, and Schiff welcomed the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision that the waivers are not subject to the CRA. Padilla also joined Whitehouse and Schiff in blasting Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s weaponization of the EPA after the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) similar finding. Padilla and Schiff previously slammed the Trump Administration’s intent to roll back dozens of the EPA’s regulations that protect California’s air and water.",https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/cropped-Padilla_Favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-05-20 11:07:00.441810

Solar, wind, and battery companies have announced plans to either create or expand 250 manufacturing facilities since August 2022. That’s when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), considered the biggest federal investment to date in climate and clean energy. If those projects are up and running by 2030, they would collectively create more than 575,000 jobs and contribute $86 billion annually to gross domestic product, according to a report published today by the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

Republican districts benefit the most from the IRA’s clean energy tax credits. But now, GOP lawmakers could take away those tax incentives if they follow through with President Donald Trump’s plan to pass a “big, beautiful” spending bill that would rollback what he calls a “green new scam.”

“Republican districts benefit the most from the IRA’s clean energy tax credits”

Red states are home to 73 percent of active facilities, according to the ACP. And already, solar, wind, and battery manufacturing supports 122,000 full-time jobs. Solar manufacturing employed the biggest share of Americans, some 75,400 people. Solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2024, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration, accounting for 81 percent of added annual capacity. Costs for solar and wind have fallen dramatically for decades, with utility-scale solar now the cheapest source of electricity in most parts of the world.

Despite that growth, supply chains for solar energy have been concentrated in China and beset with concerns about forced labor and human rights violations, particularly in the Xinjiang region. The Inflation Reduction Act was meant to supercharge domestic manufacturing, largely through tax credits. And it was starting to pay off. Manufacturing capacity for solar modules grew 190 percent in the US last year, according to a separate report by the Solar Energy Industries Association and research firm Wood Mackenzie.

Those tax credits are now in the crosshairs of a Republican-controlled Congress trying to ram Trump’s agenda into a sweeping spending bill. A draft bill from the House Ways and Means committee last week proposes phasing out the advanced manufacturing tax credit (45x) and other tax incentives for renewables established in the IRA, and would add stipulations in the meantime that would make it difficult for projects to qualify for credits.

If those proposals are ultimately signed into law, the US clean energy industry will see job losses as factories shut down, MJ Shiao, ACP Vice President of Supply Chain and Manufacturing said during a press briefing last week.

“What we have seen from these texts from House Ways and Means, it basically goes too far, too fast,” Shiao said. “The manufacturers that were being supported by these incentives, and frankly, were trusting that the government was going to honor these incentives, you know, they’re getting the rug pulled out from under them.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/STK438_CLIMATE_CHANGE_I.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-05-20 10:08:06.693056

Abstract

In order to combat climate change many nations have committed to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions with the development of renewable energy key in meeting these objectives. At the same time these nations see the development of renewables as and opportunity to ‘reindustrialise for the 21st century’ with many placing emphasis on the reshoring of manufacturing via the onshoring of parts of the renewable energy supply chains, to increase economic benefits from green investment. While this is a goal for nations of all sizes, due to the specialities needed in the development technologies, in reality reshoring is much easier for larger nations. Smaller nations are limited by their economic structures and labour force. In this paper, using offshore wind in Northern Ireland as a case study, we investigate the issues around onshoring of renewables for small nations and regions. For this we use the particular case of Northern Ireland, a self-governing region of the UK; but the method we propose is general and could be carried out by decision makers in any small nation or region. We firstly carry out a structural analysis of the economy of Northern Ireland and identify synergies with the offshore wind supply chain, and then we model the economic impacts of onshoring key components of this supply chain. Overall, we find that there is the potential for sizeable economic benefits, in NI’s case mostly in the onshoring of foundations; but our results extend and in general many smaller regions will be able to identify their own specific opportunities in onshoring renewables manufacturing.

Last Updated on:

It’s been such a big part of the US Republican Party for so long that it’s hard to keep in mind how insane opposition to clean energy is. Solar and wind energy power millions of homes, and they provide hundreds of thousands of US jobs, and they don’t cause cancer, asthma, dementia, and a large variety of other health problems that coal and natural gas power plants cause. There’s real no good reason to oppose solar and wind energy. Yet, at the national level at least, Republicans have to — because fossil fuel companies pay too many of their bills and they’re not allowed to think for themselves.

Ironically, more and more, wind and solar power plants are being installed in “red states” — states where there are more Republican voters than Democratic voters. This makes it especially awkward and illogical to oppose renewable energy, and doing so can clearly hurt their states, and yet they continue to do so.

Now, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) shares the following via email: “Legislation passed last week by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee and advanced through the House Budget Committee could jeopardize nearly 300 American solar and storage factories and lead to the loss of 145,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of solar generation by 2030 — more than the annual electricity consumption of Pennsylvania.

“New analysis released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that the bill, if enacted without changes, could result in nearly 300,000 current and future American jobs to be lost, including 86,000 in solar manufacturing.

“Roughly 80% of all at-risk factories, jobs, and investments in the solar manufacturing sector are in states that voted for President Trump.”

Well, that’s making America great again, isn’t it?

It’s idiotic. It’s so full of idiocy that it makes my head burn. And it’s just a repeat of what we see time and time again — people voting for Republican politicians who get into office and then cause those same voters harm. They are talented at distracting and deflecting, getting people wound up about other matters that really don’t harm them, and somehow hiding the harmful work they do. And this is how we got here. Republican politicians, especially at the national level, have learned that they can pass laws that harm their constituents, but what they can’t do is upset their rich donors in the fossil fuel industry.

Naturally, SEIA is much more diplomatic about it all. “There is still time to improve this bill which, as written, represents a crisis for America’s ability to build the energy infrastructure we need to meet surging demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “If this proposal becomes law, nearly 300 U.S. factories—mostly in red states—could close or never open, and we simply won’t have the energy we need to power American innovation in AI and data centers.” Ah, yes, common sense. If only we weren’t in dire deficiency of that. Better luck in four years.

SEIA notes that $220 billion in investments could be lost by 2030 of this bill becomes a law. But, hey, what’s $220 billion when you’re saving gazillions of imaginary dollars by firing the federal workers who keep our air and water clean, our airplane flights safe, and weather and climate data flowing?",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US-Capitol-Building-US-Congress-Zach-Shahan.jpeg,N,,2025-05-20 10:08:20.778060

The Reconciliation Bill presented by the US House Ways and Means Committee and advanced through the House Budget Committee could jeopardize nearly 300 US-based solar and energy storage factories and lead to the loss of 145,000 GWh of solar generation by 2030, according to the report.

Job creation has been strong since passage of the clean energy tax credits in 2022. By 2033, the SEIA expects the US solar manufacturing workforce to grow to 100,000, barring changes to tax credits. In the new report, the SEIA warns that if the bill is enacted as written, nearly 300,000 current and future jobs may be lost, including 86,000 in solar manufacturing.

Momentum

In 2017, at the start of President Trump’s first term in office, the United States ranked 14th in the world for solar manufacturing. Today it is the third largest solar manufacturing economy in the world. No longer reliant on solar modules from China and other nations, enough solar modules are now produced in the United States to serve the domestic market.

“There is still time to improve this bill which, as written, represents a crisis for America’s ability to build the energy infrastructure we need to meet surging demand,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “If this proposal becomes law, nearly 300 US factories – mostly in red [Republican] states – could close or never open, and we simply won’t have the energy we need to power American innovation in AI [artificial intelligence] and data centers.”

The SEIA estimates that, if enacted, the bill could trigger an immediate decline in solar and energy storage investment that could amount to $220 billion in investment by 2030.

Load growth

A recent study conducted by PA Consulting, for the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), “A Reliable Grid for an Electric Future,” forecast a 300% rise in energy consumption by data centers alone.

An all-of-the above approach will be needed to add energy to the grid fast enough to meet demand. As shown in the chart below, solar and energy storage is the fastest energy to reach deployment.

If Congress cuts these incentives, the SEIA said energy production will fall 145 TWh and “America will not be able to meet demand, leading to blackouts and a surrender of the AI race.”

“Passing this bill would create a catastrophic energy shortfall, cede AI and tech leadership to China, and damage some of the most vital sectors of the US economy,” Hopper added. “But the story isn’t over. The Senate has the opportunity to put forward a more thoughtful and measured proposal that achieves President Trump’s American energy dominance vision.”

The SEIA is urging the industry to contact representatives to urge revisions to the legislation to protect jobs, keep manufacturing in America, and to promote the build out of solar and energy storage at a time when we need it most.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Solar-Bill-main.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 11:06:25.039173

(Nasdaq: FLNC) is a global market leader delivering intelligent energy storage and optimization software for renewables and storage.","ARLINGTON, Va., May 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fluence Energy, Inc. (""Fluence"") (NASDAQ: FLNC), a global market leader delivering intelligent energy storage systems, services, and asset optimization software, today announced start of production at a new manufacturing facility in Goodyear, Arizona. The facility will produce enclosures made with U.S. steel and battery management system (BMS) hardware for Fluence's grid-scale energy storage systems. This latest manufacturing facility represents another milestone in the company's commitment to strengthening domestic manufacturing, reducing supply chain risk, and advancing U.S. energy security.

Part of a growing network of U.S. manufacturing, the new facility plays a crucial role in Fluence's strategy to onshore production of every major product and component of a grid-scale battery energy storage system to serve U.S. demand with domestically manufactured products. The company is ramping up the use of domestic manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, and Utah that supply cells, modules, enclosures, thermal management systems, and battery management systems, in addition to Fluence’s domestic inverter supplier, which manufactures in South Carolina. These manufacturing partnerships represent approximately $700M in investment and more than 1,200 manufacturing jobs, along with 450 construction jobs, in calendar year 2025 alone, with that number expected to quickly grow.

""By rapidly expanding our access to U.S. manufacturing, we’re helping our customers navigate complex global supply chain risks while reinforcing our commitment to delivering safe, reliable, and cybersecure energy storage systems at scale,"" said John Zahurancik, President, Fluence Americas. ""Enclosure and BMS production at the Goodyear facility is another strong step forward in this commitment.""

The American Clean Power Association (ACP) recently announced the U.S. energy storage industry’s historic commitment to invest $100 billion into building and buying American-made grid batteries by 2030, with the goal of supplying 100% of the U.S. energy storage market in the next five years with U.S. manufacturing and supply chains. Industry investments are expected to fuel the creation of 350,000 jobs across the battery energy storage industry and transform the United States into a global battery manufacturing leader.

""The U.S. energy storage industry is revitalizing American manufacturing —and Fluence is leading the way,"" said Jason Grumet, CEO, ACP. ""Their investment in Arizona—a national leader in energy storage—underscores the momentum behind expanding U.S. manufacturing, strengthening energy security, creating high-quality jobs, and supporting key suppliers including American steel.""

The expansion of Fluence's use of domestic manufacturing capabilities comes at a time of increased focus on energy security and U.S. supply chain resilience. The company's products should play a critical role in grid stability and power sector modernization, with energy storage projects contributing to grid reliability for millions of Americans across major ISO power markets.

""Our goal is to fully onshore production, as quickly as possible, to be able to serve the entirety of our U.S. demand with products and components manufactured in the United States,"" said Fluence Chief Product and Supply Chain Officer Peter Williams. ""This facility brings us closer to that goal, which is to enable our customers to benefit from secure, reliable, and domestically produced energy storage solutions.""

It reportedly cost Equinor $50 million per week to hold the project while the Trump administration deliberated its merits.

2. DOE cancels $8 billion in loans, including transmission project, low-income rooftop solar program

The Department of Energy plans to cancel seven major loans and loan guarantees, including a New Jersey transmission project and a low-income rooftop solar program, Semafor reports, per a “former DOE official close to the process.” The programs had all been conditionally approved under Biden, and also included a low-carbon ammonia factory by Monolith Nebraska, as well as a battery factory, a plastics recycling facility, and two others that had already been canceled by their developers. In sum, the canceled financing amounts to nearly $8.5 billion — which admittedly isn’t much of the roughly $41 billion in Biden-era LPO agreements that were yet unfinalized when Trump took office. At the same time, “it’s revealing that the administration would let these projects — most of which are in sectors where the U.S. is already far behind China — fall by the wayside, rather than take steps to prop them up,” Semafor’s Tim McDonnell notes.

3. Reconciliation bill removes ‘pay-to-play’ for expedited pipeline permitting

A House Rules Committee document points to potential changes to the reconciliation bill as negotiations continue — including, perhaps, to permitting. The original bill stipulated that CO2, hydrogen, and petroleum pipelines could pay a $10 million fee to bypass the standard permitting process, a move that critics decried as a “pay-to-play privilege for gas pipelines.” Activists and Democrats had slammed the provision, with Evergreen Action arguing it “makes a farce of our permitting process and essentially legalizes corruption,” and that “Americans will be severely impacted by gas pipelines built through their communities.” But in the new version of the bill, the language describing the expedited pipeline permitting “is gone,” Notus writes.

There is still a long way to go in negotiations, as hardliners and moderates remain at odds. The Rules Committee’s vote on a final version of the reconciliation bill is scheduled for 1 a.m. Wednesday morning, in order to stay on track for a possible floor vote this week — although others are skeptical of the feasibility of that timeline.

4. Clean energy manufacturing could add 453,000 jobs by the end of the decade: report

Clean power manufacturing is expected to grow from supporting 122,000 American jobs today to more than 575,000 by 2030 if all announced manufacturing facilities become operational, a new report by the American Clean Power Association found. The report similarly expects the economic output generated by those facilities to grow from contributing $18 billion to the U.S. GDP today to $86 billion by the end of the decade. “Today’s report shows that the manufacturing activities across the clean energy sector drive a ripple effect of economic growth that extends far beyond factory walls, reaching every corner of the country,” Jason Grumet, the CEO of ACP, said in a statement.

While clean energy manufacturing has taken a hit under the Trump administration, with more than $8 billion in projects canceled, closed, or downsized in the first quarter of 2025 due to concerns about access to Inflation Reduction Act tax credits and loan financing, as well as greater economic turbulence, ACP found that many investments are concentrated in rural areas and Republican states. With 200 manufacturing facilities in the pipeline, the report calls for preserving energy tax credits, “facilitating a true all-of-the-above energy strategy,” and creating “a stable and strategic trade environment,” among other policies.

5. Germany reverses position, will treat nuclear as on par with other renewables

Germany’s longtime opposition to treating nuclear power on par with renewables in EU energy policy appears to have ended. France, which gets about 70% of its power from atomic energy, had long pushed for broader adoption in Europe — and been stymied by Germany’s former chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who was skeptical of labeling atomic energy “green.” But the nation will pivot to join France under Germany’s new conservative chancellor, Friedrich Merz, leaving Austria as the last remaining holdout in the EU, Reuters reports. “When France and Germany agree, it is much easier for Europe to move forward,” Lars-Hendrik Röller, who served as chief economic adviser to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, told the Financial Times. The pivot is not just about meeting energy needs, however; as one German official also told FT, “We are now actually finally open to talk to France about nuclear deterrence for Europe. Better late than never.”

THE KICKER

“I only drained about 25 miles of range from the battery after powering my fridge and other devices for days.” —Scooter Doll, writing for Electrek about how he used his Rivian R1S as a backup energy source for three days after last week’s tornadoes knocked out his power.

Everything’s going to be okay, Crux’s co-founder CEO Alfred Johnson told me late last week. In fact, “the business is in great shape,” he said. I was a tad confused. But as Johnson reminded me, the company always planned on being more than a mere tax credit marketplace. The question is whether developers will buy into this vision of Crux as the everything store for project financing.

In March, right before the company announced its Series B, Crux launched a debt marketplace, where developers and manufacturers can access financial tools such as short-term bridge loans, construction financing, and flexible lines of credit to fund the buildout of renewables projects. “The market size for transferable credits is $30 billion per year, while the market size for project finance debt is more than seven-and-half times as big: $230 billion,” Johnson told me.

This new offering may have come just in the nick of time. It’s also likely just the first in a series of platform expansions, some of which are already in the works.

“There are many more multibillion-dollar markets among the thousands of developers, manufacturers, investors, and corporate buyers that make up the market for U.S. energy and manufacturing project finance,” Johnson told me. Playing in all those markets is a lofty goal for a company that was founded just two years ago, but so far Crux has been good at defying expectations. After all, it’s been profitable since its second year, Johnson told me, a rare and rapid rise for an early-stage startup.

Crux shared some exclusive numbers with me that illustrate some ways in which it’s starting to outgrow its roots. For one, Johnson told me that Crux’s revenue for the first one-and-a-half quarters of this year is nearly 10 times higher than for the same period last year. While he wouldn’t reveal what portion of that was comprised of tax credit deals versus debt financing deals, he did say that in the two months since the debt marketplace launched, “lenders have issued $1.3 billion of term sheets.” Those are nonbinding loan offers, $700 million of which have turned into actual deals so far. “It took more than a year for the tax credit market to reach similar throughput,"" Johnson said.

In the meantime, Crux is by no means giving up on the embattled transferable tax credit marketplace. The company sounded a relatively optimistic note last week as it published a list of takeaways from the Ways and Means Committee’s proposal, stating, “This is the starting point and we anticipate that the final bill will take a more favorable stance on transferability and tax credits.” The company looks like it’s preparing to fight for that outcome, too, as a few months ago it hired new teams of tax lobbyists and brought on Hasan Nazar, former federal policy lead at Tesla, to direct these lobbying efforts.

Johnson said that the debut of Crux’s debt marketplace had developers, manufacturers, and investors rushing to its website in numbers not seen since the company launched. It logged more “inbound interest” on that one day in March than when it announced its Series A and its Series B — that is, more than on both of those days combined.

“We didn’t invest in Crux with the belief that this would be a transferable tax credit business forever,” David Haber, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, told me. The venture capital firm led the company’s $18.2 million Series A funding round. “We viewed that as a great wedge product to bootstrap a financial exchange that could help facilitate the types of financial products needed for this ecosystem,” he said. Clay Dumas of Lowercarbon Capital, which led Crux’s Series B, also saw the company as a so-called “wedge” into a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar opportunity to finance energy and advanced manufacturing through debt and a wide range of other products.”

Not all investors felt as confident that companies built around tax credit transferability could become a one-stop financing shop, however. As of now, most of Crux’s direct competitors — such as Basis Climate, Reunion Infrastructure, and Common Forge — haven’t expanded into other parts of the climate capital stack.

“We know the fundamental risk that a stroke of the pen can have in any of these sort of marketplaces,” Juan Muldoon, a partner at the climate software VC firm Energize Capital, told me. Thus far, Energize has not funded any tax credit-based marketplace, diligence platform, or underwriting tool. “We wanted to wait for signs of resilience and more complete platforms, more complete business models, versus solving for things that might be more transient in value,” Muldoon said. Last week’s committee proposals validate Energize’s core investment strategy, he added — supporting nimble software companies that can withstand political headwinds and change tacks quickly.

Crux certainly hopes that expanding into the debt market will put any fears of its potential transience to rest. After all, Johnson told me, “all parts of the capital stack are opaque, illiquid, bespoke and manual.” That includes not only transferable tax credits, but also debt and equity financing. “These are private transactions that require a ton of documentation, models, advisory lawyers. But it doesn't have to be as bad as it is,” he said.

But if the transferable tax credits do indeed disappear, many renewable energy developers may be forced to return to one of the most opaque funding mechanisms of all: tax equity financing, which Crux is not currently set up to facilitate. As my colleague Emily Pontecorvo recently explained, prior to the passage of the IRA, renewable energy developers who wanted to liquidate their tax credits had to partner with tax equity investors — usually banks — who would give them cash in exchange for an equity stake in their clean energy project and the benefits of their tax credits. But forming these types of partnerships is both legally complicated and costly, and thus not a viable option for many smaller developers.

Presumably, Crux could shake up and simplify this space, too. And while it’s made no official commitments to a tax equity product, the company’s website has been reconfigured to advertise it as the go-to platform to “source new opportunities for lending, equity, and tax credit transfers,” as it commits to “financing the future of energy.”

Crux has its work cut out for it, though, as often the more complex the financial transaction, the more customized it must be. “The competitors are offline advisors for the most part,” Haber told me. Thus, standardizing and digitizing as many esoteric and project specific elements of the capital stack as possible is going to be, as he put it, “their opportunity and their challenge.”

Johnson says Crux is up for it. “It’s never going to be, you know, one click buy it on Amazon. That’s a ridiculous and implausible concept for deals of this size and importance. But these negotiations and transactions can be so much better.” Efficiency, at the very least, seems to be something we can all get behind. So as the partisan fighting over tax credits and transferability commences and the clean energy incentives start to fall, maybe at least this one climate tech darling can weather the storm.

Earlier in the week, Climeworks, another major DAC hubs award winner, announced a reduction in force, due in part to “pending clarity for our next plant in the U.S.” Coupled with this news, a sensationalized exposé by Icelandic news outlet Heimildin detailed challenges with the first two Climeworks facilities, including commentary that called both the company and the technology a “scam” and the “Theranos of the energy industry.”

DAC has never been entirely welcome among climate advocates. To a certain extent, its critics are right: The process of pulling carbon directly out of the ambient air and storing it permanently underground is both energy- and capital-intensive, and it has obvious utility for the oil and gas industry, which has seized on DAC’s potential to erase past emissions as a way to argue that the transition away from fossil energy isn’t actually necessary.

But these critics start to lose the thread when they call the technology a “fig leaf” for oil and gas or an “expensive, dangerous distraction,” and most egregiously when they point to the lack of actual carbon dioxide removed using the technology as an argument against future deployments.

There is a scientific consensus behind the need for carbon dioxide removal that these critiques dance around. As the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lays out in its most recent scientific report, “CDR is required to limit warming to 1.5 [degrees Celsius],” and is “part of all modeled scenarios that limit warming to 2 [degrees] by 2100.” Even when critics recognize the need for permanent CDR, they frequently fail to provide any plausible pathway to gigaton scale. The fact is that DAC doesn’t have an established, liquid market, like electricity, steel, cement, or any other commodity. That any one DAC business is struggling as it attempts to scale is not an indictment of the company, but rather an illustration of the challenge it is taking on to commercialize a first-of-a-kind technologies that naturally has first-of-a-kind issues while also building a brand new market for the crucial climate service it provides. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.

The commercial model for the nascent CDR industry is largely the sale of carbon removal credits for delivery in future years. This isn’t unique to CDR — it’s even analogous to the power purchase agreements that scaled renewable energy. Futures contracts are standard practice, and certainly not indicative of a “scam.”

DAC’s high energy needs are frequently cited as a reason for concern among skeptics. As the Princeton Net Zero America study notes, however, the total energy needed to reduce emissions in a net-zero system without DAC increases because we would need more power to produce e-fuels. (Jesse Jenkins, one of the leaders of the Net Zero America study, is also a co-host of Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast.) This criticism also fails to take into account the reduction in energy intensity that companies are already achieving by various means. That group includes Climeworks, which has introduced more efficient sorbents; Heirloom, which is working on deploying passive mineralization; and Holocene, which was recently acquired by Oxy and employs the low regeneration temperature solvents.

The costs and efficiency of DAC today, just like the cost and efficiency of solar 20 years ago, are likely to improve significantly in the future as the technology and market become more efficient and reliable. Early DAC deployments may have a relatively high cost now, but even today, DAC is cost-competitive with emissions mitigation in aviation.

The industry currently stands at a precipice. Will DAC cross the chasm from pilot facilities to meaningful deployment? Or fall off the hype wagon into the dustbin of cool ideas that were always 10 years away? Beneath the innuendo and false claims, the reporting from Reykjavik shows what everyone in DAC knew — that it has a messy, non-linear path to scale. That does not disprove the argument that it is also a necessary technology that is not only valuable to remove emissions, but also is drawing billions in investment, and driving local economic development.

And there is plenty of good news. The XRG joint venture with Adnoc shows that a sophisticated strategic investor views American DAC as promising. (The local South Texas community is excited, too.) The Oxy Stratos facility in West Texas has already brought thousands of new construction jobs, and will bring hundreds of more permanent jobs to the heart of oil country — a new industry to make use of their unique and valuable skill sets. Project Bantam, a multi-modal operation that was the largest in the U.S. when it launched last summer, is operating in Oklahoma.

The Heimildin story was written to be a salacious takedown, and DAC opponents wasted no time in saying, “We told you so.” The issue with that reaction is the story isn’t unique to Climeworks, or even to DAC. The same story could have been written 20 years ago about solar and batteries. It could be written tomorrow about advanced geothermal or long-duration energy storage. It is the boring, mundane outcome of trying to build a difficult technology with the policy and business hand we are dealt.

The road to DAC at scale will be scattered with bumps, failed projects, and folded companies. We should be cheering these folks on, not taking shots from the cheap, increasingly warm seats.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTgwNjYwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQ3Mjc1Nn0.vfqr1uzX4ulM_uSBkkrgvJsN9jfuRvw0UzE29xz-H-s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-20 10:09:08.805416

The reason for the turnaround wasn’t immediately clear. In a statement, Equinor CEO Anders Opedal thanked President Donald Trump for “finding a solution that saves thousands of American jobs and provides for continued investments in energy infrastructure in the U.S.”

Empire Wind 1 is central to New York’s climate and energy plans. The $5 billion project would connect directly into New York City’s power grid, providing enough electricity to supply 500,000 homes. It has been the focus of an intense international lobbying effort in recent weeks. Opedal and Norwegian Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg met with White House officials to discuss the project last month.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement that “countess conversations with Equinor and White House officials” had yielded the deal.

“I want to thank President Trump for his willingness to work with me to save the 1,500 good paying union jobs that were on the line and helping get this essential project back on track,” Hochul said. “New York’s economic future is going to be powered by abundant, clean energy that helps our homes and businesses thrive. I fought to save clean energy jobs in New York — and we got it done.”

The move would amount to a stunning reversal for Trump, who has railed against offshore wind since returning to the White House. A White House spokesperson deferred comment to Interior, which could not immediately be reached for comment.

Hochul told Newsday that she held three conversations with Trump over the weekend, in which she pleaded with the president to save the project. The governor told the Long Island newspaper that she emphasized the 1,500 union laborers working on the project.

Trump has pushed for building new pipelines into New York. The governor did not mention pipelines directly in her statement but made an apparent reference to the issue, saying, “I also reaffirmed that New York will work with the Administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law. In order to ensure reliability and affordability for consumers, we will be working in earnest to deliver on these objectives.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum alluded to a pipeline deal in a post on X, which did not mention Empire Wind. “Energy Dominance is the foundation of America’s economic and national security,” he wrote. “I am encouraged by Governor Hochul’s comments about her willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity. Americans who live in New York and New England would see significant economic.”

Equinor secured a lease to build the wind farm south of Long Island in 2017. The Biden administration issued a final permit for the project in 2024. Equinor began work at a marine terminal in Brooklyn last summer. It had begun preparing to install the underwater foundations in March when, the following month, Burgum announced the stop work order. He cited a report from NOAA that he said showed Empire Wind 1’s approval had been rushed. He never released the report.

Equinor came close to walking away from the project, telling POLITICO’s E&E News on May 9 that it would be canceled if the stop work order was not lifted. Hochul told Newsday that she had pleaded with Equinor to give her a week to appeal to Trump directly to save the project. The Norwegian oil giant could yet walk away from the project. It said it would perform an updated assessment of the project’s economics in the second quarter.

“This project delivers on the energy ambitions shared by the United States and New York by providing a vital new source of power to the region,” said Molly Morris, president of Equinor Wind U.S. “Empire Wind brings supply chain investments in states across the nation including New York, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas and South Carolina.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/90/b5/94d62bdd431cb9b572f32427c473/trump-44163.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 10:09:43.742746

Interest in climate-friendly technology soared during Joe Biden’s presidency and benefited from a massive boost in funding through the Inflation Reduction Act. But the Trump administration wants to undo those programs. Nearly $8 billion in clean-tech investment and 16 projects were canceled, closed or downsized in the first quarter, according to a report from E2.

Venture capital investment in the clean-tech sector worldwide dropped 45% during the past two years from a peak of $55.7 billion in 2022, according to Crunchbase data.

Despite these headwinds, LanzaTech said in a securities filing that it recently raised $40 million in a sale of preferred stock to an unnamed existing investor after LanzaTech’s largest shareholder, Carbon Direct Capital Management, made an unsolicited offer last month to take the company private for about $4 million. The company’s market capitalization is $59 million.

“Alongside the preferred stock issuance and related transactions, the company is continuing to implement strategic measures to scale its global business with greater cost efficiency to support its transition from a research and development-centric company to a commercially focused enterprise,” LanzaTech said in a securities filing May 7.

LanzaTech’s joint venture with clean-energy investor Brookfield Renewables, which has agreed to provide capital to projects that use the company’s technology, also should provide some breathing room.

“They have options,” says Thomas Meric, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. “The company is expecting to get through the challenges they have in front of them.”

LanzaTech, which trades at 26 cents per share, has proposed a reverse stock split to avoid being delisted from the Nasdaq.

The company went public two years ago in a SPAC, or a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company that raised money from investors for an unspecified transaction. Such blank-check offerings were hot a few years ago, but many have struggled to maintain their initial offering prices.

LanzaTech’s shares never reached the $10 IPO price paid by the SPAC investors. Shares peaked at $8.38 on Sept. 19, 2023, and bottomed out at 14 cents per share April 4, according to Bloomberg data.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/lanzatech_hq.png,N,,2025-05-20 10:09:46.863005

Dive Brief:

A group of Congressional Republicans are asking their party to further tweak proposed changes to clean energy tax credits that the House Ways and Means Committee included in its reconciliation bill text.

The proposed budget reconciliation bill would decrease the credits for a number of clean energy technologies after 2028 and phase them out entirely after 2031, as well as additional requirements to qualify for the credits and an early sunset for their transferability. Rep. Jen Kiggans, a Virginia Republican, led 13 other House members in a joint statement Wednesday seeking to extend the transferability mechanism through the phase-out period and make other changes.

The GOP tax bill, as currently constructed, passed the House Budget Committee late on Sunday, after the committee failed to clear the bill on Friday. However, as Kiggans and the other lawmakers seek changes to the bill to further protect the clean energy tax provisions, others in the party are looking to speed up the phaseout.

Dive Insight:

While the original Inflation Reduction Act had technology-neutral clean energy production and investment credits available until 2032, the House Ways and Means Committee’s bill text would move the sunset dates up and phase them out over a four-year period. Companies would be able to receive 80% of the credit values in 2029, 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031, with the credits phasing out entirely in 2032. Another nuclear power production credit would be phased out on the same schedule.

Kiggans and her colleagues said they commended the committee “for including reasonable phase-out schedules” for the credits, but said in the May 14 joint statement that a few more changes are needed “to fully realize the intent of these phase-out schedules.”

“While many of these provisions reflect a commitment to American energy dominance through an all-of-the-above energy strategy, we must ensure certainty for current and future energy investments to meet the nation’s growing power demand and protect our constituents from higher energy costs,” the statement said.

Kiggins was joined on the statement by Reps. Andrew Garbarino, Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota of New York; Mark Amodei of Nevada; Don Bacon of Nebraska; Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania; Juan Ciscomani of Arizona; Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado; Dave Joyce of Ohio; Young Kim and David Valadao of California; and Dan Newhouse of Washington.

The members said retaining the transferability mechanism for the entirety of the credits’ lifecycle would provide companies “with the flexibility necessary to make long-term investments in American energy.”

In addition to extending the tax credit transferability mechanism through the entire phase-out period, the House lawmakers are also asking that adjustments be made to the “Foreign Entity of Concern provisions” and for a “placed in service” standard to be included in the proposed changes.

The foreign entity of concern provisions are “overly prescriptive,” according to the lawmakers, and “should be revised to allow companies additional time to reorganize their supply chains, ensuring a strategic and successful transition.” The “placed in service” provision, which adopts an Internal Revenue Service standard of preparedness for the credits, would require a project to be ready and available for use to qualify.

Kiggins and other moderate Republicans backing last week’s statement said the “placed in service” standard is misaligned with the phaseout schedule, and should be replaced in the text with a “start construction” standard. They said that adjustment “is essential to supporting the energy development needed to meet the growing power demand and protect thousands of high-quality American jobs in communities across the country.”

Clean energy developers and industry groups are “hoping that this draft isn’t the final text,” Robert Neifert, commercial and residential solar developer Solar Gain’s director for business development, said on a press call organized by Clean Energy for America last week.

“The way that the current rules are written with the placed in service rule … we're going to have to stop selling projects at the current tax rates in a year-and-a-half,” Neifert said.

Gilbert Campbell, founder and CEO of utility scale solar developer Volt Energy Utility, said on the May 13 call that the bill as written would lead to less private investment, increasing the price of building projects and leading to small businesses taking a “big hit.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mcX2Wcd05a1EileaQQSrCfEcbF8u4H7N39yugFqI2mg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODY1MjkwMTJfVFBrNm5uTy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-20 10:09:50.476433

The Republican proposal seeks to terminate or phase out a host of federal tax credits for things like electric vehicles, charging stations, residential clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades, utility-scale clean energy and renewable energy manufacturing, according to a preliminary analysis of the proposal by Rhodium Group.
According to the New York Times, conservatives wanted deeper spending cuts and were unhappy the legislation did not immediately eliminate clean energy tax credits.","Wisconsin labor and clean energy advocates say a Republican plan in Congress to end or phase-out Biden-era clean energy tax credits could jeopardize thousands of jobs and force some companies to abandon projects.

The House Ways and Means Committee recently released an amendment to Congress’ budget reconciliation package that would rollback tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act. The move is part of a large package of tax cuts and program reductions promoted by the Trump administration.

Last week, labor groups and the liberal nonprofit Forward Together held an event to highlight the potential for job loss if the the funding is canceled, saying the cancellation of tax incentives would endanger ongoing projects in Wisconsin.

The IRA was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022. It included provisions to address climate change through incentives for the clean energy through extended and expanded tax credits.

Companies have announced plans to invest more than $840 billion in clean energy projects in the United States since the IRA was passed, but only $321 billion of that private investment had been spent through the first quarter of 2025. That’s according to a report released Tuesday from Clean Investment Monitor, a joint effort between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rhodium Group, a New York-based policy research company.

In Wisconsin, roughly $5.3 billion in total private investment had been announced with more than $2.9 billion spent since the IRA became law, according to a spreadsheet from Clean Investment Monitor.

There were 407 operational jobs and 4,109 construction jobs associated with completed facilities in Wisconsin, and another 175 operational and 2,511 construction jobs expected for announced facilities not yet online, according to the spreadsheet.

“Our members of Congress should be defending and fighting for these jobs and investments in their districts, not threatening them,” said Peter Drummond, executive director of Forward Together Wisconsin.

Electrical workers union leaders from Madison and Greenfield, as well as the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, said Wednesday the climate law led to a boom in clean energy deployment across the state.

They said the plan to gut the IRA’s incentives could result in job losses, creating economic instability for families across Wisconsin.

“This wouldn’t just be canceling clean energy projects,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council. “They’d be canceling opportunities for thousands of our members and undermining Wisconsin’s energy independence.”

But a March 2025 policy analysis from libertarian Cato Institute think tank estimates the energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act will cost between $936 billion and $2 trillion over the next decade, and between $2 trillion and $4.7 trillion by 2050.

“The IRA’s energy subsidies are multiple times larger than initial estimates, and they expose American taxpayers to potentially unlimited liability,” the report states.

The Republican proposal seeks to terminate or phase out a host of federal tax credits for things like electric vehicles, charging stations, residential clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades, utility-scale clean energy and renewable energy manufacturing, according to a preliminary analysis of the proposal by Rhodium Group.

“The impact of the proposal is likely to be similar to the impact of a full repeal of the energy tax credits initially extended and expanded in 2022,” the analysis states.

The GOP budget reconciliation bill was blocked from advancing to the House floor Friday by hardline House Republicans on the House Budget Committee. According to the New York Times, conservatives wanted deeper spending cuts and were unhappy the legislation did not immediately eliminate clean energy tax credits.

One project in Wisconsin expected to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act is the construction of a new intermediate and middle school in Menasha, after the law allowed nonprofit and local governments to receive direct payments instead of tax credits.

Brian Adesso, director of Business Services for the Menasha Joint School District, said the district expects to receive a reimbursement of nearly $4 million for a rooftop solar, energy storage and geothermal system that are included in the project.

“Without the availability of these credits, we would not have had the certainty we needed to make these projects come to life,” he said. “That would be a huge loss for our district and our community.”

While advocates decry the effort to repeal some of the IRA’s incentives, federal Republicans have been critical of the law almost since its passage. Since 2023, they’ve argued that the law failed to reduce inflation.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Tony Wied, R-De Pere, defended the House GOP’s budget plan, saying it provides tax relief to working-class families.

“We’re committed to reversing the costly Green New Scam policies of the Biden Administration, which led to massive inflation and made life unaffordable for Wisconsinites,” he stated. “While Republicans are focused on lowering costs and supporting the working-class, Democrats continue to push for devastating tax hikes that will hurt everyday Wisconsin families.”

Ending the clean energy tax credits could face challenges in the U.S. Senate, where moderate Republicans have said the proposal needs changes to earn their support, according to Politico.

Eight government departments lacked a formal system for tracking Green Public Procurement (GPP) implementation.

20 May 2025: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has today published its fourth report on Green Public Procurement (GPP) adoption by government departments. GPP allows public authorities to source goods, services or works that have a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle while also achieving value for money.

A total spend of €1.24 billion across 18 government departments was reported. Of this, 82 per cent of contracts, valued at €1.02 billion, included green criteria (compared to 34 per cent in 2022).

GPP implementation varied widely across government departments, with the number of contracts incorporating GPP ranging from zero to 100%. There was an inconsistency in application of green criteria across product & services sectors, with high adoption reported for Food & Catering Services and Heating Equipment (100 per cent) but low adoption in contracts for ICT Products & Services (29 per cent).

Launching the report Laura Burke, Director General, said:

“This report shows a welcome increase in the use of green public procurement by central government. Full adoption across all government departments is a powerful lever to achieve better economic and environmental value as well as showing leadership in a transition to a greener, more circular economy. The EPA has developed practical guidance to support Government Departments and other public bodies to accelerate green purchasing.”

Tracking of GPP remains an issue to be addressed with eight of the 18 Government Departments lacking a formal system for tracking GPP implementation.

Mr David Flynn, Director, EPA Office of Environmental Sustainability added:

“Government, local authorities and other public sector organisations collectively procure over €18 billion worth of goods, services and works. Whilst it is important that GPP is used by government departments, a broader adoption across the entire public sector will ensure that public funds are used effectively and responsibly while reducing the environmental impact of our public services.”

Notes to Editor

The EPA reports annually on the implementation of Green Public Procurement by government departments. This is the fourth report in the series and relates to reference year 2023.

The EPA supports GPP implementation including providing national guidance and national criteria for priority sectors; monitoring and reporting on GPP implementation in government departments annually, publishing case studies and hosting ‘GPP in Practice’ events to showcase examples of GPP across the public sector.

There are national GPP criteria published for eleven priority sectors: ICT Products & Services, Food & Catering Services, Indoor Cleaning Services, Indoor and Outdoor Lighting, Heating Equipment, Energy-related Products, Paper Products & Printing Services, Textile Products & Services, Furniture & Related Services, Office Building Design, Construction & Management, Road Transport Vehicles & Services.

All 18 government departments provided returns for 2023 reference year, which requested data on GPP implementation at contract level (number and value of contracts), where the contract value was greater than €50,000 and the contract was signed in calendar year 2023. A summary of the data reported to the EPA is tabulated below. Note the reporting relates to Government Department contracts and does not include procurement by agencies affiliated to those Departments.

Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin and Rep. Jason Morgan, of Ann Arbor, said they intend to rework bills that ensure companies and utilities pay for cleanups and open their records for public review. The legislation, which they plan to reintroduce in June, would also allow legal recourse for residents who suspect they have been harmed by the pollution.

The measure passed the state Senate last year but was lost amid a tumultuous and early end to the Michigan legislature’s lame duck session in December.

“We’ve migrated from ‘Let’s make this law that holds polluters to account,’ to ‘How can we focus on the most egregious cases,’” Irwin said. “How can we work around the edges of the law so as not to fundamentally change its approach, but nonetheless get better results?

“The idea is to require better cleanups of contaminated land and discourage companies from leaving a mess in the first place. I still expect universal opposition from polluters. Industry isn’t going to support more stringent standards no matter how reasonable, because it costs them money.”

The lawmakers are part of a working group that includes the Michigan Manufacturing Association, the Michigan Chemistry Council and some manufacturers. They said they want industries and state regulators to collaborate in the pollution assessment process, and they envision a negotiation process with some tough compromises.

It is likely that some sites will never meet residential standards, Irwin said.

“That gives us more flexibility to address those standards where they make sense,” Irwin said. “Some properties might continue to be designated for industrial use. Auto plants and other large industrial sites are the ones that may not be fully cleaned up (to residential standards).”

First introduced in 2023, Michigan Senate bills 605–611 are far different from laws recently passed in Vermont and New York, which are also often described as “polluter pays” measures. The Vermont and New York bills are modeled after the federal Superfund law, and would essentially tax big oil companies for their historic greenhouse gas emissions.

In Michigan, lawmakers are seeking accountability from businesses and industries that for years have left toxins in the ground or in the water.

Testing Toxic Sites

Michigan has tens of thousands of toxic sites, including many one-time commercial enterprises, that will likely fall within the proposal’s reach. The former Gelman Sciences Inc. site in Ann Arbor, which manufactured medical filters and related products for the pharmaceutical and microelectronic industries, is a prime example.

The chemical solvent known as 1,4-dioxane, a potential carcinogen, was used in production and has been found in local groundwater and nearby wells. The state and Washtenaw County has been overseeing remediation activities at the site for over 30 years. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has recommended the site to the National Superfund Priorities List.

Irwin said troubled sites will be evaluated and tested, with soil and water samples, for a range of toxins. “Is the site near a residential area, or is it located downtown?” Irwin said. “The goal is to take this case by case, and allow flexibility for sites that are in different locations.”

Progress Michigan, an advocacy organization, said its polls show over 90 percent of the public support laws that could save taxpayers from huge remediation costs. Dave Dempsey, senior advisor at For Love of Water, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the Great Lakes Basin, said the proposed legislation is an attempt at fairness.

The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy “estimates it will cost $13 billion for all these cleanups,” Dempsey said. “It could take two generations to do this, or until the end of the century. Now we just have these old sites discharging pollution into rivers and lakes.” Dempsey’s organization also wants to prevent an increase in abandoned toxic sites.

Taxpayers are currently footing the bill for so-called “orphan sites,” locations where owners are unclear or unidentified. Under current law, developers who clean up unclaimed brownfields receive tax increment financing, Irwin said.

The Biggest Culprits

Sean McBrearty, director of the nonprofit Michigan Clean Water Action, said he wonders if any polluter pay effort can succeed when corporations are often the biggest culprits. McBrearty pointed to DTE Energy, which has faced legal action over its coal-fired power plants and other facilities.

“There are industrial accidents that haven’t been cleaned up because it’s cheaper to lobby the legislature than clean up contaminated sites,” said McBrearty, whose organization has worked with Irwin’s latest version of legislation.

Irwin acknowledged that his bill will again face tough political realities. “We worry about a ‘pay-to-play’ environment where companies will use payments to stop an investigation,” Irwin said. “Now that the Michigan House is Republican, that adds more of a challenge.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1094585680-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 10:10:13.068877

San Juan, P.R. - Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that three recipients across Puerto Rico have been selected to receive $1.5 million in Brownfields rants to assess, clean up, and revitalize local lands. These investments support locally driven redevelopment, unlocking economic opportunity, creating jobs, and improving public health outcomes in communities in Puerto Rico. These will keep critical momentum going in communities already benefiting from Brownfields investments, ensuring continued progress toward safe and reusable land.

""The brownfield grants are a vital tool for Puerto Rico, enabling us to revitalize our neighborhoods and restore community pride,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “By cleaning up polluted sites, we are not only protecting public health but also stimulating economic opportunities that benefit all residents.""

“I thank Regional Administrator Martucci and the EPA for their continued support in advancing Puerto Rico’s priorities and economic development,” said Governor of Puerto Rico Jenniffer González-Colón. “These Brownfield grants represent an opportunity to allow the municipalities of Orocovis, Toa Alta and local organizations to clean up contaminated sites and transform them into spaces that uplift communities and generate economic activity. This investment from EPA is yet another example of what strong federal partnerships can achieve for the island.”

“These grants are smart investments for revitalizing communities across Puerto Rico,” said Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico Pablo José Hernández Rivera. “I’m pleased to announce this $1.5 million in funding for Orocovis, Toa Alta, and the Center for Habitat Construction that will help clean up contamination, attract new development, and improve public health. I look forward to continuing to support our municipalities and organizations, so they remain well-positioned to compete for federal resources.”

EPA has made these selections based on a competitive process. Selectees in Puerto Rico are:

The Center for Habitat Reconstruction in Puerto Rico has been selected to receive $500,000 to conduct up to nine environmental site assessments. The funding will also support reuse planning and community engagement activities, including nine community meetings. The target area for this grant includes the Municipalities of Vega Baja, Toa Baja, and Hormigueros. Priority sites for assessment include a former uniform factory in Hormigueros, a former school in Toa Baja, and a former industrial park in Vega Baja.

The Municipality of Orocovis, Puerto Rico has been selected to receive $500,000 to inventory and prioritize brownfield sites, as well as conduct ten environmental site assessments. The funding will also support the development of up to ten cleanup plans and community engagement activities.

The target area for this grant is the Municipality’s Northern District. Priority sites include a 3.3-acre former clothing factory, a 16.9-acre former vocational center, and four former schools ranging from 1.6 to 35.3 acres.

The Municipality of Toa Alta, Puerto Rico has been selected to receive $500,000 to inventory and prioritize sites, as well as conduct 23 environmental site assessments. The funding will also support the development of up to ten cleanup plans and community engagement activities.

The target area for this grant is the Municipality’s Former Industrial Zone. Priority sites include a 1.3-acre former coffin factory, a 75.3-acre former industrial park, a 2-acre former carton factory, and a 2.2-acre former trucking depot.

Brownfields grants are a powerful catalyst for local economic growth. Communities in Puerto Rico have used previous EPA grants to assess, cleanup, and attract new development. Nationally, Brownfields funding delivers proven results:

13.9 jobs per $100,000 of EPA Brownfield Grant funds spent

$20.45 for each $1 of EPA Brownfields funding expended on assessment, cleanup, and revolving loan fund grants.

Property values near cleaned-up sites increase by 5-15.2% with an estimated gain of $500,000 to $1.5 million in total property values

Increase of $29-97 million in local tax revenue in just the first year post-cleanup, per a study done in 2017.

EPA’s Brownfields Program helps transform underutilized and blighted properties into community assets – empowering neighborhoods, protecting health, and sparking lasting economic change.

Background

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.6 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments leveraged more than $34 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 175,500 jobs.

Dive Brief:

A federal judgeon Thursday granted a preliminary injunction blockingthe U.S. Department of Energyfrom instituting a 15% cap on reimbursement for colleges’ indirect research costs.

A group of universities and higher education associations sued the department in April, alleging it had overstepped its authority in implementing the policy and applying the change retroactively by terminating grants with reimbursement rates above the cap.

In her ruling last week, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with the plaintiffs' arguments and said they are likely to succeed in proving the Energy Department's funding cap is ""arbitrary and capricious” and violates federal law.

Dive Insight:

Burroughs had temporarily blocked the Energy Department's policy days after the plaintiffs filed suit. Thursday’s ruling extends that freeze, banning the agency from applying its rate cap policy to any colleges until she orders otherwise.

Despite the government's mounting legal losses, the Trump administration is not letting up on efforts to limit research-related funding to colleges.

The U.S. Department of Defense announced Wednesday it would enact its own 15% indirect research cap.The agency estimated that the change will reduce outgoing funding by $900 million annually.

""We will not stop at new grants,""U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in the memo. ""Meaningful savings can also be achieved by revisiting the terms of existing awards to institutions of higher education.""

Hegseth directed agency officials to terminate and reissue previously -awarded grants under the new terms if colleges do not agree to them.

COGR, an association for research universities and institutes and medical centers,criticized the Defense Department proposal as a cut to national security.

""Under the Trump Administration, DOD is the fourth federal agency to impose a 15% cap on research indirect cost reimbursement rates. The courts continue to halt implementation of these harmful policies,"" Matt Owens, president of COGR, said in a statement Friday. ""It’s time the Administration stop issuing misguided policies and start working in good faith with the academic research community.""

The Energy Department announced its ceiling on indirect research costs on April 11, following in the footsteps of the National Institutes of Health, which had announced a similar one in February. A federal judge in early April struck down the NIH cap.

In announcing the Energy Department's version, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said the change would ensure federal funding efficiently supported research versus “administrative costs and facility upgrades.”

The department, which awards about $2.5 billion annually to over 300 colleges, estimated the cuts would halt $405 million in indirect cost funding annually.

The plaintiffs — including groups like the American Council on Education and the Association of American Universities and colleges like Princeton and Cornell universities — sued three days after the Energy Department's announcement.

In addition to alleging that the policy is unlawful, the lawsuit argues the funding change threatens the country's scientific and medical research advancement. Prior to the cap, many of the college plaintiffs had indirect research reimbursement caps north of 50%, according to court documents. Princeton, for example, negotiated an indirect cost rate of 62% for fiscal year 2024.

In her ruling, Burroughs said the agency needed to have a strong underlying rationale to change its negotiated rates with colleges.

But the department's 15% cap policy, ""even read generously, offers very little by way of explanation or justification for the decision to so suddenly and drastically limit reimbursement for indirect costs,"" she wrote.

The judge acknowledged that the Energy Department might have information that could support the new cap.

""If such data exists, however, it was not made public or otherwise articulated,"" she wrote.

The plaintiffs' lawsuit called the Energy Department's policy a ""virtual carbon copy” of the NIH's. In permanently blocking that cap, U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley ruled that NIH enacted it without following proper procedures and violated prohibitions against applying new policies retroactively.

“DOE’s action is unlawful for most of the same reasons and, indeed, it is especially egregious because DOE has not even attempted to address many of the flaws the district court found with NIH’s unlawful policy,” the plaintiffs in the Energy Department lawsuit said.

Burroughs last week agreed with Kelley's decision, calling it ""a well-reasoned opinion.""NIH has appealed that ruling.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/C68f5loqmG3G7M1emnw_xbOcZOAeo7EJQiheALGihyw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ET0VfZmFjYWRlXy1fV2FzaGluZ3Rvbl9EQy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:07.900680

This is after the industry has expressed trepidation over Trump energy and tariff policies that created uncertainty in the market by driving up costs, reducing domestic output and dissuading domestic producers from investing in exploration and expanded production, The Center Square reported.

While the Texas oil and natural gas industry reported job gains in January and February, it reported losses in March for the first time in months as rig counts dropped, The Center Square reported. The industry slightly rebounded in April, according to the latest employment data, The Center Square reported.

Uncertainty in the industry remains due to federal energy policies and “numerous economic and geopolitical factors” that continue to impact domestic production and related investment decisions, the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) said. This includes Trump administration tariffs on steel and aluminum and encouraging OPEC+ countries to increase production, driving down domestic production and profits, The Center Square reported.

However, a positive development is a commitment to reversing Biden administration-era policies, TIPRO notes. This includes Congress prioritizing pro-energy policies in its budget reconciliation bill, referred to by President Donald Trump as one “big, beautiful bill.” The policies include expanding federal fossil fuel leasing, reducing royalty rates, streamlining the permitting process, repealing so-called clean energy incentives, refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP).

The proposals were included in the energy sections of the House Ways and Means Committee and House Natural Resources Committee packages, including prioritizing expanding fossil fuel production, TIPRO notes. The sections were included in the package before the House Budget Committee, which failed to advance it on Friday.

TIPRO and others have called for prioritizing domestic energy production, expanding critical infrastructure, including LNG ports and pipelines, protecting key tax provisions essential to the industry, among other priorities.

Included in the House package is a requirement for at least 30 oil and natural gas lease sales to be made on federal land and in the Gulf of America over the next 15 years. In Alaska, it requires six lease sales for Cook Inlet and authorizes leasing to begin in the National Petroleum Reserve and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It also reinstates quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales, generating an estimated $12 billion in revenue, TIPRO notes.

House energy proposals also reduce royalty rates to 12.5% for onshore and offshore drilling, down from 16.67% and 18.75%, respectively, and put processes in place to increase permitting approvals for energy projects.

House Republicans also repealed provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including clean energy incentives that provided tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable energy projects. They also curtailed the hydrogen production credit and expired “technology neutral” clean energy credits by 2031, TIPRO notes.

The House proposal also allocated $1.5 billion to replenish the SPR and delayed MERP by 10 years.

“With the exponential growth in energy demand forecasted in the coming years, oil and natural gas will continue to play a dominant role, but we must have the right strategy in place to provide regulatory and economic certainty to our members for the benefit of our country and allies,” TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said.

With Texas continuing to lead the U.S. in oil and natural gas production, emissions reductions and job growth, “sound policies that support fair business practices and laws that keep our state competitive are necessary if Texas is going to continue to benefit from oil and natural gas activity,” Texas Oil & Gas Association President Todd Staples said.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/05/19021720/AP25062706781334-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:11.717015

• Broader Emergency Definition: An Energy Emergency Alert Level 1 now qualifies for emergency demand response if escalation to Level 2 appears imminent without intervention, effectively lowering the threshold for what constitutes a grid emergency.","The Environmental Protection Agency recently moved to clarify when stationary emergency backup generators may operate in nonemergency situations.

The agency did so through the release of a Fact Sheet and Frequently Asked Questions as well as a companion press release clarifying when stationary emergency backup generators may operate in nonemergency situations.

While the guidance is nonbinding, it indicates a flexible approach that could have implications for companies, such as data centers, considering or already enrolled in certain demand response programs.

Under Clean Air Act (CAA) regulations, EPA allows certain classes of stationary internal combustion engines to operate without an hourly limit for emergency situations but with a 100-hour annual limit for nonemergency situations.

A nonemergency situation includes demand response as part of a financial agreement with a third party. These agreements enable operators to seek reimbursement for financial costs associated with nonemergency demand response uses.

Under EPA regulations, backup engines may be operated pursuant to these agreements for up to 50 hours a year, which counts toward the broader 100-hour nonemergency limit, provided that five conditions are met:

• The engine is dispatched by the local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator.

• The dispatch is intended to mitigate local transmission and/or distribution limitations to avoid the interruption of local power supply.

• The dispatch follows reliability and safety protocols that adhere to specific standards or guidelines.

• The power is provided only to the facility itself or to support the local transmission and distribution system.

• The owner or operator keeps adequate records.

• The regulations do not provide a definition for the term “local balancing authority” or “local transmission and distribution system operator,” nor do they define “emergency” with particularity.

EPA's new guidance addresses how businesses with energy-intensive operations can participate in demand response programs without violating CAA regulations.

EPA’s recent guidance refers to a letter EPA sent to Duke Energy clarifying two key points:

• Enhanced Local Authority: Grid operators and local balancing authorities can now require customers to activate backup generators during demand response events, helping prevent widespread outages by reducing grid load.

• Broader Emergency Definition: An Energy Emergency Alert Level 1 now qualifies for emergency demand response if escalation to Level 2 appears imminent without intervention, effectively lowering the threshold for what constitutes a grid emergency.

EPA is currently ""evaluating more substantive changes"" to the underlying regulations, though specifics on timing and scope remain undefined.

APPA said that there may be a new rulemaking that could expand permissible generator activities under the various stationary engine Clean Air Act rules.

These clarifications provide more flexibility for facilities to support grid reliability while maintaining regulatory compliance, APPA said.

The guidance seems to recognize the need to balance air quality with grid stability amid the demands of artificial intelligence and data centers, according to APPA.

Notably, EPA’s Fact Sheet and FAQ cite the Trump administration’s goal to “ensure [that the] U.S. is the AI capital of the world” as well as Executive Order 14156 (“Declaring a National Energy Emergency”), underscoring the national significance of these changes.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-20 04:01:57.432399

A phased reduction of tax incentives for renewable projects, the termination of both the electric vehicle tax credits and clean hydrogen production credits are possible.
Sylvia Leyva Martinez, Wood Mackenzie’s Principal Analyst for utility-scale solar, says the US solar manufacturing sector could be negatively affected.
Even with proposals from House Republicans, there is still momentum for new nuclear power.
Emerging technologies: hydrogen hit hard, CCUS unscathed The Ways and Means Committee proposes to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit.","“When it rains, it pours” is a popular expression around the world. It reflects a series of events that cascade in quick succession and can have big implications. And it defined US energy and economic policy last week.

Detailed answers have emerged to an important question facing the US energy sector: how will the Republican party change Biden-era policies?

There is a clear agenda from the Republican-led Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees: bolstering traditional energy sectors and reducing low-carbon energy incentives. Leasing activity for the Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico) and geothermal acreage are set for a major expansion under proposed legislation. While nuclear power investment incentives have a faster sunset, other federal policies provide momentum for the sector. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) was a surprise winner, with incentives largely unchanged.

Zero-carbon energy policy could change radically, should House Republicans have their way. A phased reduction of tax incentives for renewable projects, the termination of both the electric vehicle tax credits and clean hydrogen production credits are possible. These modifications could dramatically delay the transition to low-carbon technologies in the United States.

It is important to note that Congress is still debating the future of US energy policy. As the budget reconciliation process progresses, further legislative changes are highly likely. Senate Republicans are advocating for more moderate changes to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 to ensure reliable power supply, maintain foreign investment in US energy and preserve economic growth.

Other top stories this week include:

Zero-carbon power: investment incentives are shorter and harder to claim

Beyond the phase-out of production tax credits (PTC) and investment tax credits (ITC) for wind, solar storage, and nuclear, other provisions in the proposed legislation could slow down investment. In the proposed bill, projects are eligible for tax credits once they are placed in service, rather than from the start of construction. Transferability of credits would also end, eliminating a key option for financing projects. Stringent new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions for some of the tax credits would further restrict investment.

Companies using components with material assistance or licensing agreements from prohibited foreign entities, known as FEOC would be disqualified from receiving the credits.

For wind, the most significant aspect of the proposals may be section 112014, which outlines a halt on the advanced manufacturing tax credits for all wind locally produced components starting from 2027. Significant investments have been made in recent years to strengthen the US wind supply chain, particularly in nacelle assembly and tower manufacturing.

Sylvia Leyva Martinez, Wood Mackenzie’s Principal Analyst for utility-scale solar, says the US solar manufacturing sector could be negatively affected. The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit would remain at full value starting in 2029, then decrease to 75% in 2030, 50% in 2031 and 0% in 2032. But although the slower phase-out is positive for manufacturers, US companies licensing Chinese technology or engaging in joint ventures with Chinese entities would lose access to the 45X credits under the FEOC exclusions. This could disrupt solar component supply for US solar manufacturing.

For storage, the impact would be exacerbated by increased tariffs because of the US market’s reliance on batteries from China, says Allison Weis, Wood Mackenzie’s Global Head of Energy Storage.

Even with proposals from House Republicans, there is still momentum for new nuclear power. According to Gerardo Bocard of Wood Mackenzie’s Scenarios and Emerging Technologies team, there are three areas to watch. The US Department of Energy recently reissued a US$900 million SMR funding program. Licensing improvements are taking place following the ADVANCED Act, which should lower project development costs. New project learning rates from Canada's nuclear investment program can be applied to new nuclear projects in the US.

For geothermal, the Ways and Means bill accelerates the phase-out of the ITC. While this is a challenge, the Energy and Commerce Committee is proposing to increase geothermal lease sales on federal lands. Richard Hood of Wood Mackenzie’s Geothermal team, notes that several states including New Mexico, North Dakota, and Colorado are enacting legislation to expand geothermal investment. In addition, lease sales were announced in Alaska and Utah.

Despite conflicting signals, the investment tailwind for geothermal remains: the DoE announced over a billion dollars’ worth of funding for geothermal related projects, the House of Representatives passed significant bills supporting the exploration and development of resources and, tech giant Apple expanded its data center capacity and increased support for US manufacturing.

Transport: electric vehicle incentives are phased out; support for biofuels expands

For electric vehicles, the House Ways and Means proposal eliminates the new clean vehicle credit for any vehicle placed in service after 31 December 2026, effectively phasing out the tax credit. For electric vehicles, the House Ways and Means proposal restricts the clean vehicle credit (CVC) to 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer in 2026, eliminates the CVC from 2027 and the commercial clean vehicle credit, including leasing, from 2026.

Prateek Biswas and Andrew Brown, Wood Mackenzie’s lead analysts covering the transport sector, expected these changes. The proposals are consistent with our worst-case scenario forecast, which projected EV penetration in 2030 to drop to 23% from around 32% in Wood Mackenzie’s base case. More steps to change EV incentives are likely, according to Biswas and Brown.

Key developments to watch: Lee Zeldin’s Environmental Protection Agency is likely to lower federal greenhouse gas emission standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe. Sean Duffy’s Transportation Department will revise Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÉ) standards. The Trump administration is also likely to challenge California’s zero emission vehicle wavier.

Policy support for biofuels expands with amendments to the Clean Fuel Production Credit under 45Z. The credit would be extended to 2031, increasing investor certainty. The proposed legislation excludes emissions from indirect land use change in carbon intensity calculations, increasing credit values for domestic food-crop based biofuels. While the legislation also limits credit eligibility to feedstocks sourced outside of North America and could reduce the US market’s appeal, imports are still likely due to state level clean fuel credits from the low carbon fuel standards and the federal renewable fuel standard.

Emerging technologies: hydrogen hit hard, CCUS unscathed

The Ways and Means Committee proposes to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit. This would apply to facilities beginning construction after 31 December 2025. This change exacerbates market uncertainty since the credit was introduced in 2022 as part of the IRA.

Wood Mackenzie's analysis shows that 95% of the 3.4 million tonnes per annum of announced green hydrogen capacity is at risk. According to Wood Mackenzie’s Principal Analysts for low-carbon hydrogen Hector Arreola and Bridget van Dorsten, this policy change could significantly impact the US clean hydrogen industry's growth and competitiveness in the global clean energy market.

CCUS incentives emerge largely unharmed from the Ways and Means Committee. The 45Q tax credit remains unchanged in quantity and duration, but the Committee's proposal includes two modifications: a restriction barring entities from ""covered nations"" (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) from claiming 45Q credits and an elimination of the transferability of the 45Q credit.

Even with these minor modifications, Rohan Dighe, US CCUS lead for Wood Mackenzie, notes that CCUS projects currently in development in the US should not see major impacts if this proposal is enacted.

Upstream: lease sales will jumpstart Gulf of America (GoA) exploration

The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to expand offshore oil and gas leasing. Draft legislation requires 30 total lease sales between 2025 and 2040, beginning in August 2025. This would replace the Biden administration’s leasing goals, which led to only three lease sales in the GoA since 2021, well below the historical average.

More frequent leases will unlock more GoA production through exploration, according to Miles Sasser Senior Analyst of Wood Mackenzie’s L48 upstream team. Right now, the GoA is around 20% of global deepwater production. But with its current project profile, the GoA peaks by 2027. With exploration, we think it is possible to maintain about 2 million boe/d of GoA production beyond 2030. Key companies to watch include Chevron, Shell and BP, all of which have the technological capabilities to open up new GoA resources.

Minerals: more domestic supply won’t offset China’s dominance

The House Energy and Commerce Committee also aims to expand production for copper, nickel and lithium. Each are key minerals for zero-carbon energy technologies. According to the committee, more US mineral production could come from renewing mineral leases, expanding mineral exploration and improving project permitting.

But expanding US mineral supply does not address the core issue facing the US minerals sector. Any expansion to US mineral production will be dependent on China’s supply chains for battery components, cells and recycling, according to Wood Mackenzie’s Adrian Gardner, Principal Analyst. Trade tariffs could be a catalyst for investments in copper smelters in the US, although investors would need to be confident in a multi-decade tariff program to advantage US production over imports.

Other key stories

Trade tariff pressure eases – for now

The temporary reduction in tariffs between the US and China marks a significant de-escalation in the trade war, averting a complete decoupling of the world's two largest economies. The current tariff levels align closely with our Q2 2025 base case assumptions. We projected US tariffs on Chinese imports would settle at 34% by the end of 2026.

According to Wood Mackenzie’s Head of Economics, Peter Martin, should these temporary tariffs become permanent, both nations would be ahead of our projected timeline for trade negotiations. This could lead to slightly lower trade barriers than initially anticipated. However, the temporary tariffs represent a material increase in trade barriers between the US and China compared to 2024 levels.

The US-China agreement presents potential upside risks to our GDP forecasts for both countries. Our current outlook forecasts 1.5% and 4.3% growth in 2025 for the US and China, respectively. This tariff reduction could soften the disruption to global supply chains and investment patterns.

While offering temporary relief on higher tariffs, the reversal in policy adds to volatility and uncertainty. We caution that trade relations remain changeable, and ongoing monitoring is crucial to assess the long-term impact on investment and economic performance.

Canada goes all in on nuclear power

Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has taken a final investment decision (FID) decision to build Canada’s first SMR. This is the first SMR FID in North America and is part of a wider strategy within OPG to build four SMRs by 2050. Funding commitments from OPG, Canada's net zero target and the renewed focus on energy security under Prime Minister Mark Carney underpin the country’s investment in nuclear power.

OPG's SMR plan will be expensive. The company expects total construction costs for all four SMRs to be US$15.7 billion, including control systems. We estimate that capital costs for the first 300-MW SMR will be around US$14,250/kW, based on disclosed OPG estimates. By the fourth project, our cost projections fall to US$10,113/kW – a 30% reduction compared to the first SMR.

The new landscape for gas-fired power

Expectations of higher load growth globally led to a surge in gas turbine orders last year – up 32% globally year-on-year. A “gold rush” is how one of the leading gas turbine manufacturers characterised demand for turbines recently. In our latest analysis of gas-fired power, Wood Mackenzie said that the gas turbine market could face multiple headwinds.

According to Ben Boucher in Wood Mackenzie’s supply chain team, global gas turbine manufacturing capacity of 60 to 70 GW is maxed out through 2030. There are market-specific challenges for natural gas into power. In the US, hurdles include rising capital costs for gas turbines, tariffs and low power prices. In Asia, high fuel prices and renewables limit gas to peaking. Decarbonisation in Europe results in a long-term decline of natural gas into power.

The so-called 25D tax credit would still apply for systems that are installed this year, and then it would go away completely.
Without the tax credits, solar systems might still make financial sense in places that get a lot of sun or have high electricity prices, or both, but the payback period will likely grow.
Some Republicans have acknowledged the role that energy tax credits play in the economy, and their districts.
“This is going to turn on what the Senate does,” said Brand, about the future of the solar credits.","“This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.”

For the last two decades, homeowners have been able to claim thousands of dollars in federal tax credits to help offset the high upfront costs of going solar. Things were supposed to stay that way through 2034. But, this week, the U.S. House of Representatives proposed abruptly ending the incentives at the end of the year. If this idea survives the House and passes the Senate, it could upend the economic calculus of powering your home with the sun.

“It would put solar out of reach for millions of people,” said Glen Brand, director of policy and advocacy at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that encourages adoption of the technology. “What the House has done is to put ordinary Americans in a really hard place. They are basically saying they aren’t going to help people with rising energy costs.”

The country’s first solar tax credits took effect in 1978, but were allowed to lapse in 1985, when President Ronald Regan was in office. In 2005, however, another Republican — President George W. Bush — revived them. Lawmakers have extended and tweaked the incentives ever since, most recently with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which set the credit at 30 percent of the cost of a system until 2032, before a two-year phase out.

The average cost of a solar system in the U.S. right now is just north of $28,000, according to Zoë Gaston, a principal analyst for residential solar at the energy consultant Wood MacKenzie. That means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500.

On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee released an initial budget reconciliation proposal that would roll back large swaths of the IRA, including support for residential solar. The so-called 25D tax credit would still apply for systems that are installed this year, and then it would go away completely.

Without the tax credits, solar systems might still make financial sense in places that get a lot of sun or have high electricity prices, or both, but the payback period will likely grow. For other people, the math may no longer work at all.

“We would expect sales and installation to surge this year, followed by a market contraction,” said Gaston. “If a homeowner is thinking about solar and can afford it,” now would be the time.”

The 25D credit isn’t the only relevant tax break under threat. Another credit, 48E, is available to businesses that install solar on homes where the resident then either leases the equipment or enters into a power purchase agreement. This allows companies to reduce what they charge customers. According to Gaston, more than half of residential installations now follow this third-party ownership model.

Instead of eliminating 48E, the House favors applying limits on where the material in photovoltaic panels comes from. While experts are still sorting out exactly what the proposed language means, it generally aims to bar participation of “foreign entities of concern” — including those in China, where the vast majority of solar components are made.

“It puts the obligation on the installer or the developer to trace back the supply chain in a way that’s completely impossible,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. This, he said, could effectively make the 48E credit effectively impossible to access starting in 2026.

The current House language could at least temporarily push folks toward the third-party ownership options, said Gaston. But when Wood MacKenzie did an analysis, before the House draft, that assumed a phase out of credits by 2028, it still projected a 30 percent drop in installed residential capacity by the end of the decade.

“It’s going to be devastating for companies, their employees, and their customers,” said Gallagher. “It’ll kill an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of workers and tens of billions of dollars in investment every year.”

The House move isn’t the only headwind the solar industry is facing. Some states, most notably California, for example, have lowered the amount the homeowners can earn selling power to the grid, making solar less lucrative. Even before Republicans took control of Congress and the White House, companies were starting to let employees go. More layoffs have ensued.

Some Republicans have acknowledged the role that energy tax credits play in the economy, and their districts. Twenty-one House members of the party signed a letter to Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith expressing concern about “disruptive changes to our nation’s energy tax structure.” Four Republican Senators also wrote to Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, urging “a targeted, pragmatic approach” to any changes.

“This is going to turn on what the Senate does,” said Brand, about the future of the solar credits. He believes it’s unlikely that the House proposal will become law in its current form and is optimistic that the rollbacks will be rectified. “This is a piece the Senate can get right.”

But the harm to the solar industry is already being done, said Jacquelyn Pless, a professor who researches energy and environmental economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The constant back and forth over policy, she said, makes it extremely difficult for companies to plan ahead.

“Policy volatility is really my bigger concern,” Pless said. “Policy uncertainty alone can start to freeze investment, raise costs, and damage market confidence.”

“At the state level, things are changing all the time.” But recently, Walters has seen an accelerated trend of legislation on a state level.
He pointed in particular to Missouri, where lawmakers are advancing an ALEC-authored judicial deference bill to weaken the power of regulators in the state.","As Elon Musk and his DOGE cronies take a sledgehammer to federal agencies, corporate interests are mounting a coordinated effort to dismantle state rules and regulations — backing legislative efforts to kneecap state watchdogs’ ability to enforce everything from environmental protections to worker safeguards.

This means that as guardrails for consumers and workers are dismantled on a federal level, states are in danger of losing their ability to pick up the slack.

In fifteen states this year, according to a review by the Lever, lawmakers have introduced “judicial deference” laws, which would stack the deck against state regulators and allow corporate America to swiftly challenge and strip away state protections ranging from restrictions on pollution to consumer safeguards.

The legislation mimics the Supreme Court’s 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo decision that defanged federal regulators, with widespread consequences.

Ten of the bills include language that is nearly identical to model legislation authored by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a right-wing policy incubator that, with the assistance of private interests, is pushing to gut state regulators’ power around the country. In Missouri and Nevada, the bills have made it through one chamber; in Oklahoma, the legislation now awaits the governor’s signature.

The language, experts told the Lever, in some cases goes beyond the ruling of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority to even further constrain state regulators.

The coordinated push reveals how states are becoming a more important battleground than ever for the fight against corporate power and deregulation. If, for example, the embattled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can’t protect you from junk fees, your state attorney general could be the next best option.

But if ALEC and its corporate backers succeed in pushing these bills through state legislatures, the end result is deregulation that extends far beyond Washington, consumer advocates warn.

“This is giving massive handouts to corporate interests who don’t want to be regulated and who are maximizing profit over the well-being of the community that they’re in,” said Devon Ombres, senior director for courts and legal policy at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy think tank.

Between the Loper Bright case and state-level efforts, Ombres said, lawmakers were “giving these already super-powerful entities leeway to attack regulations in entirely new ways.”

“A Very Well-Funded Campaign”

Back in 2014, when a power plant challenged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s air pollution regulations, a more liberal Supreme Court sided with environmental regulators. The Clean Air Act, the court reasoned, might not spell out exactly how the EPA should enforce Congress’ antipollution law, but environmental regulators had the authority to interpret ambiguous provisions according to their expertise.

The doctrine backing this decision was called Chevron deference, a precedent established by the high court in a 1984 ruling over the oil giant’s challenge to antipollution laws.

For decades, the Chevron doctrine directed federal judges to defer to regulators’ judgment on questions of law, so long as their judgment was reasonable. The state of affairs greatly expanded the scope and power of regulatory agencies.

Once embraced by the conservative establishment, the Chevron doctrine was a prime target of corporate interests by the 2010s. Corporate America had come to believe the precedent handed too much authority to regulators trying to rein in corporate power — like when the EPA successfully won over polluters.

Particularly emblematic of the corporate turn against Chevron is the evolving position of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas once supported the doctrine, upholding it in an opinion he authored in 2005. But he flip-flopped on the issue after years of undisclosed gifts and luxury travel from corporate billionaire Harlan Crow, as well as endless lobbying by right-wing legal organizations such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, which are increasingly backed by dark money.

Thomas’s about-face was just one step in the conservative legal movement’s long game to overturn Chevron and usher in a new deregulatory age. Another was the Loper Bright case, a challenge to federal marine authorities brought on behalf of commercial fisheries in New England. The case was backed by a laundry list of corporate interests, and the Supreme Court ultimately ruled 6–2 in their favor last year, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recusing herself, and Thomas joining with the majority to vote to sunset Chevron.

Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion in Loper Bright, held that courts must now “exercise their independent judgment” when deciding whether federal authorities have exceeded their authority — dealing a serious blow to regulators’ power. The ruling has had wide-ranging consequences: courts cited the death of Chevron to strike down firearm background-check requirements, airline fee restrictions, and environmental protections, as ProPublica reported last fall.

Now state courts, which have their own standards for evaluating state rules and regulations, are being forced to ask the same questions. For decades, there has been a piecemeal system in the states of “judicial deference” — how much judges defer to regulators’ judgment. In the years after Chevron, many states adopted similar legal regimes, but not all: the notoriously corporate-friendly Delaware, for instance, has long had a far less deferential standard.

State standards on this issue are a “moving target,” said Daniel Walters, a Texas A&M University School of Law professor. “At the state level, things are changing all the time.”

But recently, Walters has seen an accelerated trend of legislation on a state level.

A “very well-funded campaign,” he said, has begun “advocating for changes at the state level, to try to eliminate deference there.”

This campaign is being driven in part by ALEC.

“A Thumb on the Scale”

In a recent April webinar, ALEC staffers and conservative lawmakers around the country gathered on Zoom to discuss their deregulation battle across the states.

“So many states are moving in the right direction to adopt ALEC model policy,” Jonathan Williams, ALEC’s president and chief economist, said on the call.

He pointed in particular to Missouri, where lawmakers are advancing an ALEC-authored judicial deference bill to weaken the power of regulators in the state. The legislation passed in the Missouri Senate in February by a wide margin (25–7) after ALEC sent a representative to the state house to testify in its favor and is now being deliberated on in the House.

For years, ALEC has been a secretive hotbed for conservative policy, working closely with lawmakers across the country to pass model legislation drafted by the group. Its backers include the shadowy political network funded by conservative petrochemical tycoon Charles Koch of Koch Industries, among hundreds of other corporate interests, many of which were also involved in the fight against Chevron deference.

Many states with conservative leadership, hopping in on the DOGE zeitgeist, have been attempting to copy the Trump administration’s extreme agency-gutting playbook. State-level Department of Government Efficiency–inspired entities have cropped up in twenty-six states, according to an April report from the Economic Policy Institute.

They are being egged on by ALEC’s “government efficiency coalition,” a working group that coordinates these efforts nationwide. The Lever attended multiple coalition webinars this year, in which ALEC representatives and state lawmakers discussed their strategy — as well as the group’s attempts to pass judicial deference legislation.

“Every good idea that comes out of the states should be funneled up to the federal government, and vice versa,” ALEC’s CEO, Lisa Nelson, said on a January call.

ALEC isn’t the only corporate interest group lobbying for the Missouri deregulation bill. Legislative records indicate that the Associated Industries of Missouri, an industry group whose members include Boeing, Ford, and Mastercard, has been pushing for the legislation. So has the Pacific Legal Foundation and Americans for Prosperity, a dark money group backed by the Koch network.

The Missouri bill, like nine other bills introduced in different states this year, draws almost word for word from model legislation on judicial deference drafted by ALEC, which the organization claims will “restore judicial autonomy” by seizing power from state regulators and returning it to the courts.

What’s particularly noteworthy about this language, noted Walters at Texas A&M, is that it appears to expand upon the Supreme Court’s stance on judicial deference in its Loper Bright decision. Not only does the ALEC legislation direct that courts not give any deference to agency judgment at all, but it also directs judges to “exercise remaining doubt in favor of a reasonable interpretation that limits the scope of agency power and maximizes individual liberty.”

This, Walters said, goes “well beyond” what the Supreme Court decided in Loper Bright, amounting to a “thumb on the scale against agency action.”

Yet despite how apparently extreme the language is, state lawmakers are taking it up. Last year, Idaho codified the language into law. This legislative session, the Nebraska and Oklahoma legislatures have, like Missouri, both pushed bills containing the ALEC language through at least one chamber.

According to Walters, the impact of such a drastic policy — which directs judges to oppose agency action whenever possible — could be “chilling” in states, where regulators are in charge of critical environmental protections, antitrust enforcement, worker safeguards, and many other policies.

“It just seems like stacking the deck in many ways against agency action, and I think it would have profound implications for the ability of regulators to do their job,” he said.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/19104232/GettyImages-2206691913.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 04:02:05.425532

Let’s hope U.S. auto writers don’t fatally choke on the free-range egg splattered across their collective faces.

For more than three years, mainstream and trade auto journalists have promoted the false narrative that GM CEO Mary Barra is a “transformative” environmental leader boldly disrupting a complacent auto industry and championing the adoption of electric vehicles. Fortune last year named Barra America’s most powerful female business leader, citing her EV credentials, and the year before, ranked her alongside Elon Musk as one of the auto industry’s top disruptors.

InsideEVs even named Barra its 2024 Person of the Year.

“Under Barra’s leadership, GM executed an electric turnaround that may be taught in business schools someday,” gushed editor Patrick George. “That took some doing, and it’s why she is the InsideEVs Breakthrough Awards’ Person of the Year for 2024.”

Barra’s leadership may indeed be studied in business schools—but likely as a cautionary tale. Her story is one of chasing prevailing political winds and making strategic pivots based on short-term optics, all while relying on the expectation that U.S. taxpayers will endlessly subsidize GM’s operations, including its faltering EV ambitions.

After Joe Biden—whom Politico reported had a close relationship with Barra—was elected, Barra styled herself as an EV evangelist. She pledged to make GM an all-electric manufacturer by 2035 and embraced Biden’s climate agenda.

“As Chairman and CEO of General Motors, I now have a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to use my engineering mindset to help make the world a better place on a much larger scale,” she said. “At General Motors, we have a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It is our north star that guides everything we do.”

Falling Short

Barra’s results have so far fallen far short of her stated goals and objectives.

Barra famously predicted GM would outsell Tesla in EVs by the end of 2025. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla sold 336,681 EVs, while GM moved just 31,886. Even though GM’s EV sales nearly doubled, they still made up just 5% of the company’s total U.S. volume—well below the national average of 7% for EVs overall.

In California, the most EV-friendly state in the country, GM’s performance has been especially dismal. Even the Tesla Cybertruck—dismissed by the media as a commercial failure—outsold most of GM’s electric offerings in Q1. The one exception: the Equinox EV, which qualifies for generous U.S. tax credits despite being manufactured in Mexico, and beginning in 2025, with key parts sourced from Mexico and South Korea.

Now, in what amounts to a tacit admission of failure, Barra appears to have shifted course again—this time siding with the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken California’s aggressive EV mandates.

According to the Wall Street Journal, GM urged thousands of its white-collar employees in Michigan to contact U.S. senators in support of legislation that would overturn California’s landmark rule banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035—a mandate since adopted by 11 other states.

“We need your help!” read the GM email. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

A GM spokeswoman, who the Journal unfortunately didn’t identify, said GM wants to protect “consumer choice.” That’s comical, given that five years ago, Barra pledged to eliminate gas-powered options entirely by 2035.

This isn’t Barra’s first alignment with a Trump-era environmental rollback.

In 2019, the Trump administration moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own stricter emissions standards—a power the state had exercised for decades to accelerate clean vehicle adoption. Rather than standing with California and other environmentally forward states, GM backed the Trump administration, joining a coalition supporting efforts to weaken federal fuel economy rules and undercut California’s regulatory independence.

By contrast, Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen signed a voluntary agreement with California to meet tougher emissions targets. GM’s position sparked swift backlash from Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates, who rightly accused Barra of hypocrisy.

When President Biden took office, Barra reversed course again—rebranding herself as a climate ally. Just months after Biden assumed command, Barra announced a $1 billion investment to convert GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico for electric vehicle production. The move infuriated the United Auto Workers, who saw it as a betrayal of American labor.

“At a time when General Motors is asking for a significant investment by the U.S. government in subsidizing electric vehicles, this is a slap in the face for not only UAW members and their families but also for U.S. taxpayers and the American workforce,” former UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in response. “GM automobiles made in Mexico are sold in the United States and should be made right here, employing American workers. That is why our nation is investing in these companies. Taxpayer money should not go to companies that utilize labor outside the U.S. while benefiting from American government subsidies. This is not the America any of us signed on for. Frankly, it is unseemly.”

Trump's Tariffs

Even more unseemly: Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which extended generous tax breaks to EVs built in Mexico—including the Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Cadillac Optiq. If not for Trump-era tariffs, Barra likely would have shifted even more EV production to Mexico, where GM is the country’s largest automaker.

Barra’s latest pivot is no surprise. GM last fall abandoned its self-imposed goal of building 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and has twice delayed the reopening of its Lake Orion plant, which was slated to produce the electric Silverado. The company also pushed back the launch of a new Buick plug-in hybrid.

Notably, nearly half of GM’s Buick dealers took buyouts in 2023 rather than invest in the infrastructure needed to sell and service EVs—suggesting they may have had a better read on consumer demand than Barra herself.

Still, GM’s latest retreat from its electrification targets hasn’t sparked any humility within its leadership ranks.

Last week, Dave Richardson, a former Apple executive who now oversees software at GM, told reporters the company is working on a breakthrough called “mechatronics”—a system that integrates mechanical, electrical, and computing systems in vehicles. Tesla has been deploying this type of technology for more than a decade.

Given Richardson’s background, one might assume that integrating GM’s vehicle apps with the Apple Watch would be an easy win. Yet the project has been suspended because of glitches -- while Tesla rolled out seamless Apple Watch integration last December.

Meanwhile, GM claims to have made a significant advancement in battery technology with its lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistry, which reportedly offers 30% greater energy density at the same production cost and helps reduce reliance on Chinese intellectual property.

“LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability. He added that the new chemistry would “advance American battery innovation and create jobs well into the future.”

Silicon Valley Hotshots

Kelty, formerly of Tesla and Panasonic, and Richardson are among several Silicon Valley hotshots recruited by Barra to help recast GM as a tech-forward company. Yet while GM’s top tech leadership is based in California, Barra insists the company’s headquarters remains in Detroit—even though CNBC recently reported that President Mark Reuss’s office is located at the Warren Tech Center.

Every media interview I’ve read with Barra the reporter noted that it was conducted at GM’s Tech Center.

Richardson and Kelty have been with GM for less than two years. Time will tell whether they stick around. Notably, Barra last year trumpeted the hiring of JP Clausen, another ex-Tesla executive, to lead GM’s global manufacturing.

“JP’s unique expertise in global manufacturing innovation, engineering, and operations will accelerate our ability to deliver on our vision for GM with the highest quality vehicles for our customers,” Barra said in a press release.

Clausen recently disclosed on LinkedIn that he had left GM, citing that the decision “makes sense for me and my family right now.”",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_mary_7_58037.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:02:53.999000

Climate United lawyer Adam Unikowksy said the situation was growing dire for Climate United and other nonprofit green banks established under the GGRF, but maintaining the status quo was better than shunting the matter to federal claims court, which could take years to litigate.
As such, the matter should be decided in federal claims court, not the Court of Appeals or other traditional avenues.
When JUDGE suggested green banks might reorganize years later if they won in federal claims court, Unikowsky dismissed the possibility.
“They're probably not going to come back.” Climate United CEO Beth Bafford told Tribal Business News the organization would continue to fight to resume funding their work.","Lawyers for three nonprofit “green banks” attempted to preserve a court injunction blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from terminating their grants during a hearing Monday at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

The case centers on $20 billion in clean-energy funding, frozen in mid-February amid EPA questions about oversight and potential fraud, per prior Tribal Business News reporting. The agency later escalated on March 18 by terminating the grants entirely, prompting a flurry of lawsuits from affected grantees. District courts quickly enjoined the EPA from clawing back the funding, including $1.5 billion committed to Indian Country projects.

To quickly facilitate access to the funding under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the Biden administration placed the money in accounts at Citibank, N.A. With the injunction in place, the money sits frozen in those accounts, untouchable by the grantees or the EPA.

Climate United lawyer Adam Unikowksy said the situation was growing dire for Climate United and other nonprofit green banks established under the GGRF, but maintaining the status quo was better than shunting the matter to federal claims court, which could take years to litigate.

“I think if the issue is still percolating in this court, potentially, this court could leave the stay in place,” Unikowsky said. “I think a stay would be appropriate.”

EPA claims contractual dispute

However, EPA lawyer David Roth argued that the issue was a contractual dispute, not a statutory dispute. As such, the matter should be decided in federal claims court, not the Court of Appeals or other traditional avenues.

“There’s all sorts of provisions in the contract about who can do what with the money and when,” Roth told the three-judge panel. “I think that the nature of the dispute is over the contractual provisions and the EPA’s ability to terminate under those contractual provisions.”

Climate United is one of three grantees under the National Clean Investment Fund, a $14 billion program under the GGRF

The small number of grantees, as well as their arrangement with Citibank, raised alarms at the EPA once President Donald Trump took office. The arrangement did not provide sufficient oversight over the funds, the EPA argued.

Judges question EPA’s concerns

Court of Appeals judges seemed to take issue with the EPA’s reasoning.

“What's missing?” asked Judge Cornelia T.L. Pillard, an Obama appointee. “What is the concern, given that these grantees are subject to very strict guardrails, and if the money's misused they're subject to criminal penalty?”

Roth said the agency did not believe it had sufficient oversight over subgrantees down the line, regardless of their access to information about primary grantees.

“The EPA has the ability to see the money flowing out of the accounts, but they don’t have, other than in particular circumstances, a way to see how subgrantees are spending it,” Roth said. “The further removed it is, the harder it is to understand what’s going on.”

Unikowsky argued that the injunction fell under the Court of Appeals as a statutory issue. He stated that Climate United had title over the funding as programmatic income, since it had been released to Citibank already and was not being pulled from the US Treasury. In addition, the EPA’s termination violated statutory obligations under the Inflation Reduction Act, which established the GGRF in 2022, Unikowsky said.

During the hearing, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, repeatedly noted that Unikowsky conceded the EPA’s authority to terminate the grants, which favored Roth’s contractual argument.

Potential permanent impact

The judges asked what would happen if the injunction were lifted. When JUDGE suggested green banks might reorganize years later if they won in federal claims court, Unikowsky dismissed the possibility.

“We're just going to leave and aren't going to come back. Realistically, it's just not an option for these entities to shut down, fire or lay off their employees,” Unikowsky said. “They're probably not going to come back.”

Climate United CEO Beth Bafford told Tribal Business News the organization would continue to fight to resume funding their work.

“Today, the EPA should be celebrating new investments that create jobs, generate affordable domestic energy, and save hardworking Americans money. Instead, they are taking up a frivolous battle in court,” Bafford said in a statement. “This is bigger than our contract with the federal government. It’s about EPA’s lawless and indiscriminate subversion of Congress and due process to freeze our funds and terminate our grant agreement. We will continue to push forward so we can get back to doing this critical work.”

A ruling on the injunction has not yet been issued, and is expected in the next two weeks.

China is the biggest,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.","This intra-party rift has become a significant stumbling block for the GOP’s tax and spending bill, which is caught up in demands by hard-line conservatives for a wholesale gutting of hundreds of billions of dollars in Biden-era clean energy tax incentives. That push threatens to alienate moderate Republicans whose communities stand to gain from factories and other projects enabled by the tax breaks — and green-tech advocates who had hoped they could sway Trump by framing the incentives as the key to edging out China.

The message they’ve gotten instead: When it comes to winning on clean energy, Trump just isn’t interested.

“The second administration is really not about taking half-measures,” said Daniel Simmons, who ran the Energy Department’s energy efficiency and renewable energy office in Trump’s first term. “To all appearances, it is not a battlefield that they care about.”

Trump’s Energy Department confirmed as much in a statement to POLITICO that focused largely on oil — an energy source that the U.S. produces more of than any other country.

“Thanks to President Trump, America is leading the way in lowering costs by removing red tape and unleashing affordable, abundant, and reliable American energy,” the department said Friday, adding: “As the world’s largest oil producer, the United States welcomes a secure and stable global supply of oil that promotes economic prosperity at home and promotes peace and stability around the world.”

The White House referred questions about its clean-energy worldview to the Energy Department.

Trump officials have argued that putting money into green technology boosts China, which dominates major slices of the global battery, electric vehicle, solar and wind energy supply chains.

Trump’s zero-sum assessment of the clean energy market has forged an energy strategy even more reliant on fossil fuels than he pursued in his first term. Following this approach would jeopardize a U.S. clean energy manufacturing industry that is just beginning to sprout — and, green tech advocates say, all but ensure that China will command the global sector.

That vision is coming to a head in Congress, where Republicans are working to slash the clean energy incentives created by President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. While not proposing to erase the tax breaks altogether, GOP lawmakers in the House have floated tight restrictions outlawing Chinese sourcing in energy projects’ supply chains. Those limits would render most of the tax credits unusable for projects that have not yet been built, effectively squelching the nascent U.S. clean manufacturing sector.

The changes remain in limbo as part of the broader budget reconciliation bill, the legislative vehicle for greenlighting Republicans’ and Trump’s policy agenda that can pass with a simple majority vote in Congress. House Republicans are trying to forge a compromise among fiscal conservatives and blocs of GOP lawmakers that want to preserve clean energy credits and raise tax deductions caps for state and local taxes.

Trump’s presence looms over the negotiations. He has repeatedly vowed to end Biden’s programs — the nation’s largest-ever investment in clean energy and fighting climate change — while labeling them the “green new scam.” Cutting many of those policies, such as consumer credits to purchase electric vehicles, would fund a small portion of his administration’s other priorities, including trillions of dollars in tax breaks.

“They don’t see climate change as a problem,” George David Banks, who ran Trump’s first-term climate portfolio, said of the current team’s outlook. He added, “They don’t want to essentially create a jobs program for China.”

Defenders of the IRA tax credits say killing them would wipe out an American jobs program, one whose benefits would flow to heavily Republican communities as well as Democratic strongholds. Private-sector manufacturing projects seizing on Biden’s incentives had been projected to create roughly 160,000 jobs, according to analyses published last year.

Overturning the subsidies would eliminate a potential U.S. export market for solar modules and batteries that could be worth as much as $50 billion by 2030, according to another analysis by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Other countries would fill an $80 billion investment gap left by shuttered U.S. solar facilities, electric vehicle shops and battery gigafactories.

Many countries stand to benefit from the U.S. vacating the space, the Johns Hopkins researchers wrote. But governments outside the U.S. would face risks as well: Those that fail to encourage clean tech investments at home could fall even further behind China, which would likely benefit in every industrial category.

The researchers also raised the prospect of a transition of intellectual property to China: As U.S. business shuttered, they said, foreign companies could purchase their technical knowledge at fire-sale prices.

Trump’s barrage of tariffs against nations worldwide would limit some of the advantage countries could gain by selling clean technology to the U.S., said Tim Sahay, one of the authors of the study. Still, he said, the upshot from Trump’s policies was clear — including for European allies that had erupted in fury over Biden’s use of protectionist tax breaks to move clean energy manufacturing to the United States.

“China would be the biggest winner but not the only winner. … The rest of the world wins,” Sahay said. It’s “basically the IRA in reverse. When the IRA passed, foreigners were like, ‘Oh my God, Americans are stealing our jobs and investments because of their superior fiscal space.’ Well, now the IRA is gone, then foreigners are like, ‘Well, more for us.’”

Some conservative clean energy supporters still hope they can persuade Trump to back tax credits that have sprung solar manufacturing and battery-making plants across Republican strongholds in the Sun Belt and Rust Belt.

Those advocates criticized the IRA for being too lenient on allowing Chinese content into the supply chains of products receiving the tax incentives. But they believe Trump would bless tweaks that tighten foreign content requirements to retain incentives that support blue-collar jobs in the U.S.

“There’s an enormous and rapidly growing market for low-carbon technologies around the world, and right now the U.S. is a secondary player,” said Greg Bertelsen, CEO of the Cleaner Economy Coalition, a business advocacy organization that promotes low-carbon manufacturing at the state and federal level. “There’s a recognition within the Trump administration that we need to be competing in these markets for these technologies.”

Trump officials have been making a very different case.

Last month, Energy Secretary Chris Wright flew to Eastern Europe to propose that ministers from Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and other regional governments join “Team Energy Freedom,” urging them to embrace oil, gas and nuclear energy and reject what he framed as climate dogma.

“Climate alarmism has reduced freedom, prosperity and national security,” he said, adding — in language that carried a particular charge addressed to former communist bloc countries — that it may be a Trojan horse to “grow centralization and re-establish top-down control.”

Wright’s subordinate Tommy Joyce was even more blunt when he told a gathering of 60 governments last month in London that the pursuit of climate policy was a gift to Beijing.

“There are no wind turbines without concessions to or coercion from China,” he said.

People outside MAGA world also acknowledge the dominance China has built over decades of developing its clean energy supply chains.

In solar, batteries, electric vehicles and to some extent wind power, “China started early. China is the biggest,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

These are the core clean technologies the world is going to need en masse in the coming decades as it shifts towards a cleaner energy system. And in all of these fields, Li said, “the Chinese lead is significant and irreversible.”

In the past months, for example, two rival Chinese companies — BYD and CATL — made potentially game-changing claims when they announced they had developed electric vehicle batteries that could get 400 or even 500 kilometers (roughly 250 to 310 miles) from just a five-minute charge. Tesla boasts that its “superchargers” can give drivers around 320 kilometers in about 15 minutes.

Republican proposals would also hamstring some clean energy technologies that the Trump administration has touted, such as next-generation nuclear, fusion and geothermal, according to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group. The proposed tweaks to subsidies would essentially eliminate the long-term price signals that early-stage technologies covet, eroding their business case. Beyond that, the administration’s massive spending and job cuts across federal agencies and science research threaten to constrain U.S. innovation.

Rather than focusing on clean energy technologies such as batteries and EVs, the Trump administration has so far made critical minerals the forefront of its strategy to combat China, said a State Department official who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Those efforts focus on extracting and processing raw materials rather than supporting the value-added industries like battery-making or electric vehicles.

The official said the administration’s opposition to subsidies for green technology doesn’t mean it opposes the technologies writ large — apart from wind energy, which Trump has made clear for years that he despises.

Apart from the current U.S. government, no other major power has determined that China’s dominance means that action to fight climate change needs to take a backseat. The Biden administration’s argument, one still being pursued in Europe, was that a targeted industrial strategy could claw back some share of those industries.

Those strategies have often come cloaked in pledges to make this country or that country a “clean energy superpower.” But Li said there was a danger of “making too big of a promise. A promise that cannot be entirely fulfilled.”

Li said he had long feared that someday a U.S. president would ask: If China’s lead is so big, “then why do we play the game?”

That is the conclusion being drawn in the White House during Trump’s second term. And it helps explain why the administration has gone beyond shutting down government funding for future projects and kneecapping agencies that deal with clean energy while reversing regulations.

Not even energy projects that have drawn big-time investment and are already under construction are safe. Last month, the federal government ordered work to stop on a massive offshore wind project that would have powered half a million homes in New York.

“What has surprised me is the extent to which the administration hasn’t just pursued an agenda but has thrown sand in the gears of the parts of agenda that they don’t agree with,” said Thom Woodroofe, a former Australian diplomat in Washington who now works at the Smart Energy Council. “Even when it costs American jobs.”",https://static.politico.com/e9/09/7dfe533a42899ca659859f8e3116/china-us-sanctions-66195.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:02:57.675014

Despite surging clean-energy installations in recent years, the drop shows that the industry still relies heavily on favorable policy support from Washington.

South Carolina Representative Ralph Norman, one of four ultraconservatives negotiating the package, said House leadership had agreed to a proposal to end Inflation Reduction Act tax credits earlier than Republicans’ original proposal. As initially unveiled, many energy credits, including a tax incentive for clean energy production, would begin to phase out in 2029, ending in 2032. Norman didn’t provide a new time frame.

Article content

House Republican leadership staff told reporters Monday that a phase-out date hadn’t been decided, and it remained to be seen if it would cover shovel-ready projects.

Article content

The incentives, which include credits for electric vehicles, wind and solar power, nuclear power and other sources of clean energy, have been ripe targets for lawmakers looking for hundreds of billions of dollars to help pay for extending Trump’s tax cuts.

Article content

But there is no guarantee the deep cuts being proposed will become law. Moderate Republicans in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose a handful of votes, have called for him to make the cuts less onerous. Some Republican senators have said they don’t support the changes as is in the current House tax proposal.

Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and budget hawk who has previously said his support is contingent on the “full eradication of Green New Deal IRA subsidies,” said in a post on X Sunday that he still wasn’t satisfied.

“Importantly the bill now will move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies,” Roy said. “But, the bill does not yet meet the moment – leaving almost half of the green new scam subsidies continuing.”

Importantly, this kind of state-driven coordination reflects a broader truth: preparing the EV workforce of the future requires more than funding alone.
What’s Next: Telling a Stronger Story Participants agreed that storytelling matters, and expressed frustration with an emphasis on negative narratives in the EV sector.
“Persistent misconceptions and mischaracterizations cloud the EV sector.” “Firefighters respond to 400 vehicle fires a day.
With all these trends moving in the right direction, the EV sector presents a real opportunity to build family-sustaining careers in communities across the country.","States remain on the front lines of developing the skilled workforce needed to support the electric vehicle (EV) sector’s continued evolution and expansion — with career opportunities spanning vehicle and battery manufacturing and maintenance to the installation and upkeep of EV charging infrastructure. That theme was central at the recent convening of the State and Local EV Workforce Collaborative, co-led by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the National League of Cities (NLC), with support from the Siemens Foundation.

State and local leaders, industry partners, and workforce experts gathered in Detroit in mid-April to celebrate the Collaborative’s progress and chart the path ahead. As federal priorities continue to evolve, the convening underscored a central point: the urgency of building accessible, durable education and career pathways in the EV sector remains — and states have a critical responsibility to advance the work.

“Labor market data will tell you there are around 300,000 EV-related roles in the future, but we also need to look deeper into what types of roles the area you live in will actually need.”

“We need the right training, in the right regions. What works in one state or region won’t always work in another.”

This was a common thread throughout the convening: one-size-fits-all strategies won’t cut it. EV workforce needs vary across geographies, and state governments are uniquely positioned to align training investments, employer partnerships, and education systems to meet local demand.

Continued Alignment Around Shared Goals

Despite ongoing headwinds in the sector, including funding shifts and the uncertainty of EV-related policy, participants reaffirmed their support for the Collaborative’s original objectives. Those goals include aligning education and workforce systems, supporting data-informed decision-making, investing in pathways accessible to individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, and scaling partnerships with industry.

Attendees emphasized that these goals are essential to navigating the current landscape. Aligning systems and investments across state agencies, education providers, and employers remains one of the most powerful levers states have to ensure long-term workforce readiness. Whether preparing workers for electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) installation or advanced manufacturing, the Collaborative agreed that consistent cross-sector collaboration and workforce alignment are critical to keep pace with both industry demand and community needs.

Organizations like ChargerHelp and Women Who Charge exemplify what’s possible when workforce development aligns with real-time industry needs. Both organizations are forging cross-sector partnerships to recruit and train underrepresented talent for high-growth roles in EV maintenance and charging infrastructure. Their work underscores the importance of designing programs that engage employers directly, target recruitment, and provide wraparound support that make it possible for more people to participate and grow their career in this sector.

State Leadership in Action: A North Carolina Example

One example of state-level leadership is the North Carolina Business Committee for Education (NCBCE). As an inaugural partner of the Siemens Foundation’s EVeryone Charging Forward initiative, NCBCE works to ensure the state’s workforce is prepared to meet the rising demand for EV infrastructure installation, maintenance, and support services. Their team developed a strategy to map EVSE training needs across regions, identify critical skill gaps, and partner with community colleges and industry stakeholders to co-create scalable workforce programs that prepare people for these jobs.

This model underscores the power of state agencies working hand-in-hand with local providers. By convening public and private partners, including K–12 systems, community colleges, utility companies, and employers, NCBCE delivers on-the-ground solutions, and also builds a replicable blueprint that other states can adapt to their regional labor market needs. With a focus on developing training that aligns with industry needs, ensuring credentials are valued by employers, and helping a wide range of individuals access these opportunities, the initiative is grounded in both equity and economic opportunity.

Importantly, this kind of state-driven coordination reflects a broader truth: preparing the EV workforce of the future requires more than funding alone. It demands long-range planning, cross-sector partnerships, and responsive programming that can grow and evolve alongside industry demand. As other states look to build or expand their own EV workforce strategies, North Carolina’s approach offers a powerful example of what’s possible when state leadership brings systems together with clear purpose and shared urgency.

What’s Next: Telling a Stronger Story

Participants agreed that storytelling matters, and expressed frustration with an emphasis on negative narratives in the EV sector.

“Persistent misconceptions and mischaracterizations cloud the EV sector.”

“Firefighters respond to 400 vehicle fires a day. You don’t hear about it unless it’s an EV.”

To combat these narratives, consistent and fact-based messaging that is grounded in opportunity, safety, and economic mobility is essential to gaining broader buy-in and building the inclusive EV workforce of the future.

In 2024, the EV market reached 1.56 million in sales. The reality is that EV-related jobs are growing, EV adoption continues to trend upwards, and charging infrastructure is expanding. With all these trends moving in the right direction, the EV sector presents a real opportunity to build family-sustaining careers in communities across the country.

Now more than ever, clear messaging is needed to cut through confusion and partisanship. Framing this work around shared values like innovation, infrastructure, opportunity, and local impact will help bring new voices to the table and expand support for workforce development efforts.

Charging Forward, Together

Mayor Stephanie Piko, Mayor of Centennial, Colorado, and co-chair of the Collaborative, emphasized the power of local resilience, collaboration, and “borrowing from others’ playbooks” rather than building in isolation. “Let’s learn from each other, adapt what works, and move faster together,” she said.

Ultimately, the message was clear: state leadership matters, and the Collaborative is a powerful vehicle to support this work. “We don’t have to reinvent the wheel,” Johnson noted. “But we do need to roll it faster, together.”",https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P4183317-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:03:05.270534

This week, I came across a Facebook post from a Rivian owner named Mara, who shared her frustrating experience applying for the 2024 Colorado EV tax credit after purchasing a 2025 Rivian R1S.
If it’s wrong, it may need to be corrected by the DMV before you file your EV credit paperwork.
What You Can Do If This Happens to You Here’s what I’d recommend if you’re applying for the Colorado EV tax credit: Double-check your registration.
Let’s Hear From You Have you tried applying for the Colorado EV tax credit for your Rivian?","You’d think that buying a fully electric SUV in a state like Colorado would come with a smooth path to incentives. After all, we’re constantly told that going electric is the future, and the tax breaks are part of the reward. But for some Rivian owners, that promise is turning into a paperwork nightmare that feels like it shouldn’t be this difficult.

This week, I came across a Facebook post from a Rivian owner named Mara, who shared her frustrating experience applying for the 2024 Colorado EV tax credit after purchasing a 2025 Rivian R1S. Despite submitting all the documents and proving that the R1S meets the weight requirement, she was still denied, with no real explanation from the state.

Here’s Mara’s post in her own words: “Hi, has anyone received a 2024 tax year credit for a 2025 R1S in Colorado? We were disallowed the credit because it didn't meet the GVWR for the light-duty passenger vehicle (it does, 8,532 lbs). When we provided the supporting documentation for GVWR, we were denied again without further explanation. We are appealing that decision, but wanted to see if there is some experience out there that perhaps we should be checking the box for 'light-duty electric truck' on our form instead of 'light-duty passenger motor vehicle.' We have looked through forums and see others have wrestled with the definitions and obtaining the credit, but didn't find any conclusive results. Curious if anyone has had success in claiming the credit and can explain their experience. Thank you!”

When the Right Specs Still Lead to a Denial

Let’s be clear: the Rivian R1S has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 8,532 pounds, plenty to qualify under Colorado’s light-duty vehicle incentive guidelines. So what went wrong?

The most likely culprit is the classification box that applicants have to check when applying. Mara suspects that selecting “light-duty passenger motor vehicle” instead of “light-duty electric truck” might have caused the rejection. And the scary part is, she’s not alone in thinking this small detail could derail the entire process.

In the comments under Mara’s post, another owner named Eddie shared this: “I also applied for the credit and I’m waiting on a decision. The registration has the wrong GVWR, so I’m assuming the Colorado DMV would need to correct it as well.”

That’s another twist, if your vehicle registration lists an incorrect GVWR, even when the manufacturer rating says otherwise, it could get flagged by the system. It’s entirely possible that the database the state uses doesn’t match up with Rivian’s specs, and that mismatch becomes your problem to fix.

The Fine Print That Trips You Up

There’s no public step-by-step for this kind of issue, which makes it all the more confusing. Mara submitted documentation showing the correct GVWR, but her appeal was denied again. No reasoning. No helpful feedback. Just a vague rejection that leaves her wondering if she misunderstood the form, or if the system just isn’t built for vehicles like hers.

And when you step back, it’s not hard to see how a new kind of SUV like the Rivian R1S doesn’t fit neatly into the old categories. It has the ride comfort of a luxury vehicle but the size and hauling power of a truck. As seen in this long-distance towing story where an R1S pulled a trailer 1,200 miles, it’s fully capable of truck-like work. So calling it a passenger vehicle or a light-duty truck both seem equally valid, and that gray area is exactly where issues like this start.

Paperwork Shouldn’t Be This Hard

If you’re in Colorado and recently bought an R1S, now’s a good time to check what GVWR is listed on your registration. If it’s wrong, it may need to be corrected by the DMV before you file your EV credit paperwork. Because as Eddie’s comment shows, the software Colorado uses to review applications may auto-reject anything that doesn’t align exactly with its own internal records.

Even though this feels like a minor technicality, the implications are huge. A state EV credit can be worth thousands of dollars, and for many owners, that money is factored into their budget and even their decision to buy electric in the first place. Being denied that credit can feel like a punch in the gut, especially when you’ve done nothing wrong.

And it’s not the only time R1S owners in Colorado have faced confusing or frustrating issues with their new vehicles. One owner shared how their 2025 R1S completely shut down while trying to precondition the battery, leaving them stranded in the dark with no warning.

Does the System Understand These Vehicles Yet?

There’s a broader conversation happening here, one that goes beyond just tax credits. EVs like the R1S are cutting-edge machines, and in many ways, the state systems we rely on haven’t caught up. Everything from DMV classifications to emissions exemptions to title paperwork can feel like it was written for a totally different generation of vehicles.

Just ask the owner whose R1S broke down suddenly after 2,000 flawless miles. Their story is another reminder that no matter how advanced these EVs are, the policies and processes built around them are often still stuck in the past.

A System That Needs an Update

When government paperwork becomes a barrier to clean vehicle adoption, something’s gone wrong. And unfortunately, that’s what seems to be happening here. Owners are left to sort out unclear classifications and file appeals without real guidance, all because a checkbox might be mislabeled or a database hasn’t been updated.

And it’s not just tax credits, another R1S owner recently reported a strange popping noise from their SUV after taking sharp turns, a mystery that even service centers were struggling to diagnose. While not directly related to tax forms, it’s all part of a bigger issue: Rivian owners are often blazing the trail in more ways than one.

What You Can Do If This Happens to You

Here’s what I’d recommend if you’re applying for the Colorado EV tax credit:

Double-check your registration. Make sure the GVWR listed is accurate. If it’s wrong, contact the DMV to get it fixed before you file anything.

Ask for clarification before submitting. If you’re unsure about which classification to check on the form, reach out to the Colorado Department of Revenue and ask which box applies to the R1S.

Talk to other owners. Forums and Facebook groups can be surprisingly helpful. As seen in this story about an RV trip that revealed a great fast charging station, Rivian owners often rely on one another to fill in the gaps.

Don’t be afraid to appeal. Just like Mara, you have the right to challenge a rejection, but keep copies of every document you submit and follow up consistently.

What This Says About EV Adoption in 2025

As someone who covers EVs every day, I’ve learned that the biggest barriers to adoption often aren’t about the cars themselves, they’re about the systems around them. The R1S is an impressive, capable, and forward-thinking vehicle. Even after being rear-ended, one owner found the repair process more complex than expected, revealing just how many cracks there still are in the infrastructure surrounding electric vehicles.

That’s why stories like Mara’s matter. Because they show that owning a Rivian, or any EV, isn’t just about embracing new technology. It’s about navigating outdated systems that weren’t designed with these cars in mind. And until those systems are updated, owners will keep running into obstacles that shouldn't exist.

Key Takeaways

Vehicle classification matters: If you're applying for the Colorado EV credit, double-check whether “light-duty passenger vehicle” or “electric truck” is the right choice for your R1S.

Check your registration for GVWR accuracy: A mismatch between what Rivian publishes and what the DMV lists can quietly cause your application to fail.

The appeal process lacks transparency: Even with the right documents, applicants like Mara are being denied without a clear reason, so persistence is key.

This isn’t an isolated issue: From charging mishaps to mechanical quirks, Rivian owners across the country are realizing that support systems still need serious modernization.

All of this raises the question: can the EV industry stand on its own without massive subsidies from taxpayers?
Meanwhile, even after the subsidies, Ford lost US$64,700 per EV in 2023 and US$32,700 in 2024.
(It’s also worth noting that Ford, with the second-highest EV production in the U.S., produced a mere 72,000 vehicles in 2023.)
Between 2014 and 2023, automotive production fell from 2.4 million to 1.5 million vehicles while automobile imports increased from $57 billion to $82 billion.","While Trump’s trade war continues to grab all the headlines, Canada’s electric vehicle (EV) industry may be steaming toward an iceberg, due mainly to shifts in policy south of the border.

Specifically, the Trump administration has withdrew from the Paris Agreement (and its net-zero 2050 framework) and eliminated the U.S. EV mandate, which required upwards of 56 per cent of new vehicles sold in the United States. to be EV and 13 per cent be plug-in hybrids by 2032. These moves represent an existential threat to Canada’s EV investments and the viability of the large EV battery plants under various stages of planning and construction in Ontario and Quebec.

Indeed, the Trudeau government, along with the Ontario and Quebec governments, negotiated several significant battery manufacturing deals, which included subsidies and construction funding totalling $4.6 billion for the Northvolt AB plant near Montreal, $13.2 billion for the Volkswagen plant in Saint Thomas, Ontario, $15 billion for the Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario and $1.6 billion for the Japanese battery company Asahi Kasei plant in Port Colborne, Ontario. (Although both Northvolt AB and Stellantis are reconsidering their EV battery investments in Canada—Northvolt AB is approaching bankruptcy and Stellantis thinks that current federal subsidies are insufficient to justify its investment.)

According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, taxpayer subsidies (a.k.a. corporate welfare) for these deals will cost Canadians up to $44 billion between 2022/23 and 2032/33. In the U.S., EV sales in 2024 were 1.2 million (7 per cent of auto total sales) buoyed by an EV tax credit of US$7,500 per new vehicle, which translates into US$9 billion in EV consumer subsidies that year alone.

All of this raises the question: can the EV industry stand on its own without massive subsidies from taxpayers?

In 2023, of the two largest EV producers (Tesla and Ford), only Tesla would break even without the EV tax credit subsidies. According to Reuters, Tesla earned approximately US$8,300 in profit per EV in 2023, and of the 1.8 million Tesla vehicles produced globally, only 400,000 were produced in the U.S. Meanwhile, even after the subsidies, Ford lost US$64,700 per EV in 2023 and US$32,700 in 2024. (It’s also worth noting that Ford, with the second-highest EV production in the U.S., produced a mere 72,000 vehicles in 2023.)

While Ford still plans to make EVs, it recently announced plans to shift production at its Oakville, Ontario factory from electric sports vehicles to gas-powered pickup trucks. The news came shortly after General Motors announced it would trim its forecast of EVs produced in 2024 by 50,000.

Clearly, U.S. legacy automakers are worried about overproducing against sluggish consumer demand, knowing that their profitability and fiscal viability resides in their internal combustion engine vehicle production lines. Numerous large European automotive manufacturers also saw a decline in EV sales in 2024 and are re-investing in their combustion engine production lines to protect profits.

Finally, beyond only EVs, Canada’s automotive manufacturing sector is in decline. Between 2014 and 2023, automotive production fell from 2.4 million to 1.5 million vehicles while automobile imports increased from $57 billion to $82 billion. Of the 1.5 million vehicles produced in Canada in 2023, 88 per cent were exported to the U.S., leaving the industry highly vulnerable to shifts in American policy (which currently include President Trump’s threat of a 100 per cent tariff on automobile exports).

The iceberg is in view. The new Carney government and our provincial governments must take stock of the decline in the automotive manufacturing sector, its near total dependence on U.S. exports, and uncertain government-driven EV investments. And they should ask if the push to electrify the automotive manufacturing base is in the long-term best interests of Canadians.",https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/ev-production-line-1440.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:03:22.790672

The statement comes in response to a 2024 draft study published at the very end of the Biden administration detailing the environmental, economic and other impacts of gas exports.

The Biden administration’s study comes after it paused approvals on new gas export projects, saying it needed to reevaluate the broad implications of shipping more U.S. gas abroad. The administration included a 60-day comment period along with the draft study.

On Monday, the Trump administration published a response to those comments — giving some clues as to how it would assess gas export projects going forward.

The Trump commentary did not deny the environmental impacts found by its predecessor, including impacts to air pollution stemming from nearby communities.

But unlike the Biden administration, it said that these impacts are outside of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) jurisdiction, and therefore should not be considered in its approvals of gas export projects.

“Natural gas production, processing, and transportation have environmental effects. Federal, state, and local regulatory requirements that are outside DOE’s authority over LNG [liquefied natural gas] exports include measures to reduce or mitigate any potential related impacts,” the Trump commentary states.

It also said that “the denial of LNG export authorizations would be too blunt an instrument to address the concerns raised.”

This stands in contrast with the Biden administration, which said that “Understanding the many environmental and societal effects of natural gas production and export …is part of DOE’s consideration of the public interest in reviewing applications to export natural gas.”

In addition, the Trump-era commentary also downplays the Biden administration’s findings about the increases in price that would come with exporting natural gas.

The Biden administration found that “higher U.S. LNG export levels in 2050 are associated with higher U.S. residential natural gas prices.”

However, the Trump administration described any price increases as “relatively modest.”

Overall, Trump administration official Tala Goudarzi said in a written statement that the response to the study “will allow DOE to close out this chapter and fully return to regular order on LNG exports.”

“The 2024 Study confirms what our nation always knew — LNG supports our economy, strengthens our allies, and enhances national security. Biden’s opposition defied reason and reality and hurt American progress,” said Goudarzi, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, in a written statement.

Environmental activists, meanwhile, described the Trump administration’s commentary as ignoring the costs of gas exports.

“No matter how hard they try to hide it, Trump’s DOE can not bury the truth that increased LNG exports are simply not in the public interest. The facts are clear, LNG exports raise costs to Americans’ energy bills, are disastrous for frontline communities, increase public health harms, and perpetuate the climate crisis.

But America's energy future is being built on innovation, investment and independence — things renewable energy sources are delivering every day.","Opponents of renewable energy rely on fear and misinformation to attack wind and solar projects that are delivering real economic benefits to communities across Michigan. Though entertaining, the hit show Landman fits in this column, and misrepresents the renewable energy industry to paint it in a negative light. This hostile rhetoric is hurting American farmers who are benefiting greatly from these projects. Negative rhetoric may be loud, but the facts tell an entirely different story.

The truth is that renewable energy is a powerhouse for job creation, economic growth and helping our country achieve energy independence. Why shouldn’t we create energy in Michigan to be consumed by Michiganians? That’s what renewable energy is all about: homegrown American energy, powering not just our homes, but our economy.

In states across the country, renewable energy projects in the wind and solar sectors are generating millions in local tax revenue, helping to prevent future tax hikes, supporting American farmers with reliable land-lease payments and reducing energy costs for consumers. The show Landman misses the mark by pitting renewables against oil and gas in a world where the two can coexist as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy – very much like what President Donald Trump seeks. Our country stands to benefit from the good-paying jobs this America First energy strategy would bring. Michigan, for example, is home to more than 11,000 clean energy jobs, and the industry brings billions of dollars in new investments thanks to projects coming into the state.

Large-scale solar projects provide stable, long-term revenue for rural communities and landowners, helping farmers diversify income and keeping family farms operational into the foreseeable future — especially amid high inflation and intense competition on the global stage. These same solar projects are low maintenance, provide a stable source of energy to a rapidly aging grid known for its flaws, and, most importantly, can be made right here in Michigan.

Critics claim renewables are unreliable, but modern grid technology and battery storage advancements prove otherwise. Texas, for example — a state known for oil and gas and where the Landman show is set — ranks number one in generating power from solar and is among the top in generating power from wind. Together, renewables have the capacity to power 13.8 million homes. Thanks to renewable energy projects, local Texas communities have seen nearly $585 million in property, state and local tax revenues. Imagine these same benefits in other states. This is what putting America first means, not whatever Hollywood or the Paramount Network is telling you. Imagine what this could mean for Michigan. We could finally have our roads fixed!

The show’s opposition isn't about facts; it's about clinging to the past. But America's energy future is being built on innovation, investment and independence — things renewable energy sources are delivering every day. It's time to move past fearmongering and embrace the opportunities that clean energy provides. Our economy and our local communities depend on it — it's time we put America and Michigan first when it comes to energy.

(!)

We’ve also got a quick review of a massive solar farm powering 200,000 homes in Indiana and the biggest solar project East of the Mississippi – both part of a record 98% of all new power generation and grid capacity introduced in 2025 coming from wind and solar. Those are jobs, those are lower utility rates, those are energy independence … so why are Congressional Republicans working to make that more expensive?

WATCH: What’s in the first draft of the GOP’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ cutting taxes and spending

Speaker Mike Johnson met with Republican lawmakers shortly before the meeting and acknowledged to reporters that there are still details to “iron out.” He said some changes were being made, but declined to provide details.

It’s all setting up a difficult week ahead for the GOP leadership racing toward a Memorial Day deadline, a week away, to pass the package from the House. The Budget Committee, which just days ago failed to advance the package when four conservative Republicans objected, was able to do so Sunday on a vote of 17-16, with the four hold-outs voting “present” to allow it to move ahead, as talks continue.

“The bill does not yet meet the moment,” said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, in a social media post immediately after the late-night session. “We can and must do better before we pass the final product.”

The path ahead for Johnson is unclear as he tries to hold his narrow House majority together to pass the president’s top domestic priority of extending the tax breaks while pumping in money for border security and deportations — all while cutting spending.

Republicans criticizing the measure argued that the bill’s new spending and the tax cuts are front-loaded in the bill, while the measures to offset the cost are back-loaded. In particular, they are looking to speed up the new work requirements that Republicans want to enact for able-bodied participants in Medicaid.

Johnson indicated he wants to impose the the work requirements “as soon as possible” but acknowledged it may take states longer to change their systems. Those requirements would not kick in until 2029 under the current bill.

“There will be more details to iron out and several more to take care of,” Johnson, R-La., said outside the hearing room.

“But I’m looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions over the next few days, and I’m absolutely convinced we’re going to get this in final form and pass it.”

More talks are ahead, but Johnson is looking to put the bill on the House floor before the end of the week.

Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks.

“This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,” Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that’s what is happening here.”

The first time that Republicans tried advancing the bill out of the House Budget Committee last week, the deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers in voting against reporting the measure to the full House.

Those same four Republicans — Roy and Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia — cast their “present” votes Sunday.

Norman pointed to a recent downgrade of the nation’s credit rating in making his arguments for steeper reductions.

“We’ve got a lot more work to do,” Norman said. “We’re excited about what we did. We want to move the bill forward.”

At its core, the sprawling legislative package permanently extends the existing income tax cuts that were approved during Trump’s first term in 2017 and adds temporary new ones that the president campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay and auto loan interest payments. The measure also proposes big spending increases for border security and defense.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, estimates that the House bill is shaping up to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.

Johnson is not just having to address the concerns of the deficit hawks in his party. He’s also facing pressure from centrists who will be warily eyeing the proposed changes to Medicaid, food assistance programs and the rolling back of clean energy tax credits. Republican lawmakers from New York and elsewhere are also demanding a much larger state and local tax deduction.

As it stands, the bill proposes tripling what’s currently a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to $30,000 for joint filers with incomes up to $400,000 a year.

Rep. Nick LaLota, one of the New York lawmakers leading the effort to lift the cap, said they have proposed a deduction of $62,000 for single filers and $124,000 for joint filers.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the bill remained under negotiation.

“Deliberations continue at this very moment,” Arrington said. “They will continue on into the week, and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House.”

If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are also eyeing changes that could make final passage in the House more difficult.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/2025-05-19T041515Z_1358030204_RC2QKEAWCCJY_RTRMADP_3_USA-CONGRESS-TAX-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 21:04:18.019159

The House Budget Committee advanced the package late Sunday after GOP leaders granted a group of conservative holdouts a number of concessions, but they did not say what those deals entail.

But Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said on social media, “Importantly the bill now will move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies under the green new scam.”

Four hard-line Republicans who opposed the bill Friday voted “present” Sunday to advance the package to the Rules Committee before hitting the floor.

And Rules says it will take up the measure at 1 a.m. Wednesday. That’s the earliest the panel can set floor debate parameters under certain procedural requirements.

Still, the far-right House Freedom Caucus posted on X that the legislation — as is — “does not yet meet the moment.” Roy said that’s partly because it leaves “almost half of the green new scam subsidies continuing.”

Leaders also have to contend with a group of blue-state Republicans who are similarly holding the line on state and local tax deductions. Another faction wants to see softer language on the restrictions and phase down of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits. And across the Capitol, Senate Republicans are watching closely, vowing to pursue additional changes to the bill’s tax and energy proposals.

“I couldn’t tell you what is in flux, what is fixed, what might change or not change,” said Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas). “As you all well know, this process is fluid.”

He said conversations with members and leadership would happen through the week but rejected the claim by Democrats there were “side deals” happening in backrooms.

“I don’t know anything about side deals or any deals, I just know we are at a place where we can take a vote today,” Arrington said, noting formal changes would be in a manager’s amendment at Rules.

Before the committee vote Sunday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) expressed tepid confidence, adding, “We never stop working on these things.” He told reporters “minor modifications” were made over the weekend. “Not a huge thing,” he said. “Wait and see.”

On Friday after the first failed vote, Budget Vice Chair Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), who supports the package, argued the hard-liners who voted “no” actually support “most of what came out of the committee here. There’s just a few remaining issues. But yes, we want to get there as quickly as we possibly can.”

The budget reconciliation package, which Republicans are looking to approve by simple majority, also contains public land sales, changes to federal rulemaking and deep cuts to climate-related grants.

Clash over IRA credits

For months, warring factions in the GOP have fought over how to handle the Democrats’ 2022 climate law, with moderates pitted against hard-liners. While dozens of House Republicans have signaled an interest in protecting parts of the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, few have made clear they would tank the whole package over parochial energy interests.

Still, House Republican leaders have already told hard-liners a full repeal of the IRA’s clean energy subsidies would cost the bill crucial support, POLITICO reported.

Last week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), who represents a toss-up district that also is host to a massive offshore wind project, approached Johnson on the House floor to request a meeting seeking changes that would ease the blow to renewable industry tax credits. There’s no indication the meeting has happened; Johnson’s office did not return requests for comment.

In particular, Kiggans and 13 others, have suggested a provision intended to disqualify Chinese companies from accessing the credits as too cumbersome. That’s a concern shared by many in the renewables industry.

“In general, we see where the Committee was trying to go,” said Yogin Kothari, chief strategy officer for the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition.

“That said, the language is complex and will take some time to unpack and there could be some implementation challenges that would result in unintended consequences in our efforts to reshore critical supply chains,” Kothari said.

As evidence of the division among Republicans on the IRA, the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs will hold a hearing Tuesday on the law’s negative effects to the energy industry.

One Democrat said the party failed to get through to voters — particularly Republicans in rural areas — about the benefits of the IRA programs across red states.

“There’s an intellectual inconsistency here: The people who are benefiting most from those provisions are the voters and the Republican colleagues who will continue to go after all the work that happened on climate,” said Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.).

“So what’s so hard in this moment is how do we as Democrats punch through to do a better job of shining a light on all that … because there seems to be a disconnection in the public,” Balint said.

Senators eye more changes

As House members spar over portions of the reconciliation bill, a number of senators have been mulling tweaks of their own.

Some want more aggressive spending reductions; others prefer a softer touch and could add new wrinkles to the process in the coming weeks.

Some senators could try to put new pressure on leadership to delay some of the tax credit phaseouts and other changes the House is pursuing.

Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of four Republican senators who last month signed onto a letter calling for a “targeted, pragmatic approach” to the tax credits, suggested she has qualms with the current package.

Asked last week whether she would vote for the “big, beautiful bill” as is, she quipped, “As far as I know, it’s not beautiful yet!”

From the other side of the spectrum, Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah), who like House conservatives is seeking more savings, was more blunt. “There is still time to fix it,” he said in a social media post last week.

“We MUST deliver on President Trump’s promises to the American people, enact real, immediate, and lasting spending cuts, and eliminate the Green New Scam,” he said on X.

Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former luxury car dealer, said he prefers an outright repeal of the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles extending to all manufacturers, not just ones that have sold more than 200,000 cars, as the House bill proposes.

“Certainly, my inclination is when that bill gets to the Senate, that the EV subsidies need to go away immediately — not phased out and not [with] any kind of artificial limitation in terms of volume,” he said.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a Budget Committee member and the chair of the Senate Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, said he was pleased with some of the House’s proposals on energy and climate programs, including rescinding unobligated IRA funding for the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.

“We need to take all that money back and start over,” Kennedy said. However, he added he still wants to “change a lot of it.”

Schedule: The House Oversight and Government Reform hearing is Tuesday, May 20, at 10 a.m. in HVC-210 Capitol and via webcast.

A rapid shift to clean, renewable energy will give us healthier, more vibrant communities today, and a more livable future for our kids and grandkids.","It makes no sense to dial back clean energy tax credits for solar and energy-saving tech

Wind and solar power reduce our dependence on polluting fossil fuels, with big benefits for our environment and health. That’s why it’s welcome news that Massachusetts ranked 5th in the nation for electric vehicle charging ports and 11th for solar generation at the end of 2024. Here in the Bay State, and in fact, across the country, renewable energy technologies have grown rapidly over the past decade.

Anyone who’s gone to the Mullins Center at UMass has likely parked their car under a solar canopy. It’s become commonplace to find yourself behind an electric vehicle at a Rt. 9 stoplight, and the costs of solar panels have come down to the point where local property developers are proposing to use solar panels to screen equipment on the roof of a proposed new building, instead of relying on other materials to get the job done.

Every year more Americans have gone solar or taken advantage of energy-efficient technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles that can run on renewable energy. Some do it for the environment, some do it because it makes financial sense. After all, many of these technologies pay for themselves over time through utility bill savings, but upfront costs can remain a barrier to wider adoption. That’s where tax credits come in.

Tax credits make it possible for more Americans to choose to power their lives with clean energy by lowering the costs of going solar, buying or leasing an electric vehicle, installing charging or making a home or business more energy-efficient. The incentives cover up to 30% of the cost of many clean energy upgrades. In 2023, 3.4 million Americans used these tax credits for clean energy or energy efficiency home improvements, saving more than $8 billion, and helping spur adoption.

These clean energy tax credits are popular, but despite public support behind the policy, some in Congress continue efforts to dismantle tax credits, with a ramp up in intensity when the House Ways and Means Committee began debate Tuesday on a budget proposal last week that would take away tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels or energy-efficient heat pumps at the end of 2025.

Some leaders are speaking out. In addition to widespread support among Democratic members of Congress, 21 House Republicans have written to the Speaker of the House and 4 Republican senators wrote to the Senate Majority Leader cautioning against a wholesale repeal of clean energy tax credits.

Clean energy advocates, myself included, have been working to show how America benefits when we get more of our power from renewable sources. From Cedar Rapids, Iowa to Anchorage, Alaska and Bakersfield, California to Omaha, Nebraska supporters of renewable energy are making the case. In recent months, the solar-powered headquarters of Crayola and Frank Lloyd Wright’s architectural masterpiece Falling Water have hosted solar tours to tell the story of how renewable energy is helping them. Churches and schools, as well as breweries, nature centers and hog farms are sharing their stories too.

We all benefit when we get more of our energy from renewables. The solar and wind power we’ve already installed in the U.S. have already cut health-threatening sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution from power plants by nearly 1 million metric tons between 2019 and 2022 – enough to prevent an estimated 1,400 premature deaths in 2022. These renewable energy sources have also cut global warming pollution by 900 million metric tons between 2019 and 2022 — an amount of pollution greater than the state of Texas emits in a year. Not to mention the reduced threats to our waterways such as coal ash spills and leaks of fracking wastewater.

A rapid shift to clean, renewable energy will give us healthier, more vibrant communities today, and a more livable future for our kids and grandkids. And we all have a role to play. It will take individuals, businesses, houses of worship, and others to help make the switch to renewable energy for a cleaner, healthier world; both through their own behavior and through their advocacy.

If you’ve already taken steps to power more of your life with renewable energy, I urge you to join the Voices for Clean Energy organizing project, which highlights the stories of folks from across the country who are choosing to take steps to reduce energy waste and power their lives with clean energy.

And if you don’t yet have your own clean energy story to tell, but hope to at some point, you can email your member of Congress and urge them to oppose efforts to take away tax credits for energy efficiency and renewable energy, so that it’s easier for more people to choose clean energy.

Power concludes that the continuing concern with charging, coupled with flattening overall EV interest, points to a lack of progress in consumer education on these issues.","Despite uncertainty around future EV interest and potential economic headwinds hanging over the automotive industry, consumer demand has remained stable, according to J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study.

Twenty-four percent of vehicle shoppers surveyed said they would “very likely” consider purchasing an EV, and 35% said they would “somewhat likely” consider the purchase, both of which remain unchanged from a year ago, according to the study.

“Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration,” said Brent Gruber, J.D. Power’s executive director of EV practice, in a press release. “To further capitalize on that interest and spur adoption moving forward, the industry needs to have products that meet consumer needs and wants at prices that are affordable. Additionally, the industry should better educate consumers about EV ownership to ease concerns — many of which, such as those related to public charging, are less problematic than they might seem when it comes to actually owning an EV.”

Of those who said they would “very likely” consider buying an EV, cross-shopped an average of 2.9 brands, while those who say they are “somewhat likely” shop an average of 2.8 brands. J.D. Power found the same to be true in its 2024 U.S. Sales Satisfaction Index Study, which found EV buyers shopped three dealer brands compared to 2.5 for gas-powered vehicle shoppers.

“As more EV options come to market, this should serve as an encouraging sign for automakers because it’s an opportunity for them to gain a foothold and pull shoppers from outside their brands,” Gruber said, in the release. “This year’s study results also show that EV shoppers consider products from mass market and premium brands alike, highlighting the opportunity to capture consumer interest with brands or products that shoppers may not have otherwise considered.”

Charging station availability remains shoppers’ top concern, with 52% citing it as a reason for not purchasing an EV.

J.D. Power concludes that the continuing concern with charging, coupled with flattening overall EV interest, points to a lack of progress in consumer education on these issues. However, while consumer rejection due to purchase price has dropped 4 percentage points year-over-year to 43%, concern with cost of ownership has dropped 2 percentage points to 33%.

The study also found that 17% of consumers in the 25-49 age range have an annual income of over $100,000.

“It’s an interesting dichotomy because younger consumers are the most receptive to EVs, but also the least likely to be able to afford them, while older consumers have the financial means but show less interest,” Gruber said, in the release. “Much of the recent growth in the EV space has been fueled by products from mass market brands, which demonstrates the pent-up demand for more affordable products.”

Midwest states are least enthusiastic about EVs, with the lowest shares of consumers who say they are “very likely” to consider purchasing an EV living in Wisconsin and Kentucky (18% each), Minnesota (17%), and Ohio (16%).

J.D. Power says this is influenced by several factors, including concerns about EV performance in cold climates and the stronger loyalty of consumers in these regions to traditional automakers.

This year’s study is based on responses from 8,164 consumers who said they intend to buy or lease a new vehicle in the next year, and was fielded from January through April 2025.

Recently, some state governors have paused EV sales incentives and/or requirements, including Delaware and Vermont.

On May 13, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott issued an executive order directing the Agency of Natural Resources to pause enforcement of a multi-state plan requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet certain EV sales targets for passenger cars and medium- and heavy-trucks.

“I continue to believe we should be incentivizing Vermonters to transition to cleaner energy options like electric vehicles,” he said, in a press release. “However, we have to be realistic about a pace that’s achievable. It’s clear we don’t have anywhere near enough charging infrastructure and insufficient technological advances in heavy-duty vehicles to meet current goals. We have much more work to do, in order to make it more convenient, faster, and more affordable to buy, maintain, and charge EVs. When we do, it’s more likely everyday Vermonters will make the switch.”

Scott said he remains committed to addressing climate change, including advocating for more charging infrastructure, but emphasized that when it comes to transitioning to a low-carbon future, mandates are not going to be the total answer. Instead, using common sense and incentivizing technological advancements are necessary to overall success, and the new compliance flexibility is intended to reflect that reality, he said in the release.

At the federal level, EV tax credits remain in limbo, according to a May 6 Bloomberg article in which U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said House Republicans might end the credit.

President Donald Trump has made EVs a policy focus, including proposing to cut $15 billion in clean energy projects and subsidies as part of his recently released budget outline.

However, some automakers continue to move forward with expanded EV plans.

Last week, at the Financial Times Future of the Car Summit in London, Kia announced it would carry out the world’s first trial of a Battery Passport vehicle — a digital-first solution that tracks and analyzes EV batteries at the cellular level.

“The trial vehicle is capable of monitoring live data for each battery cell and uploading it to a digital passport,” said Jens Brech, Kia’s director of ownership experience. “This close analysis will help extend battery life, reduce long-term costs, and build greater customer trust in EV batteries.”

Kia also unveiled its PV5, the automaker’s first Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV), and its collaboration with Motability Operations to develop a wheelchair-accessible variant (WAV) of the PV5. The PV5 caters to ride-hailing, last-mile delivery, trades, families, and camper vans.

North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, for instance, has an idea of removing only the subsidies for wind and solar but not for nuclear.
The nuclear industry, hopefully, has a better memory about that.","Last week, Republican legislators caused an uproar in wind and solar circles by proposing what amounts to a decimation of subsidies for these industries—and EVs as well. But the lawmakers did not stop with wind and solar. They are cutting incentives for nuclear as well. The nuclear industry is up in arms. It has AI movers and shakers on its side.

Last Monday, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce proposed phasing out tax credits linked to climate policies stipulated in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. This, per the Committee, will raise some $6.5 billion. The House Ways and Means Committee also proposed phasing out various tax incentives, aiming to fuel the expansion of wind and solar energy, electric vehicles, and other transition technologies.

Naturally, wind and solar companies were less than happy to hear this, especially since they’d been lobbying legislators hard in the months since President Trump took office. The lobbying effort has focused on legislators representing districts that have been on the receiving end of IRA subsidies and on scare tactics about job losses and a worsened outlook for “American families”.

Nuclear has also joined the push against subsidy phaseout with its own lobbying effort. According to a Financial Times report from Sunday, the industry has been lobbying Congress to stop short of removing subsidies for new nuclear facilities, and it has been lobbying it hard. One nuclear tech firm, Oklo, linked financially to OpenAI’s Sam Altman, for instance, upped its spending on lobbying by 500% on the year to 424,000. Constellation Energy, Microsoft’s partner in Three Mile Island, spent more than $1.7 million on lobbying in the first quarter, a 17% annual increase, per the FT.

That Three Mile Island reopening deal that Microsoft struck with Constellation Energy last year was one of the signs that nuclear is making a comeback—and a major one. Google’s partnership with modular reactor developer Kairos for 500 MW of capacity was another sign. Amazon was not far behind, buying a stake in another modular reactor company, X-energy. Meta is also in the nuclear game, seeking up to 4 GW in nuclear capacity for its data centers.

Data centers and artificial intelligence—this is what is driving the nuclear rush that has benefited from the IRA incentives that GOP legislators now want to remove, along with wind, solar, and EV subsidies. Artificial intelligence is pushing electricity demand higher, and the outlook for this demand is so unanimously bullish that the need for more generating capacity is taken for granted. The thing about nuclear is that it costs a pretty penny upfront, and it’s nice to have a part of that financial burden shouldered by a cooperative federal government.

“It’s hard to overstate the value of the tax credits on helping to de-risk early-stage capital and project developments . . . if the idea is to lead and dominate in this space, we need to use all the tools in the tool belt,” the chief executive of that Sam Altman-supported nuclear company, Oklo, told the FT.

The tools in this case are the investment tax credit and the production tax credit, among half a dozen others. They are essential, the industry argues, for advancing new nuclear technology, such as small modular reactors, which have enjoyed a lot of hype but have struggled to really take off. Yet the tax credits are also essential for large-scale new nuclear because of the price tag it tends to come with—and Republicans in the Senate know it.

This is the good news for the nuclear industry: Senate legislators who don’t mind slashing subsidies for wind and solar do mind slashing them for nuclear and some have already indicated the authors of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” would have to make some changes if they want it to pass the upper house of Congress.

North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, for instance, has an idea of removing only the subsidies for wind and solar but not for nuclear. “I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology,” Cramer said, per Politico, referring to wind and solar, on the one hand, and small modular reactors, on the other.

But here’s a twist: some nuclear companies actually welcome the threat of subsidy removal. “Industries that rely on federal subsidies tend to get stuck in ruts and less favourable towards innovation,” Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, told the FT. “I like the direction that the administration is taking on this, in allowing it to be private and faster.”

Indeed, businesses relying on federal subsidies tend to get stuck in ruts. Look no further than wind and solar for evidence of this. These industries are a lot more active in the lobbying push right now because they know they will not survive for long without subsidies—and they have long forgotten how to compete on the free market. The nuclear industry, hopefully, has a better memory about that.

The company expects to move to mass production in the near term through its global manufacturing partners.

The compact, lightweight SiCore cell delivers up to 80% more energy than conventional lithium-ion cells using graphite anodes, according to Amprius. This translates to extended flight time, greater range and improved system-level performance, as well as lower system cost.

SiCore meets the demands of High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS), Medium-Altitude Platform Stations (MAPS), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where energy density, weight and endurance have a direct impact on mission success. Operators can fly longer missions, minimizing the need for additional batteries, fuel, or equipment.

The cell is being evaluated and Amprius plans to move into qualification with leading aviation and defense customers to prepare for commercial deployment. The company expects to receive UN38.3 certification, which is required for the safe air transport of lithium-ion batteries, during the current quarter. This will allow Amprius to begin volume shipments shortly afterward and support broader commercial deployment worldwide. The company says it has built a global contract manufacturing network with gigawatt-hour-scale production capacity to meet demand.

Over the past several years, they have increasingly been found in farm soils due to the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, causing devastation for farmers. They are also now widely found in drinking water, in the foods Americans eat, and in pesticides, and experts say more research is needed to understand their impacts and find effective ways to eliminate contamination.

According to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) website, the EPA canceled a $1.6 million grant to Texas A&M University for researchers to analyze how plants take up and store the chemicals, and to develop monitoring tools for PFAS in fertilizer, soils, and irrigation water. It canceled another $1.6 million grant to Michigan State University to study how the chemicals accumulate in both crops and livestock. “The expected outcome is to improve the knowledge of the PFAS life cycle in a farm setting,” the researchers wrote in the MSU grant description. “Direct beneficiaries include farmers, agricultural advisors, human health and the environment.”

Additional canceled grants include a University of Florida study looking at how flooding might exacerbate PFAS contamination in water and soil and an Oregon State project to increase understanding of PFAS toxicity. EPA also cut funding to a study on common pesticides called neonicotinoids, which are linked to pollinator declines, in rural drinking water.

The grant cancellations, posted to DOGE’s website between May 6 and May 8, were in line with reporting The New York Times published last month that found the EPA was planning on cutting grants in the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program. Some cancellations were also linked to the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, where the agency is planning to cut staff by up to 75 percent.",https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/250519-epa-pfas-research-grants-cut-1-top-credit-getty-images.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 19:06:07.552580

Maine has spearheaded efforts to address PFAS contamination.
The research The research these grants were supporting in Maine showed promise for helping farmers, communities and consumers detect and prevent PFAS from accumulating in their food, water and soil.
UMaine’s project was to examine ways to disrupt the PFAS contamination cycle, including by limiting the chemical uptake by forages (plants eaten by livestock), livestock, and animal byproducts such as milk, meat and manure.","With the brief window for fiddlehead foraging nearing its close, citizens of the Mi’kmaq Nation hope to collect the traditional food source this week from the Aroostook River flood plain to test as part of their research into understanding, and in turn reducing, forever chemicals in the food supply.

However, they may no longer be able to afford to do the testing they’d planned.

Following months of preparation after securing federal funding in September, the team received an email from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Mission Support on May 13 stating that their four-year grant had been terminated, effective immediately.

“The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,” the email read.

The EPA terminated all of the ten grants it had awarded for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in plants and animals, including two others to Maine-based teams led by the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the University of Maine. PFAS have been linked to long term adverse health outcomes, such as cancers and weakened immune systems, and their pervasiveness in agriculture is not fully understood.

The termination of these grants, each for roughly $1.6 million, are some of the latest examples of the billions of federal dollars the Trump administration has blocked despite already being appropriated by U.S. Congress.

“It’s complete overreach,” said Chelli Stanley, co-founder of an organization committed to cleaning contaminated land, Upland Grassroots, which is part of the research team headed by the Mi’kmaq Nation. “We’re going to appeal. We’re also seeking legal aid.”

Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, UMaine awarded federal grants for forever chemical research

The Passamaquoddy Tribe also plans to appeal the termination of its grant, said Marvin Cling, environmental director for the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point. UMaine did not provide comment regarding whether they intend to dispute the decision by the time of publication.

The grantees have 30 days from their termination notices to make the case that their work is in compliance with the EPA’s priorities. But crafting that argument is complicated by the fact that the EPA has given contradictory statements regarding why the grants were terminated and whether or not they are in line with the agency’s priorities.

Conflicting agency response

In a statement provided to Maine Morning Star in response to a request as to why the research no longer aligns with priorities, the EPA equated the grants with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures.

“As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” the EPA Press Office wrote. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”

There is no mention of DEI or environmental justice in the Maine teams’ research plans or overall objectives of the grant program.

“This is a matter of public health,” said Frey Corey, information technology director for the Mi’kmaq Nation who is a researcher for the Tribes’ grant. Corey has worked with the EPA since 1996 when he started managing natural resources for the Tribe.

“There’s been funding challenges over the years — there’s no doubt about that,” Corey said. “But in terms of how they’re operating, this is really unusual.”

Democratic U.S. Rep Chellie Pingree of Maine, who helped secure that funding as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star this response from the EPA was “not only incredibly disappointing, it’s absurd.”

“To suggest that supporting tribal health and environmental safety — in this case, by studying PFAS contamination in their ancestral waters — is some kind of ‘radical agenda’ is both offensive and deeply ignorant,” Pingree said. “How many times do we have to make clear to this administration that tribes are not ‘DEI’?”

The response the EPA provided to Maine Morning Star runs counter to the agency’s press releases in recent weeks, which highlight a focus on combating PFAS contamination, including through partnerships with tribes. It is also directly at odds with the response EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin gave to Pingree about the grant terminations during an Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Thursday.

After Zeldin outlined that addressing PFAS contamination is a priority for the agency and him personally, Pingree asked, “Since these grants are consistent with the EPA priorities, do you know why they were terminated?”

Zeldin responded, “It’s an important program. It’s something that’s congressionally appropriated. The agency’s going through a reorg, so the way that the program and these grants are administered are going to be different going forward.”

In early May, the agency announced a significant reorganization with major cuts to staffing, especially to its Office of Research and Development, the part of the agency that provides scientific analysis on environmental hazards. Pingree has called those changes a blatant abuse of public health and the agency’s core mission.

Pingree told Maine Morning Star that she felt Zeldin’s response on Thursday was a non-answer.

“The only good thing was he did emphasize that he understood it was appropriated funds,” Pingree said.

But in light of the EPA’s response to Maine Morning Star, Pingree added, “Either Administrator Zeldin was disingenuous with me and our subcommittee, or he and his agency aren’t on the same page.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, also told Maine Morning Star she reached out to the agency last week about the grant terminations and is continuing to press leadership to get a clear answer about their status.

“Research into PFAS mitigation is critically important for our farmers and rural communities, work I am urging the EPA to continue without delay,” Collins said in a statement. “Terminating PFAS grants would be an extremely damaging development.”

Regardless of the reason, Pingree said she considers the termination to be illegal and unconstitutional.

She is encouraging the grantees to go through the appeals process but said she will continue to question EPA leadership on the terminations, including during hearings for the proposed budget, which outlines a 55% funding cut to the EPA that would directly impact the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.

Maine has spearheaded efforts to address PFAS contamination. It was the first state to require manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in their products and has established a host of assistance programs to help farms continue to operate while also protecting public health.

“It’s just doubly cruel of the EPA to take that money back from Maine when we’ve been such a leader in dealing with this critical toxin in our environment that we have so much more work to do on,” Pingree said.

The research

The research these grants were supporting in Maine showed promise for helping farmers, communities and consumers detect and prevent PFAS from accumulating in their food, water and soil. It also represents a new model that centers Indigenous communities who have deep knowledge of the land on which this work is being conducted.

The collaboration between the Mi’kmaq Nation, University of Virginia, Upland Grassroots and Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station dates back to 2019, when they came together to test ways to clean toxins from the former Loring Airforce Base in Aroostook County, which now belongs to the Mi’kmaq Nation.

The team has seen early success with using hemp plants to remove PFAS from soil — a process called phytoremediation. These are the findings that led the group to apply for the EPA grant to further study how this method and others can help reduce contamination from irrigation on farms, a well-known reality for Aroostook County.

After receiving the grant in September, the team began the initial phase of the research, which has three overarching focuses.

Randy Martin, executive director of the Central Aroostook County Soil and Water Conservation District, planned to study how irrigation from the Aroostook River causes PFAS build up in soil and then ultimately in crops. Martin started this winter monitoring contamination levels, watering plants using the Aroostook River and harvesting them for testing.

The Mi’kmaq Nation is focused on how widespread PFAS contamination is in the ecosystem, including medicinal and culturally relevant plants, such as fiddleheads as well as ash wood, which the Tribe has long used for basketweaving.

With the grant now in limbo, the team is planning to freeze these samples with the hope that they can still be studied in the future, as testing makes up the bulk of the cost.

Researchers at the University of Virginia created biosensors to detect PFAS, a twist on the idea of sentinel plants, which are alternative species that display visible symptoms of infection to provide warning signs. Bryan Berger, associate professor of chemical engineering at UVA, said the grant was going to help expand testing to the field.

“Our work is directly focused on delivering solutions to farmers and communities affected, which we did and continue to do now,” Berger said. “It also provides crucial data for regulatory decisions, and offers industries a cost-effective compliance tool — ultimately safeguarding public health while reducing environmental remediation costs across all sectors.”

Before the EPA terminated the grant, the team published a paper demonstrating how one application of this technology could be used in monitoring environmental water quality and a report for growers that shows how PFAS accumulates in potatoes grown in northern Maine.

“We’re proud of how much we accomplished in a short time, and frustrated we weren’t given the chance to complete our work,” Berger said.

Berger, Stanley and Corey said the team is committed to continuing its research despite the grant termination. If it is not eventually reinstated, they plan to explore private funds.

The other two Maine-based projects had similar but distinct aims.

UMaine’s project was to examine ways to disrupt the PFAS contamination cycle, including by limiting the chemical uptake by forages (plants eaten by livestock), livestock, and animal byproducts such as milk, meat and manure. The EPA terminated UMaine’s grant on May 10, according to its website.

The Passamaquoddy Tribe, specifically the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point, planned to assess PFAS in water and fish from watersheds in Tribal and disadvantaged regions of Northeastern Maine to inform the health of those in the area who depend on recreational fisheries as food sources. The Tribe had been in the process of hiring someone to do the research when it received notice of its grant termination on May 12, Cling said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/planting-2.jpg.webp,N,,2025-05-19 18:09:09.763387

The decision by Judge Richard Gergel, a U.S. District Court judge for the District of South Carolina, represents one of the first final judgments in a case challenging the Trump administration, as it has fired employees, frozen funding and dismantled agencies, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center. The organization, along with the Public Rights Project, filed the case on behalf of the nonprofits and municipalities from Baltimore to San Diego. The affected groups received funding for climate and environmental work through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act during the Biden administration, as well as through separate federal programs.

“This is a huge victory for us today,” said Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center and lead attorney on the case. She said the order would set an important precedent and characterized the decision as “a ruling that reaffirms that the executive branch doesn’t have the authority to disregard Congress.”

Gergel announced his decision during a hearing in Charleston that came after the Trump administration, in a filing Friday, said it would concede to the plaintiffs’ claims on 32 of the 38 grants. The judge said he would enter a final judgment calling on the administration to restore the funding immediately. The order was expected within a few days. Despite the administration’s concessions, its attorneys indicated they planned to appeal over jurisdictional concerns.

In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs had claimed that the executive orders freezing the grant funding represented an “unlawful interference by the executive branch” and also violated the First Amendment, which protects free speech. Two additional groups later were added as plaintiffs to the litigation. The plaintiffs said they were forced to furlough employees and pause programs supporting farmers, communities and public health.

Among the executive orders the litigation cited was “Unleashing American Energy,” intended to stop money designated under the IIJA and IRA, which provided historic funding for climate change and clean energy initiatives. The other orders were “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing” and “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative.”

The 32 grants affected by the judge’s decision Monday were awarded under the IIJA and IRA. The other grants were provided under a Department of Agriculture program called Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, which was cancelled in April over concerns about inefficient spending and alignment with Trump administration priorities. The Southern Environmental Law Center said it would continue to work to restore this funding.

Climate United received $6.97 billion, Coalition for Green Capital $5 billion and Power Forward $2 billion.
Following his confirmation, Zeldin indicated on Feb. 12 that the EPA would not rest until the grant funds had been recovered.
They continued requesting access to funds until Citibank informed them on March 3 that it had forwarded the request to the EPA for further guidance.
On March 11, the EPA sent three termination letters to the green energy groups.","WASHINGTON (CN) — A D.C. Circuit panel appeared doubtful Monday that the Environmental Protection Agency followed the law when it suddenly terminated nearly $14 billion in clean energy grants, citing potential fraud concerns.

The Justice Department asked the appellate court to overturn a preliminary injunction blocking the EPA and the Treasury Department from clawing back the funds currently held in the grantees’ accounts at Citibank.

The grants, part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program authorized under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, were awarded to fund efforts for clean energy projects across the country. Climate United received $6.97 billion, Coalition for Green Capital $5 billion and Power Forward $2 billion.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin issued three termination letters to the grantees, effective immediately, “based on substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste and abuse and misalignment with the agency’s priorities.”

Zeldin specifically highlighted an “absence of adequate oversight controls,” “improper or speculative allocation of funds” and “circumvention and defeat of key oversight mechanisms in the disbursement of federal funds.”

Adam Unikowsky, of Jenner Block and representing the grantees, argued Monday that the EPA’s justification was not factual because any grant recipient, including sub-grantees that receive funds to construct the projects, has monitored bank accounts.

“The question in this case is whether the EPA has the authority to just terminate the whole program and re-obligate the funds just because it disagrees with the decision of the prior administration,” Unikowsky said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Cornelia Pillard, a Barack Obama appointee, pressed Justice Department attorney Jacob Roth over separation of powers concerns sparked by the EPA's canceling of congressionally appropriated funds.

“EPA has been really clear on this, from in the termination letters and in every statement it's made, that this is not some sort of frontal assault on the appropriation or Congress’s objective,” Roth said. “There’s a whole series of grants, like the solar grants, that were not touched because they don’t implicate the structural problems with these particular grant agreements.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, a Donald Trump appointee, expressed concern that finding any separation of powers issue would set a precedent for a slew of constitutional claims anytime the executive fails to terminate a contract as specified by statute.

Unikowsky pushed back, arguing that Climate United and the fellow grantees’ claims were a special case because the EPA violated the appropriations clause rather than a usual statute.

“Suppose EPA simply announced that it doesn’t care about what the act of Congress says, it’s the executive branch, it has the unilateral authority to terminate contracts at will,” Unikowsky said. “I think that would raise some separation of powers and constitutional issues.”

Pillard noted that the facts of the case seem to undermine the Justice Department’s case, pointing both to Zeldin’s public comments and the EPA’s actions at the outset of the case.

Following his confirmation, Zeldin indicated on Feb. 12 that the EPA would not rest until the grant funds had been recovered.

During a Feb. 23 Fox News interview, Zeldin made clear what he thought about the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program, stating “the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal.”

According to the grantees, they first learned their funds had been frozen in mid-February when they placed their regular request to Citibank to release the funds but received no response.

They continued requesting access to funds until Citibank informed them on March 3 that it had forwarded the request to the EPA for further guidance. During this time, the EPA did not respond to similar requests from the plaintiffs.

The agency offered to meet with Climate United around Feb. 24, then rescheduled the meeting three times before ultimately canceling without explanation.

On March 4, the Treasury instructed Citibank not to disburse the funds through March 9, after which the EPA ordered the freeze to be continued indefinitely.

Climate United sued, seeking a temporary restraining order on March 8, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled a hearing for March 12. On March 11, the EPA sent three termination letters to the green energy groups.

The administration also will rescind planned regulations for other PFAS chemicals found in water systems.
What are PFAS chemicals?
PFAS chemicals are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down naturally in the environment or in the human body.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost everyone in the U.S. has at least some PFAS chemicals in their blood.","The Trump administration announced on May 14 it will keep the first-ever regulations on two of the most widely-known “forever chemicals” found in public water systems, including here in Indianapolis.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would keep the Biden administration’s 2024 regulations for PFOA and PFOS, but would extend the period for public water systems to come into compliance to 2031, two years later than originally planned.

The administration also will rescind planned regulations for other PFAS chemicals found in water systems.

Here’s what you need to know.

What are PFAS chemicals?

PFAS are a group of thousands of chemicals, such as PFOA and PFOS, that were made to manufacture products that are resistant to heat, water, grease and stains. Products include Teflon nonstick pans, clothing and other products sold and manufactured in the state.

They are also used to produce items like microchips and medical devices.

PFAS chemicals are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down naturally in the environment or in the human body. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost everyone in the U.S. has at least some PFAS chemicals in their blood. Some PFAS chemicals can stay in the human body for years.

Until 2024, there were no enforceable limits on how much of any PFAS chemical was allowed in drinking water.

Which PFAS are now regulated?

The EPA will keep a 4 nanograms per liter limit on PFOA and PFOS, some of the oldest and most studied PFAS chemicals.

They were created in the late 1940s by Minnesota-based manufacturing company 3M and have been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, liver damage, lower antibody response to some vaccines and other adverse health effects.

State public water system testing found PFOS in Speedway’s drinking water at 2.3 nanograms per liter, a level below the national limit. PFOA and PFOS were also found in water wells used by the town of Speedway and Citizens Energy Group for drinking water.

Public water systems will have until 2031 to meet the new standards.

Which PFAS regulations will be dropped?

The Trump administration said it would eliminate limits for PFHxS, PFNA and HFPO-DA — the latter of which is a chemical more commonly known as GenX. All three are PFAS chemicals that served as replacements for PFOA and PFOS. If allowed to take effect, the regulation would have limited each chemical to 10 nanograms per liter.

It also plans to drop the Hazard Index, a formula that would assess how the combined levels of those three chemicals, plus another called PFBS, affect drinking water systems and require further action to limit their levels at water systems.

PFBS was found in treated drinking water supplied by Citizens Energy Group, and both PFBS and PFHxS were found in Speedway’s treated water.

PFHxS has been found in untreated water used by Speedway and Citizens Energy Group, PFNA has been found in Speedway’s water wells and GenX in Citizens Energy Group water wells.

The EPA has not announced when it would submit a proposed rule to eliminate these regulations.

Notably, EPA now intends to rescind regulations for four other PFAS covered in the Biden-era PFAS drinking water rule. EPA plans to issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize the rule in early 2026.

On April 10, 2024, the EPA under President Biden established Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)1 and Maximum Concentration Level Goals (MCLGs)2 for six PFAS (the MCL Rule), including PFOA and PFOS, which gave public water systems until 2029 to complete water treatment system adjustments and infrastructure upgrades, as may be necessary, to comply with the MCLs.3 EPA now plans to develop a rulemaking to extend the compliance date to 2031 and rescind the regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus PFBS. EPA also stated that it will support the defense of the MCL Rule with respect to PFOA and PFOS in the ongoing legal challenges to the rule.4 In its May 14, 2025 announcement, the agency hinted at “holding polluters accountable”, stating that “the need for a polluter pays model has guided a lot of the work to be done at EPA in the future.”

Environmental groups criticized the announcement, expressing concerns about the impact on public health and stating that the plans are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision.”5 Industry groups applauded the EPA’s stance as necessary and pragmatic. The Association of State Drinking Water Administrators responded that with the current 2029 deadline under the Biden-era MCL Rule, “states and water systems are struggling with the timeframes to complete the pilot testing, development of construction plans, and building the necessary treatment improvements.”

The EPA’s May 14, 2025 announcement can be found here.

1 MCLs are the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to MCGLs as feasible using the best available treatment technology and taking cost into consideration. MCLs are enforceable standards.

2 MCLGs are the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MCLGs allow for a margin of safety and are non-enforceable public health goals.

3 Under the MCL Rule, the MCL for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water supplies is 4 parts per trillion and the MCLG is zero. For the four other chemicals, EPA had set the MCLs and MCLGs at 10 parts per trillion.

4 The MCL Rule is currently being challenged in the D.C. Circuit court by industry groups and utilities. See American Water Works Association, et al v. EPA, et al (24-1088) (D.C. Court of Appeals)

5 Section 1412(b)(9) of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended in 1996 requires that: ""The Administrator (of EPA) shall, not less often than every 6 years, review and revise, as appropriate, each national primary drinking water regulation promulgated under this title.

Clean air protections don’t hold us back, they help communities thrive.
It also limits the EPA’s ability to enforce clean air and water protections or hold corporations accountable when they pollute.
These moves don’t make us safer—they endanger lives and threaten decades of hard-won gains on public health.","As Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin prepares to testify before Congress this Wednesday—where he’s expected to downplay the real-world harm caused by his actions—his recent op-ed in the New York Post and public announcements offer a preview of the misinformation to come. Zeldin claims the Trump administration is cracking down on so-called “environmental justice scams” and refocusing on “real threats to water and air,” all under the banner of fiscal responsibility. But the reality looks very different. Under his leadership, EPA is systematically dismantling nearly core clean air and water protections, giving polluters a free pass while communities are left to bear the consequences. Here’s what Zeldin says—and what the facts actually show.

Zeldin’s Claim: Public Health Will Be Fine Without Health Protections

Zeldin confidently asserts that the Trump administration’s plan to gut 31 public health safeguards have “absolutely” no adverse health effects on people.

The Truth: Just 12 of the 31 environmental rollbacks proposed by the Trump administration could cause nearly 200,000 premature deaths in the next 25 years and trigger more than 10,000 asthma attacks every single day. These rollbacks include weakening mercury and air toxics limits for coal plants, limits for chemical air pollution from factories, and gutting wastewater protections for oil and gas operations. The estimates come from the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA officials sounding the alarm on the deadly consequences of dismantling basic public health safeguards.

Zeldin’s Claim: Eliminating ‘Environmental Justice’ Grants Is Justified

Zeldin criticized environmental justice initiatives, labeling them as “scams” and accusing them of misusing taxpayer money. He points to grants awarded to organizations like the Climate United Fund, which received nearly $7 billion despite being newly established.

The Truth: Getting rid of environmental justice programs takes away one of the few tools people have to stand up to pollution in their neighborhoods. (Even House Speaker Mike Johnson sought an environmental justice grant for his Louisiana district). Research shows that low-income communities and communities of color are much more likely to breathe toxic air, live near factories, highways, and waste sites—places where the air is harder to breathe and the water isn’t always safe to drink. These programs have long helped remedy those unfair conditions by reducing disparities between who has access to clean air, clean water, and a safe place to live, across the nation.

Zeldin’s Claim: Cutting Health Protections Will Drive Economic Growth

Zeldin and the Trump administration claim that stripping away environmental safeguards will jumpstart economic growth, especially in industries like energy and manufacturing. They argue that removing so-called “regulatory burdens” will lead to job creation and more investment—even if it means loosening protections that keep air and water clean.

The Truth: Pollution doesn’t just harm our health—it drives up healthcare costs, leads to missed work, and leaves taxpayers with the cleanup bill. And despite what some claim, it’s not necessarily good for the economy. An Earthjustice review of federal data shows that 14 major metro areas grew their economies while cutting pollution—including Dallas, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Detroit, to name just four. Clean air protections don’t hold us back, they help communities thrive. And in places already struggling financially, more pollution only makes people sicker and harder for them to get ahead.

Zeldin’s Claim: Firing Staff and Reorganizing the EPA Will Improve Efficiency

While Zeldin was firing hundreds of EPA employees, he also announced a major reorganization of the agency—including the creation of new offices focused on air partnerships, clean air programs, and applied science. He claims these changes will enhance transparency and efficiency

The Truth: Restructuring the EPA while slashing its workforce and budget undermines the very efficiency Zeldin claims to promote. Pushing out experienced staff and cutting funding weakens the agency’s ability to protect public health and the environment. It also limits the EPA’s ability to enforce clean air and water protections or hold corporations accountable when they pollute. At a time when pollution, chemical exposure, and climate threats are growing, hollowing out the EPA makes it less effective—not more.

Administrator Zeldin’s claims about the benefits of gutting protections and scrapping community-focused programs fall apart under even the briefest scrutiny. These moves don’t make us safer—they endanger lives and threaten decades of hard-won gains on public health. But Earthjustice isn’t standing by. We’re fighting alongside communities across the country to protect clean air, safe water, and a healthy future from Zeldin, the Trump administration, and corporate polluters.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lee_zeldin_2k.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 18:09:17.170905

The majority’s bill that would slash taxes for billionaires would eliminate clean vehicle tax credits that have allowed tens of thousands of Americans afford a new car; gut clean vehicle standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and impose a new and unprecedented fee on owners of electric vehicles.

Going after clean vehicles undermines a transition to electric vehicles (EVs) that is crucial to America’s economic success and global competitiveness. The United States is the global leader for attracting EV investments, with more than $300 billion in investments in new domestic factories to date. These investments are creating good jobs in states from Georgia to Michigan.

The combination of tax incentives and EPA standards is driving this transition. The incentives ensure that the vehicles are affordable, and the standards ensure that automakers deliver on their promises on EVs. In fact, this powerful combination of policies will save drivers $6,000 on the cost of owning a new vehicle while also helping spur EV sales and saving the country $13 billion a year from fewer asthma attacks and lung and heart disease.

Despite the benefits of these measures, the legislation passed by party-line vote in committees last week would gut both of these measures. The House Ways and Means committee measure would eliminate the $7,500 credit when buying a new electric vehicle and, in a totally unprecedented maneuver, the Energy and Commerce bill would overturn the commonsense and beneficial EPA standards.

Given the broad benefits to consumers and industry, the Senate should jettison both of these provisions as they make no sense.

In addition to the attack on incentives and EPA standards, the House proposal also includes a more novel attack on clean vehicles: a substantial annual tax of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid vehicle owners. Additional taxes for EVs, combined with a repeal of clean vehicle tax credits that make it more expensive to buy a clean vehicle, would significantly erode—or in states that already have other punitive fees on EVs in place, erase—the fuel cost savings that driving on electricity should provide.

Add to the mix already soaring vehicle prices thanks to recently introduced tariffs, and clean vehicles would be unfairly penalized and would become unaffordable for a large proportion of the U.S. population. State EV fees and taxes already overburden EV drivers compared to their gasoline counterparts. Thirty-nine states collect EV-specific registration fees on top of conventional vehicle registration fees ranging from $50 to $250, often far exceeding what drivers of conventional vehicles pay in state gas taxes. Some states also subject EV owners to additional charging fees and electricity taxes.

All these state and proposed federal charges lumped together mean that, on average, EV drivers pay more than double what gasoline vehicles pay. All vehicles on the road contribute to the maintenance of America’s transportation infrastructure in some way and people who drive the cleanest vehicles should not pay more than those driving gasoline and diesel vehicles.

These proposed new taxes on clean vehicles are supposedly meant to shore up Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenues, but they won’t make a dent in projected revenue shortfalls. EVs account for less than 2 percent of vehicles currently operating on American roads. If Congress is serious about returning the HTF to solvency, it needs to address the real problem: the fact that gas tax revenues have been shrinking as a result of inflation.

While the need remains to identify a long-term solution to generating revenue for the HTF, discussions about clean vehicles should be part of a holistic approach to funding transportation in the long term and should be included as part of the surface transportation reauthorization process, which dictates the level of money allocated to transportation programs and determines the sources of funding.

In April 2025, 34 environmental, health, and industry organizations signed a letter calling for Congress to oppose proposals to include new taxes for clean vehicles in the budget reconciliation process and to develop a fair and transparent approach to transportation funding through bipartisan surface transportation negotiations.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-05/woman-charging-electric-car-curbside-station-DSC00793.jpg?h=790be497&itok=g-PoSFJl,N,,2025-05-19 17:08:33.959969

By Eric Starkman

Let’s hope U.S. auto writers don’t fatally choke on the free-range egg splattered across their collective faces.

For more than three years, mainstream and trade auto journalists have promoted the false narrative that GM CEO Mary Barra is a “transformative” environmental leader boldly disrupting a complacent auto industry and championing the adoption of electric vehicles. Fortune last year named Barra America’s most powerful female business leader, citing her EV credentials, and the year before, ranked her alongside Elon Musk as one of the auto industry’s top disruptors.

InsideEVs even named Barra its 2024 Person of the Year.

“Under Barra’s leadership, GM executed an electric turnaround that may be taught in business schools someday,” gushed editor Patrick George. “That took some doing, and it’s why she is the InsideEVs Breakthrough Awards’ Person of the Year for 2024.”

Barra’s leadership may indeed be studied in business schools—but likely as a cautionary tale. Her story is one of chasing prevailing political winds and making strategic pivots based on short-term optics, all while relying on the expectation that U.S. taxpayers will endlessly subsidize GM’s operations, including its faltering EV ambitions.

After Joe Biden—whom Politico reported had a close relationship with Barra—was elected, Barra styled herself as an EV evangelist. She pledged to make GM an all-electric manufacturer by 2035 and embraced Biden’s climate agenda.

“As Chairman and CEO of General Motors, I now have a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to use my engineering mindset to help make the world a better place on a much larger scale,” she said. “At General Motors, we have a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It is our north star that guides everything we do.”

Falling Short

Barra’s results have so far fallen far short of her stated goals and objectives.

Barra famously predicted GM would outsell Tesla in EVs by the end of 2025. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla sold 336,681 EVs, while GM moved just 31,886. Even though GM’s EV sales nearly doubled, they still made up just 5% of the company’s total U.S. volume—well below the national average of 7% for EVs overall.

In California, the most EV-friendly state in the country, GM’s performance has been especially dismal. Even the Tesla Cybertruck—dismissed by the media as a commercial failure—outsold most of GM’s electric offerings in Q1. The one exception: the Equinox EV, which qualifies for generous U.S. tax credits despite being manufactured in Mexico, and beginning in 2025, with key parts sourced from Mexico and South Korea.

Now, in what amounts to a tacit admission of failure, Barra appears to have shifted course again—this time siding with the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken California’s aggressive EV mandates.

According to the Wall Street Journal, GM urged thousands of its white-collar employees in Michigan to contact U.S. senators in support of legislation that would overturn California’s landmark rule banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035—a mandate since adopted by 11 other states.

“We need your help!” read the GM email. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

A GM spokeswoman, who the Journal unfortunately didn’t identify, said GM wants to protect “consumer choice.” That’s comical, given that five years ago, Barra pledged to eliminate gas-powered options entirely by 2035.

This isn’t Barra’s first alignment with a Trump-era environmental rollback.

In 2019, the Trump administration moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own stricter emissions standards—a power the state had exercised for decades to accelerate clean vehicle adoption. Rather than standing with California and other environmentally forward states, GM backed the Trump administration, joining a coalition supporting efforts to weaken federal fuel economy rules and undercut California’s regulatory independence.

By contrast, Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen signed a voluntary agreement with California to meet tougher emissions targets. GM’s position sparked swift backlash from Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates, who rightly accused Barra of hypocrisy.

When President Biden took office, Barra reversed course again—rebranding herself as a climate ally. Just months after Biden assumed command, Barra announced a $1 billion investment to convert GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico for electric vehicle production. The move infuriated the United Auto Workers, who saw it as a betrayal of American labor.

“At a time when General Motors is asking for a significant investment by the U.S. government in subsidizing electric vehicles, this is a slap in the face for not only UAW members and their families but also for U.S. taxpayers and the American workforce,” former UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in response. “GM automobiles made in Mexico are sold in the United States and should be made right here, employing American workers. That is why our nation is investing in these companies. Taxpayer money should not go to companies that utilize labor outside the U.S. while benefiting from American government subsidies. This is not the America any of us signed on for. Frankly, it is unseemly.”

Trump's Tariffs

Even more unseemly: Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which extended generous tax breaks to EVs built in Mexico—including the Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Cadillac Optiq. If not for Trump-era tariffs, Barra likely would have shifted even more EV production to Mexico, where GM is the country’s largest automaker.

Barra’s latest pivot is no surprise. GM last fall abandoned its self-imposed goal of building 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and has twice delayed the reopening of its Lake Orion plant, which was slated to produce the electric Silverado. The company also pushed back the launch of a new Buick plug-in hybrid.

Notably, nearly half of GM’s Buick dealers took buyouts in 2023 rather than invest in the infrastructure needed to sell and service EVs—suggesting they may have had a better read on consumer demand than Barra herself.

Still, GM’s latest retreat from its electrification targets hasn’t sparked any humility within its leadership ranks.

Last week, Dave Richardson, a former Apple executive who now oversees software at GM, told reporters the company is working on a breakthrough called “mechatronics”—a system that integrates mechanical, electrical, and computing systems in vehicles. Tesla has been deploying this type of technology for more than a decade.

Given Richardson’s background, one might assume that integrating GM’s vehicle apps with the Apple Watch would be an easy win. Yet the project has been suspended because of glitches -- while Tesla rolled out seamless Apple Watch integration last December.

Meanwhile, GM claims to have made a significant advancement in battery technology with its lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistry, which reportedly offers 30% greater energy density at the same production cost and helps reduce reliance on Chinese intellectual property.

“LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability. He added that the new chemistry would “advance American battery innovation and create jobs well into the future.”

Silicon Valley Hotshots

Kelty, formerly of Tesla and Panasonic, and Richardson are among several Silicon Valley hotshots recruited by Barra to help recast GM as a tech-forward company. Yet while GM’s top tech leadership is based in California, Barra insists the company’s headquarters remains in Detroit—even though CNBC recently reported that President Mark Reuss’s office is located at the Warren Tech Center.

Every media interview I’ve read with Barra the reporter noted that it was conducted at GM’s Tech Center.

Richardson and Kelty have been with GM for less than two years. Time will tell whether they stick around. Notably, Barra last year trumpeted the hiring of JP Clausen, another ex-Tesla executive, to lead GM’s global manufacturing.

“JP’s unique expertise in global manufacturing innovation, engineering, and operations will accelerate our ability to deliver on our vision for GM with the highest quality vehicles for our customers,” Barra said in a press release.

Clausen recently disclosed on LinkedIn that he had left GM, citing that the decision “makes sense for me and my family right now.”",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_mary_7_58037.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 21:04:31.297585

The proposal is being reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee at the time of this writing and seeks to end the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and up to $4,000 credit for used models by the end of this year. However, the plan will allow a grace period (ending in 2027) that would permit automakers who had not yet reached 200,000 EV sales to continue taking advantage of the program.

Absent from the plan are any provisions to end federal subsidies of battery production, provided the work is being done without help from China. EV batteries produced within the United States would be fine. But any units manufactured under Chinese licenses or using components made by select Chinese companies will be deemed ineligible.

According to Reuters, this still sent some groups into a tizzy. While environmental organizations have become less enamored with EVs due to the ecological concerns surrounding the manufacturing and disposal of batteries, some of the largest entities still support them unconditionally. But it was the industry groups that had the most to say about the proposal thus far.

From Reuters:

The president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, Genevieve Cullen, criticized the proposal, saying that plans “to abandon U.S. leadership in energy innovation by gutting federal investment in electrification are catastrophically short-sighted.”

The proposal, she said, would deliver “an enormous market advantage” to competitors like China and threaten U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

The U.S. Treasury in 2024 awarded more than $2 billion in point-of-sale rebates for EVs.

There is certainly a case to be made that the U.S. would be foolish to totally abandon embracing new technologies. But it could just as easily be argued that China still has the most to gain from global electrification, regardless of where the manufacturing takes place, due to how much of raw materials required for battery production pass through its borders. China presently holds a staggering 70 percent of the world lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity. That effectively means Central Asia controls the global supply chain.

Ergo, China likewise benefited from the manufacturing incentives initiated under Joe Biden. But many of those joint ventures fell through as additional scrutiny was given to industry partnerships and those efforts have only ramped up under Trump. Still, billions upon billions in government subsidies have likewise gone to South Korean companies as part of subsequent joint ventures with U.S. brands to build batteries domestically. A significant amount of money is still technically being sent offshore to swiftly increase U.S. battery production and determining how much of that is necessary will be tricky for legislators who want to see more electric vehicles produced as soon as possible.

As part of the House proposal designed to curtain emissions and end EV tax credits, there are likewise provisions to eliminate some of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Programs, including those pertaining to battery production.

Working against the House Republicans’ efforts is the fact that the automotive-related inclusions only represent a fraction of what’s in the larger bill. It’s not inconceivable that other components could serve to undermine its passing. This is ultimately a budget reconciliation bill and includes items pertaining to cutting back Medicaid, numerous welfare programs, and loads of environmental spending. Bipartisan support likewise seems to be lacking and isn’t anticipated to come up due to how much the proposal targets climate and “environmental justice” initiatives.

However, both the House of Representatives and Senate presently have Republican majorities. The likelihood of President Trump signing off on the legislation, should Congress pass it, is strong as well. He attempted to reduce U.S. fuel economy standards during his first term on the premise that it would allow manufacturers to build less complicated and more traditional vehicles boasting lower price tags. He contended that this would simultaneously boost American manufacturing, due to the fact that those products could be less reliant on foreign-made electronics.

Trump has tacitly supported ending EV tax credits in the past. But the assumption at the time was that they would eventually exhaust themselves as part of the vehicle quotas they were attached to. However, the 200,000 car limit was done away with during the Biden administration (which made pivoting America to EVs a major platform) and EV subsidies effectively became indefinite, if manufacturers could adhere to the content requirements. That latter aspect is likely something Team Trump would have probably supported. But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.

While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them. The assumed reasoning is that Tesla was the first automaker to manufacture enough electric vehicles to exhaust the quota and has little to gain by allowing legacy brands to continue benefiting from government subsidies.

The final angle to this ludicrously complicated issue pertains to how the automotive lobby ultimately responds. The industry is incredibly influential in terms of setting policy and has some deep pockets. Whether we’re discussing restrictions on imported trucks via the “Chicken Tax,” creating emissions loopholes via the “Footprint Rule,” extending EV subsidies, or securing billions of dollars in bailouts after going bankrupt in 2008, the automotive sector has a tendency of getting its way.

However, the industry cannot control everything and even the best-laid plans can sometimes backfire. For example, the response to aggressive emission mandates from Western governments was to have the auto lobby help carve out special exemptions for larger vehicles and subsidize electrification indefinitely. While this temporarily boosted profit margins on just about every vehicle sold, automakers are now confronting a situation where a large amount of new product is out of reach for the average customer.

Small, affordable vehicles boasting superior reliability have effectively evaporated from the North American market. Tiny, increasingly complex powertrains are simultaneously becoming the norm and mandated technologies help balloon MSRPs. The push toward EVs has likewise failed to progress at a pace industry leadership assumed would be financially viable. While nothing can be truly assured, much of the public has signaled they’re not altogether pleased with the direction the industry has been heading and we’re starting to see vehicle sales reflect that.

It’s plausible that the industry would absolutely embrace a reduction in emission requirements at this juncture. But there is still a lot of free money (for lack of a better term) from the taxpayers being left on the table if the subsidies are done away with. Meanwhile, the fact that this is all part of an expansive budget reconciliation bill means it’ll undoubtedly go through numerous changes before the matter is settled",https://i0.wp.com/automotiveamerican.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-10.png?fit=720%2C480&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-19 22:02:23.613614

And by growing role, we mean there’s plenty to talk about on Toyota’s hydrogen horizon.

And it’s not just in cars.

Stacked in the beds of Toyota Tundra pickup trucks, these mobile power generators can be taken across the country, from California to as far east as Florida providing cleaner power for a variety of events.*

“You’re using hydrogen, so you’ll have energy with the only byproducts at point of use being power and water,” said Craig Cauthen, who manages Emerging Technologies at Toyota Racing Development (TRD).

Generating a Speedy Process

In 2021, Cauthen and a handful of engineers on the TRD engineering team in Costa Mesa, California, were asked to develop a fuel cell generator system based on technology from the first-generation Toyota Mirai.*

“Once we figured it was possible, we said, Let’s make it portable. Let’s make it lightweight. Let’s make it easier to move around,” Cauthen said.

Powerful Events

The team recognized that the fuel cell generators could be used at local and Toyota-sponsored events around the U.S. that needed off-grid power.*

From live performances to racing events, these fuel cell generators have powered outdoor events nearly silently and with zero emissions at the point of use. Not only can they provide cleaner energy, but they’re also sensory positive.

“If you’ve ever been to an event, concert, or anyplace like that, there are always generators running,” Cauthen says. “These fuel cell generators are relatively quiet. You can have a conversation next to them while they’re running. You can power just about anything if you have a tank of hydrogen.”*

Spreading the Word While Moving in Silence

It can be an eye-opening experience to learn that a fuel cell generator can power so much while remaining virtually noise-free.

“From an R&D standpoint, we heard that TRD had this fuel cell generator in the Tundra and wanted to give it more face time with the general public,” says Debby Byrne, an executive program manager at Toyota. “So, I think from the advanced product planning office [APPO], we wanted to get more information about hydrogen and hydrogen technology, fuel cell technology, out into the public.”

Byrne adds, “I think a lot of people are familiar with EVs (electric vehicles) but not fuel cells. So, it was an opportunity to kind of take what TRD had done and then showcase it in different demonstration events.”

For example, the fuel cell generators had been used to power three food trucks in Detroit during a community event, delivering 10 kilowatts of power.

“Normally when you have a food truck rally, every single one has that diesel generator,” she says. “It’s loud and you smell those fumes rather than the food that you’re trying to eat. So, it was a good opportunity to partner with the City of Detroit to showcase this technology.”

Fueling the Future

Byrne also believes the future looks bright for fuel cell generator opportunities and more.

“From a global standpoint, Toyota has pushed fuel cell technology as something that is scalable,” says Byrne. “So, we really want to showcase how fuel cell technology has the capability to work in many different applications almost seamlessly.”

Added Cauthen: “Hydrogen fuel cells are a technology that can be used now. It’s not a far-off dream or a concept technology. Fuel cells can be done today. They are here.”

On May 12, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an interim final rule significantly extending the reporting deadlines for PFAS reporting under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The extension postpones the start of the reporting period by nine months—from July 11, 2025, to April 13, 2026—and sets a new submission deadline of October 13, 2026, for most manufacturers. Small manufacturers who import PFAS-containing articles will now have until April 13, 2027, to comply.

This extension responds to feedback from stakeholders and is designed to give EPA additional time to finalize and test the electronic reporting system. Significantly, EPA’s delay also provides industry more time to prepare for what many have described as a complex and demanding reporting obligation. According to its May 12, 2025 update, “EPA is separately considering reopening certain aspects of the rule to public comment,” and the “delayed reporting date ensures that EPA has adequate time to consider the public comments and propose and finalize any modifications to the rule before the submission period begins.” That statement, coupled with EPA’s April 28 announcement that it would minimize the burden on article importers and small businesses, may mean that EPA is already considering future rule changes.

Scope and Purpose of the TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting Rule

The 2023 final rule marked a significant expansion of EPA’s data-gathering authority over PFAS. Issued pursuant to the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which amended TSCA to mandate reporting on PFAS, the rule requires any entity that manufactured or imported PFAS, including as components of articles, between 2011 and 2022, to report a broad range of information. This includes data on chemical identity, production volumes, uses, byproducts, disposal practices, worker exposure and known environmental or health effects.

EPA’s stated objective is to build a comprehensive inventory of historical PFAS manufacturing and importation in the US to support future regulatory action, risk evaluation, and risk management efforts. Given the growing regulatory and public health focus on PFAS as a class of persistent and potentially harmful chemicals, the reporting rule represents a critical step in the federal government’s effort to close longstanding data gaps.

Implementation Challenges and the Basis for Extension

In issuing the interim final rule, EPA cited the need for additional time to develop and test the electronic reporting platform that will be used to receive the required information. The agency emphasized that the extended timeline will not only allow for technical improvements but also enable regulated entities to provide feedback on the tool’s usability and to request clarifying guidance on reporting expectations.

Stakeholders across multiple industries have raised concerns about the complexity of the reporting requirements and the burden associated with reconstructing over a decade of historical data. In particular, trade associations such as the RV Industry Association (RIVA) have highlighted the difficulty for article importers—especially small businesses—with limited access to upstream supplier information. These concerns appear to have factored heavily into EPA’s decision to issue the interim final rule, as the agency acknowledged the need to provide reasonable timeframes for compliance and reduce the likelihood of widespread reporting errors.

Implications for Manufacturers, Importers and Article Handlers

The extended deadlines offer short-term regulatory relief but underscore the need for companies to begin preparing now. Manufacturers and importers must identify all PFAS that they handled from 2011 to 2022. Importantly, the reporting obligation applies even if the PFAS was imported unintentionally or as part of a complex product. The scope of required data, such as information related to environmental and health effects, will necessitate significant internal coordination and engagement with suppliers.

While EPA has not yet modified the substance of the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements, companies should not postpone their due diligence efforts to determine whether any such changes may impact their reporting obligations, as the delay is an acknowledgment that compliance will require substantial, time-consuming effort and that additional guidance and outreach will be critical. The final version of the reporting tool, once released, may also influence how companies structure their data collection efforts in the coming year.

Conclusion

By balancing regulatory objectives with industry feedback and technological readiness, EPA aims to facilitate more accurate and complete PFAS reporting submissions. The regulated community should view this extension not as a reason to delay preparation, but as an opportunity to carefully align compliance strategies with EPA’s guidance and technological updates. As EPA advances its broader PFAS agenda, including potential future restrictions and risk management rules, early and thorough compliance with the reporting rule will be essential.",https://www.mgmlaw.com/assets/images/mgm-og-social.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 17:08:37.290321
