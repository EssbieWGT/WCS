Windmills and solar panels make only a small contribution to grid reliability in cold snaps, according to Olson.
The demand for electricity will grow, but the supply will shrink, according to figures compiled by E3.
“We need resources that can provide that energy for extended periods during these cold weather events,” Olson said.
Electric utilities have plans to build enough new power resources to make the grid reliable.","If the Northwest has a long cold snap, it may not have enough electricity, a consultant hired by utilities said.

Up to now, the region has had enough power to meet extraordinary demand. But the surplus is expected to turn into a deficit in 2026, E3 senior partner Arne Olson told the Washington Senate Environment, Energy and Technology Committee on Dec. 5.

Power plants that provide “firm” electricity, such as coal plants, are being shut down. Almost all new power plants are intermittent wind and solar installations, he said.

Windmills and solar panels make only a small contribution to grid reliability in cold snaps, according to Olson. Batteries typically supply power for only four hours, he said.

“If you have an event that lasts three or four days, the four hours is really not that helpful,” Olson said.

Two-part study

Public and investor-owned utilities in Washington and Oregon hired San Francisco-based E3 (stands for Energy and Environmental Economics) to do a two-part study.

The first part evaluated the grid’s reliability. The second part, still to come, will suggest ways to make the grid more reliable.

E3 projects the grid will become increasingly short of enough power to meet peak demands. The demand for electricity will grow, but the supply will shrink, according to figures compiled by E3.

“When I read this report, I had a hard time sleeping,” said the committee’s chairwoman, Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham.

Hydropower dams are a defense against power outages.

“If it’s a wet year, we are fine. If it’s a very, very dry year, and we have a cold snap, that’s when we have the biggest problems,” Olson said.

Demand accelerating

Data centers, electric vehicles and manufacturing are expected to accelerate demand.

Meanwhile, Washington’s clean-energy law commands electric utilities to get off fossil fuels by 2045. The state’s last coal plant is scheduled to close at the end of this year.

Wind, solar and batteries make up almost all new resources. As a result, the region will have less electricity available to meet peak demands. E3 projects the shortfall will grow to 8,600 megawatts by 2030.

“We need resources that can provide that energy for extended periods during these cold weather events,” Olson said.

“We’re replacing resources, but we’re not replacing them in-kind,” he said. “We are actually losing capacity, rather than gaining it over the last seven years.

“In the future, we’ll be looking at emerging technologies, such as geothermal or nuclear or long-duration storage that also may be able to help, but those aren’t available today,” Olson said.

Electric utilities have plans to build enough new power resources to make the grid reliable. But to keep up, they will have to pick up the pace, and it’s hard to get anything build, Olson said.

“More than has been built in the last 25 years has to be built in the next five years,” Olson said. “It’s very challenging to think we can get this amount of power developed over the next five years.”",https://chinookobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/BPA-lines.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-12-14 23:57:44.895393

With Spain aiming to foster investments in hydrogen as a fuel source, the sentiment for clean fuel production in the nation has become all too clear.","In a world that has seen growing calls to diversify energy portfolios and reduce emissions from fuel production, the renewable diesel and gasoline downstream markets have been boosted by the news that Repsol, one of the largest integrated energy firms in the world, has given the green light for the Catalonia facility in Spain to convert urban waste materials into methanol, and renewable diesel and gasoline. The move comes as a litany of energy-rich nations aim to decarbonize the fuel production market in their nations to provide cleaner energy resources for the downstream market.

Repsol plans to enable its Tarragona Ecoplanta to deliver vast amounts of fuels that will boost the downstream market

The company has noted that it plans to invest up to €800 million in the Tarragona Ecoplanta, which will be capable of producing vast amounts of methanol and renewable gasoline and diesel through the conversion of urban waste into energy resources. The project will be the first of its kind in Europe, and exemplifies the need to produce cleaner fuels for the industrial, shipping, and transport industries.

The project will boost the regional clean fuel operations as Spain, along with the rest of the world, aims to decarbonize the fuel market to meet stringent clean energy and emission targets by the end of the decade. Repsol has noted that the project will create up to 2,800 jobs during the construction phase, and will provide a further 340 jobs once the pioneering plant begins operations.

“Ecoplanta will strongly contribute to achieving the ambitious waste management objectives for the 2030-2035 horizon. Together with the improvement of selective collection, anaerobic digestion, and mechanical and chemical recycling, it will make it possible to achieve the recycling objectives and minimize the disposal of waste in landfills and incineration, as well as the improvements that this reduction in the use of landfills represents for the environment.” – Repsol statement on the Tarragona Ecoplanta

The project has received funds from the Innovation Fund of the European Union

Notably, the Tarragona Ecoplanta conversion of urban waste into methanol, renewable diesel, and gasoline will leverage Repsol’s already impressive infrastructure in the region. Repsol’s board of directors recently gave its approval for the project to move forward after it was selected by the Innovation Fund of the European Union due to its ability to drastically reduce emissions from methanol and renewable diesel production.

Reducing emissions in the transport sector has become a top priority for the international market, and Repsol’s pioneering Ecoplanta in Tarragona, Catalonia, will need an astonishing €800 million to begin operations, which Repsol is aiming for by 2029 at the very latest. Repsol’s plant will be able to process up to 400,000 tons of municipal solid waste annually, which it will then convert into 240,000 tons of renewable fuels such as diesel and gasoline.

The announcement of the project comes as the European Commission has recently unveiled a new plan to reinforce the EU’s chemical sector, paving the way for significant change in the regional energy market.

Repsol is aiming to become the market leader in clean and renewable fuel production

Repsol’s pioneering €800 million investment in the Tarragona Ecoplanta will completely reshape the downstream market as the world aims to diversify fuel production and reduce emissions from the transport sector overall. With Spain aiming to foster investments in hydrogen as a fuel source, the sentiment for clean fuel production in the nation has become all too clear. Repsol’s already impressive portfolio has positioned the company as a market leader that is not afraid to shake things up in the downstream sector, and add to that the pioneering Tarragona Ecoplanta project, and the future of clean fuel production in Spain is looking good.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/49.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 23:57:47.849652

Chang Liu worked for years as a physicist at the Energy Department’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.","On a leafy campus in eastern China, crews are working day and night to finish a mammoth round structure with two sweeping arms the length of aircraft carriers.

On former rice fields in the country’s southwest, a hulking, X-shaped building is being built with equal urgency under great secrecy. That facility’s existence wasn’t widely known until researchers spotted it in satellite images a year or so ago.

Together, the colossal projects are China’s most ambitious efforts yet to harness an energy source that could transform civilization: fusion.

Fusion, the melding together of atoms to release extraordinary energy, uses fuels that are plentiful, carries no risk of meltdowns and leaves no long-lived radioactive waste. It promises near-limitless energy that might not only satisfy the surging demand for electricity to power artificial intelligence but also end reliance on the fossil fuels that are perilously overheating the planet.

Scientists first mused a century ago about fusion, the energy of the stars. In recent decades, they have made major strides toward reproducing the process in the laboratory using magnets and lasers. Yet forcing unruly atoms to combine is vastly more difficult than splitting them, as in the fission process that produces nuclear power today.

A fusion reactor must first heat hydrogen to temperatures hotter than the sun, turning it into plasma, the fourth state of matter. Then it needs to hold this violent plasma together for long enough that the atoms fuse and disgorge energy. China, the United States and other countries are now racing to develop the machines that can pull all this off and survive to do it again and again, reliably enough to power a grid.

The world’s two superpowers are in a tightening contest to dominate the energy future. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. is intent on producing oil, gas and coal and selling it abroad. Its chief economic rival, China, has become the world’s dominant supplier of clean energy in the form of solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles.

Fusion could change the calculus for both nations and the globe. Whoever conquers it could build plants around the world and forge new alliances with energy-hungry countries. But the Americans and the Chinese have very different strategies for getting there.

The United States is counting on private industry and American innovation to deliver results, with government agencies providing targeted support. From coast to coast, a fleet of start-ups has brought new urgency and ingenuity to the quest.

On the other side of the world, China’s government has made fusion a national priority, marshaling resources at daunting speed. Recently, a Shanghai start-up essentially matched an engineering breakthrough by America’s best-funded fusion company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, in much less time. Over the summer, the Chinese government and private investors poured $2.1 billion into a new state-owned fusion company. That investment alone is two and a half times the U.S. Energy Department’s annual fusion budget.

The two countries’ progress could soon be tested head-to-head.

Commonwealth says that by 2027, the experimental device it is building in Massachusetts will pull off a key feat: producing more energy than it takes to run. That would be a signal that fusion could someday generate electricity for data centers, steel mills and more.

China’s leading plasma-physics lab is aiming for its new machine, which has the modest name of BEST and will sit in the twin-armed building in the country’s east, to cross that milestone in the next few years, too.

“It’s a very tight schedule,” said Lian Hui, a scientist at the lab. Even so, “we are very confident we will be able to achieve BEST’s research goals,” he said.

A National Priority

China’s commitment to science, and fusion, comes from the very top.

The government’s new five-year plan, covering 2026 through 2030, promises “extraordinary measures” to secure breakthroughs in fusion energy and other areas. China’s state-owned nuclear company is preparing detailed fusion research proposals, calling it “the main racetrack in future scientific and technological competition among the great powers.”

The country was a minnow in fusion only two decades ago, and it grew by teaming up with other nations. It worked closely with France to develop its most modern tokamak, a type of doughnut-shaped fusion machine. It became a key contributor to the 33-nation ITER fusion experiment (pronounced “eater”). During much of the past decade, American and Chinese researchers conducted joint experiments and extolled their nations’ “long-term friendship” in plasma physics.

Now, Chinese labs and companies are pouring concrete for cutting-edge research facilities of their own. The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Plasma Physics is building both the new BEST tokamak and a 100-acre complex nearby where researchers will develop and test components to operate under the extreme conditions of a fusion device. Scientists there are also sketching out another tokamak that would power a pilot fusion plant in the 2030s and ’40s.

Richard Pitts, a British-French physicist at ITER, visited the BEST site in January last year, when it was little more than an empty platform. Today, it’s half finished.

China has learned a great deal from being part of ITER, and now it is applying that knowledge to make its own advances, Dr. Pitts said. “Every time I go there, I’m taken aback by the sheer numbers of people and the sheer efficiency with which things get done,” he said.

Even if the core technology works, however, fusion reactors won’t power the world until companies figure out how to build and operate them affordably and at industrial scale.

And on that front, China’s expertise in engineering and construction gives it a distinct advantage, said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior fellow at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. “The risk for the United States is we create a viable technical pathway first, but then China engineers and scales it up before we can,” Mr. Goodrich said.

The Laser Path

In the southwest, another front in China’s fusion ambitions is racing ahead with much less public fanfare.

Scientists at the China Academy of Engineering Physics, in Sichuan Province, studied attentively as their counterparts at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California toiled for years before achieving a tantalizing demonstration of fusion’s potential. In late 2022, the lab’s lasers caused a pellet of hydrogen to “ignite,” meaning the reaction produced more energy than the energy from the lasers.

A senior scientist at China’s academy quickly called for his country to follow suit.

Livermore’s achievement marked “a major scientific breakthrough that will be memorialized in the annals of human history,” Zheng Wanguo said in an interview in early 2023. China, he said, should “strengthen investment and research” in fusion energy, “taking laser fusion ignition as the main technical approach.”

Within a year and a half, an enormous X-shaped facility had arisen outside the city of Mianyang.

Chinese laser industry reports, scientific papers and a patent application suggest the site will house Shenguang IV, a new laser ignition facility. Proposals for such a facility, whose name means “Divine Light,” go back in some form over 15 years. But the Livermore lab’s success seemed to put it on the fast track.

The speed of construction in Mianyang is “breathtaking,” said Livermore’s director, Kimberly Budil, given that it took her lab 20 years to build its ignition facility and get it fully running. Still, “operating that system reliably and effectively over time takes meaningful skills, and these are all lessons China will have to learn along the way,” Dr. Budil said.

Scientists at the China Academy of Engineering Physics have reason for secrecy. Like many at Livermore, they work in nuclear weapons research, and laser fusion offers a way to study the conditions of nuclear explosions without detonating actual weapons.

As China’s nuclear stockpile has grown rapidly under the country’s top leader, Xi Jinping, its military has looked for ways to maintain and perhaps upgrade warheads without violating a global ban on test explosions, experts say.

In recent months, the Academy of Engineering Physics has revealed plans to build another laser ignition facility in Chengdu, Sichuan’s provincial capital — a smaller, more commercial sibling to the one in Mianyang.

And Peng Xianjue, once an anonymous weapons designer, has transformed himself into an energy entrepreneur, promoting his vision of an untested type of reactor that would combine fusion and fission. China, Dr. Peng wrote in a proposal this year, should “aim for commercial application by 2040.”

The reason, according to the department, is that American start-ups are already moving quickly toward erecting such a plant.

To some scientists, the U.S. government needs to do more.

Investors have poured about $14 billion into fusion companies worldwide, with $7.6 billion of that going to American firms. “That’s a lot of money, but it’s going to take a whole lot more of that to get this across the finish line,” said George Tynan, a plasma scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Chang Liu worked for years as a physicist at the Energy Department’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Recently, Dr. Liu tried to recruit some younger scientists for his team, but the lab said it didn’t have the budget, he said. Experiences like this, plus family reasons, led him to move to Peking University, one of China’s best. A Princeton spokeswoman said the lab didn’t comment on personnel matters.

In America, the lack of government support is one reason so many fusion researchers are joining start-ups, Dr. Liu said.

Chinese officials, by contrast, are putting significant resources into a possible “ultimate solution” to humankind’s energy needs, he said. “They can really invest in things that are important,” he said.

“We view current available advanced energy: solar, wind, battery storage as lowhanging fruit,” said Hunter Jones, executive director of the alliance.
DATA CENTER CONCERNS In several communities, Hoosiers have recently voiced concerns about water and electricity usage of data centers.
According to the website Data Center Map, 80 data centers are either already built or in development in Indiana.
Most of data centers’ electricity usage is split between operating and cooling massive IT servers.","ANDERSON — Concerns about rising energy costs and the coming of data centers that guzzle water and electricity are driving legislation in the Indiana General Assembly.

According to data from the Citizens Action Coalition, Hoosiers’ electric bills have risen 17.5% within the past year.

That coupled with Gov. Mike Braun telling the Indianapolis Investment Forum in May that the state doesn’t have enough energy to meet the evergrowing demand for electricity has prompted concern from legislators.

During the 2025 session, which was completed early this year, the General Assembly passed legislation to encourage the use of small modular nuclear reactors, to the dismay of some clean energy advocates.

Representatives of the Indiana Conservative Alliance for Energy said they support the development of SMRs, but they noted that state officials shouldn’t overlook incentivizing alternatives such as wind and solar power. “We view current available advanced energy: solar, wind, battery storage as lowhanging fruit,” said Hunter Jones, executive director of the alliance. “The goal is to get electrons on the grid.” Many communities throughout the state have opposed the siting of wind and solar projects. Roughly 80% of Indiana’s 92 Indiana counties have moratoriums on such projects.

Jones feels the opposition is unwarranted — solar and wind energy would reduce costs in the immediate future, whereas SMRs could take decades of development before economic benefits would arise.

“Education and messaging in those communities (that oppose solar and wind projects) could be a lot better,” Jones said. “A lot of the advancements that have been made in the past decade are not the same solar and wind residents have in their mind.”

He also said the state should look into allowing residents to generate power with plug-in balcony solar panels.

In March, the Utah State Legislature passed a law allowing residents to use such devices to generate up to 1.2 kilowatts, enough to power blenders and other light-use appliances, without obtaining a permit or connecting with a utility. These panels cost less than $2,000.

Sam Carpenter, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, said the panels would pay for themselves within 4-5 years.

Indiana Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, has decided to follow a similar path with Senate Bill 74, which had its first reading Monday.

Plug-in solar panels don’t “need a requirement for utility interconnection, and that’s why they require legislation. The legislation also includes safety standards,” Carpenter said.

State officials could also change how electric bills are calculated.

The Indiana General Assembly’s Utilities Committee recently discussed the possibility of establishing a performance-based electricity pay rate, where a utility would be compensated at a rate based on the reliability and efficiency of the utility and its equipment.

Rates are traditionally calculated based on the utility’s cost of service — in other words, rates are increased or decreased to cover the cost of service.

Jones believes the idea has promise, though Carpenter said there are still too many variables that are unknown.

DATA CENTER CONCERNS

In several communities, Hoosiers have recently voiced concerns about water and electricity usage of data centers. According to the website Data Center Map, 80 data centers are either already built or in development in Indiana.

Most of data centers’ electricity usage is split between operating and cooling massive IT servers.

According to the Hoosier Environmental Council, Amazon’s Northwest Indiana data center project is expected to require 2.2 gigawatts of electricity at peak operating times, enough to power about half of the state’s households.

Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, has authored Senate Bill 79, which would require developers to disclose the amount of water and electricity a data center is expected to use before a permit can be issued.

The bill would also require data centers to report quarterly use of water and electricity to a working group that would include representatives of electricity suppliers, the data center industry, and representatives of the regional transmission organization in Indiana.

The working group would attempt to forecast the data center industry’s future in the state and submit its findings to the director of the state’s legislative services agency no later than Oct. 26, 2026.

A large data center could use at least five million gallons of water per day, the equivalent needed to serve a population of 50,000 people.

The River Ridge Commerce Center in Jeffersonville will house a Meta data center. Its power plant could treat up to 12 million gallons of water a day, the organization’s chief director, Wendy Dant Chesser, said in a Jeffersonville News and Tribune article.

The Meta data center is expected to be operational in 2026.

Such high volumes of need could strain existing water utilities, so Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville, is hoping fellow legislators will take action to protect Indiana’s water resources by passing House Bill 1043.

The legislation would require that developers obtain a water consumption permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources before establishing a data center.

Burton is also concerned about the quality of the water discharged by data centers.

“The goal is to make sure our water remains safe, drinkable. ... It’s important that if water is to leave the data center, that it’s safe,” he said.

Joint ventures are often the only way to progress projects towards realization

Joint ventures serve an important purpose across the global energy market. Companies may struggle with certain aspects of a project, and often opt to bring on board other substantially large energy companies to progress operations towards actual, on-the-ground commissioning. With the increased output expected in the US market due to the new focus from the federal government, 2026 is looking good for the US energy market.

The Blackcomb Pipeline project was specifically designed to transport up to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day through an astonishing estimated 365 miles of 42-inch pipeline that will run from the Permian basin to processing facilities in South Texas. The supply of gas that will run through the Blackcomb Pipeline will be sourced from several operations in the Permian Basin.

Targa Resources

The WPC joint venture will bring invaluable assets to the project, as it has significant long-haul natural gas pipelines that regularly transport natural gas from the Permian basin to processing facilities in Texas. The WPC joint venture owns and operates several pipelines and processing sites in the Permian basin, including but not limited to:

Whistler Pipeline

Rio Bravo Pipeline

70% of the Blackcomb Pipeline

70% of the ADCC Pipeline

50% of the Waha Gas Storage facility

Targa Resources, which forms part of the WPC joint venture, has been developing its plans to build a new 500-mile ‘Speedway’ pipeline in the Permian, exemplifying the substantial assets it brings to the Blackcomb pipeline project. Joint ventures are often the only method to develop energy infrastructure needed to advance projects beyond the planning phase.

The Blackcomb Pipeline project still has a few regulatory barriers to navigate

While the new joint venture will progress the project to reach a final investment decision in the new year, the project is yet to receive the approval of regulators, but expectations are that the process will run smoothly over the coming months as it targets a 2026 operational commencement. The Permian Basin has long been the cornerstone of the US gas market, and over the years, it has attracted interest from some of the largest energy companies in the world, such as the Eiger Express Pipeline, which is also being developed by WhiteWater and its associates.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/48.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 19:58:26.182663

Guy HedgecoeAragón, north-eastern Spain

On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby.

It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms.

Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles.

Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as ""one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen"".

Luis Bertol Moreno, mayor of the town, says the area was a logical choice for the project.

""We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels,"" he says.

""Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas.""

The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%.

By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel ""Dig, baby, dig"" slogan. ""Green, baby, green,"" said the Socialist, as he pointed to the benefits of renewable energy.

However, in recent months, Spain's all-in commitment to renewables has come under scrutiny. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours.

With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of ""fanaticism"" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident.

Feijóo and others on the right advocated a rethink of the national energy model.

The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims.

Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain.

""We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system,"" says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. ""Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment.""

Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an ""unknown event"" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations.

However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. A cyber-attack has repeatedly been ruled out.

Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads.

Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035.

With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. That request is currently under consideration.

Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible with the green energy transition.

""It's prudent to have a mix of renewables and nuclear energy,"" he says.

Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable.

""How can you produce energy in those hours when the renewables are not producing?"" he asks. The answer, he added, is ""with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year"".

The political opposition is staunchly opposed to the nuclear shut-down. The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as ""a crucial source of stability"".

Ms Sánchez acknowledges that there is room for improvement for Spain's electricity model, pointing to the Iberian peninsula's relative isolation from the European grid compared to most of its EU neighbours. She also sees storage as an issue.

""While we have taken a good path when it comes to renewable installation, we cannot say the same regarding storage,"" she says. ""We need to foster storage installation.""

Spain's political panorama adds an element of uncertainty to its energy future. The Socialist-led coalition has been mired in corruption scandals and its parliamentary majority appears to have collapsed in recent weeks, raising the possibility of a snap election in the coming months.

A right-wing government, which polls suggest would be the likely outcome, would almost certainly place less emphasis on renewables and advocate a partial return to more traditional energy sources.

But in the meantime, Spain's renewable transition continues.

And for Figueruelas, in Aragón, that means not just cheap, clean energy, but investment. The town's population, of just 1,000, is due to increase dramatically, with 2,000 Chinese workers scheduled to arrive to help build the new battery plant, which is expected to create up to 35,000 indirect jobs once it starts operating.

""These kinds of investments revitalise the area, they revitalise the construction sector, hostelry,"" says local man Manuel Martín. ""And the energy is free – it just depends on the sun and the wind.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d24e/live/3992fd80-d72d-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 19:58:13.929862

Outpost, with an installed capacity of 629 MW, began commercial operation this August and benefits from a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA), reinforcing its attractiveness to investors.

This marks Repsol's second asset rotation in the United States, and the multi-energy company continues to optimise the financial structure of its renewable business by bringing in strategic partners to maximise value creation.

This transaction also represents the second collaboration between Repsol and Stonepeak in the U.S. renewables market. In July this year, the two companies closed a similar transaction that included Stonepeak's acquisition of a stake in the Frye solar farm (632 MW) in Texas and the Jicarilla solar and storage complex (145 MW) in New Mexico.

The transaction is expected to close in the coming months, subject to standard regulatory approvals.

João Costeira, Executive Managing Director of Low Carbon Generation at Repsol, said: 'Rejoining forces with Stonepeak, a major investor that continues to place its trust in the quality of our renewable assets in the United States, allows us to advance our growth strategy in this country, where we already have more than 2,800 MW in operation and under construction in solar and storage projects'.

“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers.
The previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023.
The ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.","The Conservatives have announced proposals to end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars and cut the legal requirement on car manufacturers to sell electric vehicles.

A Conservative government would abolish the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, ending the legal requirement for manufacturers to sell a fixed rising percentage of zero-emission vehicles each year – 80% of new cars and 70% of new vans by 2030, increasing to 100% by 2035. It would also completely end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.

A future Conservative government would also scrap all of the non-research and development subsidies associated with the ZEV mandate to “relieve manufacturers of more costly regulatory obligations”, which the party estimates would save £3.8bn over the next decade. Ministers would retain infrastructure funding to continue developing the electric vehicle market.

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said: “Labour’s rush to net zero is having a disastrous effect on the UK car industry. The Conservatives will ensure that we protect the environment, but we will do so without forcing families to bear the brunt of the costs, and forcing carmakers to meet deadlines that don’t reflect consumer demand.

“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers. Britain succeeds when we back business and support innovation – that’s our plan for a stronger economy.”

Writing in the Telegraph, Badenoch said she was inspired by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her “commonsense approach to net zero”, which required that “any push to tackle carbon emissions must not degrade Italy’s economy”.

The previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023. However, Labour reinstated the ban and will require every new car to be zero-emission by 2035, on the grounds that the timeline will provide certainty to manufacturers and consumers.

The ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.

Doug Parr, the Greenpeace UK policy director, said: “Nothing the Tories suggest is likely to take effect before 2029, one year from when the ban takes effect. A U-turn now would create chaos after years of preparation for electric cars, wasting effort, risking jobs and leaving Britain stuck in reverse while the rest of the world accelerates towards cleaner, cheaper cars.

“If ever a political party wanted to sow confusion and uncertainty into one of Britain’s most important manufacturing industries, this is how you do it. It’s the opposite of what’s needed to cut pollution, lower running costs for drivers and secure long term jobs.

“Chinese electric vehicles will soon be better and cheaper than anything coming out of Europe or the UK. A phaseout date to incentivise UK manufacturing has to be part of the response. Scrapping rules would be a total disaster. It would undermine investment and leave manufacturers facing uncertainty in a rapidly changing global market. The Tories introduced this policy, and they should leave well alone.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7ef80140263da04bbc24032051f8c8cb01cde42/681_0_6830_5464/master/6830.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a43018e4805e251f511e56cf2db8c35",N,,2025-12-14 17:57:57.452539

As of September, electricity prices were up 5.1 percent relative to 12 months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In January, electricity prices were up 1.9 percent from the previous year.

Overall inflation in September hit 3 percent, the same as in January, according to the BLS.

The increase in electricity prices peaked at 15.8 percent in August 2022 amid global energy shortages stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Increases in electricity demand, particularly during extreme weather events, also drive up utility bills nationwide.

The price of other utilities, such as natural gas, regular gasoline, and heating oil, is expected to be 1 percent higher, 23 percent lower, and 32 percent lower next year relative to 2022, the EIA notes.

Wright, though, said that DOE is “doing everything we can to stop that rise in electricity prices.” The department, at the direction of President Trump, has prioritized slashing regulations on energy companies and cutting funding for green energy projects.

Department officials describe the vehicle as a pilot, not a fleet conversion. The EV is primarily used for urban patrol, traffic enforcement, and administrative duties, allowing officers and city staff to assess real-world performance, operating costs, charging needs, and officer usability.

AAPD leaders emphasize that the single EV does not replace traditional cruisers and is not intended for every policing scenario. High-speed pursuits, long shifts, and operations without reliable access to charging infrastructure remain better suited to gasoline-powered vehicles.

Still, the department says the pilot aligns with Ann Arbor’s broader sustainability goals while offering a practical way to test whether electric patrol vehicles can reduce fuel and maintenance costs over time. Quieter operation has also proven useful in residential neighborhoods and community-policing situations.

Ann Arbor’s limited experiment reflects a measured approach shared by other Michigan police departments.

The Michigan State Police has evaluated electric vehicles for administrative and support roles rather than frontline patrol. Departments in Dearborn, Royal Oak, and other metro Detroit communities have explored or tested EVs for specific functions, often focusing on traffic enforcement, command vehicles, or short-range urban patrols.

Across Michigan, police agencies cite similar factors driving interest: rising fuel costs, long-term maintenance savings, and access to state and federal fleet-electrification incentives. At the same time, departments remain wary of range limitations, winter performance, charging availability, and pursuit capability—especially in rural or high-demand environments.

As a result, most agencies view EVs as situational tools rather than full patrol replacements.

For now, Ann Arbor’s single electric patrol vehicle serves as a test case, offering data and experience rather than a declaration of a full transition.

In the closing weeks of 2025, Tesla Inc. is unleashing a barrage of incentives designed to turbocharge vehicle sales, a move that underscores the company’s aggressive push to clear inventory and maintain momentum amid fluctuating market dynamics. With offers including free premium upgrades on select inventory models, zero-percent APR financing for up to 72 months on the Model Y Standard Range, and zero-down lease options, Tesla is effectively lowering the barrier to entry for potential buyers. This strategy comes at a pivotal moment, as the expiration of federal tax credits earlier in the year has dampened demand, prompting the automaker to pull every lever to stimulate purchases before the calendar flips.

Industry analysts note that these promotions are not merely discounts but a calculated effort to bolster quarterly delivery numbers, which have shown signs of softening. According to recent data, Tesla’s U.S. sales dipped to under 40,000 units in November 2025, marking the lowest figure in years, as reported by Electrek. This decline follows the phase-out of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which had previously buoyed affordability for models like the Model 3 and Model Y. In response, Tesla has layered on incentives that could save buyers thousands, effectively replicating some of the lost tax benefits through direct rebates and financing perks.

The free upgrade program, in particular, stands out as a novel tactic. Eligible buyers selecting from Tesla’s inventory can receive one complimentary premium feature—such as enhanced wheel designs, interior color upgrades, or even towing packages—without additional cost. This offer applies to on-site inventory only and is available while supplies last, adding an element of urgency to the promotion. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from users like Tesla enthusiasts highlight the buzz, with many sharing how these deals are tipping the scales for on-the-fence consumers.

Decoding the Incentive Arsenal

Tesla’s current lineup of promotions extends beyond upgrades to include highly competitive financing. For the Model Y Standard Range, buyers can secure 0% APR for 72 months, a rate that’s virtually unheard of in the automotive sector and could translate to savings of over $5,000 in interest compared to standard loans. Additionally, zero-down leases for models like the Model 3 and Model Y start at $299 per month, making electric vehicle ownership more accessible to a broader demographic. These deals are detailed on Tesla’s official site, but third-party analyses, such as those from Not a Tesla App, emphasize their role in closing out the year strong.

This incentive blitz is part of a broader pattern for Tesla, which has historically ramped up promotions in the fourth quarter to maximize deliveries. In 2025, the urgency is amplified by external pressures, including increased competition from legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors, who are rolling out their own EV models with competitive pricing. Tesla’s approach contrasts with rivals by focusing on immediate value-adds rather than long-term warranties, a strategy that aligns with CEO Elon Musk’s emphasis on rapid iteration and customer satisfaction through software and hardware perks.

Moreover, state and local incentives continue to play a supporting role. As outlined in Tesla’s support resources via Tesla Support, buyers in regions like California or New York can stack additional rebates on top of Tesla’s offers, potentially amplifying savings to $10,000 or more. This patchwork of incentives creates a complex but rewarding environment for savvy shoppers, though it requires careful navigation of eligibility criteria, such as income limits or vehicle qualifications.

Market Pressures and Strategic Shifts

The timing of these promotions coincides with Tesla’s efforts to rebound from a challenging year. Sales data indicates a slowdown in EV adoption rates, attributed to factors like higher interest rates and consumer hesitation over charging infrastructure. Tesla’s response has been multifaceted, including not just price cuts but also enhancements to its product ecosystem. For instance, the inclusion of three months of free Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability and Supercharging with certain purchases adds intangible value, appealing to tech-savvy buyers who prioritize autonomous features.

Comparisons to previous years reveal an escalation in aggressiveness. In 2024, Tesla offered 1.99% financing and free FSD transfers, but the 2025 deals go further with zero-interest options and complimentary upgrades, as chronicled in updates from X posts by influencers tracking the company’s moves. This evolution suggests Tesla is adapting to a maturing market where differentiation through incentives is key to retaining market share, which currently hovers around 50% of the U.S. EV segment.

Critics within the industry argue that such heavy reliance on promotions could erode profit margins, a concern echoed in financial analyses. Tesla’s stock has experienced volatility, with shares dipping amid reports of inventory buildup. Yet, proponents counter that these short-term tactics fuel long-term loyalty, as satisfied customers often become repeat buyers or advocates for the brand’s ecosystem, including solar products and home energy storage.

Consumer Perspectives and Real-World Impacts

From a buyer’s standpoint, these incentives are transforming the purchasing process. Take the Model Y, Tesla’s bestseller: with the free upgrade and zero-percent financing, the effective cost drops significantly, making it competitive against gas-powered SUVs in the same price bracket. Anecdotal evidence from X discussions shows users calculating total ownership costs, factoring in fuel savings and maintenance reductions, which further tip the scales in Tesla’s favor.

Dealership experiences, or rather Tesla’s direct-to-consumer model, enhance this appeal. Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla’s online configurator allows real-time customization, with incentives automatically applied. This streamlined approach, combined with rapid delivery timelines—often within days for inventory vehicles—creates a sense of immediacy that’s rare in the industry.

However, not all feedback is glowing. Some potential buyers express frustration over limited inventory for upgraded models, leading to quick sell-outs in high-demand areas. Additionally, the expiration date of December 31, 2025, for most promotions adds pressure, potentially rushing decisions that could benefit from more deliberation.

Broader Implications for the EV Sector

Tesla’s moves are rippling through the electric vehicle domain, pressuring competitors to match or exceed these offers. For example, companies like Rivian and Lucid have introduced their own discounts, though none yet rival Tesla’s zero-interest financing. This competitive dynamic is fostering innovation, with a focus on affordability to counter perceptions that EVs remain a luxury item.

On the regulatory front, the absence of federal tax credits has shifted the onus to manufacturers like Tesla to bridge the gap. Industry insiders speculate that if sales rebound strongly in Q4, it could influence policy discussions in 2026, potentially advocating for reinstated incentives to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation.

Economically, these promotions are injecting vitality into related sectors, from battery suppliers to charging network providers. Tesla’s Supercharger network, bolstered by free access perks, continues to expand, with over 60,000 stalls globally, reinforcing the company’s dominance in infrastructure.

Innovation Amid Incentives

Looking deeper, Tesla’s strategy intertwines hardware incentives with software advancements. The free FSD trials included in some packages serve as a gateway to subscriptions, where users pay monthly for ongoing updates. This model not only generates recurring revenue but also collects valuable data to refine autonomous driving algorithms, a core pillar of Tesla’s valuation.

Comparisons to tech giants like Apple reveal parallels: just as iPhone upgrades drive ecosystem loyalty, Tesla’s vehicle incentives encourage adoption of add-ons like Powerwall or solar panels. Recent promotions for energy products, as noted in Not a Tesla App‘s overview, bundle vehicle purchases with home energy discounts, creating a holistic value proposition.

Yet, challenges persist. Supply chain constraints, particularly for premium features like advanced batteries, could limit the scalability of free upgrades. Analysts project that if Tesla achieves its delivery targets—potentially exceeding 500,000 units globally in Q4—these incentives will have proven their worth, setting a precedent for future campaigns.

Forecasting the Road Ahead

As 2025 draws to a close, Tesla’s incentive-driven push is a testament to its adaptive prowess. By offering tangible savings and exclusive perks, the company is not just selling cars but cultivating a community of electric vehicle advocates. This approach may well redefine year-end sales tactics across the automotive industry.

For industry observers, the key metric will be delivery figures released in early 2026. If successful, these promotions could stabilize Tesla’s growth trajectory, mitigating the tax credit void. Conversely, underwhelming results might prompt further innovations, such as expanded model variants or international expansions.

Ultimately, Tesla’s current playbook highlights a blend of financial ingenuity and customer-centric design, positioning the company to navigate an increasingly crowded field. Buyers capitalizing on these deals today may find themselves at the forefront of an electric revolution that’s accelerating faster than ever.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3849-1765747879.jpeg,N,,2025-12-14 17:57:49.518053

That means T1 has almost the entire supply chain associated with solar manufacturing and will soon support about 6,000 American jobs.
The simple truth is that T1’s solar manufacturing is American manufacturing.","OPINION:

Michael Kinsley, the great liberal writer and commentator, once noted that some people are always looking for heretics while others are always looking for converts. That trenchant observation may be applicable to a situation in Texas.

There, an American company based in Austin is trying to bring solar manufacturing back to the United States after what has been a generation-long effort on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to destroy that manufacturing capacity in the United States. The company, T1 Energy, owns and operates one of the world’s most advanced solar module facilities in Wilmer, Texas, where it will produce about 3 gigawatts of solar modules this year.

That’s pretty good for an outfit that changed its name last year when the company, then called Freyr Battery, bought a Wilmer factory and various other things from Trina Solar, unfortunately part of the sprawling network of companies owned or controlled by members of the communist regime in Beijing. Soon after the sale, the company changed its name to T1 and made clear it intended to grow and become an integrated solar and battery storage leader owned and operated by Americans.

The company supports tariffs directed at Chinese predatory behavior, including the Section 232 investigation of China’s activities related to solar manufacturing by the Department of Commerce. More important, T1 announced a deal in August with Corning to be a foundational customer for that company’s new ingot/wafer manufacturing facility. That means T1 has almost the entire supply chain associated with solar manufacturing and will soon support about 6,000 American jobs.

Here’s the tricky part: Trina Solar still owns about 20% of the company, according to reports, allowing it a minimum of two board members. That’s important in large measure because federal tax credits require companies to avoid relying on “foreign entities of concern” (a diplomatic way of saying the Chinese Communist Party) for their supply chains. That makes sense; there is no point in strengthening an already powerful and probably hostile adversary.

With all that said, it seems this is one of those cases in which the new crew is trying to fix a problem it inherited. It bought the company and its assets from Chinese owners. Are there still unappetizing people on the board? There sure are, but they own only 20% of the company, which means the good guys own 80%, and you have to think the Texans will solve that problem eventually.

President Reagan used to routinely and correctly note: “The person who agrees with you 80% of the time is a friend and an ally, not a 20% traitor.” That seems like useful context in this case. Whatever future there is for solar manufacturing in this country, it’s going to look like T1 Energy: technologically skilled, practical in business deals, and careful about the generosity and limits of government policies.

The simple truth is that T1’s solar manufacturing is American manufacturing. As CEO Dan Barcelo recently said when he met with Vice President J.D. Vance, “We are investing in energy from America, for America and by Americans … to build a domestic solar supply chain that is scalable, reliable and low cost.”

Electricity and computing power are now the building blocks of national strength. Mr. Barcelo’s company is helping ensure that we have the American energy we need to meet Team Trump’s energy goals and maintain American supremacy in the existential race to master artificial intelligence and command the economic and technological heights for the remainder of this century.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted the company a new patent for an electric vehicle (EV) battery thermal-runaway suppression system, filed on May 28, 2024, and granted on December 4, 2025.

In plain English, this is a built-in emergency fire-suppression system inside the battery pack itself, designed to react when a battery cell starts to fail and heat up uncontrollably. Instead of waiting for that heat to turn into a full-blown fire, the system is designed to attack the problem immediately with a specialized foam mixture.

For future Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep®, FIAT, and Ram EVs and range-extending electric vehicles (REEVs), this kind of tech could become a major selling point—especially for customers still uneasy about EV battery fires.

What Problem Is Stellantis Solving? –

Most modern EVs use lithium-ion or lithium-metal battery cells. Under normal use, they’re safe and efficient. But in a failure scenario—like physical damage, internal short circuits, or severe overheating—one or more cells can enter thermal runaway.

When that happens, the cell temperature rises rapidly, gases are released (some of which are flammable), and heat can spread to neighboring cells. If those gases ignite, you’ve got a battery fire that can be extremely difficult to contain. Fire departments often have to flood battery packs with thousands of gallons of water just to cool them down enough to stop the reaction.

Stellantis’ new system is designed to catch that process early and smother it from the inside, using the battery pack’s own cooling system plus a dedicated fire-retardant supply.

How The System Is Built Inside The Pack –

The patent describes a battery pack that still looks familiar on the outside: a rigid metal housing, rows of battery cells, a cooling system with coolant lines and heat sinks, and pressure vents. The extra technology is layered in around those components.

The key added pieces are:

A bladder filled with a fire-retardant chemical

This bladder is located close to the battery cells, typically between the cells and the top of the pack. It’s made from a flexible polymer, so it can be punctured when needed.

Two sets of blades

– First blades: aimed at the bladder, ready to pierce it and release the fire-retardant chemical.

– Second blades: aimed at specific points on the coolant inlet line, outlet line, or heat sinks to rupture them and release coolant directly into the pack.

Special coolant line sections

The cooling lines and/or heat sinks are built or modified with small sealed apertures—closed off with a soft plug material. These plugs are easy for the blades to pierce but strong enough to hold pressure in normal operation.

Actuation devices tied to a controller

Electric or solenoid-style actuators push the blades into the bladder and coolant components when commanded by the vehicle’s controller.

The system is integrated into the existing battery thermal management system, which already circulates coolant (typically a water/glycol mix) through heat sinks under or around the cells to manage normal operating temperatures.

How It Works In Real-World Terms –

Think of this as an innovative fire-suppression system that lives inside the pack and only triggers when it senses serious trouble.

Continuous Monitoring

Temperature sensors inside the pack monitor battery temperatures. There can be one sensor per module, or even per cell, depending on the design. These send signals to a controller that constantly evaluates whether temperatures are within safe limits.

Detecting Thermal Runaway Conditions

If the controller detects temperatures rising into a zone that indicates a thermal runaway event is occurring or about to occur, it switches from normal cooling to emergency mode.

Triggering The Blades

The controller commands the actuators:

The first blades puncture the fire-retardant bladder.

The second blades pierce the plug-filled apertures in the coolant line(s) or heat sink(s), opening them up.

Creating Fire-Retardant Foam

As the bladder empties, fire-retardant chemical spills into the battery compartment. At the same time, coolant escapes the opened ports under pump pressure. When the two fluids mix, they form a foam specifically formulated to:

Absorb heat

Smother hot surfaces

Help prevent flammable gases from igniting

Extinguish any flames if they’ve already started

Boosting Coolant Flow

The controller can also tell the coolant pumps to speed up, forcing more coolant into the ruptured areas, increasing the volume of foam generated, and helping spread it more quickly throughout the cells.

Managing Internal Pressure

The battery housing has vents with valves that can open if pressure builds up from gas generation during thermal runaway. The patent even suggests pulsing these valves—relieving pressure while keeping as much foam as possible inside the pack to continue suppressing the event.

Why This Matters For Future Mopar EVs And REEVs –

This isn’t just an engineering flex; it’s the kind of system that can directly affect customer confidence and real-world safety for upcoming Stellantis products.

Safer EVs For Everyday Owners

For someone buying a future Dodge Charger Daytona EV, a Jeep® Recon EV, a Chrysler crossover EV, a Ram pickup with a large battery pack, or a FIAT city car, the big question is simple: What happens if something goes wrong?

A system like this gives Stellantis a concrete answer: the vehicle is designed to fight its own battery fire from the insidebefore it becomes catastrophic.

Better Packaging And Potential Weight Optimization

If Stellantis can prove this system is effective, it may allow engineers to optimize how much passive fire protection is needed. That could, over time:

Reduce the amount of heavy shielding

Free up space inside the pack

Improve vehicle efficiency and potentially range

You’re not just making the pack safer—you’re also giving engineers another tool to balance safety, weight, and performance.

Strategic Move For Stellantis In The EV Space –

Patents don’t guarantee production, but this one checks a lot of boxes: it uses familiar components, integrates with existing cooling systems, and leverages proven fire-retardant chemistry. It feels less like a wild concept and more like a production-ready architecture that could roll out with upcoming platforms.

As Stellantis ramps up its electrified roadmap for North America, this battery thermal-runaway suppression system could become one of those “under the skin” features that helps set Mopar EVs and REEVs apart—especially in a marketplace where headlines about EV fires still grab attention.

If implemented, it would give future Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep®, FIAT, and Ram electric vehicles a serious technical talking point: not just fast, capable, or efficient—but smarter and safer when it matters most.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/photo-output.png,N,,2025-12-14 15:58:41.832844
,American Energy,2025-12-14 20:01:00+00:00,LI Press,Op-Ed: Offshore wind is the best energy solution - LI Press,"Long Island Press, George Povall",,,,,https://www.longislandpress.com/2025/12/14/op-ed-offshore-wind-is-the-best-energy-solution/,"Right now, there’s one ready-to-go solution we can’t afford to miss: offshore wind.
And with Long Island’s abundant wind resource, more offshore wind means expensive gas plants don’t have to turn on as often — keeping overall energy prices stable.
Offshore wind’s fixed price delivers cost savings for those of us using that power, compared to scenarios without offshore wind.
Our first operational offshore wind farm is a great example of the rewards moving to renewable energy can give us.
With the upcoming cold season, AI and data center explosion, and ongoing rise in energy prices, now is the time for proven solutions like offshore wind.","The answer is simple supply and demand: to bring prices down and keep up with energy demand, we need to bring more energy supply online and invest in the infrastructure we need to deliver it. New versions of traditional energy generation will need years to come online. Right now, there’s one ready-to-go solution we can’t afford to miss: offshore wind.

Offshore wind is the most readily available resource to meet demand and keep prices stable. This is our best bet to address both the energy affordability crisis and the climate crisis at the same time. Big utility companies don’t own what drives wind turbines; wind is free. And with Long Island’s abundant wind resource, more offshore wind means expensive gas plants don’t have to turn on as often — keeping overall energy prices stable.

The benefits don’t end there. Offshore wind’s fixed price delivers cost savings for those of us using that power, compared to scenarios without offshore wind. Especially those that involve the ever-volatile cost of traditional energy. In fact, if New York’s three planned offshore wind projects had been operational in 2022, we could have saved ratepayers $77M in a single month.

Our first operational offshore wind farm is a great example of the rewards moving to renewable energy can give us. Last year, the South Fork Wind Farm produced electricity 92% of the time, consistently delivering power to 70,000 homes. The data shows South Fork produces energy steadily during the day and peaks in the evening — right when we start to power everything up after work, school, and dinners.

It also helped during times when we needed energy the most. When New York was facing an energy emergency during last summer’s heatwave, South Fork delivered power at close to its maximum potential, helping us avoid blackouts. This is just a preview of what we can expect from other wind farms, Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind — if they are allowed to continue.

New York needs to stop looking to the failed energy of the past. With the upcoming cold season, AI and data center explosion, and ongoing rise in energy prices, now is the time for proven solutions like offshore wind.

In the Senate, Republican Senator Ashley Moody announced she was introducing the American Shores Protection Act to prohibit oil drilling and natural gas exploration and development near Florida’s coastline.","A bipartisan bill to protect Florida’s coastline and prevent offshore oil drilling was introduced in Congress.

Florida Congressman John H. Rutherford introduced H.R. 6068, the Preserving Recreation, Oceans, Tourism, Environment, and Coastal Towns in (PROTECT) Florida Act, to prevent drilling off Florida’s coast. This bipartisan legislation codifies President Trump’s moratorium on oil and gas leasing, seismic testing, and exploration in federal waters off the coast of Florida until 2032.

“Florida’s coastal environment is a central part of our state’s economy and way of life,” said Rep. John Rutherford. “Floridians have spoken, and they do not want drilling off their coast. That is why I am proud to introduce the PROTECT Florida Act with my colleagues from Florida. This commonsense, bipartisan bill will ensure our environment is preserved for generations to come.”

This bipartisan legislation with support from members of Congress all over Florida comes after the Department of the Interior announced a Secretary’s Order titled “Unleashing American Offshore Energy,” directing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to take the necessary steps, in accordance with federal law, to terminate the restrictive Biden 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program and replace it with a new, expansive 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program by October 2026.

Rutherford was joined by Representatives Jimmy Patronis, Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez, Daniel Webster, Lois Frankel, Gus Bilirakis, Byron Donalds, Maria Salazar, Anna Paulina Luna, Mike Haridopolis, Scott Franklin, Darren Soto, Laurel Lee, Neal Dunn, and Vern Buchanan in the U.S. House.

Florida’s economy relies on healthy and pristine beaches. According to NOAA, Florida’s coastal economy contributes approximately $760 billion to our nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) through tourism, fishing, and recreation.

The PROTECT Florida Act codifies protections for Florida’s coastline against offshore drilling guaranteed in President Donald Trump’s 2020 executive order. It extends the GOMESA protections in the Eastern Gulf and creates a new moratorium for Florida’s Atlantic Coast and the Straits of Florida through 2032.

In the Senate, Republican Senator Ashley Moody announced she was introducing the American Shores Protection Act to prohibit oil drilling and natural gas exploration and development near Florida’s coastline. This legislation would extend the drilling moratorium, which includes the shores of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, from 2022 to 2032, and would codify President Trump’s September 2020 executive action that protects Sunshine State beaches.",https://westorlandonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Floridacoastline1.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 14:59:47.423738

A new color of hydrogen has been created by Korean scientists, using only oxygen, water, and electricity.
In fact, Korean scientists have created a new color of hydrogen.
A new color of hydrogen has been created Hydrogen comes in various colors, including the turquoise hydrogen that Europe desperately wants for methanol production.
Korean scientists have fortunately created something that could lead to a new color of hydrogen.","This year is rapidly coming to an end, which means we are one year closer to the 2050 net-zero deadline. Presently, the global carbon footprint is high, and carbon emission levels are at an all-time high. Fortunately, nations are working hard to address the issue. A new color of hydrogen has been created by Korean scientists, using only oxygen, water, and electricity. The new method is a breakthrough in renewable energy and has showcased remarkable results.

Hydrogen has become highly in demand, especially for certain colors

The world is working hard to keep its overall carbon footprint as low as possible. Whether at home or at work, the world is focused on going greener. Unfortunately, we still face significant challenges in our greener, low-carbon pursuit, including, but not limited to:

Difficulty in decarbonizing certain industries, such as heavy industry and transport

Excess energy storage and transport difficulty

One element that could address some of these challenges is hydrogen. According to a report by the Environmental Defense Fund, some of the main reasons why hydrogen has increased in popularity include:

Ability to store excess renewable energy long-term

Complementary fuel to battery-electric vehicles

Grid flexibility capabilities

Ability to decarbonize carbon-heavy industries

Improved energy security

Does not emit carbon when burned

However, not all hydrogen types are environmentally friendly, and hydrogen’s color determines how truly eco-friendly it is. Yes, we realise hydrogen is essentially colorless, but the color we are referring to is the method that was used to produce it. In fact, Korean scientists have created a new color of hydrogen.

A new color of hydrogen has been created

Hydrogen comes in various colors, including the turquoise hydrogen that Europe desperately wants for methanol production. Hydrogen can have either a high or low carbon footprint depending on the method used to produce it. A color is assigned to the particular process to represent its carbon footprint, for example:

Brown or Black Hydrogen

Gasification is used to create hydrogen from brown or black coal

Extremely carbon-intensive

Green hydrogen

Water electrolysis is used to create hydrogen

Process is powered by renewable energy sources such as wind power

While green hydrogen is the holy grail, it is still expensive to produce, and the production process is slow. Korean scientists have fortunately created something that could lead to a new color of hydrogen. Find out more below.

Korean scientists just needed this to create it

A research team that consists of Dr. Sung Jong Yoo of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Professor Chan Woo Lee of Kookmin University, and led by Professor Jin Young Kim from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Seoul National University’s College of Engineering, has created a new and improved electrochemical catalyst to replace platinum in electrolysis.

Platinum is a costly, precious metal that is used as a catalyst in hydrogen electrolysis. Unfortunately, it also degrades quickly. The newly engineered catalyst is more cost-effective and has showcased higher efficiency and stability, making it a feasible alternative for commercial applications. It consists of a small number of precious metals and comprises a ruthenium-based nanocluster and a core-shell structure.

The core-shell nanocluster catalyst can potentially be used in the following applications:

Industrial applications

Hydrogen power plants

Environmentally-friendly transportation systems

Hydrogen fuel cells for cars

So, by just using oxygen, water, and electricity, and the new catalyst, of course, we could end up with hydrogen that is even ‘greener’ than green hydrogen. However, further development will still be necessary before the new core-shell nanocluster catalyst will be commercially available, and only time will tell how soon that will be. In other hydrogen news, South Korea has opened new 2025 tenders to expand its hydrogen-based power production capacity. Korea sure isn’t playing around!

Tokyo Gas is committing over $1 billion to the US gas and LNG market over the next three years—marking a major play to grow beyond its home turf in Japan.

What does this mean?

Japan’s top city gas provider is eyeing North America for expansion, driven by growing demand for natural gas in sectors like data centers and semiconductor manufacturing. Global enthusiasm for LNG remains strong, which backs Tokyo Gas’s bold strategy. After acquiring Rockcliff Energy last year, the firm recently grabbed a 70% stake in East Texas gas assets from Chevron, aiming to boost returns by ramping up US operations. The company is keen on possible deals involving liquefaction plants or new gas supply contracts, depending on how the market evolves. Meanwhile, Tokyo Gas is treading tricky waters back home, as it relies on Russian LNG under a US sanctions waiver that’s set to expire soon—a situation shaped by geopolitics and government policy.

Why should I care?

For markets: US energy assets are drawing global capital.

Tokyo Gas’s aggressive US expansion signals strong global investor confidence in American natural gas and LNG, especially as worldwide energy demand rises. The company’s latest moves—and its billion-dollar-plus commitment—highlight a long-term outlook for natural gas, even as clean energy talk picks up steam. This ongoing investment could mean more foreign capital flowing into US energy, fresh competition for homegrown firms, and active development in top gas regions.

The bigger picture: Global energy security hinges on diversification.

Tokyo Gas’s strategy spotlights how energy giants are shoring up their supply chains amid geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties. Last year, the company sourced nearly half its 11.56 million metric tons of LNG from Australia, while still relying on sanctioned Russian projects for a significant slice. By snapping up US assets and spreading risks across regions, the firm’s adapting to a world where energy security depends on smart strategy, not just resources in the ground.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L4N3XH1LH_1901071635.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=169ba2e822c103518386be414eec32c6,N,,2025-12-14 15:58:51.078170

Japan Quits Its Vietnam Nuclear Project

Diablo Canyon Agrees to Coastal Commission Land Use Plan

Environmental Groups and others opposed to the reopening of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant thought they’d latched on to a sure thing when the California Coastal Commission told Pacific Gas & Electric (PGE) that the Diablo Canyon Plant needed to set aside 4.000 acres of its site to prevent future development for residential or commercial use.

The outcome of the decision would determine whether the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission would proceed with granting 20-year extensions of the licenses of the two 1,100 MW nuclear reactors at the plant.

PG&E filed its license renewal application with the NRC in November 2023 and the NRC accepted the application for a full review in December 2023. The utility intends to keep Diablo Canyon running until 2045. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to approve the plant’s license renewal application in the first quarter of 2026.

The NRC’s approval depends on PG&E clearing two hurdles in California. The first is a land use plan that needs to be approved by the California Coastal Commission. The second is a certification from California Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board that the reactor site is in compliance with its water quality permit. The plant’s once through cooling system discharges the water back into the Pacific Ocean.

The NRC’s safety evaluation report issued in June 2025 concluded that operator Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) can continue to manage the site safely and within federal regulations. The report’s conclusions followed extensive technical reviews, audits, inspections, and public consultations.

First Up a Land Use Plan

Opposition groups targeted the Coastal Commission’s action calling for setting aside 4,000 acres from further development. The Environmental Defense Center and Mothers for Peace have opposed extending the licenses by 20 years for the two 1,110 MW Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR) units at Diablo Canyon every step of the way.

By way of background, environmental organizations thought they’d put a lid on the future of the plant in 2016 with an agreement to close the plant. In June 2016 four leading environmental groups signed on to the agreement to close the twin reactors and replace them with “greenhouse gas free resources,” e.g., solar, wind, and hydro. The groups involved included Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California, and the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility.

What happened next is that the State of California discovered that there was not enough generating capacity on the energy mix to cover the gapping hole was carved out of grid capacity once the reactors were shut down.

In response California Governor Gavin Newsome was able to convince the state legislature that the quickest way to be voted out of office was to let the nuclear plants stay dark which had already resulted in energy blackouts and skyrocketing utility costs. The two reactors had provided 10% of all the electricity generated in California.

In 2020 statewide rotating outages during a heat wave helped make his point. What green groups experienced is that you can preach the environmental values of renewable energy, but when people reach for the ‘on’ switch to their air conditioners, and all they hear are crickets, the party’s over.

California experienced an extreme heat wave in August 2020 that caused the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to direct electric utilities in its balancing authority to shed load, or in more common terms, to initiate rolling blackouts.

As expected, popular sentiment came around quickly when faced with stark choice that needed to be made to reverse the Diablo Canyon shutdown order in to keep the lights on and to prevent the California economy from taking a nose dive. In 2022 a state law ordered the plant to stay open for at least five years. It also authorized a $1.4 billion loan to be paid back by a combination of future profits and federal funding sources.

This experience did not deter opposition groups from hitting the Coastal Commission hard in 2025 forcing it to spend months in hearings over the proposed restrictions on land around the plant. However, in the end nine of the 12 commissioners voted to approve the new lands use plan.

In the end, the utility proposed a timeline to conserve up to 6,700 acres of land, create 25 miles of trail easements and put aside $10 million for trail construction to mitigate its operations through 2030. It also committed to a prohibition on selling another 5,000 acres of land through 2040, unless the sale is for conservation.

Meeting Water Quality Standards is the Final Hurdle

The remaining step in the license renewal process is the approval of permits through the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. The plant uses two million gallons a day of water drawn from the Pacific Ocean as a non-consumptive use for cooling purposes. Once the water has done its job, it is discharged back into the bay.

The California Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board is slated to vote in February 2026 on continued Diablo Canyon operations. To allow continued operation of the power plant, the Central Coast Water Board will consider two actions: renewing the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and issuing a Clean Water Act section 401 water quality certification.

Before the NRC’s license renewals can take effect, the Central Coast Water Board must certify that discharges to ocean waters resulting from the license renewals will comply with California’s water quality standards. (November 2025 staff presentation to the Water Board

Another issue related to regulating Diablo Canyon’s “once through” water use system is how it will protect marine organisms from being harmed by the intake systems. (Fact Sheet)

The same opposition groups will surely focus on these hearings as the decision by the Water Board is the last hurdle in the state’s review prior to the NRC decision whether to grant the license extensions. As they say in the world of Opera, “it ain’t over until the fat lady sings,” so watch this space.

Energy Demand is Growing in California

Diablo Canyon’s future as a key element in the state’s energy portfolio is driven by rising energy demand from data centers. The California Energy Commission says demand from data centers could grow by 4 GW in the next 10 years. The commission anticipates its next forecast will at least double. PG&E’s August 2025 estimate says demand could rise as much as 10 GW by 2035. That equals the energy of nearly five Diablo Canyons.

Diablo Canyon’s extended operations through 2030 are expected to annually reduce greenhouse-gas emissions

equivalent to carbon-dioxide emissions from 1.6 million cars.

Standard Nuclear Moves Ahead with Plans for TRISO Fuel Production

A new prime contract with the Department of Energy provides for a significant expansion of the firm’s capacity to manufacture TRISO fuel for advanced reactors

Standard Nuclear, Inc., a reactor-agnostic producer of TRISO nuclear fuel, announced that it has executed an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), marking a major milestone in an effort to bring privately funded advanced nuclear-fuel production infrastructure online in support of TRISO-fueled reactor demonstrations in 2026. Standard Nuclear is focused on the large-scale production of advanced nuclear fuel and radioisotope power systems.

Under the newly executed OTA, Standard Nuclear will transition key operational elements of its TRISO fuel production operations to full DOE oversight, ensuring adherence to the agency’s contracting framework. This enhanced oversight enables a substantial increase in the company’s TRISO fuel manufacturing throughput within its existing facilities.

Standard Nuclear is drawing on expertise from across the DOE complex to support this transition. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by Battelle Energy Alliance for DOE, is providing technical assistance through a Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) agreement executed earlier this year. The company is also receiving technical support and specialized training from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Y-12 National Security Complex.

“We’re proud to be the first TRISO fuel manufacturer to execute an agreement of this kind with the Department of Energy ahead of next year’s reactor demonstrations,” said Kurt Terrani, CEO of Standard Nuclear.

“The advanced reactor and fuel technologies now moving into deployment all originate from decades of DOE research and development said Jess Gehin, Associate Laboratory Director, Idaho National Laboratory.

Standard Nuclear Joins DOE Nuclear Fuel Line Program

DOE has conditionally selected Standard Nuclear as the first company to join its newly launched nuclear fuel line pilot program. This initiative is designed to strengthen the domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel, a key component in the deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. Standard Nuclear, based in Oak Ridge, TN, will lead the development and operation of a new nuclear fuel fabrication facility.

The project will also utilize infrastructure in Idaho to support production of advanced TRISO fuel – a next-generation nuclear fuel critical for high-performance reactors currently under development.

The company will be fully responsible for the construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning of the facility, while reactor developers will source uranium feedstock through DOE’s High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) allocation program.

The fuel line pilot program directly supports the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, which aims to bring at least three advanced reactor designs to operational criticality by July 2026. These next-generation reactors are expected to use more efficient, safer nuclear fuel like TRISO. Standard Nuclear said in its press statement the dual approach fast-tracks research, licensing, and deployment of innovative reactor technologies outside of traditional government labs, opening the door for private-sector investment and commercial-scale deployment.

Expanding domestic nuclear fuel capabilities is a strategic national priority. For years, the US has depended on foreign countries, including adversarial powers, for enriched uranium and other critical materials. This reliance introduces supply chain vulnerabilities, especially during times of geopolitical tension.

Earlier this year Standard Nuclear, Inc.,announced its launch from stealth with $42 million in total funding led by Decisive Point with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Washington Harbour Partners, Welara, Fundomo, and Crucible Capital.

Natura Resources Purchases Shepherd Power

The firm Also Partnered with NOV to Deploy Gigawatts of SMRs in early 2030s

Shepherd Power’s expertise in full-scale reactor deployment will accelerate Natura’s ability to provide comprehensive power options for customers, including site, build, own, and operate

Agreement will align Natura’s breakthrough reactor design with NOV’s manufacturing expertise to accelerate commercial deployment of Natura’s molten salt reactor (MSR) technology

Natura Resources LLC, a developer of advanced molten-salt nuclear reactors, has acquired Shepherd Power from NOV Inc. (NYSE: NOV) and signed an agreement with NOV to support commercialization of its small modular reactor (SMR) technology. As part of the transaction, NOV will become an investor in Natura and will appoint a representative to Natura’s Board of Directors.

The agreement will align Natura’s molten salt reactor design with NOV’s manufacturing, supply chain, and project management expertise to support delivery of multiple gigawatts of SMRs for data center and industrial applications between 2029 and 2032.

The acquisition adds Shepherd Power’s reactor deployment expertise, including regulatory and licensing experience, to the Natura team, strengthening Natura’s path to commercial deployment and enhancing the company’s ability to offer a range of industrial power options for customers.

Natura is building SMRs that use liquid fuel dissolved in a molten salt mixture. This design operates at high temperature and atmospheric pressure. It can use several fuel types, including recycled waste fuel and enables harvesting of rare medical isotopes critical for cancer treatment.

The firm said in its press statement that the design of Natura’s 100 MW reactor also will make it an option for produced water desalination, a critical issue for the Permian Basin and other areas of the U.S. with significant oil and gas production.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a construction permit in September 2024 for the deployment of Natura’s 1 MW reactor at Abilene Christian University. Natura expects to deploy this reactor in 2026.

Natura plans to file two commercial reactor applications with the NRC before the end of 2025 –one focused on medical isotope production and the other for grid-scale electricity generation. The company expects to deploy its first 100 MW commercial reactor in 2029.

State of New York Invests $40 Million in Nuclear Workforce Development

(WNN) The New York Power Authority (NYPA) will partner with qualified workforce development providers, including technical high schools, community colleges, universities, labour unions, and others to use $40 million in funding to develop nuclear energy technical training, retraining, coursework and apprenticeship programmes to prepare workers for employment in the advanced nuclear energy field.

Hochul’s direction to NYPA, the state’s public electric utility, plans to develop at least 1 GW of advanced nuclear capacity in upstate New York, an area in and around Oswego, NY. The NYPA will develop a ‘Master Plan for Responsible Advanced Nuclear Development’ in New York as part of a $1 billion proposal

In addition to the $40 million, the NYPA Board has awarded $4 million to universities and organizations to develop and expand programs that prepare New Yorkers for high-demand careers in artificial intelligence, electromechanical trades, and advanced power systems to meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

Three nuclear power plants, all in upstate New York, and all operated by Constellation Energy, currently provide 21% of the state’s electricity, and 42% of its carbon-free electricity, according to information from the Nuclear Energy Institute. The state supports the continued operation of the two-unit plant at Nine Mile Point and the single-unit Ginna and Fitzpatrick plants.

GE Vernova Hitachi SMR Design Clears Key UK Regulatory Review Milestone

(WNN) GE Vernova Hitachi announced that its BWRX300 SMR has cleared the second of three phases of the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process at the U.K. Office of Nuclear Regulation. The GDA assess the safety, security, and environmental protection aspects of a nuclear power plant design that is intended to be deployed in Great Britain.

The GDA process is a voluntary, non-mandatory process. Successful completion of the three-step GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and a Statement of Design Acceptability from the Environment Agency.

In May 2021, the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy opened the GDA process to advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs). GE Vernova Hitachi submitted a GDA entry application for its BWRX-300 SMR to the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in December 2022. The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH’s ESBWR boiling water reactor.

Step 1 of the GDA of the BWRX-300 began in January 2024 and focused on agreeing the scope and schedule for Step 2. Step 1 was completed in December 2024. It then entered Step 2, which focused on evaluating the fundamental adequacy of the design and its safety, security, safeguards and environmental protection documentation. The regulators have now completed Step 2 of the GDA and issued their Step 2 statements and assessment reports on the GE Vernova Hitachi design.

There are currently no plans to deploy the GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 design in Great Britain, and no sites have been identified for its deployment. If an organization decide to progress plans to deploy the BWRX-300 design, the regulators would need to undertake a further period of detailed design assessment before safety-significant construction could begin and environmental permits could be issued. This assessment could be conducted on a generic basis with GE Vernova Hitachi, should the company choose to return to the GDA process to complete Step 3.

“GE Vernova Hitachi opted for a shorter two-step GDA, making it the first requesting party to take advantage of the flexibility we introduced in our modernized GDA process,” said Rob Exley, ONR’s Head of the BWRX-300 GDA.

He added, “This means it is the quickest GDA engagement completed to date.”

Other Firms and the GDA Process

GDAs have previously been completed for the EDF/Areva UK EPR, the Westinghouse AP1000, the Hitachi-GE UK ABWR and China’s HPR1000 designs. A GDA Step 3 assessment is currently ongoing for Rolls-Royce SMR Limited’s small modular reactor design.

In August 2024 a Step 2 assessment began for Holtec International’s SMR-300. In August 2024, Westinghouse’s AP300 was accepted for a GDA review. Last month, TerraPower submitted its Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor and energy storage system into the GDA process in the company’s first regulatory step to deploying the technology in an international market.

Japan Quits Its Vietnam Nuclear Project

Reuters reports that Japan has pulled out of plans to build a commercial nuclear power station in Vietnam because the time frame is too tight, Japanese ambassador Naoki Ito told the wire service.

He said, “The Japanese side is not in a position to implement the Ninh Thuan 2 project.”

Japan at one time proposed to develop a nuclear power station for a location on Vietnam’s central highlands with a planned capacity of 2-3 GW.

A key focus of the power plant was to provide electricity to an aluminum smelting plant to move Vietnam up the value chain from simply exporting raw aluminum to developing a manufacturing capacity to produce finished durable goods.

In June, Bloomberg reported Vietnam was seeking discussions with Russia to accelerate its nuclear program and sign an investment cooperation agreement for a first nuclear power station. Vietnam is a global center of manufacturing operations for multinationals including Samsung and Apple. It has had major power blackouts as demand from its huge industrial sector and expanding urban populations often exceed the power available.

Vietnam, which shares a long common border with China, has long aligned itself with Russia to counter balance China’s influence on its economy and politics. Russia has proposed to build up to 4 GW of nuclear power generating capacity in Vietnam. Japan was supposed to have provided another 4 GW for a total of 8 GW. It is unclear whether Russia would commit to an 8 GW project or whether Vietnam could pay for it.

In 2016 Vietnam cancelled a proposal by Russia to build four 1,000 MW VVERs, and four more 1,000 MW reactors to be supplied by Japanese firms, due to the rising costs of the power stations and concerns about the country’s ability to safely manage the construction operations of the reactors.

Construction of the reactors had been set to begin in the province of Ninh Thuan province in 2014. The site is about 350 km / 135 miles northeast of Ho Chi Minh city (formerly Saigon).

The start date was pushed back several times by the government on the grounds that it did not have enough trained nuclear engineers to manage the construction nor the safety regulatory programs needed for a reactor development effort of this size.

In January 2015 Hoang Anh Tuan, head of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Agency, told western news media that the reason for the delays is that the government wasn’t ready to manage the project nor does it have a mature and independent nuclear safety and regulatory oversight agency. A national nuclear safety agency was set up in 2010, but much more work is needed according to this report.

At the time Vietnam did not consider small nuclear reactors because neither the Russians nor the Japanese had commercial units to sell them. Fast forward to 2025, Russia is building SMRs to power mining operations in Siberia but has not, so far, offered them for export. Japan does not currently have a domestic design of an SMR that is economically viable.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/diablocanyon-aerial_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 12:59:21.073845

Public Opinion Remains High for Nuclear Energy According to Bisconti Research, Inc. the American public overall has a favorable view of nuclear energy.
The 2025 National Nuclear Energy Public Opinion Survey finds continued highly favorable public opinion of nuclear energy, despite a slight drop since 2024.
Opinions about license renewal for “nuclear power plants that continue to meet federal safety standards” and for “definitely building more nuclear power plants” also are favorable in 2025.
Among those who feel very well informed about nuclear energy, 66% are strongly favorable and only 6% are strongly opposed.","In a world in which nuclear energy is experiencing a resurgence of interest and action, the determined efforts of groups opposed to the relicensing of the twin 1,100 MW PWRs at the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant flies in the face of global wisdom. According to the World Nuclear Association, as of 12/04/25, 33 nations have signed a pledge to triple the amount of nuclear power on the planet by 2050. That’s a lot of good company for any utility wanting to start, restart, and/or relicense a nuclear power plant of any size or design.

Dr Sama Bilbao y León, Director General of World Nuclear Association said: “The path to tripling nuclear capacity is open, but it demands bold, pragmatic, and visionary leadership. Governments must act now, but the industry needs to deliver and work together with civil society. A cleaner more resilient future is within reach with nuclear energy. We need to move with purpose, investing in solutions that work to shape a tomorrow that is defined by reliability, innovation, and climate responsibility.”

“Tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050, can be achieved, provided governments take immediate and sustained action to deliver on their own national targets for nuclear capacity.”

According to the report global nuclear capacity could reach 1,428 GWe by 2050, exceeding the 1200 GWe target set in the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy set in 2023 at in September 2023 COP28 in Dubai.

Nuclear Opposition Groups Face the Realities of the 21st Century

Closer to home, here in the US sustained commitments to nuclear energy are visible with projects under way to bring five nuclear reactors back from the dead. While the economic drivers of these projects vary, all of them have targeted being in revenue service as quickly as possible, several in the next few years, to meet rapidly growing demand from data centers and other sources of electricity demand resulting from the closure of coal fired power plants. These efforts put the relicensing of Diablo Canyon in good company.

Opposition groups and some elected officials in California don’t like what they see. The implications of the restarts of five reactors, and relicensing of two more at Diablo Canyon, set the examples for future financial investment decisions in small modular reactors as well as potential new full size reactors. The resurgence of nuclear power called for by the World Nuclear Association’s global pledge by 33 nations is well underway in the U.S.

Wikipedia lists 80 anti-nuclear groups in the U.S. These are direct action, environmental, health, and public interest organizations who oppose nuclear weapons and/or nuclear power. It is a real head scratcher why in the middle of the second decade of the 21st century, opposition groups are working in California, Michigan, and other places to spike reactor restarts and prevent the development of SMRs are stuck in the middle of the last decades of the last century.

The 1980s and 1990s were dark decades for nuclear energy in terms of spanners tossed into the gears of nuclear R&D with the cancellation of the Integral Fast Reactor. Public fears driven by the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979 were energized by an anti-nuclear movie “The China Syndrome,” which was released just 12 days before the accident.

A lot of lessons have been learned since which is why flogging current reactor restarts with the sins of the past make little sense. Even Japan, with the effects of the Fukushima accident still in the news, is restarting closed reactors and is holding planned to complete reactors that were under construction in March 2011.

Five Reactor Restarts Lead the Way

There are the five reactors being restarted in the U.S. Every nuclear utility in the US is watching their progress towards revenue service especially to see what lessons can be learned about the market for large 1,000 MW+ reactors and demand for electricity based on the rapid growth of data centers and the closing of coal fired power plants.

Holtec – Work well underway for the restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan. According to recent press statements by Holtec, Palisades is on track to restart in early 2026. When it does, it will be the first nuclear plant in the United States to generate electricity again after being decommissioned.

A long-term power purchase agreement signed between Holtec Palisades Energy and the non-profit Wolverine Power Cooperative is a key economic driver of the restart effort. Under the multi-decade agreement,

Wolverine committed to purchasing two-thirds of the power generated from a reopened Palisades, with Wolverine’s partner Hoosier Energy purchasing the balance. It also includes a “contract expansion provision” to include one or two small modular reactors that Holtec plans for the site.

At the time it was taken out of service, the 805 MW Palisades reactor was licensed to operate until 2031. Holtec notified the NRC last year that it intends to apply for a second, or subsequent, license renewal for the plant during the first quarter of 2026. This would extend the plant’s operating period by a further 20 years, to 2051.

As the first mover for reactor restarts in the nation, Holtec has also attracted the most vigorous opposition to its plans. Beyond Nuclear, an anti-nuclear group in Michigan, is opposed to the restart and 20-year license extension of the plant.

It also attacked Holtec’s plans to build two 300 MW PWR type SMRs at the site. A coalition of opposition groups, as described in a 12/06/25 article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, label Holtec as being untrustworthy. Beyond Nuclear’s opposition to the restart of Palisades is long standing. In 2022 it called the project a “zombie reactor restart scheme.”

V.C. Summer – The most dramatic restart announcement of the year is the planned restart of the twin Westinghouse 1,150 MW AP1000s at the V.C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Brookfield, the Canadian private equity firm that holds a majority share of the ownership of Westinghouse, has been selected by South Carolina utility Santee Cooper to complete two partially built Westinghouse 1,150 MW AP1000 PWR type nuclear reactors.

Brookfield won the V.C. Summer development contract with the main factor being a commitment to paying down $2.7 billion of an existing $3.6 billion obligation Santee Cooper has on the site and sharing ownership and power. Ratepayers have been stuck with the debt since the project collapsed in 2017. Until now there were no prospects to complete the twin reactors.

Neither reactor is even 50% complete. As a result of the uncertainty associated with the cost to complete the two reactors, Westinghouse and its EPC will be expected to make project management and controls for costs and schedules job number one.

In terms of regulatory status, the NRC terminated the combined licenses for the two reactors in March 2019. Santee Cooper and Brookfield will have to submit new applications for construction and operating licenses under the NRC’s Part 50 process. The documentation from the previous COLs for both reactors should, to some extent, make life easier in terms of relicensing the the two units.

For now Brookfield and Santee Cooper are working out the feasibility issues that are a precursor to a final investment decision and bringing an EPC on board to complete the reactors.

Constellation Energy – Efforts to restart TMI-1 in Pennsylvania, now renamed as the Crane Clean Energy Center, is targeting 2027 for revenue service for the 819 MW reactor. A 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft is the incentive for the restart.

Duane Arnold – In March 2025 NextEra Energy filed paperwork with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) indicating its intent to restart the 600 MW Duane Arnold nuclear power plant which is located in Iowa. The reactor was shut down in 2020 after 45 years of operation. The utility has also reportedly communicated with regional grid operators about its plans to be a source of power for new data centers being built in Iowa.

In October 2025 the utility said the plant is targeted to be fully operational by the first quarter of 2029. A key economic driver of the restart is that Google and NextEra Energy sign a 25-year agreement for Duane Arnold’s energy, as well as an agreement to explore deployment of nuclear generation nationwide.

Public Opinion Remains High for Nuclear Energy

According to Bisconti Research, Inc. the American public overall has a favorable view of nuclear energy. Here are some highlights from the 2025 report.

72% favor nuclear energy vs. 28% who oppose. The 2025 National Nuclear Energy Public Opinion Survey finds continued highly favorable public opinion of nuclear energy, despite a slight drop since 2024. Four decades ago, the numbers for favor and oppose were about even.

29% strongly favor nuclear energy vs. 6% who strongly oppose. Those who strongly favor nuclear energy outnumber those who strongly oppose by 5 to 1.

Chart: Bisconti Research, Inc.

Opinions are not polarized. The myth of polarized public opinion about nuclear energy is a thing of the past. A majority of Americans are fence-sitters on nuclear energy. They somewhat favor or somewhat oppose nuclear energy, with more tending to favor. Among persons with a strong opinion, those in favor outnumber those opposed by 5 to 1.

87% support license renewal, and 64% would build more plants. Opinions about license renewal for “nuclear power plants that continue to meet federal safety standards” and for “definitely building more nuclear power plants” also are favorable in 2025.

Since these questions were first asked in 1998, most of the public has agreed with license renewal of nuclear power plants that meet federal safety standards. In contrast, barely half the public (47% in 1998) supported definitely building more nuclear power plants. Those agreeing that we should definitely build more plants rose in recent years to a high of 72%. While that number fell 7 points between 2024 and 2025, it remains high.

A Call to Action for the US Nuclear Industry

The Bisconti report contains data that should be taken as a call to action by the U.S. nuclear industry.

According to the Bisconti report,one of the reasons why so many Americans take middle positions on nuclear energy is that they don’t feel very well informed about this energy source.

In 2025, only 15% feel very well informed on the topic, 47% somewhat well informed, 31% not too well informed, and 7% not at all well informed. The correlation between the level of feeling informed and attitudes is striking. Among those who feel very well informed about nuclear energy, 66% are strongly favorable and only 6% are strongly opposed.

Chart: Bisconti Research, Inc.

It is time for the nuclear industry’s trade organizations as well as scientific and educational organizations to ramp up their efforts to inform the public about the current progress being made with reactor restarts and the potential for entirely new builds of small modular reactors, advanced reactors of all sizes, and new 1,000 MW+ units. It is a new year’s resolution waiting for the industry to act.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2050-pledge.png,N,,2025-12-14 12:59:17.336501

A Strategic Reset, Not a Retreat The end of the Ford–SK On joint venture does not signal an abandonment of electric vehicles.","DEARBORN — Ford Motor Co. and South Korean battery manufacturer SK On are unwinding one of the most ambitious electric-vehicle bets of the past decade, ending their $11.4 billion joint venture to build EV battery plants in the United States as demand for electric vehicles softens and federal policy signals shift.

The move marks a sharp reversal from 2021, when Ford and SK On announced plans to construct multiple battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, a deal that was widely seen as a cornerstone of Ford’s long-term electrification strategy. At the time, soaring EV sales projections, generous federal incentives and tightening fuel economy standards pushed automakers to move aggressively into battery production.

Four years later, the EV landscape looks far more uncertain.

EV Market Hits a Reality Check

Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. have slowed through 2025, with battery-electric vehicles accounting for less than 10 percent of new light-duty vehicle sales. After years of double-digit growth, EV sales have flattened and, in some months, fallen sharply year over year.

Industry analysts point to a combination of factors: the rollback or narrowing of federal EV tax credits, high interest rates that have pushed monthly payments higher, and ongoing consumer concerns about charging infrastructure and resale values. At the same time, revised federal fuel-economy standards are expected to give gasoline and hybrid vehicles more breathing room, easing pressure on automakers to rapidly expand all-electric lineups.

Hybrids, which offer improved fuel efficiency without the need for charging, have gained market share faster than full battery-electric vehicles — a trend automakers are now leaning into.

How the Breakup Will Work

Under the terms of the dissolution:

SK On will take full control of the Tennessee battery facility, known as the BlueOval plant.

Ford will assume ownership of two adjacent battery plants in Kentucky, previously part of the joint venture.

SK On formally initiated the move to dissolve the partnership but says it plans to continue working with Ford around the Tennessee facility. The company says operating independently will allow it to improve productivity, increase operational flexibility and accelerate growth in its North American energy storage business.

Federal Loan Reassessed

The breakup also triggers a reassessment of a government loan originally approved at up to $9.6 billion to support the joint venture. Under the current administration, the loan is being restructured and reduced to limit taxpayer exposure and ensure faster repayment.

According to Bloomberg, the revised structure is designed to “reduce exposure to taxpayers and ensure prompt repayment.” Ford is working voluntarily with the U.S. Department of Energy to repay its portion more quickly than initially planned.

Ford’s EV Losses Mount

The decision comes as Ford continues to absorb heavy losses in its EV business. The automaker lost $5.1 billion before interest and taxes on its electric-vehicle operations in 2024 and expects losses to grow in 2025.

Chief executive Jim Farley has warned that under current market and policy conditions, U.S. EV sales could fall by as much as 50 percent, forcing automakers to slow investment and refocus on profitability.

“We believe the writing was on the wall this partnership was not going to work moving forward,” Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives told the Detroit Free Press. “Ford has to make some difficult moves, and this was a smart strategic one to rip the band-aid off.”

Michigan Impact: What It Means at Home

For Michigan, the breakup underscores the uneven pace of the EV transition — and the growing tension between long-term electrification goals and near-term economic realities.

Michigan remains the epicenter of U.S. auto manufacturing, with billions invested in EV assembly plants, battery research, and supplier retooling. But as EV sales slow, suppliers across the state face longer production timelines and increased uncertainty around volume forecasts.

Utilities and regulators are also watching closely. Large-scale EV and battery investments have raised concerns about electric grid capacity, infrastructure costs, and ratepayer impacts, issues that have already sparked pushback in rural Michigan communities where data centers and energy-intensive facilities are proposed.

At the same time, Ford and other automakers are signaling a renewed emphasis on hybrids and advanced internal-combustion technologies — segments that support existing Michigan jobs while buying time for EV markets to mature.

A Strategic Reset, Not a Retreat

The end of the Ford–SK On joint venture does not signal an abandonment of electric vehicles. Instead, it reflects a broader recalibration underway across the auto industry as companies adjust to slower adoption, shifting policy priorities and the need for tighter capital discipline.

Battery makers are increasingly cautious about overcapacity, while automakers are dialing back the scale and pace of EV investments once assumed to be inevitable. In that context, the breakup stands as a clear marker of how quickly the EV boom has cooled — and how pragmatism is replacing ambition as the industry charts its next phase.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FordSKEV.webp,N,,2025-12-14 12:00:03.180860

With utility bills on the rise, most homeowners are increasingly looking for ways to cut down their power bills. Depending on where you live, you may find yourself at a crossroads, wondering whether switching to a heat pump is worth the cost. They are known for being more costly to install than conventional HVAC systems, but they can be cost-effective over time, reducing your power consumption by a staggering 75%, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Plus, they always pull double duty year-round, allowing homeowners to heat and cool their homes with the same setup.

But despite their massive perks, if you've spent your time scrolling through online forums that talk about heat pump upgrades, you've probably come across a statement like, ""heat pumps don't work in cold weather."" And given that this claim is repeated so often, you might take it as a fact. But is it truly factual? The simple answer is no, although it is a myth that used to be true.

Heat pumps are typically vulnerable during harsh winters. After all, they usually keep your home warm when temperatures drop by extracting heat from the outside air and transferring it indoors. This means that when it gets cold enough to freeze, the pumps will have little to no heat to absorb, reducing their efficiency. Older models struggled with this issue, but great strides have been made to make it easier for heat pumps to extract sufficient heat from freezing outdoor air, more efficiently than before.

Generally speaking, modern heat pumps are a completely different story from those of the '80s and '90s, and even some of the early 2000s. Today's cold-climate models, like the Mitsubishi Hyper-Heating FX-Series (available on Amazon), feature advanced technology that provides warmth for your home even when the temperature outside dips below -13 degrees Fahrenheit. These models are specifically built to maintain strong heating output during extreme cold months, thanks to inverter-driven compressors and advanced refrigerants.

However, it's worth noting that although cold-climate heat pumps might still operate at 100% capacity, they will typically cost more. If you're trying to keep your home comfortable across all seasons while avoiding skyrocketing bills, you'll probably want to consider a hybrid heat pump. As a hybrid, this model comes with two systems: an electric heat pump that handles your heating needs when outdoor temperatures are mild to moderate and a furnace that can save the day when conditions are frigid.

Even beyond the ""heat pumps don't work in cold weather"" myth, there is still a ton of misinformation out there about these energy-saving appliances. Money is always a major factor when considering which type of heating system to get, and unfortunately, the idea that heat pumps are affordable is one concept that people don't believe. While there's some veracity to the idea that they're prohibitively expensive — hybrid and cold-climate models carry a higher upfront cost than standard models — but it's not true in all situations. After all, when you factor in home energy rebates, tax credits under programs like the Inflation Reduction Act, and energy savings, a modern heat pump will suddenly become much more affordable since the installation costs will be slashed by hundreds or thousands of dollars.

You might also hear the misconception that heat pumps are quite noisy. While this might have been true a few decades ago (since older units have a reputation for rattling and whining), today's pumps are built to run with a low hum. In fact, most operate at 40–60 decibel levels, which is similar to that of a refrigerator or a normal conversation. There is also the issue of maintenance. You might believe that heat pumps are more difficult and expensive to maintain than standard systems. But that's not true. Their upkeep is the same as that of a standard HVAC system. You'll just need to clean or replace the air filters, schedule annual maintenance service, and keep the outdoor unit clean.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/dont-believe-this-extremely-common-heat-pump-myth/l-intro-1765452877.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 11:02:53.205423

El Paso Electric sought to change the solar customer fee – which would have likely resulted in an increase to rooftop solar customers.
“Regarding New Mexico, we have not yet finalized our filing, the revenue requirement or calculated residential customer impacts,” El Paso Electric said in its statement.","The proposed bill increase by El Paso Electric that could take effect next year may be decreased after a panel of judges overseeing the utility’s rate case sided with customers and suggested moderating it.

A final decision on the rate increase by the state’s Public Utility Commission likely won’t come until February. But the judges on Dec. 7 issued a proposal for decision – a recommendation for the state’s public utility commissioners – that argued El Paso Electric is asking to make too much profit off customers.

Instead of authorizing the requested shareholder profit margin of 10.7%, the PUC should approve an allowed return of 9.4% that’s close to the utility’s current authorized profit margin.

El Paso Electric is evaluating the panel’s recommendation, the utility said in a statement.

“Because this is an ongoing regulatory proceeding, we are not in a position to comment on specific recommendations included in the Proposal for Decision, including customer charge levels, return on equity, revenue requirement adjustments, or the treatment of distributed generation customers,” the utility said.

Since it filed to raise rates in January, El Paso Electric has argued it needs to collect about $85 million more annually from customers to pay off $1.55 billion in various investments it made between 2021 and 2024, such as the $217 million Newman 6 power plant unit that started operating in 2023.

Monopoly utilities can’t set their own rates. Instead, utilities have to seek approval from state public utility commissions to raise their rates to recover money they’ve spent on investments such as substations or power plants – plus their authorized profit margin.

The judges said El Paso Electric’s proposed shareholder profit margin made up $38 million of the total requested rate increase.

El Paso Electric’s original request would raise average monthly bills from $96 to $118.

READ MORE: As El Paso Electric rate increase looms, some say utility is seeking to make too much profit

It’s difficult to calculate how the recommendation from the judges overseeing the case would impact bills, but it’s likely the increase will be lower than the $22 proposed if the PUC adopts the recommended decision when commissioners vote early next year.

The judges recommended the PUC hold the flat monthly customer charge at $9.25 rather than the proposed $13.71. That would take off $4.46 of the proposed $22 per month increase. And if the PUC approves the 9.4% shareholder profit margin over the 10.7%, it would mean a smaller increase for customers.

A big part of the rate case involves what to do with customers who have rooftop solar panels. The utility currently charges a $30 minimum bill for rooftop solar customers, arguing they still rely on the grid when their panels aren’t producing electricity.

El Paso Electric sought to change the solar customer fee – which would have likely resulted in an increase to rooftop solar customers. But the judges recommended keeping the current fee in place and said the utility hasn’t studied closely enough how those customers affect the electric grid and the utility’s costs.

A coalition of pro-solar organizations known as the Joint Solar Advocates weighed in on the ruling, saying they largely supported the judges’ conclusions.

“The Joint Solar Advocates are generally supportive of the outcome in the recommended decision,” the group said in a statement to El Paso Matters. “Importantly, the (case’s judges) agreed that there is no cost-basis for a unique demand charge on customers that choose to install their own solar panels to meet part of their electricity needs.”

The solar advocates – which include the national nonprofit Solar United Neighbors and other pro-rooftop solar groups such as Public Citizen and Amanecer Peoples’ Project – say El Paso Electric should conduct a detailed study to look at the benefits rooftop solar customers bring as a decentralized source of electricity generation. And they want the utility to pay customers more for the electricity their panels produce.

That kind of study “is what’s really needed so that EPE and customers can make a more informed decision on adopting rooftop solar,” the joint statement said. “The study will also speak to the appropriateness of EPE’s minimum bill for solar customers, and the utility’s compensation rate for those customers’ energy exports back to the grid.”

RELATED: As rate increases loom, El Paso households could see utility bills jump $45 a month in early 2026

Separately, El Paso Electric told the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission that it plans to apply to raise rates for its customers in New Mexico in February, likely after the Texas rate case is resolved. The utility in 2024 had more than 459,000 customers, including 107,000 New Mexico customers, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

El Paso Electric didn’t provide details yet to the NMPRC about what the rate increase in New Mexico could look like – for example, whether rates would rise more for residential, commercial or big industrial customers.

However, in the utility’s Texas rate case, El Paso Electric said it needs to bring in $140.7 million more from all of its customers, annually, to cover the cost of investments and operations, including $85.7 million more from all of its Texas customers. That would indicate the utility needs to collect about $55 million more from its New Mexico customers – a 38% increase in revenue.

“Regarding New Mexico, we have not yet finalized our filing, the revenue requirement or calculated residential customer impacts,” El Paso Electric said in its statement.

El Paso Electric plans to spend $4.4 billion in capital projects over the next five years as spending across the U.S. utility industry has accelerated rapidly in recent years.

Most of that spending is driven largely by the construction boom of power-hungry data centers and increased electricity demand for air conditioning in homes and businesses caused by climate change and higher average temperatures.

Beyond technical training, schools like Southwestern University and the University of Minnesota, Morris, are weaving renewable energy into campus life, achieving complete reliance on renewable electricity through Renewable Energy Credits. These campuses serve as real-world testbeds, equipping students with practical experience while showcasing scalable solutions.

Building the Workforce: Addressing Skills Shortages

The rapid expansion of clean energy has led to a significant demand for skilled professionals, especially in fields such as solar installation, wind turbine maintenance, and energy storage engineering. To meet this need, universities are partnering with industry and government agencies. For example, the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office supports initiatives like Bright Solar Futures in Philadelphia, which prepares high schoolers and young adults for careers in solar installation. The Gulf Research Program has also invested millions in projects like the Texas Green Careers Academy, helping residents in Gulf States transition into clean energy roles.

Community colleges and technical schools are equally important. The Solar Energy Industries Association works with these institutions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) in the workforce. Meanwhile, platforms such as IREC’s Green Workforce Connect link job seekers with training and employment opportunities. State programs, like Maryland’s Offshore Wind Workforce Training, further demonstrate how local efforts are broadening access to clean energy careers.

Employment Growth and Ongoing Challenges

Today, more than 3.6 million Americans work in the renewable energy sector, with solar energy supporting over 7 million jobs worldwide. The IRA has spurred over $300 billion in clean energy investments, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new positions in solar, wind, and battery manufacturing. According to the 2024 U.S. Energy and Employment Report, clean energy jobs grew by 4.2% in 2023, outpacing the overall economy.

Despite this growth, the sector faces persistent hurdles. There is a notable shortage of skilled workers in construction and manufacturing, particularly as experienced tradespeople retire. The need for hybrid expertise—combining technical know-how with digital skills like energy analytics and artificial intelligence—is also increasing. Academic programs are evolving to meet these demands, but scaling up will require ongoing investment and supportive policies.

Investment Patterns: Universities as Innovation Hubs

Research conducted by academic institutions is increasingly shaping investment strategies in the clean energy space. For example, financial analyses from Duke University have influenced approaches to sustainable infrastructure. Tax incentives from the IRA have enabled colleges, such as Roxbury Community College, to launch geothermal and solar projects.

Private investors are also taking notice. As renewable technologies become more affordable, collaborations between universities and private partners are driving innovation in areas like energy storage and hydrogen solutions. However, the recent cancellation of funding for more than 200 energy projects by the Department of Energy highlights the sector’s sensitivity to policy changes.

Internal Challenges and Leadership Focus Inside Tesla, the sales slump has prompted a reevaluation of priorities.
Global EV sales growth slowed to 20% in 2025 from 40% the prior year, per International Energy Agency data.
But with sales teetering, 2025 serves as a critical test of resilience in an industry where innovation alone may not suffice.","As Tesla Inc. navigates a turbulent 2025, the electric-vehicle giant finds itself in a precarious position, racing against time to stem a potential second consecutive year of declining sales. Recent data paints a stark picture: U.S. sales plummeted to under 40,000 units in November, marking the lowest monthly figure in nearly four years. This downturn comes despite aggressive discounting and the introduction of more affordable models, underscoring deeper issues within the company and the broader market for battery-powered cars. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, has been vocal about external pressures, but insiders and analysts point to a mix of internal missteps and shifting consumer sentiments.

The expiration of federal EV tax credits at the end of 2024 has exacerbated the situation, removing a key incentive that once buoyed demand. Tesla responded by slashing prices on its flagship Model 3 and Model Y, rolling out “Standard” variants priced as low as $35,000 to attract budget-conscious buyers. Yet, these moves have failed to ignite sales, with estimates from Cox Automotive showing a 20% drop from October’s figures. According to a report in Reuters, even the Cybertruck, Tesla’s much-hyped electric pickup, has underperformed, contributing only marginally to overall volume.

Musk has attributed some of the blame to broader economic factors, including high interest rates and a slowdown in global EV adoption. On social media platform X, formerly Twitter, he has posted about supply chain constraints echoing past challenges, such as chip shortages that hampered production in previous years. However, critics argue that Tesla’s aging lineup—dominated by models like the Model 3 and Y, which haven’t seen major refreshes in years—has left the company vulnerable to fresher competition from rivals like BYD Co. and Ford Motor Co.

Aggressive Discounts and Their Limits

In a bid to reverse the slide, Tesla has unleashed a flurry of promotions, including zero-interest financing for up to 72 months on select models and referral bonuses worth thousands in credits. These incentives, detailed in a recent article from Business Insider, aim to clear inventory and boost deliveries before year-end. The company is targeting a narrow window to surpass 2024’s sales total of about 1.8 million vehicles globally, but with only weeks left, the math looks daunting. Analysts project that without a miraculous December surge, Tesla could see its first back-to-back annual declines since its early days as a startup.

This strategy isn’t new for Tesla; price cuts have been a hallmark of Musk’s playbook, often used to stimulate demand during lulls. But the current environment differs. The end of tax credits has leveled the playing field, making Tesla’s offerings less competitively priced against gasoline vehicles, especially as oil prices stabilize. Moreover, consumer hesitation stems from concerns over charging infrastructure and range anxiety, issues that Tesla’s Supercharger network has mitigated but not eliminated entirely.

Adding to the complexity, Musk’s public persona and political involvements have alienated some potential buyers. Surveys from industry groups indicate that a portion of the liberal-leaning EV buyer base has soured on the brand amid Musk’s outspoken support for certain policies and figures. While Tesla maintains a loyal following, this backlash has contributed to softer demand in key markets like California, where sales dipped 15% year-over-year in the third quarter.

Global Pressures and Competitive Shifts

Expanding beyond the U.S., Tesla’s international performance tells a similar story of strain. In China, the world’s largest EV market, sales fell 6% in November, per data referenced in posts on X, as local players like BYD undercut prices with government-backed incentives. Europe hasn’t fared much better, with a 30% drop attributed to regulatory hurdles and economic slowdowns. A piece in The Times of India highlights how cheaper Tesla variants failed to spark interest, even as the company ramped up production at its Shanghai Gigafactory.

Musk has downplayed these figures, emphasizing long-term bets on autonomy and artificial intelligence. In recent X posts, he reiterated Tesla’s focus on self-driving technology, predicting that software updates like Full Self-Driving (FSD) version 13 will revolutionize the industry. Yet, regulatory scrutiny from bodies like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration continues to delay widespread deployment, limiting FSD’s revenue potential in the short term.

Competitors are capitalizing on Tesla’s vulnerabilities. Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. have introduced models with superior range and luxury features, while traditional automakers like General Motors Co. push affordable EVs subsidized by their vast dealer networks. Tesla’s reliance on direct sales, while innovative, leaves it exposed in regions with poor online penetration or where physical showrooms matter.

Internal Challenges and Leadership Focus

Inside Tesla, the sales slump has prompted a reevaluation of priorities. Musk, who juggles roles at SpaceX, xAI, and now advisory positions in the U.S. government, has admitted to stretching thin. X posts from earlier this year reveal his return to “sleeping in conference rooms” to oversee critical projects, including Starship launches and AI integrations. This divided attention, some executives whisper, has slowed decision-making on new vehicle development, such as the long-awaited affordable “Model 2” compact car.

Financially, the picture is mixed. While vehicle sales falter, Tesla’s energy storage business—bolstered by Megapack batteries—posted record revenues, offsetting some automotive losses. Stock investors, as noted in a report from Parameter, seem unfazed, with shares rising 3% despite the November data, betting on AI-driven growth over traditional carmaking.

Critics, however, warn that ignoring core automotive execution could prove costly. Aging factories and supply chain bottlenecks, reminiscent of 2021’s chip crisis that Musk publicly lamented, persist. Tesla’s Fremont plant, for instance, operates below capacity, hampered by labor disputes and parts shortages.

Strategic Pivots and Future Bets

To counter these headwinds, Tesla is doubling down on innovation. The company plans to unveil a revamped Model Y in 2026, incorporating advanced battery tech for longer range and faster charging. Musk has teased robotaxi services as a game-changer, potentially generating billions in recurring revenue once regulatory hurdles clear. Insights from Electrek suggest that without tax credits, Tesla may lobby for new incentives or explore partnerships with governments to subsidize infrastructure.

Yet, skepticism abounds. Analysts from firms like Morgan Stanley question whether these futuristic bets can sustain the company through immediate sales droughts. The Cybertruck’s production ramp-up, plagued by quality issues, exemplifies the risks: initial hype gave way to recalls and customer complaints, further denting brand perception.

Musk’s leadership style—bold, unfiltered, and often controversial—remains a double-edged sword. His X commentary on topics ranging from population decline to AI supremacy keeps Tesla in the headlines, but it also invites scrutiny. For instance, recent posts defending Tesla’s autonomy edge over rivals like Waymo have rallied fans, yet failed to translate into sales momentum.

Market Realities and Consumer Sentiment

Broader market dynamics reveal a maturing EV sector where early adopter enthusiasm wanes. Global EV sales growth slowed to 20% in 2025 from 40% the prior year, per International Energy Agency data. Tesla, once the undisputed leader, now holds about 15% market share, squeezed by hybrids that offer a bridge for hesitant buyers.

Consumer surveys, including those cited in Torque News, point to Musk’s polarizing politics as a factor in brand aversion. One respondent quipped that buying a Tesla feels like “endorsing a worldview,” prompting some to opt for alternatives like the Chevrolet Bolt or Hyundai Ioniq.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s ecosystem—encompassing solar products, home batteries, and a vast charging network—provides a moat. The company’s vertical integration allows for cost efficiencies that peers envy, potentially enabling deeper discounts without eroding margins entirely.

Path Forward Amid Uncertainty

Looking ahead, Tesla must balance short-term fixes with long-term vision. Insiders suggest accelerating the Model 2 launch to under $25,000 could recapture entry-level buyers, especially in emerging markets. Musk has hinted at this in X discussions, stressing the need for volume production to replace the global fleet of internal-combustion vehicles.

Regulatory environments will play a pivotal role. In the U.S., potential policy shifts under new administrations could reinstate incentives, while Europe’s stringent emissions rules might favor EVs. Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory expansion aims to tap this, targeting 1 million annual units by 2027.

Ultimately, Tesla’s fate hinges on execution. As Musk refocuses on core operations, the company could emerge stronger, leveraging its tech prowess to outpace rivals. But with sales teetering, 2025 serves as a critical test of resilience in an industry where innovation alone may not suffice.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3828-1765673699.jpeg,N,,2025-12-14 10:01:22.464901

Driving sustainable practices in manufacturing

Julie Chapman, head of manufacturing and engineering at Duncan & Toplis explains

Sustainability and environmental responsibility have shifted from being a ‘nice to have’ to an essential part of business strategy. For manufacturers, this isn’t just about meeting expectations —it is about staying competitive and aligning with the UK’s ambition to reach net zero by 2050.

Julie Chapman, head of manufacturing and engineering at Duncan & Toplis, said: “Manufacturing is an extremely energy-intensive industry.” Government data shows the sector emitted around 71 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2023, making decarbonisation a significant challenge. Yet, with Industry 5.0 ushering in a new era, technology is transforming the way manufacturers operate sustainably.

Introduced in 2021 as the ‘5th Industrial Revolution’, Industry 5.0 goes beyond connectivity and automation to address sustainability and societal impact. Ms Chapman explained: “It is not just about contributing to a healthier planet — environmentally driven practices can streamline processes, future-proof strategies and secure financial growth.” Across the UK, manufacturers are embedding sustainability into everyday operations, from factory floors to supply chains, to minimise environmental impact and conserve resources for future generations.

Technology plays a pivotal role in this transformation. Industry 5.0 emphasises collaboration between robotics, bionics and people, creating ultra-modern facilities where automation drives efficiency. By leveraging AI and the Internet of Things, manufacturers can reduce energy consumption, minimise waste through precision, and optimise supply chains. Highlighting how innovation is reshaping traditional workflows, Ms Chapman added: “Processes are becoming smarter and leaner.”

Renewable energy adoption

Reshoring is another trend gaining momentum. Encouraging UK production not only supports local economies but also delivers environmental benefits by reducing transportation emissions. Producing goods closer to where they are consumed cuts reliance on carbon-intensive global supply chains and strengthens the UK’s commitment to ‘net zero’. Renewable energy adoption is also accelerating, with manufacturers increasingly turning to wind, solar and hydro power. Significant investment in offshore wind, carbon capture and hydrogen technologies promises even greater progress in the years ahead.

Sustainability now begins at the design stage. Manufacturers are sourcing raw materials responsibly and prioritising recyclable or recycled components. Packaging is evolving too, with cardboard and paper replacing plastics to reduce environmental impact. Transport and logistics remain critical, as travel miles contribute heavily to emissions. Switching to electric or hybrid vehicles, alternative fuels like biodiesel, and even high-speed rail are helping manufacturers cut their carbon footprint.

The benefits of these changes extend beyond ecology to economics.

Improving efficiency through technology, reducing reliance on global supply chains and embracing renewable energy all lead to cost savings. Ms Chapman continued: “The case for ecological is also the case for economical.” Innovative solutions that reduce environmental impact can also unlock tax relief opportunities. The Government offers R&D tax incentives for businesses tackling scientific or technological challenges, whether by creating new processes or improving existing ones. These measures not only reduce tax liabilities but also build financial resilience, enabling reinvestment and continuous improvement.

At the meeting the Chesapeake Executive Council also approved the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement.
The refreshed Watershed Agreement commits signatories to address nutrient and sediment goals and outcomes by 2040, with a midpoint assessment in 2033, coinciding with the 50-year anniversary of the Chesapeake Bay Program.
The LGI projects will be reported to support pollution reduction goals under the multi-jurisdictional Conowingo Watershed Implementation Plan, which aims to reduces pollution entering the Chesapeake Bay from the Conowingo Dam reservoir.

The 2026 CAP Implementation Grant application round resulted in 222 approved projects that counties may complete over the next 12 to 24 months, resulting in an estimated reduction of more than 113,493 pounds/year of nitrogen, 28,816 pounds/year of phosphorus, and 11.8 million pounds/year of sediment delivered to the Chesapeake Bay. Pennsylvania has reduced more than 10 times the amount of nitrogen in the past 5 years than in the previous ten years, and water quality monitoring data shows significant improvements in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment levels.

“Pennsylvania’s clean water successes are rooted in collaboration—state, local, federal, legislative, and non-governmental partners, and of course landowners,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “The work will continue to evolve, and our focus will remain on setting our collaborative partnerships up for success well beyond 2025. The momentum is real, and you can see it in our improved water quality.”

The Chesapeake Executive Council is composed of the Governors of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At the meeting the Chesapeake Executive Council also approved the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. The refreshed Watershed Agreement commits signatories to address nutrient and sediment goals and outcomes by 2040, with a midpoint assessment in 2033, coinciding with the 50-year anniversary of the Chesapeake Bay Program. Under the Shapiro Administration, Pennsylvania has accelerated progress toward its clean water goals by investing new financial resources, targeting high performing pollution reduction strategies, implementing innovative technical solutions, listening to local leaders and stakeholders, and providing sustained support to implement county-based action plans.

The 2025 CAP Implementation Grants include $9.5 million from the state Environmental Stewardship Fund and $6.2 million in federal funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including $1.1 million in Local Government Implementation (LGI) Funds for project implementation in the Octoraro Watershed in Chester and Lancaster counties. The LGI projects will be reported to support pollution reduction goals under the multi-jurisdictional Conowingo Watershed Implementation Plan, which aims to reduces pollution entering the Chesapeake Bay from the Conowingo Dam reservoir.

Through an innovative new arrangement, the block grant funding model of the CAP Implementation Grant has enabled DEP’s Bureau of Clean Water to provide $100,000 of 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds to Mifflin County in support of restoration of the Town Run Watershed and $114,000 of federal Chesapeake Bay Implementation Grant funding through the Bureau of Watershed Restoration and Nonpoint Source Management for restoration efforts in the Hammer Creek Watershed. This is the first time the 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds have been targeted through a partnership between DEP programs toward the Countywide Action Plans.

The electric vehicle sector, once hailed as the unstoppable force reshaping transportation, is facing its most significant headwinds yet in 2025. Global sales of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles have shown signs of deceleration, with particular weakness in key markets like North America. This shift comes amid economic pressures, policy changes, and intensifying competition from Chinese manufacturers. According to recent data, while overall global sales grew modestly by about 21% to 18.5 million units this year, the pace has slowed compared to previous explosive growth periods, driven largely by surges in Europe but offset by stagnation elsewhere.

In the United States, the removal of federal tax credits has dealt a severe blow to demand. Tesla, the longtime market leader, saw its U.S. sales plummet to a near four-year low in November, dropping roughly 23% year-over-year to around 39,800 vehicles. This decline persists despite the company’s efforts to introduce more affordable models. Broader industry figures paint a similar picture: North American EV sales are on track for their first annual drop since 2019, with growth decelerating sharply after subsidies were phased out.

Chinese giants like BYD, however, continue to dominate on a global scale. BYD overtook Tesla in battery-electric vehicle deliveries back in the fourth quarter of 2023 and has maintained its lead, capturing a 15.4% share of the global BEV market in the third quarter of 2025. This success stems from aggressive pricing, rapid model launches, and strong domestic performance, even as China’s overall market approaches saturation.

Shifting Dynamics in Major Markets

The divergence between regions highlights the uneven progress of EV adoption. In Europe, sales have surged, contributing significantly to the global uptick. Factors such as stringent emissions regulations and renewed incentives have propelled growth, with battery-electric vehicles leading over plug-in hybrids in the mix through the first nine months of 2025. Reports from Autovista24 detail how brands like Volkswagen and emerging players have capitalized on this momentum, pushing BEV registrations ahead.

Contrast this with the U.S., where the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit has chilled consumer interest. Industry analysts note that without these incentives, many potential buyers are opting for traditional hybrids or sticking with internal combustion engines. Tesla’s struggles are emblematic: despite rolling out cheaper variants of its Model 3 and Model Y, the company has failed to reverse the sales skid. Exclusive estimates shared with Reuters underscore this, showing November figures as the lowest since early 2022.

Meanwhile, China’s market, which accounts for over half of global EV sales, is showing signs of plateauing. BYD and peers like Geely Holdings have expanded aggressively, with BYD securing approvals for 38 new models in China this year alone, far outpacing Tesla’s three. Yet, even here, Tesla’s share in the new energy vehicle segment slipped to 2.03% in October, dropping it out of the top 10 for the first time in years, as per data from CnEVPost.

Competitive Pressures and Innovation Races

The rise of Chinese manufacturers isn’t just a domestic story; it’s reshaping international competition. BYD’s global market share in battery-electric vehicles stood at 15% in the third quarter of 2025, with Tesla trailing at 13%. This shift is evident in emerging markets like South America, where EV sales are booming without significant Tesla presence. A Reuters report highlights how importers in Peru and elsewhere are turning to affordable Chinese options, bypassing Tesla’s import hurdles.

Tesla’s challenges extend beyond pricing. CEO Elon Musk’s focus on robotics and other ventures has drawn criticism for diverting attention from core auto sales. A separate Reuters analysis points out that while Musk secured a massive pay package, vehicle deliveries have stagnated, with global sales projected to remain flat for the second consecutive year. In the U.S. and Europe, Tesla’s brand image has suffered, leading to declines of 5.7% and 10.7% respectively in 2024, trends that have persisted into 2025.

Innovation speed is another battleground. Chinese firms like BYD and Geely are launching models at a blistering pace, with Rest of World noting how they outstrip U.S. counterparts in regulatory approvals and market entry. This agility allows them to respond quickly to consumer preferences, such as demand for affordable crossovers and sedans, further eroding Tesla’s once-dominant position.

Policy Impacts and Consumer Sentiment

Government policies remain a critical driver—or deterrent—in EV adoption. The U.S. rollback of tax incentives has not only hurt Tesla but also broader players like Ford, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, whose sales dipped in April, marking a 5.6% year-over-year decline for new EVs. Posts on X from industry observers echo this, with sentiments indicating that the middle tier of the market is cracking under pressure, even as Tesla and General Motors show isolated bright spots.

In contrast, Europe’s supportive framework has fueled a 21% global sales jump, as detailed in a recent Electrek article. Yet, even there, Tesla’s sales are faltering, down 40-45% year-over-year in key months, while Chinese EVs surge. This regional disparity underscores how policy stability can make or break market momentum.

Consumer sentiment, influenced by economic factors like inflation and high interest rates, adds another layer. In North America, buyers are increasingly wary of EV range anxiety and charging infrastructure gaps, opting instead for hybrids that offer familiarity. X posts from analysts like Troy Teslike highlight Tesla’s brand challenges in the U.S. and Europe, predicting flat or declining sales unless addressed.

Forecasts and Future Trajectories

Looking ahead, projections from the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 suggest that while global adoption will continue, growth rates may moderate to single digits in mature markets. China’s dominance is expected to persist, with BYD and Geely Holdings projected to hold 15% and 10% shares respectively by year’s end, based on quarterly data from Counterpoint Research.

Tesla, facing these headwinds, is pivoting toward autonomy and robotaxis, but skeptics argue this distracts from immediate sales needs. BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook anticipates that shared mobility and autonomous tech could reinvigorate the sector, but only if integrated with affordable vehicles.

Emerging markets offer glimmers of hope. South America’s EV boom, driven by non-Tesla imports, signals untapped potential. However, without policy harmonization, global fragmentation could deepen, leaving North America further behind.

Strategic Responses from Industry Players

Automakers are adapting in varied ways. BYD’s strategy of flooding markets with diverse, low-cost models has paid off, as evidenced by its Q4 2023 overtake of Tesla in global deliveries, per a Statista chart. This approach contrasts with Tesla’s premium focus, which has alienated price-sensitive buyers.

U.S. firms like General Motors are finding success with targeted models, bucking the broader decline. Yet, the overall North American drop—projected as the first since 2019—prompts questions about long-term viability without renewed subsidies.

Chinese expansion into Europe and beyond intensifies pressure. Visual Capitalist’s analysis shows China’s makers widening their lead, with global reach cementing positions in 2025.

Broader Implications for the Auto Sector

The slowdown affects supply chains, from battery production to raw materials. Declining demand in the U.S. could ripple through lithium and cobalt markets, already volatile.

Investors are recalibrating expectations. Tesla’s stock has reflected these woes, with X discussions pointing to a 70% sales drop in some European countries and a 49% shipment decline in China, juxtaposed against BYD’s 161% growth.

Ultimately, the EV sector’s path forward hinges on balancing innovation, policy, and affordability. As Chinese players consolidate gains, Western firms must innovate or risk obsolescence.

Evolving Consumer Preferences and Market Realities

Shifting buyer priorities, such as a preference for vehicles with longer ranges and faster charging, are reshaping offerings. Hybrids are gaining as a bridge technology, eroding pure EV share in transitional markets.

Infrastructure buildout remains crucial. In the U.S., inadequate charging networks exacerbate hesitancy, while China’s dense setup supports higher adoption.

Global forecasts indicate EVs could reach 20-30% of new sales by 2030, but 2025’s slump serves as a cautionary tale of over-reliance on incentives.

Pathways to Recovery and Growth

Strategies for revival include cost reductions through scale. BYD’s vertical integration model offers lessons for others.

Collaborations, like potential U.S.-China joint ventures, could accelerate tech transfer, though geopolitical tensions loom.

In summary, while challenges abound, the underlying shift toward electrification endures, propelled by environmental imperatives and technological advances.

As I wrote on Friday: this is both a transition and an expansion. Several folks will be stepping up to use this platform and I couldn’t be more excited to hear what comes next.

A platform, now with more places to stand

Archimedes said: “Give me a place to stand and I will move the Earth.” This podcast will become a platform for more people to stand.

The podcast is moving into a multi-host format, and one of those new voices is Matt Boms, Executive Director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance (TAEBA). Matt has been a leader on some of the most important energy work in Texas: distributed energy resources, affordability, energy waste reduction, grid flexibility, and much more.

How I got “bit by the bug”

Matt asked how I got into energy. The real answer is, slowly and then all at once.

My early work in energy policy was at the Texas Legislature, in a stretch (2005 to 2009) when a lot was happening and the instincts to build and expand were strong.

That period mattered because it shaped a belief I still hold today: Texas works best when we put pragmatism above ideology. Texas is a place to build and do big things.

The next frontier is the grid edge

One of the big themes in this conversation with Matt is that the “cheap electrons” story is true on the generation side, but bills keep climbing because transmission and distribution costs keep rising.

So if we’re serious about affordability, we have to talk about the distribution grid, and the tools that can help us defer (or avoid) some of the costs associated with building out the grid. We’re still going to spend a lot but can we avoid some of it?

That’s where distributed energy resources (DERs) come in, and where Texas has a real opportunity to lead.

Matt and TAEBA recently looked at what DERs could do in Oncor’s territory. The numbers are big, but here’s the one that sticks: about $279 per family per year in savings. If you want a sense of how big a difference that would make for many Texans, check out my discussion with Margo Weisz of the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute:

There are two core value buckets behind these savings:

Wholesale market value (DERs competing through aggregation, the work ERCOT is already moving through)

Transmission and distribution deferral or avoidance (often the larger, currently under-valued piece)

If we get the policy design right, DERs can help lower system costs, enable load growth, and reduce the pressure that shows up on people’s bills.

Final Thoughts

If you’ve been listening for a while, let the new team (more announcements on that soon) know what topics you want them to cover next.

The next chapter is going to be great. I can’t wait to listen!

Welcome back to the Energy Capital podcast. I’m your host, Doug Lewin. Today’s episode is a little different. The platform is expanding into a multi-host format. I’m really excited about these changes. I cannot wait to be a listener to this podcast and hear where it’s going. I’ve been working with your new hosts and there are several on the issues and topics and speakers they’re going to be inviting and I could not be more excited.

Doug Lewin (00:33.504)

about where this is gonna go. I put out a post this morning at the Texas Energy and Power newsletter called It’s a Transition and an Expansion. And that is exactly what it is. Change can be hard, but change can also be really good. And this is an opportunity for a lot of folks to use the platform that I have helped to build. There’s a famous quote from Archimedes where he says, give me a place to stand and I’ll move the earth.

Doug Lewin (01:03.768)

You all, dear listener, come on, it’s the Energy Capital podcast. Y’all, dear listeners, have given me a place to stand, given me a voice, and I’m deeply, deeply grateful for that. Now, other folks are gonna have this place to stand to move the Earth. Stand with them, help them through this transition and expansion, and I know you’re gonna be really excited to hear what comes next. So today, again, this is a little different.

Doug Lewin (01:31.2)

and thrilled to introduce one of the new voices who will be carrying this work forward. That’s Matt Bombs. Matt is the executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance, TABAA for short. They do some great work in Texas and Matt has done some great work, particularly around distributed energy resources. He was part of that aggregated distributed energy resource task force that has had a lot of success in Texas. He’s also part of the advisory committee on the backup power package program I talk a lot about. He was instrumental

Doug Lewin (02:00.138)

in getting the Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee established here in Texas. So he’s done a lot of great work. He is an expert in his own right. He is very interested and curious about all this stuff, just like I am. And I’m thrilled that he’s one of the people that is going to be stepping onto this platform. So what you’re here today is me interviewing Matt and Matt interviewing me. A little bit of a retrospective looking back. I hope you enjoy this episode and I hope you enjoy all the episodes going forward.

Doug Lewin (02:28.364)

I can’t wait to listen myself and I know you’re gonna like what comes next. So with that, thanks for listening and let’s jump in.

And now that I’m hosting the podcast with a few of my very talented and brilliant colleagues, it’s just a great opportunity to pick your brain and to hear more from you. I really do want to hear more about your story and how you first got into energy. What was the key factor that really brought you into this industry and how did you first get started?

Doug Lewin (03:11.522)

Yeah, Matt, before I jump into that, just want to say how thrilled I am to be able to take this platform that I think really is reaching a lot of people that are really interested in Texas energy. Texas is such a dynamic place and you’re such an important part of that ecosystem. And I’m thrilled that you’re excited to step into this role, like you mentioned with some others. So, you know, we, often joke in the energy world about energy transition and energy expansion. This is both, it’s going to be an energy transition and an expansion.

Doug Lewin (03:41.154)

You know, with, new hosts coming in and there’ll be multiple of them that’ll allow more exploration. And I’m just so thrilled you’re in that mix. So thanks, Matt. So to answer your question, it’s something I’ve talked about a little bit on the pod over the years, but not a lot. And yeah, look, I can’t even like tell you like, Hey, there was this moment or this, you know, day or week or month or year where it would like all clicked and like, this is what, like what I want to do with my professional life. It kind of happened over time.

Matt Boms (03:49.59)

Awesome. Thanks so much Doug.

Doug Lewin (04:09.614)

Certainly some of my first experiences with energy policy were at the legislature. And it was a time at the legislature, there was a really good time to be there. It 2005 to 2009. It was just a very different time over there, particularly related to energy policy. So like a lot of things were happening, right? 2005 Senate bill 20, which had an expansion of global portfolio standard, the big expansion of the transmission system commonly known as CREZ, but really that enabled a lot of the economic growth Texas had over the last 20 years.

Doug Lewin (04:39.758)

You know, that was passed in 05, 07, there was a major efficiency bill that was passed then. I had the privilege to work on that. That was with Representative Strauss before he was Speaker Strauss. And then, you know, 2000, when 2008, right, people forget this, but you had both Republican and Democratic candidates running on platforms that were extremely pro clean energy, climate action, all that kind of stuff. And obviously 2009, you had...

Doug Lewin (05:05.166)

President Obama and there was like RF funds and all that kind of stuff. So like, it was just kind of a fascinating time to be in there. Add to that, that like 2005, six Al Gore puts out inconvenient truth and Rick Perry fast tracked 11 coal plants. Now Perry was like, you know, pro wind and solar and pro transmission and pro coal. He’s got to like pro everything, but you know, 11 coal plants, right in the middle of that context of like this dawning awareness around climate change. It was just kind of, it was just a fascinating time.

Doug Lewin (05:33.932)

to be in it and I’ve always found the energy space to be dynamic and fast paced and interesting. And it’s just one of those subject areas that almost any subject areas this way, if you get bit by the bug and you’re into it enough, right? That there’s no like end to learning in it. I always feel that beginner’s mind thing is there that like any corner you turn, it’s like, wow. I didn’t know about that whole thing. Tell me about that. Right. I want to, I want to read up and get smart on that and

Doug Lewin (06:03.406)

after 20 years of doing this, I still have the same feeling. And to your point and your question, like that’s even more so now, right? The acceleration is accelerating, right? So like what I thought has always been a pretty dynamic space, way more dynamic now. And the amount of stuff that we all have to learn just to keep up, right? Not even get ahead, but just keep falling off the back of the treadmill. It’s, there’s so much right now. And I find that challenge of not just keeping up, but like,

Doug Lewin (06:32.962)

that challenge of really comprehending what’s going on, really seeing different stakeholders point of view and how do different entities view this very same problem so differently. So there’s this whole kind of social dimension to the work that I absolutely love as well. yeah, I can’t really like pinpoint a day or a year or something like that. It was just like the ledge through to be in the head of an energy efficiency organization to go into clear result. Everything throughout my career has just added to it and just sort of like.

Doug Lewin (07:01.398)

increased that passion every step along the way.

Matt Boms (07:04.866)

That’s really interesting, Doug, and I am really interested in hearing more about how things got more political. So you started in this role, you were working in the energy industry at a time where these different technologies were all emerging. And at a certain point, the technology itself began being painted as red or blue or whatever color of your choice. And I want to hear more about the politicization.

Matt Boms (07:29.718)

even leading up to Winter Storm Yuri, about how did that change happen and what was it like as someone who was actively working in the industry at that time?

Doug Lewin (07:36.61)

I

Doug Lewin (07:36.71)

think the politicization of energy, you know, is thankfully not as bad as in a lot of other areas, but it has at least tracked, if not equally, but sort of tracked the polarization that is happening in the countries and all. I’ll tell you, one of the, I’m proud of all the podcasts that I’ve done with Energy Capital Podcasts. And I’m going to be proud to hear all the ones you’re going to do. I’m so looking forward to being a listener going forward, but.

Doug Lewin (08:02.646)

You know, one of the ones I’m most proud of was with David Spence and it was about, you know, his book, brilliant book, Climate of Contempt, which sort of was the whole thing is about the polarization of climate policy. And I’ll say, I think that’s actually probably how it became so polarized was like climate change has become very polarized. The things that you wouldn’t have imagined 20 years ago could have become that polarized. know, McCain and Obama both running on doing something about climate change.

Doug Lewin (08:31.608)

Who would have thought like vaccinations would have become as politically polarized as they are. But I will say, I think this is an issue area where you see really, really interesting alliances, left, right, center. And I think it’s because if you can kind of step back and kind of focus on first principles, we all want a reliable and affordable and clean grid. Like I don’t care what your political ideology is. You don’t like air pollution. Like nobody wants to have polluted.

Doug Lewin (09:00.394)

skies and water. Like that’s not something somebody sets out to do. I think in this industry, people are actually pretty mature about understanding that there are trade-offs and that those trade-offs are quite real. And so I think as much as possible, Matt, what I have tried to do, and I hope you’ll continue to do this on this platform, is to dial down that temperature, to have discussions with...

Doug Lewin (09:26.996)

The first question of asking somebody to come on the podcast isn’t what political tribe are you a part of? It’s do you have interesting thoughts on energy? They may not be the same as my thoughts on energy. I actually hope they aren’t because if we’re only talking to people we agree with 100%, like what’s the point? I mean, you know, some of it is to explore differences. Some of it is just to learn from experts that know, you know, that’s been my great joy in doing this is having people on that know so much more than me that I can ask questions of.

Doug Lewin (09:57.014)

and get smarter and help the audience get smarter too. And I’ll tell you, I mean, I’m just so excited about some of the possibilities of, you know, cross ideological cross partisan. And I don’t even want to just say bipartisan. Like it could be all kinds of different beliefs that if you come to this from, want cheap, fast, reliable, clean power. Like

Doug Lewin (10:22.764)

Let’s talk about what are the things we can do to get all those. know, competition, right? That’s one of those places that like, you know, you get broad agreement in general, not a hundred percent, but broad agreement left and right that like competition is generally a good thing, particularly on the right, which has made things like really, really interesting in Texas. So I think as much as possible to depoliticize it, to dial the temperature down, to look for areas of commonality, you know, it’s interesting.

Doug Lewin (10:52.29)

Chairman Flores of ERCOT gave a speech at, I think it was at Gulf Coast Power Association where he talked about like, can we look for our similarities first and our differences next? And I just think that’s so powerful. And I’ve always tried to do that in my career, like connect with somebody first and then explore the differences. I think too many people are just leading with their differences. And like that’s on a human level makes it very hard to work with anybody.

Matt Boms (11:18.286)

Yeah, I completely agree with you. And that is not limited to energy, right? We’re seeing that across our entire society. And I think you said at the outset that speaks to kind of your curiosity as a person, but the fact that you’re not married to your ideas, right? Things change. We’re constantly learning. A lot of these concepts are new and emerging. AI is only beginning to emerge as this new pillar of society. We’re all going to have a lot to learn here.

Matt Boms (11:46.508)

moving forward. I think that at the outset, if we can just drop our prior set of expectations and maybe any biases that we have, that will help us all come together and work in a more productive way. And I certainly think that what you mentioned about competitive markets being, know, historically Republican principle in a Republican state, that was probably the single biggest factor in the renewable industry having success in Texas and continues to be right. So that will be

Matt Boms (12:16.334)

crucial moving forward. And I think that’s what’s bringing a lot of solar, wind and battery companies to Texas because of the competitive market that we have here. You don’t see that in other states. see even blue states having trouble with the renewable build out because of permitting problems or because of regulatory issues that they’re facing, because of the backlogs and interconnection that they have. And as a state, we’ve been able to leapfrog a lot of those problems. And there’s a whole bunch of reasons behind that that you can take us through.

Matt Boms (12:45.486)

But I think overall you’re right that the taking the ideology out of it and maybe focusing less on politics and more on practical solutions is probably how we’re going to move forward here and meet the load growth that’s coming. So that’s what I want to hear from you too is how are we going to possibly, some of the numbers are mind blowing. You’ve gone through this in previous podcast episodes. How do you see us meeting this next big challenge and this big tsunami of load growth that’s coming?

Doug Lewin (13:10.092)

Yeah. Well, first, before I get to that, I just want to back up to something you said just a minute ago, right? So like competition, yes, Texas has been a red state for a long time. When Senate Bill seven was passed, the house was still democratic. So it was a very bipartisan bill. Senate was Republican. Governor was Republican. House was democratic. And they had to find those solutions across, know, bicameral, bipartisan. And competition had strong support in the democratic house with Speaker

Doug Lewin (13:39.182)

Pete Laney, if I’ve got this right, and I think I do, it’s within a couple of votes, but I think it was 146 out of 150 voted for Senate Bill 7. So like, and again, I came into the legislature like a few years after that, and I think we’ve seen, there’s still a lot of bills that get that many votes, but not as many big bills. And that’s what I would hope we can start to get to is as a state, if we say these are the things we prioritize, right? Again, clean, cheap, fast, reliable, like,

Doug Lewin (14:08.81)

What are the things that kind of meet all of those things or most of those things? And how do we balance those using competitive market forces? And I’ll tell you, as far as the load growth goes, it’s really amazing. There was a study that Aurora did for ERCOT on the Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service. There were a lot of different models they ran and there’s a lot of different results that came out. There was only one result.

Doug Lewin (14:34.776)

that had 0.0 gigawatts worth of load shed in a winter storm Elliott, which was the 2022 winter storm in December, right before Christmas or 2023 heat wave. There’s only one that had zero rolling outages. And that was the very high data center load growth scenario. That was the only one like, you know, you could spend all this money and build new ancillary services and capacity markets, capacity constructs, all that kind of stuff. And you would still have.

Doug Lewin (15:05.022)

some outages. The one exception was the high load growth. And what they were modeling was if we had high load growth and data centers are bringing their own generation and 60 % of them have flexibility in them, that would get you down to 0.0. So I think, again, no matter what your political persuasion is, the investment that could be coming to the state, the potential to actually get the most reliable grid possible, right?

Doug Lewin (15:34.398)

while spreading the fixed cost of the system out to more users. Like all of this is there right in front of us. And I couldn’t be more excited to continue to be working in Texas towards this vision of a clean, reliable, affordable, you know, power grid, which we’ve made huge strides over the last five years in this state. There’s just no denying it. We got a long way to go. And pretty soon here, we’re going to flip the mic around. I’m going to ask you questions, Matt, because I know you over the last several years.

Doug Lewin (16:01.986)

have been working on some of the very things that I think are like most essential to get to that clean, reliable, affordable grid. So yeah, we’ll do that in a second, but I don’t know. I don’t want to cut you off. had any other like burning questions you want to ask.

Matt Boms (16:16.716)

Well, yeah, what changes now, because for most of your career, you know, correct me if I’m wrong, we didn’t have the kind of low growth that we have now, right? So that’s right. That’s a huge, drastic change from how energy has functioned over the last few decades, right? So where do we go from here? Like, where do you see policymakers really changing their views and making sure that we’re bringing these businesses to Texas instead of turning them away because we don’t have enough power?

Doug Lewin (16:47.202)

Yeah, look, to me, there’s so much, right? This is so complicated. Obviously, there’s a long record there for people to go back and listen to, hearing all this stuff. But to me, this kind of boils down to three main things, right? You’ve gotta keep the conditions for new supply to want to come to Texas. We have built more supply here than any other state by far. It’s not close.

Doug Lewin (17:11.406)

And that’s because of the competitive market design. So I think being protective of that competitive market design, keeping those price signals, you know, at the ERCOT board meeting, there’s some discussion around, not getting enough gas built. The gas queue has tripled in the last 18 months because those signals are coming from the new demand, right? So I think keeping that where particularly solar storage and gas, like those are the things that are going to be built over the next years. Wind too, there’ll be some wind in the mix, but.

Doug Lewin (17:40.194)

you know, probably not as much as the other three. Transmission, to be able to move all that power around and to be doing it in a way that is not, it’s not always congested, driving up costs, causing reliability problems. Congestion is not just a cost issue. It’s a reliability problem too. If you’ve got generation in a part of the state and you can’t move it to where it’s needed, you got reliability problems, right? We’ve had that South of San Antonio the last several years and we got it, we got to get ahead of that.

Doug Lewin (18:06.702)

And think ERCOT’s work on building out a 765 system, we’re recording on a day when the ERCOT board approved the building of the Eastern half of the 765 system. So that I think is really key. And then the last one, and this is probably a good segue to flip this around. And let me start asking you some questions, is the demand side. And I know you, Matt, you’ve played a huge leadership role in Texas on demand side.

Doug Lewin (18:30.686)

Demand side to me, look, I’ve spent a big part of my career working on energy efficiency and DERs, VPPs before anybody knew what a VPP was. Well, a few people knew, but it wasn’t as talked about as it is now, right? And I think that for a long time, the perception was, those are interesting and nice. Sure, who’s supposed to saving some energy and getting lower bills? Those are nice, but it was always just kind of like, there’s a little pat on the head, great work.

Doug Lewin (19:00.334)

cool, but that’s not the real stuff. In this environment with rapid load growth, those demand side solutions become absolutely essential and central. There’s a big discussion going on right now in the Twitterverse around this. Matt Iglesias had an article out, which I haven’t read yet, so I probably shouldn’t talk about it. I’ve only seen his tweets. So I will go read the article, Matt Iglesias, and digest your whole argument. But what I can gather from the Twitter spats is like,

Doug Lewin (19:29.548)

there is this kind of debate going on of like, is it more supply or demand side stuff? we be like demand flexibility and energy efficiency just aren’t going to be enough to meet our needs. We need to build more supply. And it’s like, well, of course, like, but, that’s not a binary. You don’t have to choose one or the other of those things. And, and as a matter of fact, if you choose one or other of those things, you’re probably going to end up short. We’re going to need resources everywhere we can get them. And that includes demand side resources and supply side resources.

Doug Lewin (19:59.616)

I just think that is a false choice if ever there was one. So I really think building up energy efficiency, distributed energy resources. So if you’re okay, Matt, I’m start asking you questions. Is that all right?

Matt Boms (20:12.856)

Yeah, I think you just did ask me like five questions.

Doug Lewin (20:14.958)

Doug Lewin (20:15.359)

So talk to us about distributed energy resources and energy efficiency. Tell us a little about your work in that area and what kind of excites you about that, what you’re excited to be working on.

Matt Boms (20:26.36)

Yeah, well, I think the way I like to think about this is electricity is the backbone of our economy, right? Like I went to school, I studied economics and the feeling that I have is the electric grid is the backbone for local economic development. There are other countries that don’t have the luxury that we have in the United States of having an abundant electric grid. And there are countries where businesses simply can’t operate because they don’t have a stable grid.

Matt Boms (20:55.33)

to count on like we do here. They also don’t have cheap electricity, right, which is something that we take for granted, just generally speaking, right? We have some variations across states, across counties, but for the most part, Americans have access to reliable, affordable electricity. And those are the key words that we want to keep it affordable. We want to keep it reliable. And that’s, think, the challenge that we’re going to be facing now with all the new data centers that are coming to Texas. So I think my feeling on this, Doug, is also that it’s not black and white. It’s not one or the other.

Matt Boms (21:25.292)

You can make the same argument that I just heard you make when it comes to different technologies, whether it’s solar, batteries, gas, wind, DERs, energy waste, transmission infrastructure. We need all of that. It’s not going to be choosing winners and losers. It’s going to be all of these different technologies playing their role in meeting our energy needs moving forward. Yep. So the key piece for me is how do we keep it flexible?

Matt Boms (21:51.466)

And I think the flexibility is what’s going to drive affordability and reliability in Texas. I don’t think that we’re at a point now in ERCOT where we can say our grid is sufficiently flexible to meet all of the load that’s coming. I think we have a lot of work to do. I think you can see that through price volatility. You can see that in parts of the state where during heat wave or a winter storm, the price signals are exorbitantly high and

Matt Boms (22:19.852)

distributed resources aren’t being valued the way that they should, right? There’s no reason we shouldn’t be valuing battery storage or backup generators or smart thermostats for the value that they’re bringing on those days that we really need them. And that might only be 1 % of the year, but when we really do need to count on them, that’s where we’re going to have to think of ways to support those technologies. And by doing that, you’re going to bring the costs down for consumers, right? Because right now it certainly feels like

Matt Boms (22:49.282)

For anyone that owns a home in Texas that has looked into rooftop solar or batteries, the prices are still too high. They’re just not affordable enough. And I think that’s where the policy comes in because the policy creates the market that we need to set up for distributed resources.

Doug Lewin (23:05.25)

Yeah, I was just going to say like that is, you when you talk about yes, like power is more reliable here, or more, I should say more affordable, more reliable too. But your point was it’s more affordable here than is a lot of places in the world. A lot of places you just can’t get electricity. Important to acknowledge, and I know you do acknowledge this, you just started to talk about it there, that like for a lot of people, power is, is unaffordable, right? We have a, we have a large portion of the population.

Doug Lewin (23:30.808)

that is really struggling to pay their bills, 30 to 40 % that are making choices between paying their power bills, paying for food and medicine. So this is really where I think it becomes really important when you’re talking about flexibility, if we can bring those flexible resources, whether they be batteries or demand response, right, through thermostats, heat pumps that are connected to a thermostat and have variable speed, all of those kinds of things.

Doug Lewin (23:58.434)

that you can meet, just like you said, Matt, that 1 % of the year, maybe it’s 2 % some years if there’s a really bad heat wave, but you’re talking about, you know, a few hundred hours, right, during a winter storm, right, having those batteries that are on the distributed network. And a lot of people say the batteries only last for one or two hours. If you’ve got a battery in your garage, it could be configured to last a lot longer than an hour or two. This is a common perception I think we’ve really got to get after, that every battery is only a one or two hour battery. Not true.

Doug Lewin (24:27.958)

It depends how it’s configured and we can stretch them out and have all kinds of different configurations to them. And if we can do that, not only does that bring the price of generation down, that means in some cases we won’t have to do as extensive a build out of the distribution grid, right? Which is the biggest driver of higher energy bills right now is on the distribution grid. So I know

Doug Lewin (24:53.422)

You and the organization, Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance, put out a study recently looking at the encore service territory and what DERs could mean for that. I think the number was something like eight and a half billion in savings over 10 years. Tell us a little about the findings and how could we actually get to those savings? What policy solutions might unlock some of those savings for consumers?

Matt Boms (25:16.43)

Sure, yeah, the calculation was around $2,000 in savings per rate payer over the next 10 years. And that’s a huge amount of savings for, like you said, folks that are struggling to pay their energy bills that really could use that relief, right? And might not necessarily have the capital to go out right now and buy a huge solar and battery system to install on their house. Or for a small business that frankly we’ve seen in Houston.

Matt Boms (25:45.272)

small businesses that after Hurricane Barrel went out and purchased backup generators because they can’t just accept a week without a business because a hurricane swept in and wiped out their power, right? And to your point, there are plenty of stories after Barrel of folks that did weather the storm through battery systems and through rooftop solar. So I think we have the arguments and we have the case studies to show that the technologies are working. You asked about what are the policies that could be put in place to solve the problem.

Matt Boms (26:15.054)

The way that the number was calculated as far as the roughly $2,000 per rate payer is on the one hand, you have the wholesale market value, right? So you have, if these technologies could compete in the wholesale market, how much potentially could we assign in value to those distributed resources? And that’s happening through the aggregated DER project, right? There’s a lot of work that needs to be done there, but it’s working its way through ERCOT.

Matt Boms (26:40.77)

The other half that is not at all being valued right now is through the transmission and distribution deferral, right? So for every distributed resource that’s put on the grid, you are ultimately deferring transmission and distribution that needs to be built out in the long-term, right? So that means an overloaded substation that might need to be replaced, but can you replace that with batteries or with whatever distributed technology works best for that particular location in Texas, right?

Matt Boms (27:10.614)

Right now we have a system set up where we are just building out poles and wires through our transmission and distribution utilities and we’re not assigning any value to DERs when they can be a more cost effective technology for rate payers. Because ultimately we’re trying to save money for rate payers through these technologies. So that’s where most of the value comes from, Doug. I know that you had Astrid Atkinson on your podcast recently who spoke about

Matt Boms (27:37.794)

The fact that it can be up to 75 % of the value of distributed resources could be attributed to that TND deferral, right? That’s the big piece here that we’re missing within the ERCOT system because that whole part of the value stack is missing currently in the way that our market is set up.

Doug Lewin (27:53.998)

Yeah, and the podcasts with Charles Hua, with Margo Weiss, like, you know, we see that the lines for generation have been relatively flat to some years down. Every once in a while you get a little blip like 2022 with the Russian invasion where like generation goes up. But generally, overtime cost of generation going down for two reasons. And when we talking about the competitive market earlier and you said, you know, it’s brought a lot of renewables, it also brought a ton of gas, right? Especially in the mid-aughts, right? Really cheap gas.

Doug Lewin (28:22.35)

cheap renewables have lowered the cost generation. Meanwhile, the lines for transmission and distribution are going up. Now I said earlier, I really do believe we need the 765 build out. It’s really important to be able to move power around more efficiently. Large amounts of power, those lines can carry four to six times the amount of the next voltage down. So we’ve really got to look to that distribution grid. And that’s really what I think this study is a really good one. We talked about it a little bit, I hope.

Doug Lewin (28:47.862)

Matt, you might be able to have Demand Site Analytics that did that excellent study. And I understand you guys are doing another one that is ERCOT wide that’ll come out at some point. So maybe that’ll be a good interview for you on the podcast going forward is really getting into that study and breaking down some of the assumptions there and how could those savings go bigger? How would they be smaller? What kinds of policies do we actually need to unlock those savings, right?

Matt Boms (29:10.584)

Yeah, that’s right. I also think this is an area where Texas could lead the country, right? Like it really is the new frontier. If you think about all the data centers that are being built and how they can contribute to that flexibility in Texas, that’s a huge opportunity. Like that’s the way we can unlock all of this load growth and the business opportunity in Texas, because all of a sudden you’re talking about dozens of gigawatts that are going to be coming online over the next few years.

Matt Boms (29:38.162)

And you have the capital to make it happen. You’ve got data centers that really the number one priority is how fast can I get power, right? It’s not about the capital that they have on hand. It’s about the speed that they can possibly get connected to our grid. So there’s an incentive there for making the grid more flexible and that enables more data center interconnection. So I’m hopeful that this will happen. I just think that we need to change the way we think about electricity, right? For those of us that have worked in this industry, we’re used to thinking about

Matt Boms (30:06.85)

the utilities delivering electrons to our homes and businesses. And something that is true, and like you said, we need those 765 lines to bring us cheap electrons from rural parts of the state. However, we also need to flip that on the table and say, well, these technologies weren’t around when the system was created, right? And so now all of sudden you have this great battery storage technology that can enable folks to generate their own power, right? And they should be rewarded for bringing flexibility to the grid.

Doug Lewin (30:34.862)

And you know what’s a great way to get like new resources onto the grid competition and markets. I actually got chills, Matt, when you said Texas could lead this, cause that has been a huge theme on this podcast, right? For years. And I’m so happy that you’re like grabbing the torch and going to keep that going forward. Cause that really is a theme here is Texas has a lot going for it. We have the elements here to put all that together. And I think you’ve got that vision.

Doug Lewin (31:04.66)

You can see that. You can kind of see that you got a puzzle in front of you. All the pieces are there. We’ve got the competitive market. You know, that means we’ve got competitive retail electric providers. We’ve got very innovative co-ops and munis as well. There’s a ton. I hope you’ll do some podcasts with, especially some of the co-ops. think I only did, I think it was only Bandera. Was that the only co-op? So like that’s kind of a big, big hole in this podcast that needs to be filled. There’s a lot going on at co-ops right now.

Doug Lewin (31:33.696)

in the competitive market, et cetera, Texas really has all those pieces to put together markets that send a price signal to these distributed resources to lower that distribution spending, bend the curve downward. And while we’re doing that, put those resources on people’s premises so that they have reliable and resilient service, even through those storms. Before we end, I just want to ask you just one more thing. And again, we’re teeing up like a bunch of different

Doug Lewin (32:03.768)

podcast episodes. hope the audience is getting a sense here, right? Dear listener that like there is no shortage of stuff to cover. There’s no shortage of people to cover it. I’m so excited to become a listener and hear where all this is going. But you’ve been working a lot on this Texas backup power package program, right? So this is this very innovative. think it instantly talk about Texas being a leader. Here’s Texas actually putting $1.8 billion towards

Doug Lewin (32:30.934)

Effectively microgrids, they may or may not actually be microgrids depending on how they’re configured, but effectively microgrids backup power systems at critical facilities like police stations and nursing homes, water treatment facilities, et cetera. You’ve been involved in that from the very beginning. Can you just share with the audience a little bit kind of a little bit more about what that is and why that’s exciting, why that’s been a priority for you over the last few years to work on and you know.

Doug Lewin (32:57.026)

what you might explore here on the podcast related to that really innovative program Texas has.

Matt Boms (33:02.062)

If we go back to the 2023 legislative session, this was part of SB 2627 that initially set up the Texas Energy Fund. think when folks hear Texas Energy Fund, they think of gas plants, That just automatically where our mind goes. But I constantly remind people that there’s the 1.8 billion allocated to the Backup Power Program, right? Of the 10 billion, 1.8 is for Backup Power. And so there’s a significant amount of resources that the state has allocated to this program.

Matt Boms (33:31.552)

I was surprised when it was first created that this hadn’t been done since Winter Storm URI. Like that was something that really stood out to me because you would hope that by now we would have backed up critical facilities. And I think it’s our obligation as people who work in this industry to make sure that hospitals, police, fire stations, nursing homes have power. If God forbid we have another Winter Storm URI event, we want to make sure that we’re taking care of.

Matt Boms (33:58.178)

our most vulnerable Texans, right? That’s something that we can all agree on. That’s not a partisan issue at all, right? We all want to protect vulnerable people in our state. So that was the impetus for the program. And I give a lot of credit to Alison Silverstein, who really put her blood, sweat, and tears into this program. And it’s something that we continue to work on with the Public Utility Commission. So I think the hope is that this will be launched next year.

Matt Boms (34:21.698)

This will be a program that ideally will bring in all the different vendors that are already manufacturing these technologies. It has to be a combination of solar, battery, and generator, right? It has to have those three. As an alternative, it could be electric school buses because those are essentially batteries on wheels, right? So those could be, if the load is small enough at some of these facilities, the electric school bus could absolutely power the facility for 48 continuous hours, which is what the statute says.

Matt Boms (34:50.082)

So I think what I’m looking forward to is the rollout of the program. I’m looking forward to bringing in private sector companies that are excited to roll up their sleeves and get these technologies out to rural communities across the state. And I think we also have to think about bringing in the critical facilities, making sure that they’re aware of this program, because, you know, it’s like when a tree falls in a forest kind of deal with if the critical facilities aren’t paying attention to this program, then they won’t know it exists. So I think we also have to support the program by bringing in all the different stakeholders and making sure that.

Matt Boms (35:20.12)

they’re aware that the program is here to support them. then hopefully next time a winter event or a summer event happens, these backup power packages will be in place to provide reliable power for those facilities.

Doug Lewin (35:33.902)

It’s such, such an important program. It’s such an important policy. And by the way, an example of where, you know, you had good bipartisan bicameral policy making happening. Like those are major policy decisions that take a lot of different input from a lot of different folks and kudos to the ledge for figuring that out. Now the PC is working to implement that and you’ll continue to cover that here. know that the backup power packages will be something also that could be talked about.

Doug Lewin (36:01.262)

at the Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee, which you helped to get going. So we won’t talk about that one right now, but I’m just trying to tee up a lot of the different things that I know you’re gonna be talking about in the coming months. And I hope the audience is as excited as I am to get some different voices in here, explore some different topics that maybe I didn’t cover as much. And I just couldn’t be more excited about this next chapter. Matt, since we were interviewing each other, the question I always ask at the end, as you know,

Doug Lewin (36:29.704)

Is there anything I forgot to ask you? want to say anything you want to add? And then guess you can ask it back of me, but I’ll add, I don’t have anything to add. I’m good. Anything you want to add, Matt.

Matt Boms (36:39.15)

I just want to say that we’ll miss you and I know you’ll still be around. And I want to say thank you because you’ve been really an inspiration and source of so much knowledge and information that this podcast has served a lot of people over all the episodes that you’ve recorded. You’ve just been a wealth of knowledge and leadership and inspiration for me, Doug, and I know for a lot of my colleagues. So just want to say thank you and salute you. And I know you’re not disappearing, but just as this chapter comes to an end, I just want to say thank you on behalf of

Matt Boms (37:08.778)

Driving away from the solar shed, Teichert and Thornock said their history with Rocky Mountain Power contradicts other utilities’ arguments against net-metering.
Less than two percent of all Wyoming homes have rooftop solar panels, according to estimates from the Solar Energy Industry Association.","COKEVILLE, Wyo.—Tim Teichert and Jason Thornock want the sun to help them survive as ranchers in Cokeville, Wyoming. On an overcast May day, the two drove around the one-restaurant town, lamenting high electricity prices and restrictive Wyoming laws that they say have thrown an unnecessary burden onto their broad shoulders.

“I pay $90,000 in an electric bill,” Teichert said as he and Thornock made their way through fields of cattle, alfalfa and hay. “Jason’s about $150,000. If Jason had that $150,000 back, his kids could all come back to Cokeville, and work and live here, and you’d be able to raise kids here in Cokeville.”

In 2023, hoping to improve their margins, Teichert and Thornock each applied for Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grants, which the Biden administration had infused with $2 billion to help support farmers interested in renewable energy.

While neither man was thrilled about the prospect of applying for federal funds—they prefer smaller government—they were interested in using solar to cover their own electrical demand. Teichert and Thornock say this could have saved them five or six figures annually, and made their businesses more attractive to their kids.

Across Wyoming and the U.S., Americans increasingly face skyrocketing electricity bills. In 2023, Rocky Mountain Power, Teichert and Thornock’s utility and the largest in Wyoming, asked regulators at the state’s Public Service Commission to approve a nearly 30 percent rate increase; the next year, they asked to raise rates by close to 15 percent. Though both requests were ultimately granted at lower rates, affordability concerns have sent almost every corner of Wyoming scrambling for ways to defray rising electricity costs.

A fraction of homeowners already do this in the Equality State by using credits from their utility for generating their own electricity using solar panels and sending excess amounts back to the grid, an arrangement known as net metering. But Wyoming law caps net-metering systems at 25 kilowatts, large enough to include just about any homeowner’s rooftop solar system, but too small to provide enough credits to offset all the electricity larger properties, like ranches, draw from the grid.

Earlier this year, a coalition of environmentalists, businesses and ranchers, including Teichert and Thornock, unsuccessfully supported a bill that would have raised Wyoming’s net-metering cap to 250 kilowatts.

Teichert and Thornock were initially counting on changes to the law as they eyed REAP funds. Teichert, a sturdy man with pale blue eyes and a trim Fu Manchu mustache, eventually applied and was awarded a $440,000 grant to build a ranch shed supporting around 250 kilowatts of solar panels. Today, with no ability to net meter, he fears he may never recoup his investment, which was over $500,000. Thornock, whose wide, boyish grin sits atop a hefty build, was approved for $868,000 in REAP funding to build a 648-kilowatt solar system. Concerned that his project’s viability rested on the judgment of state lawmakers, he returned the money.

The Department of Agriculture has since stopped funding renewable energy projects on farmland. REAP was a “huge opportunity we all missed in Wyoming,” Thornock said.

The two men are not the only Wyoming ranchers interested in using solar to give their businesses more stability.

“A lot of ranchers really look to renewables to help diversify their revenue stream, keep the ranch whole, and keep their family on the ranch, keep the land together,” said Chris Brown, executive director of Powering Up Wyoming, a renewable energy advocacy group. Most of the ranchers he’s worked with are interested in leasing their lands to solar developers, rather than purchasing their own systems, and his organization is neutral on net-metering.

Rocky Mountain Power says it is open to changes in the state’s net-metering laws, and the utility did not take a position on net metering during last spring’s legislative session.

“It’s not a level playing field; you’re dealing with a monopoly—a government-subsidized monopoly, government-protected monopoly.”

— Jason Thornock

“We have worked diligently in recent decades with customers, municipalities, state legislatures, in order to facilitate particular regulatory and pricing changes to allow customers to meet their energy goals,” said David Eskelsen, a spokesperson for PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company and a subsidiary of billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.

If rate hikes keep coming and margins don’t improve, Teichert, who runs his ranch with his brother, fears he and Thornock will eventually have to sell their lands, which crisscross much of Cokeville. They find other utilities’ arguments against net-metering expansion dubious, and fume at the business model and regulatory environment that allows utilities to earn enormous profits but restricts their customers from making their own energy use more affordable. The two ranchers find it particularly ironic that Rocky Mountain Power could build power lines across their property to carry renewable energy to California, Oregon and Washington, while it is illegal for them to install enough solar panels to cover their own electrical bills.

“It’s not a level playing field; you’re dealing with a monopoly—a government-subsidized monopoly, government-protected monopoly,” Thornock said on his ride to see Teichert’s solar array. “It’s got all the power in the world. And, like Tim says, they want to sell renewable energy to California, [Washington] and Oregon. They won’t let us do it because they want the control.”

Reaping Few Rewards

Teichert pulled his truck through a gate and into a field of alfalfa and hay. Just beyond was a shed with 18 red steel legs that looked like an enormous centipede straddling bales of hay and some farming equipment. On top of the shed sat Teichert’s $1.1 million solar system, which was designed to cover the electrical costs of running all his irrigation system’s pivots and pumps.

If Teichert could net meter, he says he would be more competitive with ranchers just a few miles away in Idaho and Utah, where net-metering laws are much less restrictive than in Wyoming.

In Idaho, ranchers can install up to 100 kilowatts of solar, and that number jumps to 2 megawatts for ranchers in Utah, 80 times the limit in Wyoming.

Rocky Mountain Power charges irrigators different base electricity rates in each state, but regardless of the price of the power, any savings are helpful to big users like agricultural operations.

“Quite a few of the farmers [in Idaho and Utah] do it,” said Teichert, of net-metered solar.

In 2023, while Teichert was designing his system, Thornock was considering whether it was wise to spend his money on a solar array. He believed there was a good chance Wyoming wouldn’t change its law to increase the cap on net metering. Since his system would be more than 25 times the size that’s allowed to net meter, Thornock anticipated it would be extremely difficult for it to pay for itself if he wasn’t credited for sending excess electricity to the grid. He backed out of his REAP grant, and advised Teichert to do the same.

But Teichert forged ahead and installed his panels, believing it would be no big deal to convince Wyoming lawmakers to adjust the state’s net-metering law—especially given the more advantageous arrangement ranchers in Idaho and Utah enjoy with the same utility. “I thought I’d be ahead of everybody,” he said.

Once the bill to raise Wyoming’s net-metering cap failed, Teichert pivoted. He began exploring a power purchase agreement with Rocky Mountain Power, in which the utility would buy electricity from him like he was a power plant. He said he had been told by the company installing his panels that a power purchase agreement could net him a good deal.

But when he saw how much the utility would pay him, he laughed. The utility would give him less than 1 cent per kilowatt hour in winter periods of low demand, and about 4 cents in peak summer demand hours. He would get much more of a financial benefit from the electricity he sent to the grid if he was instead compensated through net metering, which Wyoming law typically requires be credited at Rocky Mountain Power’s retail rate of electricity. The utility charges him around 14 cents per kilowatt hour, he said.

Setting up to sell his excess electricity to the grid through a power purchase agreement could leave Teichert even deeper in the hole, he added, as the utility informed him it would need $43,000 just to look at connecting his system to its grid.

Originally, Teichert expected to pay off his solar shed in 10 years, but with the additional costs and the rates the utility offered, “I don’t know that I’ll ever come out on the deal,” he said.

And now, the federal support that incentivized him to pursue solar has been eliminated; in August the Department of Agriculture announced it would no longer fund solar or wind projects through REAP.

Teichert eventually decided to purchase a battery system to back up his panels. He does not plan on selling any of his electricity to Rocky Mountain Power.

“I should have listened to Jason,” he said.

Thornock feels he dodged a bullet.

Driving away from the solar shed, Teichert and Thornock said their history with Rocky Mountain Power contradicts other utilities’ arguments against net-metering.

Lines in the Valley

The biggest of the power lines crisscrossing the valley where Teichert and Thornock ranch belong to PacifiCorp, whose planned Gateway West project to deliver renewable energy to customers in California, Oregon and Washington would add even more lines. Some of those new lines could cross Teichert and Thornock’s properties, the men say.

They’ve got more experience with power lines than most utility customers, as they actually built some of the smaller lines coming off Rocky Mountain Power’s system.

Both men say the utility sent inflated estimates of the cost to install new lines to bring additional power to their growing ranching operations, leading them to seek help elsewhere.

In 2020, Teichert said he contracted a company to put in a power line for about $600,000 after the utility told him he would need to pay over $1 million for the same job, he said. Thornock has repeatedly testified to state lawmakers that Rocky Mountain Power nearly bankrupted him when he first began ranching in the late 2000s after going back and forth with him about whether they would deliver power on lines he had installed. Thornock wound up in court and lost, then had to cover the utility’s attorney fees.

The whole saga “was that close to breaking me,” he said, as Teichert drove by the poles he had installed.

Utilities warn that net-metering systems can allow those with rooftop solar to avoid paying fixed expenses for the grid they feed into, like system maintenance and construction costs, which, according to reporting by the New York Times, account for a growing share of utilities’ spending. “That in effect sets up a subsidy flowing from customers who don’t use net-metering systems to those who do,” said Eskelsen, PacifiCorp’s spokesperson. Any price issues rooftop solar customers cause are confined within their “rate class” of customers who use a similar amount of electricity, he added.

Determining how—or whether—to alter the rates for net-metering customers to make sure they’re paying their fair share for the infrastructure that takes their excess energy has been a sticking point between utilities and Wyoming’s net-metering supporters. Rooftop solar supporters say that subsidization likely occurs all over the grid regardless of whether a homeowner or business is net metering, and claim that avoiding transmission costs saves all ratepayers money.

Experts generally say that rooftop solar’s dependence on infrastructure that it isn’t paying for won’t create billing issues until 10 to 20 percent of a utility’s customer base is in the program. Less than two percent of all Wyoming homes have rooftop solar panels, according to estimates from the Solar Energy Industry Association.

Given all the work he’s paid for, Teichert finds utilities’ arguments about cost sharing disingenuous. “When they sit there and say, ‘Well, we’re not paying our share,’ we’ve more than paid our share,” Teichert said. “That bugs me that they lie like that.”

Thornock said he would be happy to pay for any issues a net-metering solar system may cause—provided the new rate is fair, and preferably not suggested by a utility.

“We’re not asking for a handout. I don’t want Rocky Mountain Power subsidizing me,” he said. “I just want to be able to compete. I just want to be able to make a living.”

When told of Teichert and Thornock’s experience building their own power lines, Eskelsen was surprised, but said it was possible in such a rural area. “That’s not something that we typically allow,” he said.

But what really bothers Teichert and Thornock is the utility business model. In Wyoming, as determined by the Public Service Commission in the company’s latest rate case hearing, Rocky Mountain Power is entitled to a 9.5 percent return on equity, around the national average, according to S&P estimates. In other words, if Rocky Mountain Power uses shareholder funds to build long-term assets, like power plants, it can recover up to an additional 9.5 percent of the total value of those assets from its customers and deliver that back to shareholders as profit.

This incentivizes Rocky Mountain Power to “explode [their] costs,” Thornock said. “Ten percent of 10 million is a lot more than [10] percent of a million,” he continued. “Even I can do that math.”

At least one former utility executive believes that the nationwide average of around 10 percent return on equity for utilities is too lucrative, and should be closer to 6 percent to more appropriately reflect the benefits and risks of investing in a utility.

“We’re not asking for a handout. I don’t want Rocky Mountain Power subsidizing me. I just want to be able to compete. I just want to be able to make a living.”

— Jason Thornock

A utility’s return on equity is misunderstood, Eskelsen said, and functions more like a ceiling than a guarantee. Because utilities must “open our books to utility commissions,” who judge whether the company has spent prudently, they have a “powerful incentive” not to exaggerate their costs, he said. A commission disallowing a utility’s costs cuts profits for utility shareholders, he added.

Back in Teichert’s truck, he and Thornock laughed at the fantasy of getting a guaranteed profit on cattle and crop purchases. “I think that’s why there’s such a huge blowback from these utilities on net metering,” Thornock said. “They can see that if we let these guys produce their own power, they’re going to see right through all the nonsense.”

“And I don’t blame them,” he continued. “If I was in their shoes, man, that’s crazy money—and they’re protected by the government to do it.”

Staying Alive

For their way of life to remain sustainable for themselves, their kids and grandkids, Wyoming needs to either increase the net-meeting cap or change how it regulates utilities “so we can have something fair,” Teichert said.

But he and Thornock see many of Wyoming’s representatives as too deferential to utilities, and neither of them has much faith that the state will overhaul the system.

While it is not unusual for politicians in Wyoming to accept donations from sectors they regulate, at least one member of the Wyoming Senate has close professional ties to a utility. Dan Dockstader, a state Senator representing Teton and Lincoln counties, which includes Cokeville, is a board member of Lower Valley Energy, an electric cooperative.

As last year’s net-metering bill came up for a vote in the Senate, Dockstader amended the bill to exempt electric utility co-ops from Public Service Commission oversight when it came to setting net-metering customers’ rates. The commission now has “limited jurisdiction over eighteen retail rural electric cooperatives,” according to its website.

The amendment didn’t sit well with Thornock. “[Dockstader is] representing Lower Valley Energy, he’s not representing the people who are using the power,” he said.

“I was representing the interests of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association (WREA) with 14 electric power distribution cooperates and another three generation and transmission cooperates,” Dockstader said, in an email. “All efforts to pass legislation should include a balanced approach with the rural cooperatives.”

Those who have been trying to find a way to raise Wyoming’s net-metering cap agree that utilities hold a lot of sway with lawmakers in Cheyenne.

“We watched numerous amendments chip away at the original intent of the bill, to the point where we realized if it passed it would actually be a step back for rooftop solar deployment in Wyoming,” said John Burrows, climate and energy director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council.

“Utilities have established, professional lobbyists,” he continued. “They lobbied quite aggressively on this issue and I suspect that that had an impact on where the bill went.”

Moving forward, net-metering supporters are trying to resolve their differences with utility companies through a third-party facilitator before introducing another bill, according to Burrows.

“Net metering still needs to happen,” Thornock said. Other energy sources, like small modular nuclear reactors that can generate power without emissions, but rely on unproven technologies, intrigue him—but he worries they’ll also be hobbled by the kinds of problems plaguing net metering. “If we don’t get this net-meeting stuff figured out we’re not going to be able to take advantage of the technology that’s coming,” he said.

Clouds shrouded the high sun over Cokeville when Teichert dropped Thornock off at his house around noon. Cruising around his hometown, where he once taught middle school English, Teichert pointed out about half a dozen homes sporting rooftop solar panels. As the cost of living goes up, his 91-year-old mother’s house may be next.

“At some point, my mom’s gonna have to choose between, do you turn on the power or do you buy groceries?” he said.

Rising costs, including for electricity, pose a similar dilemma to his business. “If it gets to the point where you can’t afford to ranch, our only option is to start selling 35-acre parcels,” he said.

Eventually, Teichert navigated toward the mountains. He slowed to admire the clarity of a creek, pulled over to gush over the ski slopes just outside of town and spoke eloquently about Cokeville’s history as an energy hub. But on his way home, he saw ranchland that had been carved up and sold to developers, and his eyes winced with angst. He kept driving.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/042725_Bolster_Cokeville_034.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 10:01:34.612481

Dec. 14 (Reuters) - BNSF Railway, one of the crown jewels of Warren Buffett’s sprawling Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, calls itself an environmental leader in ⁠the U.S. rail industry with the cleanest locomotive fleet in North America.

“When ⁠you see our orange locomotives’ and freight cars’ ‍steel wheels moving on steel rails, think green,” BNSF says in its latest sustainability overview.

But the company is the largest player in an industry that has a pollution problem: U.S. freight railroads are a major source of pollution, chuffing out more nitrogen oxide, the primary component of smog, than all the nation’s coal-fired power plants combined, according to a Reuters calculation using government data.

U.S. railroads together produced about 485,000 tons of nitrogen oxide in 2024, compared to 452,000 tons emitted by U.S. coal-fired power plants, according to a Reuters calculation of reported annual fuel consumption multiplied by the EPA’s 2023 weighted-average emission rates.

BNSF, the nation's largest freight railroad, accounts for about a third of that total, producing 161,500 tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide in 2024, according to the ‍data. “We don't dispute your number. BNSF is the biggest Class I railroad by volume,” BNSF said in an email.

BNSF's position as largest in the rail industry, as well as its profitability, will be challenged if regulators approve the planned $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, which would create the first U.S. coast-to-coast freight ​rail operator, Morningstar railroad analyst Greggory Warren said.

Reuters shared its calculations with four industry experts and all agreed it was a fair methodology. About 80% of the industry's NOx tons are produced by Class I railroads, the industry term for the six major railroads with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Details on the rail industry’s recent NOx emissions performance, BNSF’s share of those emissions, and the factors driving the ongoing high levels of pollution have not previously been reported.

Railroad locomotive pollution causes an estimated $48 billion in healthcare costs and 3,100 premature deaths annually in ​the United States, according to the EPA’s Co-Benefits Risk Assessment tool.

“Americans don’t realize how much harmful pollution comes from old diesel locomotives,” said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, a California group that advocates for public health. “EPA should require the railroad companies to modernize their fleets,” he said.

The EPA declined to comment specifically on rail pollution for this story, but said: ""The Trump EPA is committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water, and land for all Americans.”

AGING FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVES

The railroad industry’s poor emissions performance is due mainly to the fact that it has largely stopped replacing its aging fleet of locomotives. The average age of U.S. locomotives is about 28 years, compared with 20 years in 2009, according to EPA and industry reports.

That's a problem because federal emissions standards for locomotives depend on how old they are with the oldest grandfathered into the lightest limits.

With no requirement to retire old locomotives, the U.S. freight rail ​industry has dragged its feet on buying new ones, a dynamic amplified by industry fears that new regulations under future administrations could render their investments obsolete, according to Environmental Protection Agency data, and interviews with analysts and railroad executives.

Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, says railroads have lost their taste for innovation. ""Our air pollution standards for railroads have an engine-sized loophole in them, which companies are using to... keep old, dirty trains on the tracks,"" Markey said in a statement to Reuters.

The rail industry says that it is the cleanest option available to move freight over land, and cites data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. A locomotive can move a ton of freight about 500 miles on a gallon of fuel, which is three to four times more efficient than trucks.

The Association of American Railroads said it was also unfair to compare rail to power plants, ​saying locomotives have little choice but to burn diesel. ""These power plants have multiple other viable options for generation – coal, natural gas, hydropower, wind, nuclear, etc. That is not the case for rail,"" the trade group told Reuters.

BNSF, meanwhile, told Reuters that it is working to reduce its emissions through efficiency and technology improvements, and stands by its claim to have the cleanest fleet in the industry based on the outright number of modern locomotives in its possession.

BNSF said 360 of its 6,780 total are modern locomotives subject to the strictest federal emissions standards, called Tier 4, the largest ‌outright number in the industry.

That's just 5% of the company's total fleet that is active or in storage, according to Surface Transportation Board data. By contrast, rival Canadian National has nearly 300 Tier 4 locomotives, making up about 27% of its total fleet, according to analysts and CN press releases about new locomotive orders.

Tier 4 locomotives operated by BNSF's nearest competitors number about 270 at Union Pacific; about 225 at CSX Corp.; and about 80 at Norfolk Southern, according to EPA data, company press releases and trade industry reports.

BNSF spent $394 million on 165 new and rebuilt locomotives from 2020 to 2024. That was down 69% from the prior five ​years when it spent $1.26 billion on 558 locomotives, as replacement of aging engines—some lasting up to 40 years—slowed sharply, according to BNSF annual reports filed with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.

CLEANEST FLEET?

BNSF's high emissions, however, are not just the result of ⁠its size.

BNSF’s fuel economy is the worst among the country’s six major railroads, according to railroad operating statistics filed with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, the industry’s economic regulator.

In 2024, BNSF burned 1.14 gallons of diesel for every ton of weight it moved 1,000 miles, an industry metric called a gross ton mile. Union Pacific burned 1.08 gallons to move the same weight the same distance, and the most efficient, Canadian National, burned 0.88 gallons, according to the data.

Railroad industry analysts interviewed by Reuters said one reason for BNSF's low fuel economy is that it handles more intermodal freight than peers.

These high-priority shipping containers need to move faster than regular freight because they are typically more time-sensitive, said ‌Jason Kuehn, a railroad analyst and vice president at consulting firm Oliver Wyman.

BNSF's intermodal shipments totaled 5.3 million in 2024, or nearly 60% more than No. 2 Union Pacific, according to company disclosures.

Analysts said BNSF's efficiency is also likely hurt by its limited adoption of precision-scheduled railroading, an industry practice meant to reduce costs and fuel use through longer trains, fewer locomotives, and less idling time. Fuel efficiency can also be hindered by mountainous terrain and congestion on a railroad's network.

BNSF declined to comment on the reasons behind its relatively low fuel economy, but maintains it is an environmental leader in the industry based on its adoption of new locomotives, which allow it to burn fuel more cleanly.

“BNSF has the most modern platform locomotives in the rail industry, the basis for our cleanest fleet statement,” the company told Reuters.

It declined to provide details on its fleet-wide emissions intensity, and Reuters was unable to verify if it was better than rivals.

Tier 4 locomotives can reduce NOx emissions by about 80% compared to Tier 3 models, ‌according to the EPA.

FEAR OF REGULATION

The main reason railroads stopped spending big money on new locomotives is because they are worried new regulations - including proposed zero-emissions standards in California - could quickly make them obsolete.

""These locomotives have a lifespan of 40 to 45 years, and you're saying they won't be able to use those because we'll have zero emissions,"" said Roger Nober, director of George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center who retired as BNSF’s chief legal officer in 2023.

""Railroads don’t see that as an efficient ‌use of their capital.""

In 2008, the EPA hoped to clean up freight rail by setting new standards for locomotives, including higher standards for new Tier 3 and Tier 4 models. But rather than encourage replacement of old locomotives, rail companies have slowed down their purchases of new locomotives dramatically.

In 2008, the EPA estimated that at least 30% of freight locomotives would be operating under the strictest limits by 2025. But as of 2023 only 6.5% of 19,303 active locomotives operated by the big six railroads meet that limit, according to the EPA.

Before 2008, American railroads replaced their locomotives at a 4% rate per year, according to the U.S. Office of Transportation and Air Quality. By 2024, the industry replacement rate had dropped to 0.5% per year.

Neither BNSF nor its rivals provide exact data on the model years of active locomotives in their national fleets.

One key battle for the industry has been opposing California's proposed emissions standard, which would have banned locomotives older than 23 years from operating in ‍the state, and required all locomotives to be zero-emissions by 2035.

Because California is such a large market, it can effectively set the national standard.

Officials at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) estimated that by 2050 the stricter rules would have reduced 7,400 tons of diesel soot, 386,000 tons of NOx and cut cancer risk for those living near rail operations by up to 90%.

But it would have also barred 65% of active freight locomotives from operating in the state, rail officials say.

A week before Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. president in January, California withdrew the proposal.

Trump has been a frequent critic of CARB and was expected to block the initiative by denying ⁠California the waiver it would have needed to set state pollution rules that are tougher than federal ones.

In May, House Republicans introduced the Locomotives Act, which would prevent California from securing such waivers. The bill has been referred to the Energy and Commerce Committee.

FIGHTING GREEN TECHNOLOGY

The rail industry has also lobbied hard against the adoption of clean technologies. BNSF told the EPA last year at a public hearing that their test of a battery-electric locomotive failed to deliver enough power to move tons of freight over long distances.

""The battery had two megawatts of usable energy,” John Lovenburg, BNSF’s vice president for environment and sustainability, said. “That’s roughly 1/40th of the energy we will need for line-haul locomotives.”

Electric locomotives are viable for shorter routes and replacing diesel locomotives in switch yards, but for long distances they're limited by battery weight, said Alex Scott, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Tennessee.

Battery-electric locomotives are not prevalent in the United States and other parts of the world. But in China, India and Russia, a majority of their freight locomotives draw their power from overhead electric lines, or catenary systems.

That sort of electrification in North America would cost more than $1.1 trillion for 139,000 miles of track used by the six major railroads, according to a February 2025 study by the Association of American Railroads.

""The railroad industry is slow to adopt new things because if you have problems, it's not just your problem,"" Scott explained. ""You're creating problems for your customers and other railroads because they share track all of the time.""

Owned by the Seiko Epson Corporation, the brand is reinforcing its commitment to efficient, compact and precise innovation to address major environmental challenges.

A core component of Epson's philosophy is the reduction of its environmental footprint, with a particular emphasis on energy consumption across all its operations.

Epson's sustainability report outlines a clear strategy to achieve this, aiming to become carbon negative by 2050.

Decarbonisation and energy reduction targets

Epson’s strategy sets out ambitious, science-based targets for decarbonisation.

By 2030, Epson aims to cut its total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90% and reduce its overall emissions by 55%.

These objectives are aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target.

To meet these goals, Epson is concentrating on minimising energy consumption and reducing water use, waste and greenhouse gas emissions, especially within its European facilities.

Takanori Inaho, President of Epson Europe, says: “As we celebrate 50 years of the Epson brand, our commitment to pushing technology boundaries and driving meaningful sustainable change has never been stronger.

""The approval of our climate goals by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) formalises our ambition to become carbon negative by 2050, reshaping how we operate and collaborate throughout our value chain.""

To tackle Scope 3 emissions, which account for the largest portion of its carbon footprint, Epson has incorporated the end use of its products and the procurement of raw materials into its science-based targets.

Energy efficiency

A key step in its energy reduction journey during FY24 was the relocation of its UK headquarters to a more energy-efficient building.

The new office does not use gas for heating, a move that has contributed to a 56% reduction in Epson’s total gas consumption across its operations.

Epson intends to use its own technology to advance digitisation and automation, deploying manufacturing solutions designed to save energy and space.

Through these innovations, Epson plans to lessen its overall environmental impact while continuing to meet market demands and enhance productivity.

Boris Manev, Sustainability Director at Epson Europe, says: “We recognise that embedding responsible practices throughout our operations is an evolving process requiring dedication, transparency and collaboration.

""By aligning our ESG efforts with evolving regulations, we mitigate risks, unlock opportunities and reinforce our leadership in responsible innovation and corporate governance.”

A circular model for resource efficiency

Epson is also focused on closing the resource loop to foster a circular economy, which has direct implications for energy use.

Epson's goal is to use resources more efficiently and extend the life of its products through reuse and refurbishment programmes.

For instance, faulty printers can be returned, assessed and repaired before being resold.

This process extends the product lifespan, meaning the energy and raw materials required for new manufacturing are conserved.

In November 2024, Epson also introduced an ink cartridge refill initiative to collect and reuse spent inkjet cartridges.

As part of this programme, Epson plans to optimise pallet configurations and improve reverse logistics.

Engaging customers and partners to increase return rates could contribute substantially to Epson's wider sustainability and energy-saving objectives.

“Recognised with Platinum EcoVadis status, Epson is dedicated to responsible sustainability leadership,” Takanori says.

“The choices we make today will shape the next 50 years – and we are ready to lead with purpose and determination.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/74ab59c2b96acede31cad7daa4e2f7b4:3a0e7750ae5b2a96ef667f57b3320681/closed-resourse-loop-05.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 04:58:31.737346

The White House's policy pivot has thrown billions of dollars' worth of U.S. offshore wind projects into turmoil. Industry interest and investment are looking elsewhere, and developing regions with ample wind resources, such as Southeast Asia, have the most to gain from this likely reshuffling, analysts say.

Wind energy is essential to efforts to curb climate change, scientists say, as global temperatures drift perilously higher. Offshore wind, which uses turbines installed in the sea, is set to grow rapidly because it can harness stronger, steadier ocean winds to generate clean electricity, the International Energy Agency says.

Southeast Asia, with its archipelago nations, long coastlines and consistently windy seas, is emerging as one of the world's most promising regions for this technology. As energy demand continues to rise, the Philippines and Vietnam are building policy momentum that proponents hope will spur interest across the region.

Those moves could turn Southeast Asia into a model for other developing nations seeking to use wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, said Rebecca Williams, with the Global Wind Energy Council.

""Asia and Southeast Asia are a beacon of hope for the industry,"" she said.

Trump has actively sought to kill the U.S. offshore wind industry, one of his presidential campaign promises.

He opposes using renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes burning fossil fuels for electricity, contending that climate change is a hoax.

The White House has halted construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked and paused permits, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for wind energy and cut $679 million in federal funding for a dozen projects -- a complete reversal from former President Joe Biden's Administration.

Trump's anti-renewable energy stance has shaken U.S. confidence in offshore wind projects.

That has kickstarted an industry-wide search for other places to invest.

Globally, wind energy generation is growing, led by China. It dominates wind power installations and manufactures more than half of the world's wind turbines. Beijing is also emerging as a quiet force in the region's offshore wind buildout, supplying turbines and engineering expertise as countries race to tap their coastal wind potential.

""We're seeing more governments in the Global South, especially in countries in Asia, who haven't had that background in offshore wind, now really step up,"" Williams said.

Home to half of the global population, Asia is expected to account for much of the world's future energy demand. Yet the region still relies heavily on fossil fuels, and wind generates barely 7% of Asia-Pacific's electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.

The 11-member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, a vast region that includes tiny Brunei to populous Indonesia, have no installed wind power capacity.

So there's a lot of untapped potential up for grabs, said Amisha Patel, with the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, an organization of countries promoting offshore wind.

Trump's rhetoric is disappointing given America's vast wind potential, but it hasn't slowed global wind power developments, and ""Southeast Asia is stepping forward as the U.S. retreats,"" she said.

Last month, Singapore announced a three-year plan for wind energy conferences to attract investment and become a regional hub for the industry.

""Asia is looking very, very attractive because of the momentum that we're seeing there and the core understanding of the value of offshore wind,"" Patel said.

The Philippines and Vietnam have an early advantage.

The Philippines held its first offshore wind auction in November, allowing companies to bid and compete for the right to build 3.3 gigawatts of wind farms on designated seabeds. Energy Secretary Sharon Garin said that shifted offshore wind power from ""potential to reality,"" with clear rules and plans for how wind farms will connect to the grid, which ports they'll use and how equipment will be moved.

""The Philippines is ready to compete for global investment,"" she said in a statement.

Filipino corporation ACEN partnered with Denmark's Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners in May to co-develop the nation's first large-scale offshore wind project, aiming for up to 1 gigawatt in the central Philippine province of Camarines Sur.

Vietnam has revived long-stalled offshore wind ambitions, issuing new rules and courting foreign investors. It revised its national power plan in April, targeting up to 17 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, and is speeding up marine zoning rules and updating permitting procedures.

Regulatory delays led Norway's Equinor to withdraw from Vietnam in 2024, but investor confidence is slowly growing. Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is working with state-owned PetroVietnam on an offshore wind project in south-central Vietnam and Germany's PNE AG is planning a $4.6 billion, 2-gigawatt farm in Binh Dinh province.

Vietnam is exploring regional projects. It signed a deal in May for a transmission line to export power to Singapore and Malaysia.

China is also emerging as an important player in the region. State-owned Power China completed the Binh Dai offshore wind power project in Vietnam in November, according to the China's official Xinhua news agency. In the Philippines, Mingyang Smart Energy is exploring a 2-gigawatt project in Northern Luzon.

Extreme weather is a challenge for offshore wind, especially in the Philippines and Vietnam, which endured an onslaught of deadly typhoons this year.

What's the story

Global electric vehicle (EV) sales have surged by 21% in November compared to the same period in 2024, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The research firm noted that two million EVs were sold worldwide during the month. This brings the total global EV sales for the year to date to an impressive 18.5 million units. Europe has emerged as a major contributor to this growth, while North America continues to lag behind.

Market dynamics

Europe's EV market outpaces North America

The European EV market witnessed a remarkable 36% year-on-year growth in November 2025. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales rose by 35%, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) sales jumped by an impressive 39%. This brings Europe's total EV sales for the year to date to a whopping 3.8 million units, up by 33% from January-November 2024. Meanwhile, North America continues to trail after US EV tax credits expired on September 30, 2025.

Growth factors

France and Italy boost EV sales with new initiatives

France has finally returned to year-to-date growth in November, up 1% after spending most of 2025 in the red due to earlier subsidy cuts. The rebound was led by automakers such as Volkswagen and Renault, a wider selection of EV models, and France's ""leasing social"" program aimed at helping lower-income households switch to EVs. Meanwhile, Italy saw record EV sales of just under 25,000 units in November after launching a new incentive program aimed at replacing older internal combustion vehicles.

Potential Uses and Future Development The researchers envision many applications for a clear material that effectively traps heat.
For the moment, the outlook for MOCHI remains promising, much like the clear view through a window coated with this material.
Co-authors of the study include Amit Bhardwaj, Blaise Fleury, Eldo Abraham and Taewoo Lee, all postdoctoral research associates in the Department of Physics at CU Boulder.
Bohdan Senyuk, Jan Bart ten Hove and Vladyslav Cherpak, former postdoctoral researchers at CU Boulder, also contributed as co-authors.","The material is called Mesoporous Optically Clear Heat Insulator, or MOCHI. It can be manufactured as thick blocks or thin flexible sheets that attach to the interior surface of standard windows. At present, MOCHI is only produced in the laboratory and is not yet available to consumers, but the researchers report that it is durable and nearly completely see-through.

Because of its clarity, MOCHI maintains an unobstructed view, which sets it apart from many other window insulation products.

""To block heat exchange, you can put a lot of insulation in your walls, but windows need to be transparent,"" said Ivan Smalyukh, senior author of the study and a professor of physics at CU Boulder. ""Finding insulators that are transparent is really challenging.""

The research team published its findings on Dec. 11 in the journal Science.

Why Window Heat Loss Matters

Buildings of all kinds, from houses to large office towers, account for about 40% of global energy consumption. Much of that energy is wasted as heat escapes to the outdoors during winter or enters buildings during hot weather.

Smalyukh and his collaborators hope MOCHI will slow that unwanted heat flow.

The new material is a silicone-based gel with a complex internal structure. It contains air trapped within extremely fine pores that are far thinner than a human hair. These microscopic pockets make MOCHI an excellent thermal barrier. In fact, a sheet only 5 millimeters thick is enough to let a person safely hold a flame against it.

""No matter what the temperatures are outside, we want people to be able to have comfortable temperatures inside without having to waste energy,"" said Smalyukh, a fellow at the Renewable And Sustainable Energy Institute (RASEI) at CU Boulder.

How MOCHI Controls Light and Heat

Smalyukh described the key to MOCHI's performance as its precisely arranged air pockets.

The new material shares similarities with aerogels, which are well-known insulators used in many industries. (NASA uses aerogels inside its Mars rovers to keep electronics warm). Aerogels also rely on air-filled pores, but those pores are typically arranged in a random pattern that scatters light. This is why aerogels often appear cloudy and are sometimes referred to as ""frozen smoke.""

The CU Boulder team wanted an insulating material that would maintain clarity while providing strong thermal resistance.

To build MOCHI, researchers combined surfactant molecules with a liquid mixture. These molecules naturally cluster into thread-like shapes, somewhat like the separation that occurs when oil and vinegar form layers in salad dressing. Silicone molecules in the same mixture attach themselves to the surface of those tiny threads.

Through several controlled steps, the researchers then remove the detergent clusters and replace them with air. This leaves behind a silicone framework surrounding a network of ultra-small, air-filled channels. Smalyukh likens the intricate pattern to a ""plumber's nightmare.""

Air accounts for more than 90% of MOCHI's volume.

Stopping Heat at the Molecular Scale

Heat travels through a gas in a way similar to a billiards-style chain reaction. Energy causes gas molecules and atoms to move faster and collide with one another, passing heat along as they strike.

The pores inside MOCHI are so tiny that the gas molecules cannot freely collide. Instead, they repeatedly hit the silicone walls, which prevents heat from easily spreading through the material.

""The molecules don't have a chance to collide freely with each other and exchange energy,"" Smalyukh said. ""Instead, they bump into the walls of the pores.""

Despite this strong heat blocking ability, MOCHI reflects only about .2% of incoming light, allowing nearly all visible light to pass through.

Potential Uses and Future Development

The researchers envision many applications for a clear material that effectively traps heat. One possibility is a device that captures warmth from sunlight and converts it into low-cost, sustainable energy.

""Even when it's a somewhat cloudy day, you could still harness a lot of energy and then use it to heat your water and your building interior,"" Smalyukh said.

For now, MOCHI is not ready for commercial release. Its laboratory production requires considerable time, although Smalyukh believes that more efficient manufacturing methods can be developed. The components used to make MOCHI are relatively low-cost, which supports the long-term potential for scaling the technology.

For the moment, the outlook for MOCHI remains promising, much like the clear view through a window coated with this material.

He noted that the joint effort intends to build infrastructure at scale and change how energy companies function.
Similarly, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian stated that combining NextEra’s domain expertise with Google’s AI infrastructure is necessary to support the digital future of energy infrastructure and meet the rising demand for AI technologies.","NextEra Energy and Google Cloud announced a significant expansion of their ongoing collaboration, creating a partnership designed to develop multiple gigawatt (GW)-scale data center campuses across the United States.

This new initiative builds upon a substantial existing portfolio between the two companies, which already encompasses approximately 3.5 GW of power capacity that is either currently in operation or under contract.

The deal addresses the escalating energy requirements of the technology sector, a trend further highlighted by the companies’ recent agreements to add 600 megawatts of clean energy capacity to the electricity grid in Oklahoma.

The companies are currently in the active development phase for the first three campuses under this new agreement and have set a target of mid-2026 for the release of their first commercial technology product on the Google Cloud Marketplace.

Accelerate deployment of data centers

This collaborative effort focuses on accelerating the deployment of data centers by systematically addressing critical infrastructure hurdles.

These challenges include land acquisition, managing load interconnection, and the simultaneous development of supporting power generation resources needed to sustain large-scale artificial intelligence operations.A central component of this energy strategy involves the revitalization of nuclear power capabilities to support the electrical grid.

“Most recently, the companies announced the restart of the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa followed by two new long-term power purchase agreements to add 600 megawatts of clean energy capacity to Oklahoma’s electricity grid to support Google’s technology infrastructure,” noted a press release.

To facilitate this restart, NextEra Energy has formally requested that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) restore grid connection rights for the shuttered facility.

This regulatory filing seeks to reclaim interconnection rights that had previously been transferred from the nuclear plant to a planned solar energy project at the same site.

The move follows a licensing change request that NextEra filed with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in January, marking a distinct shift from solar back to nuclear baseload power to meet steady demand.

Digital transformation of operations

Beyond the construction of physical infrastructure, the partnership will implement a digital transformation of NextEra Energy’s operations using Google Cloud’s artificial intelligence tools.

This integration will utilize Google’s “TimesFM 2.5” time-series open-source forecasting model and the “WeatherNext 2” weather forecasting system. By combining these AI capabilities with NextEra’s proprietary asset data, the companies aim to improve grid reliability and resilience.

“Pairing NextEra Energy’s capabilities with Google’s latest time-series open source forecasting model, weather forecasting model and security-constrained power flow modeling will give NextEra Energy and its customers better insights into system optimization opportunities, enhancing utilities’ planning and grid management efforts to keep costs affordable while making electric service more reliable and resilient,” highlighted the press release.

This approach is designed to maintain safety and reduce operational costs for both the utility and its customers, particularly as the grid faces challenges from aging assets and unprecedented load growth.

NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO John Ketchum characterized the partnership as a reflection of the current moment where the energy and technology sectors are becoming increasingly intertwined.

The report suggests cancellations may drive electricity prices higher as supply fails to meet surging demand, with price increases already visible in some regions.

The cancellations stem from Trump administration opposition, local community pushback, escalating grid interconnection costs, battery value drops, and offshore wind policy disruption.

The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department.

As the Trump administration sheds staff and funding at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a new analysis places Louisiana among states that have notably slashed their pollution regulation resources even as industry expands.

The report from the Environmental Integrity Project evaluated staffing and changes in operating budgets at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality and comparable agencies in other states. From 2010 through 2024, the numbers show the agency’s personnel count decreased 24% with 222 positions eliminated from the agency. The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department.

“These cuts increase the risk that residents will face higher levels of pollution, especially if the EPA lacks the funding and capacity to do its job,” Environmental Integrity Project executive director Jen Duggan said Wednesday during a news conference for the report’s release.

“In Louisiana, we feel them deeply,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade who also took part in the news conference.

The report focused on the Department of Environmental Quality’s operating budget, or the money it spends to handle day-to-day tasks such as paying employees, maintaining facilities, lab analysis and grants to local governments. Large loans and federal grants, which are considered as capital costs, were excluded from the analysis where possible to avoid outliers because they vary widely from year to year and “do not measure a state’s capacity” to limit pollution, according to the report’s methodology.

The staffing cuts at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality are “among the most of any state,” according to the report. Other standouts included Mississippi, which reduced its environmental agency funding 71% from 2010 to 2024.

On the other end of the spectrum is California, which increased its environmental operating budget by 364% over the same 14 years.

At the federal level, the Trump administration has said it intends to bring the EPA’s employee count down to levels last seen during the Reagan era, when the agency had between 11,000 and 14,000 people of staff, NPR reported. It began Trump’s second term with about 15,000 employees.

The majority of environmental agency staffing cuts in Louisiana happened during Bobby Jindal’s terms as governor from 2008-16. The Department of Environmental Quality has not seen significant hiring or funding boosts dating back to Edwin Edwards’ fourth term as governor from 1992-96.

The agency’s boldest policy moves came after Gov. Buddy Roemer took office in 1988. He placed environmental scientist Paul Templet in charge of Environmental Quality, and the administration tied industrial incentives to benchmarks for reducing pollution. Since Roemer lost his reelection bid in 1991, governors who have succeeded him have, to varying degrees, urged cooperation with industry.

The Environmental Integrity Project report points out cuts in Department of Environmental Quality staff and funding come as Louisiana sees a boom in industrial investment. The number of facilities seeking air pollution control permits from the state rose 29% from 2016-24, with 1,906 applications last year according to the report’s analysis of public records.

A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality responded to the report in a statement, saying the department meets all federal grant requirements and performance expectations while prioritizing “efficiency” and remaining “fully committed” to environmental protection.

The department has implemented an expedited permitting program to make up for its staffing shortages, allowing applicants to pay for agency staff members’ overtime as they work on the approval process.

Rolfes cites issues with this process in the report, saying it creates a conflict of interest.

“When you cut the resources of the agencies, you further depend on the companies themselves as the source of payment for permit writers — and that is an inherent conflict,” Rolfes wrote in the report. “When you have the company paying your overtime, you are just not going to ask the questions and scrutinize it the way you would if your salaries were being paid by the public.”

The analysis also identified Louisiana as having the highest amount of toxic air emissions per square mile of any state in the country. Staffing shortages also play a role in delayed response time to pollution issues, according to the report.

In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project report counted only 10 LDEQ employees who handled all air enforcement actions at more than 500 major industrial facilities and hundreds more smaller locations. A Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report from 2021 also found the department was understaffed and could do more to address air pollution violations.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/westcentralsbest.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b44a2b66-f4e9-11e4-83a0-3bbd4468f030.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-12-14 04:58:51.755850

The state’s economy had crashed in 2001, and it was only slowly regaining the jobs lost during the recession.
Patrick, I had a chance to see and participate in initiatives that had a catalytic effect on the state’s innovation economy.","MASSACHUSETTS HAS EXPERIENCED a full assault on the basic pillars of our innovation economy. Clean energy programs and infrastructure, biomedical research funding, immigration, and core funding and academic freedom at our state’s leading universities have all landed in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s reckless cuts and ideologically extreme policy agenda.

While President Trump wraps this all in America First rhetoric, these moves will severely undermine our country’s ability to compete economically and remain a global leader in cutting-edge research and development. Given the outsized role these areas play here, the threat to Massachusetts is particularly acute.

The Commonwealth needs to act boldly and creatively to respond to the threats to its innovation economy. Fighting to reverse these moves in Washington should be a top priority, but we surely can’t count on that happening. We may not be able, on our own, to mitigate the full impact of these harmful policies, but we can take action at the state level to counter their effects.

Over the summer, Gov. Healey unveiled a proposal to do just that. The Discovery, Research and Innovation for a Vibrant Economy, or DRIVE, Initiative includes a call for $400 million in state appropriations to help make up for some of the lost federal funding.

Committing public dollars to help bolster or jumpstart economic activity is not something that should be done lightly without due diligence and careful consideration. But in weighing the governor’s proposal, legislative leaders don’t have to look back too far for an example of unquestionable success with such a strategy.

It may be hard to remember, but Massachusetts wasn’t always the leading state for the innovation economy. In 2003, despite our state’s deep strengths in finance, health care, and higher education, the major economic story of the day was Boston losing Fortune 500 headquarters.

The Commonwealth had invested heavily in remaking Boston’s downtown and waterfront, but 20 years ago the Seaport was best known for inexpensive parking lots. The state’s economy had crashed in 2001, and it was only slowly regaining the jobs lost during the recession. In 2004, the Boston Foundation bemoaned the fact that greater Boston “lacked the collaborative gene,” which was essential to competing in the global knowledge economy. There was significant pessimism disguised as realism – which all made sense if you were a fan of the Boston Red Sox during the many decades leading to October of that momentous year.

As seen in the sudden reversal that year of our baseball fortunes, however, the world changes – sometimes quicker than you expect. I served in the Patrick administration during both of the governor’s terms, eventually as the state’s first assistant secretary for innovation policy in the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, and witnessed this firsthand.

Working under Secretary Dan O’Connell and the late Secretary Greg Bialecki, both of whom helmed the housing and economic development secretariat under Gov. Patrick, I had a chance to see and participate in initiatives that had a catalytic effect on the state’s innovation economy.

In 2008, Gov. Patrick and the Legislature partnered to launch the state’s 10-year, $1 billion Life Sciences Initiative, which served as a catalyst for regional partnerships and international investment.

The scale of the initiative drew international attention and investment in Massachusetts, while the vast majority of the state funds invested (over 70 percent of funds through FY 2014) were spent on research and development infrastructure and educational programs throughout the state. A 2018 impact study showed that Massachusetts outperformed peer states in life sciences wage and job growth from 2009 through 2016, providing evidence that the initiative did make a meaningful difference in improving the state’s competitiveness.

In 2009, the state provided seed funding for MassChallenge, one of the world’s largest startup accelerators and competitions. Anyone who attended a MassChallenge event can readily attest that it had a dynamic effect – as if a world-class region was meeting itself for the first time. MassChallenge reinforced the state’s international reputation for innovation while also supporting the state’s entrepreneurial ecosystem by inviting winners from regional startup accelerators to join its program.

In 2012, the state’s five largest research universities partnered to open the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center – a major research facility – in Holyoke. It was the first significant collaboration to ever take place among these universities – and there, too, a seed investment by the state was critical to its success. Through the computing center, the partner universities have sponsored collaborative research by faculty across their schools and with external partners, with the goal to make our state more competitive for major federal research funding opportunities.

Unquestionably, the Commonwealth is right to focus on a triad of long-term challenges that threaten our economic health and competitiveness: affordable housing, education and workforce development, and safe and efficient transportation. Progress in those areas creates a more livable state for all of us and unlocks bottlenecks to hiring and growth. But it won’t be enough to forestall the worst impacts of current federal policy.

The actions of the federal government strike at the very heart of our state’s competitive advantage. Massachusetts is a magnet for the world’s talent, from undergraduate students to postdocs to regional headquarters for major multinational corporations. We thrive on collaboration and the sophistication of our experienced researchers, investors, executives, advanced manufacturers, and technicians.

Collaboration is at the heart of our success. And collaboration requires trust, mutually agreed upon goals, resources, and sufficient stability over time to execute on plans. It requires belief, hope, and expectation that hard work will lead to accomplishment, whether that is in six months, a year or five years. The state investments described above succeeded in part because they were sustained commitments that improved capacity and created a reliable state partner that enabled the private sector and universities to make long-term plans and investments of their own.

That’s why it is imperative that our state’s leaders – from government, education, and industry – partner and respond robustly to this threat.

The House and Senate, with whatever modifications they deem appropriate, should move quickly to pass the DRIVE Act, which is designed to stabilize and grow our state’s research and innovation ecosystem. Roughly half of the funds would be devoted to backfilling some of the support for our universities, investing in promising research proposals that went through rigorous scientific review prior to the federal cuts.

The second half of the funds would support new collaborative research and initiatives that can accelerate our innovation economy. For new initiatives, the Commonwealth should require substantial direct and in-kind matches to magnify the impact of state dollars. In addition, the state should be ambitious in choosing initiatives that bring together multiple partners and advance national research priorities that have been defunded or opposed by the Trump administration.

We are, eventually, going to come out of this unsettling era. How we do so is up to us. In a moment in which fear and uncertainty abound, we should set the goal for Massachusetts to emerge as the strongest, most competitive innovation state in the nation in 2029.

Approach 2: Bloom Energy Price vs Sales

For companies like Bloom Energy that are still scaling and not yet consistently profitable, the Price to Sales, or P S, ratio is often a more practical valuation tool than earnings based metrics. It anchors valuation to current revenue, which is less volatile and easier to compare across peers.

In general, higher growth and lower risk can justify a higher P S multiple, while slower growth or greater uncertainty point to a lower, more conservative range. Bloom Energy currently trades at about 12.35x sales, well above both the Electrical industry average of roughly 2.17x and the peer group average of around 3.02x. This signals that investors are already pricing in substantial growth and improvement in profitability.

Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what a P S multiple should be, given Bloom’s growth outlook, margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. On this basis, Bloom’s Fair Ratio is 8.44x, which is meaningfully below the current 12.35x. That gap suggests the stock price is running ahead of what its fundamentals and risks would justify.

The worldwide shift toward sustainable energy has dramatically altered the strategies of institutional investors, with clean energy derivatives now standing out as a vital asset class. In 2025, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) granted CleanTrade approval to operate as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF), marking a significant advancement in the renewable energy sector. This regulatory breakthrough has helped resolve persistent issues such as market fragmentation and limited liquidity, positioning clean energy as a leading destination for institutional funds. This article delves into the operational models of CFTC-sanctioned platforms and examines the influx of institutional capital, highlighting how these developments are transforming liquidity in renewable energy assets.

Regulatory Advances and Market Evolution

When the CFTC approved CleanTrade in September 2025, it brought much-needed regulatory certainty to the market by overturning a 2021 advisory that had previously created confusion among participants. This move allowed CleanTrade to function as a centralized, high-standard venue for trading Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). Within just two months of its debut, CleanTrade saw $16 billion in notional trades, reflecting strong institutional trust in energy markets aligned with ESG principles.

The CFTC’s flexible approach extended beyond CleanTrade. In 2025, the agency withdrew its proposed Operational Resilience Framework for SEFs, citing overlap with existing rules and the need to harmonize with global standards. This change is part of a broader effort to reduce compliance complexity while upholding market integrity. For example, the CFTC granted exemptions to SEFs such as LSEG FX SEF, allowing them to forgo mandatory central limit order books—an acknowledgment of the practicalities of swaps trading. These regulatory adjustments have fostered a more dynamic environment, encouraging further innovation in clean energy derivatives.

Institutional Capital and Market Liquidity

Institutional participation in clean energy derivatives has grown rapidly. Bloomberg projects that ESG investments will soar from $39.08 trillion in 2025 to $125.17 trillion by 2032. In 2025, investments in clean energy surpassed those in fossil fuels by $1.1 trillion, with major players like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs increasingly focusing on renewables within their portfolios. CleanTrade’s integration of real-time analytics, carbon tracking, and advanced risk management tools has enabled investors to better align with ESG goals and manage counterparty risks.

Recent data further illustrates this momentum. In the third quarter of 2025, U.S. investment in clean energy and transportation reached a record $75 billion, with $25 billion directed toward clean energy production and industrial decarbonization—a 15% increase over the previous year, fueled by demand for electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure. However, the second quarter of 2025 showed mixed results: while utility-scale clean electricity and industrial decarbonization technologies grew by 13% compared to the previous quarter, investment in manufacturing for greenhouse gas reduction technologies fell by 15%. These fluctuations underscore the value of liquid, transparent markets like CleanTrade, which help stabilize institutional portfolios through reliable pricing and scalable risk management.

Broadening the Clean Energy Trading Ecosystem

CleanTrade is just one of several platforms shaping the future of clean energy derivatives. Between 2025 and 2026, the CFTC authorized additional venues, including Electron Exchange DCM, Railbird Exchange, and Quanta Exchange, reflecting a diversification of the market. Nodal Exchange, a prominent player in power and environmental markets, has expanded its offerings by launching new REC contracts and a web-based trading platform to improve accessibility. Together, these platforms cater to a wide range of regional and sector-specific needs, from small-scale solar initiatives to large-scale energy storage, making clean energy assets more attractive to institutional investors worldwide.

Ongoing Challenges and the Road Ahead

Despite significant progress, obstacles remain. The Q2 2025 Clean Investment Monitor reported a 36% drop in U.S. renewable energy investment compared to the latter half of 2024, while investment in the EU-27 surged by 63%. These regional imbalances highlight the necessity for harmonized regulations and cross-border liquidity solutions. Additionally, the cancellation of $7 billion in energy projects in Q2 2025 underscores the volatility inherent in capital-intensive industries.

Looking forward, the CFTC’s commitment to modernizing its regulatory approach—such as its spot crypto trading initiative—signals an ongoing focus on fostering innovation. Platforms like CleanTrade and Nodal Exchange are expected to play a pivotal role in connecting traditional energy markets with the demands of the green transition. As institutional investors increasingly prioritize decarbonization, the transparency and liquidity offered by CFTC-approved SEFs will be essential for scaling up renewable energy infrastructure.

Summary

The rise of CFTC-approved clean energy trading platforms marks a fundamental transformation in institutional investment. By overcoming market fragmentation, boosting liquidity, and supporting ESG objectives, these platforms are not only revolutionizing renewable asset markets but also redefining the influence of institutional capital in the global energy transition. As regulations adapt and new platforms emerge, clean energy derivatives are set to become a cornerstone of global investment strategies in the coming decade.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-14 03:58:24.203789

The Future U project, which began construction this summer, is a three-year renovation meant to reuse a majority of the original foundation built in 1972.

According to Melissa Soto, manager of Capital Program Development at Beach Building Services, approximately 90% of the USU’s original foundation will remain.

One of the few areas slated for demolition and replacement is the University Dining Plaza. Additionally, the 1972 plumbing and electrical systems will be replaced.

“It’s a really great opportunity to upgrade everything just to make the building function well and to reorganize,” says Soto.

A study from the Environmental Protection Agency found that around 600 million tons of construction and demolition debris were generated nationwide in 2018.

To avoid adverse environmental impacts, the Future U project seeks to reduce waste and source sustainably. According to Soto, furniture and building materials will be sourced within the U.S.

“Most new student unions are built new from the ground up, which means they require entirely new materials,” said Lisa Salgado, the Capital Projects Program manager at Beach Building Services, in an email exchange with the Current.

By using the majority of the 1972 foundation, BBS seeks to maintain the vision of the original building’s architect, Edward Killingsworth.

The student union is eligible but not yet registered for the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources, which work to preserve the cultural and artistic integrity of historic buildings and artifacts.

By preserving key historic elements of the original USU, such as the terracotta flooring and vintage tiles, the student union will remain eligible. Because of this, maintaining the USU’s mid-century modern style is important for the university.

According to Salgado, material reuse will reduce the carbon footprint of Future U and expedite construction.

Currently, the building is undergoing abatement, a process in which hazmat crews will conduct a complete sweep for hazardous materials, including asbestos, lead and more.

According to BBS’s 2024 Design Standards Manual, 95% of post-abatement waste will be sent to construction recycling centers. The 5% of ineligible materials will be sent to landfills.

Some materials are sent to special disposal sites where they have to be treated further, Soto said.

California State law required the CSU system to divert 75% of all solid waste from landfill disposal by 2020 through source reduction, reuse, recycling and composting programs.

The Future U project is maintaining these rates. 75% of the waste produced by the Future U project will be recycled or salvaged, according to Salgado.

“There’s construction waste recycling centers…that we take the material to where it gets recycled just as you would recycle your cans,” Soto said.

BBS is confident in the original structure’s strength – despite it being over 50 years old – and is implementing construction techniques to reinforce it.

“We do type one construction, where the interior is concrete,” Soto said. “We’re trying to build these really strong, long-lasting things.”

Type one construction uses non-combustable materials such as reinforced concrete and protected steel.

According to the National Fire Protection Association, Type I construction offers the highest level of fire protection and projects are considered noncombustible.

The original USU foundation is also being reinforced to meet modern-day seismic standards. An evaluation of the building was conducted to assess its ability to withstand earthquakes.

“There’s certain areas in the building that we do need to strengthen seismically, but it’s really not a lot, which is really exciting,” Soto said.

That gives BBS less work and allows them more time to make good on their promise of a 2028 opening.

In addition to the strong infrastructure, Future U will also introduce over 80 low-volatile organic compound materials into the new design.

VOCs are human-made chemicals that may pose short and long-term health risks. VOCs are emitted as gases from solid or liquid materials and are present in many common building materials.

“Low-VOC materials will keep the air healthy so all visitors can focus, socialize, and thrive,” Salgado said in an email exchange with the Current.

Many of the low-VOC materials listed in the Future U “Low-VOC Material Tracker” spreadsheet include paints, carpets and wall panels.

While the Future U project is still three years from completion, the renovation is necessary and will be worth it in the long run, Soto said.

“It’s lasted fairly well for 50 years,” she said. “Our goal is that we don’t have to touch [it] again for another 50 years.”",https://lbcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mural.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 22:58:06.736151

US District Judge Patti Saris agreed, writing in her order that the “Wind Order” was illegal because it was an “arbitrary and capricious” exercise of federal power, not to mention weird and creepy.
There wasn’t even a concept of a plan for regulatory review, because the point was simply to prevent new wind energy from coming online at all.
As for Monday’s decision overturning the Wind Order, the White House’s first response was, as always, to whine.
Now that Judge Saris has deflated Trump’s Wind Order, states and companies will still need to sue to move wind projects forward, causing costly delays and probably killing some projects altogether, so progress will remain slow.","In a blow to Donald Trump’s irrational war against wind energy, a federal judge in Massachusetts on Monday overturned Trump’s Day One executive order that had frozen all leases and permits for offshore wind energy projects. Seventeen states, led by New York but reaching across the country to Oregon and California, had joined the lawsuit, arguing that they and their residents were being harmed by the refusal to add clean, cheaper energy to the grid. US District Judge Patti Saris agreed, writing in her order that the “Wind Order” was illegal because it was an “arbitrary and capricious” exercise of federal power, not to mention weird and creepy.

Trump’s order placed an indefinite pause on all offshore wind energy development so that federal agencies could “review” the permitting process, supposedly to remove any of those mean unfair advantages that Joe Biden used to oppress wind’s poor, downtrodden competitors in the fossil fuel industry. As testimony in the case showed, however, hardly any such “review” had even begun, even 10 months after the order. There wasn’t even a concept of a plan for regulatory review, because the point was simply to prevent new wind energy from coming online at all.

In fact, lawyers for the administration agencies involved couldn’t demonstrate any real rationale for the stonewalling on permits beyond pointing to Trump’s executive order and the Department of the Interior’s memo putting the pause into place. Judge Saris wrote that the thin justifications given in those documents alone were insufficient to effectively shut down an entire industry. “Whatever level of explanation is required when deviating from longstanding agency practice, this is not it.”

OK, you were waiting for the “However,” weren’t you? Here we go: However, the order on its own doesn’t automatically approve any pending wind projects, and as Ars Technica explains, Judge Saris’s order can’t force the relevant agencies to stop simply slow-walking every project that’s in the pipeline, as well as new leases or permits. But it does at least mean that states and offshore wind developers can go ahead and sue the government for gumming up the process simply because Trump hates wind turbines and wants to protect dirty energy.

In fact, one such lawsuit, brought by the Danish wind energy company Ørsted, has already successfully lifted the administration’s stop-work order on a giant wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. When it’s completed next year, the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project, initially approved in 2023, will bring carbon-free electricity to more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. But in August, the administration ordered a halt to construction, even though Revolution Wind was more than 80 percent complete, claiming that the plant was somehow a “national security” threat.

The stop-work order didn’t get into specifics, probably because it would have been laughed out of court, because when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum tried to explain it on CNN, he came up with some weird speculation about how, ummm, let’s see, what if the wind turbines kept radar from detecting a big attack by, umm, “undersea drones” launched inside US territorial waters? That makes no goddamn sense at all because radar doesn’t work underwater and the Pentagon has already studied the possibility of wind turbines affecting radar, concluding that any minor interference can be “offset with planning and technological upgrades.” You fucking idiots.

As it was, DC Circuit Judge Royce Lamberth in September granted Ørsted’s request to lift the stop-work order while its suit against the government goes forward, and work has resumed on Revolution Wind. In fact, in November, the administration missed its chance to appeal Lamberth’s order, although it remains just as insanely devoted to favoring oil and gas over renewable energy.

As for Monday’s decision overturning the Wind Order, the White House’s first response was, as always, to whine. White House Spokesperson Taylor Rogers groused that darn it, that nasty old Joe Biden had given wind preferential treatment while being unspeakably cruel to fossil fuels, which is a difficult lie to reconcile with the fact that US oil production reached historically high levels during the Biden administration.

Still, Rogers, like every other Trumper, offered the same line every other administration hack does on any energy story, proclaiming that “President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security.” Why no, Rogers didn’t say anything specific about the ruling or whether the administration will try to pursue the case in the Supreme Court.

That’s virtually the same as the non-answer that fellow spokesbot Anna Kelly offered last month when asked if the administration would appeal to try to stop Revolution Wind: “In just a few months, President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restored American energy dominance,” blah blah blah, with no mention of the wind farm or the judge’s decision.

Now that Judge Saris has deflated Trump’s Wind Order, states and companies will still need to sue to move wind projects forward, causing costly delays and probably killing some projects altogether, so progress will remain slow. US offshore wind may remain stymied until Trump is out of office, putting us farther and farther behind the rest of the world, which is all in on renewables. All the more reason to keep up the pressure to retake Congress and fight Trump’s climate stupidity at every step. For now, at least, states that want cleaner, more affordable energy for the long term have one less roadblock in their way.

That will include electric vehicles, many of which were leased during the tax credit era.

Coupled with depreciation, this means that a giant supply of low-mileage EVs are hitting dealer lots, many with excellent range and outstanding features.

Some people say that given recent trends, the auto industry bet wrong on electric vehicles. I see things differently. I think it bet wrong on high prices.

New car prices skyrocketed to around $50,000 this year, and EV models went even higher, especially after the $7,500 federal tax credit vanished. You can blame a number of trends for this. Inflation is certainly one of them. But in general, automakers looked at the car-buying trends of the 2010s—when Americans kept going bigger and better and nicer—and anticipated they too could keep going up and up forever.

Today, with interest rates still high and amid persistent inflation, people feel differently about new car purchases. More than ever, they're after a good deal. And in 2026, the used EV market seems poised to give it to them.

New data from the car-buying website Edmunds indicates that next year will see a surge in off-lease vehicles returning to the market. ""The sharp drop in leasing activity in 2022 left 2025 with unusually thin inventories of lower-mileage, near-new vehicles, limiting affordable choices for many shoppers,"" Edmunds analysts said. ""As leasing began to recover in 2023, the resulting 2026 lease returns will start to help fill a gap that was especially visible in 2025.""

If you want numbers around that, Edmunds estimates that around 400,000 more lease returns will return to the market in 2026. ""A healthier flow of off-lease returns will give consumers more flexibility—especially those priced out of the new-vehicle market or looking to avoid today's higher monthly payments,"" analysts said.

They don't say this explicitly, but I'll take things a step further: it's about to be a great year to get an awesome, affordable used EV.

As Edmunds notes in that data, about 71% of EVs sold in recent years were leased. This stemmed from a quirk in the EV tax credit rules: to qualify for the full $7,500, a car had to be built in North America—but if it was leased, any EV qualified for the credit regardless of where it was made. And carmakers started offering obscenely cheap lease deals just to entice people to go electric. Thus, nearly everyone who got a new EV in recent years leased it (including yours truly).

But since most lease deals are two or three years long, many of those EVs are due back next year (also including yours truly's car). And EV depreciation has been unfortunately steep—about 13% or more than gas cars, in part because there's no standard to evaluate battery health. These initial owners' losses, however, could soon be your gain. Many well-equipped used EVs now retail for $30,000 or less, often with excellent range, tons of features and more power than a comparable gas car.

Take the Ford Mustang Mach-E, still a staff favorite after all these years. According to CarGurus data, they now sell for an average of $28,970—which made me spit out my drink when I read it. If you buy a lease turn-in, like a 2023 Mach-E Premium with 290 to 306 miles of range, with loads of tech and probably less than 30,000 miles on the odometer. Find me a gas car deal that good. I'll wait. Or you give in to your evil side and get the Mach-E GT, with 480 horsepower. Those can also be had for much cheaper than they went for originally.

Or the Kia EV6, which I have. My car was over $50,000 when I got it (thanks, cheap lease deals). Today, CarGurus says their average used retail prices are around $27,427, as of this writing. Again, that gets you into a comfortable, family-friendly crossover with excellent performance, around 300 miles of range, Tesla Supercharger access (via an adapter) and the best charging speeds in its class for less than $30 grand.

And the Tesla Model Y is still hard to beat, especially if you buy one used. Right now, CarGurus says they retail for around $29,429 on the pre-owned market, and that gets you a lot of car for not a ton of money.

But if you're new to EV-buying, you may be thinking: what about the battery? The good news is that study after study shows us that modern EV batteries hold up remarkably well. With a lease turn-in around 30,000 miles or so, it's unlikely you will see any real battery degradation—and thus, loss of range—for a long time. On older Teslas, we've seen plenty of examples getting past 200,000 and even 300,000 miles with 80% battery capacity or more. It's simply not an issue like people think it is.

The EV tax credit once included a discount of up to $4,000 for used models, but that's unfortunately no longer the case. But depreciation is still opening the door to a great deal. So if you've been putting off car-shopping until 2026, your patience may soon be rewarded if you go electric—and then you probably won't go back to gas.

This position helped my administration seize every possible opportunity to expand Virginia’s energy mix, lower costs for hardworking families and grow our economy.
I also strengthened Virginia’s natural gas supplies and energy efficiency standards by advancing legislation to expand development of natural gas infrastructure and signing the Conservation and Ratemaking Efficiency (CARE) Act into law.
These energy policies — spanning all manner of energy sources, from natural gas to solar and wind energy — helped lower utility bills and create more jobs in the commonwealth.
That’s the best path forward to reduce energy bills, lower the cost of living and help us successfully move toward a prosperous clean energy future.","Following their major statewide wins and historic legislative victory in November, Virginia Democrats will deliver on several policy priorities in the 2026 legislative session — with affordability as issue one.

Throughout the campaign, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and the entire Democratic ticket championed lowering costs for Virginians, especially when it comes to the commonwealth’s surging electricity demand and utility costs. Virginia currently ranks 29th in the country for electricity affordability and we import more power than any other state in the nation. At the same time, our power demands are enormous. The commonwealth boasts the world’s largest data center market with 340 facilities and, if projections hold, data center construction could triple our state’s electricity demand by 2050.

If we want to continue growing our economy, create good-paying jobs and embrace technological innovations that position us as a global leader in science and technology, it can’t come at the cost of affordability and higher electricity bills.

During my time as governor, Virginia’s economy boomed. I was proud to add more than 200,000 new jobs, significantly reduce the unemployment rate, and help implement economic policies that led to personal income increasing by nearly 13%. My administration achieved these milestones because we embraced all types of energy solutions to power our economic growth. My Virginia Energy Plan acknowledged the rapidly changing energy landscape and laid out a strategy to drive innovation in energy generation by deploying diverse fuel sources, including nuclear power and natural gas, while dramatically expanding solar and offshore wind capacity and calling for state-led efficiency programs.

To help reduce overall energy consumption, I established an executive committee on energy efficiency and appointed a chief energy efficiency officer — the first state-level position of its kind in the country — to manage the planning, implementation and evaluation of energy efficiency throughout the state. This position helped my administration seize every possible opportunity to expand Virginia’s energy mix, lower costs for hardworking families and grow our economy.

I also strengthened Virginia’s natural gas supplies and energy efficiency standards by advancing legislation to expand development of natural gas infrastructure and signing the Conservation and Ratemaking Efficiency (CARE) Act into law. The CARE Act encouraged utilities to build pipelines and other infrastructure that would bring shale and coalbed methane gas to the market while keeping prices affordable for consumers. It helped reform the financial and regulatory mechanisms for natural gas utilities, delivering stronger efficiency options for Virginia consumers. These energy policies — spanning all manner of energy sources, from natural gas to solar and wind energy — helped lower utility bills and create more jobs in the commonwealth.

As our energy demand skyrockets, we must build on these efforts and there’s growing demand among Virginians for decisive action. Recent polling found that 62% of Virginia voters agree on building more natural gas plants and a majority of voters throughout the commonwealth said the price of electricity was an important factor in their vote this year, supporting a balanced approach to lower utility bills by expanding our state’s natural gas and renewable energy capacities.

New energy construction remains subject to planning, siting, permitting and building delays. But we can’t let that slow us down. Improvements to state regulatory processes that ensure safety and respect for our environment can help us move forward expeditiously to meet this critical moment and lower costs quickly.

Virginia’s unemployment rate has risen for the last eight months, and our third-quarter GDP dropped from 6.2% in 2024 to 1.7% in 2025. To keep growing Virginia’s economy, provide sufficient power to homes and businesses, and lower electricity costs, the commonwealth must diversify its energy sources — as we did when I was governor — and unlock the potential of affordable natural gas as more renewable energy sources come online. That’s the best path forward to reduce energy bills, lower the cost of living and help us successfully move toward a prosperous clean energy future.",https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/01/09/4473TWU2SGIYJLRPBES5IJXQXU.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-12-13 19:58:59.467382

Who foots the bill?,Alejandro Lazo,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-13/data-centers-for-ai-could-nearly-triple-san-joses-energy-use-who-foots-bill,"The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity.
No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers.","The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.

Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.

Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San José clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center build-out, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.

Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.

Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.

How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?

The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.

According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.

Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.

“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”

The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised.

“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years — or at all,” the office said in its commentary.

Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.

Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San José, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San José Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”

What are the environmental concerns around the data-center boom?

California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.

Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.

Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.

Ahmad Thomas, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.

“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.

Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the the Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group.

Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?

The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.

The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.

State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.

Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.

PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology, calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.

Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San José’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.

Will data centers raise your electric bill?

California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.

PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.

Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.

“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”

Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills. A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.

“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/174ebc7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/840x441+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe4%2Fc8%2Fa658cdb947ccb55cb401c2dafacb%2Fdata-center-system.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 18:59:47.978719

European automotive supplier FORVIA and Swiss clean-hydrogen specialist H2 Energy have expanded their collaboration to accelerate the industrialisation of hydrogen supply infrastructure by jointly scaling production of Multiple Element Gas Containers (MEGCs) — large modular units used to transport compressed hydrogen safely and efficiently. The strengthened partnership means that FORVIA, which has been supplying certified 38 MPa hydrogen composite tanks, will now take on end-to-end manufacturing responsibility for complete MEGC units, supporting broader hydrogen mobility and logistics deployment across Europe.

MEGCs are key components in the hydrogen supply chain, acting as robust containerised solutions that allow hydrogen to be moved from production sites to filling stations or industrial users. The renewed agreement builds on FORVIA’s expertise in high-pressure hydrogen storage systems and H2 Energy’s operational experience running a functional hydrogen ecosystem via its Hydrospider subsidiary in Switzerland, where more than 30 MEGCs are already used daily to supply green hydrogen to 18 hydrogen refueling stations and heavy-duty vehicle fleets. Production of the full MEGC units is scheduled to begin by the end of 2025, marking a major milestone in scaling last-mile hydrogen logistics ahead of broader commercial rollouts for mobility applications.

Under the expanded partnership, FORVIA will combine its manufacturing capabilities with H2 Energy’s practical hydrogen infrastructure know-how to improve safety, quality and cost efficiency in hydrogen transport solutions. MEGCs integrate FORVIA’s composite cylinders, which already meet stringent European ADR certification standards for road transport of hydrogen, ensuring compliance with top safety and regulatory benchmarks. This means the containers can be used with confidence in pressurised hydrogen environments, facilitating the broader adoption of hydrogen fuel for industrial and mobility use cases.

The collaboration also addresses one of the key challenges facing hydrogen mobility: bridging the gap between production and consumption through reliable logistics solutions. While hydrogen refueling infrastructure continues to grow across Europe, cost-effective and scalable transport systems remain essential for ensuring consistent fuel availability, particularly for heavy-duty transport and commercial fleets. FORVIA and H2 Energy’s combined efforts aim to strengthen this supply backbone by deploying MEGC fleets that can deliver compressed hydrogen where pipelines or local production are not feasible.

In statements about the partnership, leaders from both companies highlighted its significance for the hydrogen economy. FORVIA’s Hydrogen Solutions leadership emphasised the company’s commitment to advancing safe, high-quality hydrogen transport technologies as part of a broader shift toward sustainable mobility. Meanwhile, H2 Energy’s founder stressed that integrating FORVIA’s manufacturing expertise enhances logistical efficiency and accelerates the deployment of affordable hydrogen supply infrastructure — a critical enabler of clean energy adoption across transport and industry.

Hydrogen mobility is positioned as a major pillar of Europe’s decarbonisation strategy, especially for sectors where battery electrification is less practical, such as long-haul trucking and heavy-duty vehicles. Containerised hydrogen solutions like MEGCs play a pivotal role by enabling flexible delivery models and supporting hydrogen refueling infrastructure in regions where direct pipeline access is limited or non-existent. By scaling production and streamlining assembly processes, FORVIA and H2 Energy are taking a tangible step toward overcoming logistical barriers and helping to make hydrogen a more accessible and competitive energy carrier.

The partnership also reflects a broader trend among automotive suppliers to diversify beyond traditional vehicle components and contribute to the energy transition through clean mobility infrastructure. FORVIA’s investment in hydrogen transport systems aligns with its strategy to expand its portfolio in electrification and energy management, while H2 Energy continues to grow its integrated hydrogen value chain — from production and storage to distribution and use.

Looking forward, the companies expect that rolling out standardised, certified MEGC units at scale can help meet rising demand for hydrogen logistics solutions in both commercial transport and industrial sectors. As regulators, fleets and infrastructure developers increasingly adopt hydrogen solutions, partnerships like this one could accelerate the transition to lower-carbon mobility while supporting Europe’s climate goals.",https://telematicswire.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-twfev-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:04.077718

A collision between AI data centers being built—in the current AI bubble and with full throated support by the Trump Administration—and aluminum smelters for electricity is no longer theoretical. Utilities across the United States are facing binding constraints on generation and transmission. When presented with competing requests for hundreds of MW of firm power, they are choosing the customer that can pay more, scale faster, and accept shorter contracts. That customer is almost always a data center. Aluminum smelting, which depends on cheap electricity locked in for decades, loses in that comparison even before policy enters the picture.

Primary aluminum smelting is uniquely exposed to electricity pricing because electricity is not an input at the margin. It is the input. A modern smelter consumes power on the scale of a city and must operate continuously. Interruptions damage equipment and shutdowns destroy economics. To remain viable, smelters typically need long term power contracts at roughly $40 per MWh. AI data centers, by contrast, can tolerate higher prices, shift loads geographically, and monetize power into high margin digital services. That asymmetry is structural and it defines everything that follows.

The decline of US aluminum smelting did not begin with AI, renewables, or EVs. It has been unfolding for decades. In the mid twentieth century the United States was the world’s dominant aluminum producer, anchored by hydroelectric power and protected domestic markets. As globalization accelerated, smelting shifted toward regions with abundant low cost electricity and stable policy frameworks. Canada, Norway, Iceland, and the Gulf states built modern capacity while US plants aged. Rising power costs, environmental compliance requirements, and underinvestment eroded competitiveness long before today’s debates.

By the early 2020s, only four primary smelters remained operational in the United States. The remaining active smelters are in Indiana, northern New York, western Kentucky, and South Carolina, typically co located with legacy power infrastructure and long standing utility agreements that allow them to operate at all. Domestic primary production fell to roughly 700,000 tons per year while total US aluminum demand hovered around 5 million tons. Recycling expanded to fill the gap and now supplies roughly 72% of US aluminum consumption (like steel, the United States is a global leader in primary metal recycling, which is a strong positive). Net imports supply the remaining 14%, mostly from Canada. The system adapted to smelter decline through recycling and imports rather than revival of primary capacity.

In 2025, the administration sharply escalated tariffs on imported aluminum, citing national security, supply chain resilience, and domestic job protection. Section 232 tariffs rose to 25% and then to 50% for most sources. The stated intent was straightforward. Higher prices would support domestic producers and encourage investment in new capacity. Tariffs would level the playing field and bring smelting back.

In practice, tariffs were applied to a system that was already import dependent and constrained by electricity availability. Before the 2025 escalation, the US Midwest duty paid premium typically sat in the $450 to $550 per ton range, reflecting the delivered physical cost of aluminum in the United States above the global benchmark price. Within months of the tariff increases, that premium rose to roughly $1,300 to $1,900 per ton, a two and a half to four times increase over the prior baseline. Over the same period, the base LME aluminum price increased by roughly $200 to $300 per ton, on the order of 8% to 12%. The result was a sharp divergence between global aluminum prices and the delivered prices paid by US buyers, driven primarily by policy rather than underlying metal scarcity.

This price increase did improve cash margins for surviving smelters that already had tolerable power contracts. It did not address the binding constraints that prevented restarts or new builds. Electricity remained too expensive and too uncertain. Capital costs remained high. Policy risk increased rather than declined. Tariffs raised the price signal without changing the underlying feasibility of investment.

The first industries to feel the impact were those that buy large volumes of aluminum and operate on tight margins. Automotive manufacturing sits at the center of that group. Modern vehicles contain increasing amounts of aluminum to reduce weight and meet efficiency targets. EVs contain more aluminum than internal combustion vehicles because battery packs, structures, and thermal systems demand it. When delivered aluminum prices rise by $800 to $1,500 per ton, the added cost per vehicle ranges from $150 to $400 depending on design.

Automakers cannot fully absorb those increases. They respond by delaying model launches, reducing incentives, substituting steel where feasible, and passing costs to consumers. For EVs, where price parity remains fragile, aluminum inflation slows adoption and undermines competitiveness. Tariffs that were meant to support domestic manufacturing end up raising input costs for one of the country’s largest manufacturing sectors.

Grid infrastructure and electrification face similar pressure. Aluminum is embedded in transmission lines, substations, transformers, and renewable energy structures. Materials often account for 20% to 30% of transmission project costs. When aluminum and related metals become more expensive, utilities must either raise rate cases, delay projects, or scale them back. Regulatory approval takes time and cost recovery is partial. The result is slower grid expansion and higher electricity bills over time.

Renewable energy projects absorb these costs as well. Solar frames, wind components, and balance of system equipment all rely on aluminum. While aluminum is not the dominant cost driver for renewables, it is a meaningful one. Rising materials costs compound existing supply chain and permitting challenges. Deployment slows at the margin, especially where power purchase agreements were bid at tight prices.

Packaging and consumer goods also feel the impact, though the per unit effect is smaller. Beverage cans, appliances, and household products incorporate large volumes of aluminum. Higher costs are passed through gradually to consumers. Each item increases by cents rather than dollars, but the effect is broad and persistent.

Substitution provides only partial relief. Steel can replace aluminum in some automotive and construction applications, but weight penalties, corrosion risks, and performance limits constrain that option. Composites and plastics have already displaced aluminum in many uses and face sustainability and recycling challenges of their own. In critical applications such as power transmission, aerospace, and heat exchange, aluminum has no practical substitute. Higher prices do not eliminate demand. They shift costs through the system.

Proponents of tariffs argue that these costs are a temporary price worth paying to rebuild domestic capacity. In theory, higher prices could support restarts of idled smelters and justify new investment. In reality, restart potential is limited, capital intensive, and still dependent on cheap long term power. Many idled plants are obsolete or partially dismantled. New smelters cost several billion dollars and require decades of confidence in power pricing and trade policy.

Capital markets are pricing materially higher risk in 2025, and that increase is directly linked to policy choices made by the Trump Administration. The escalation of trade tariffs, including the sharp increase in aluminum duties, has increased uncertainty around long term market access and price stability, which raises required returns for capital intensive industrial projects. Repeated use of executive authority to change trade rules has shortened investor time horizons and widened credit spreads for sectors exposed to policy reversal risk.

There is also a critical labor distinction that is often glossed over in discussions of smelter viability. The direct workforce inside operating aluminum smelters is heavily unionized, relatively stable, and largely composed of US citizens or permanent residents with long tenure and specialized operational experience. That workforce can keep an existing smelter running once it is operating.

Smelter restarts, major maintenance, retrofits, and new construction, however, rely far more on external and often non unionized labor pools. These include industrial construction crews, refractory specialists, electricians, welders, civil works contractors, and control system installers. In practice, parts of this supporting workforce have historically included undocumented immigrants or workers in mixed status households, particularly in construction, site preparation, and ancillary services. The Trump Administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement posture and expanded deportation actions have tightened these labor markets further, reducing availability, increasing wage pressure, and raising the risk of delays and work stoppages.

This raises project costs and lengthens schedules, which feeds directly into higher execution risk. For capital intensive projects with multi year timelines, this distinction matters. Even if a smelter can staff its unionized operations once running, uncertainty around the availability, legality, and cost of the broader maintenance and construction workforce further undermines investor confidence and pushes the effective cost of capital higher.

Compared with the 2010s, when stable trade policy, lower interest rates, and more predictable labor availability supported effective WACC levels in the 6% to 8% range, new US primary smelting projects in 2025 face effective WACC estimates in the 9% to 12% range or higher once policy volatility and labor constraints are fully priced. These risks compound over multi year build timelines. Even with higher aluminum prices, investors see more attractive risk adjusted returns in assets with shorter development cycles, lighter labor requirements, and clearer policy alignment, including AI data centers that are competing directly for the same electricity.

This combines to mean that restarting idled aluminum plants, something requiring hundreds of millions of dollars, or building new ones, something requiring billions, are very unlikely to reach final investment decision. The cost of capital alone raises the costs of these options by tens to hundreds of millions. This compounds the lack of competitively priced industrial electricity and the challenges with getting the skilled labor necessary for new plants. It’s much more likely that more primary aluminum smelters will close rather than new ones open, a situation directly attributable to the Trump Administration’s policies which were supposed to achieve the opposite.

The collision with AI does not end there. Data centers themselves require massive grid expansion. They need transmission, substations, transformers, and conductors to be built at unprecedented speed. Aluminum is embedded in all of that infrastructure. When tariffs raise the cost of those materials, the cost and timeline of data center electrification increase. The policy meant to assert industrial strength ends up slowing the infrastructure buildout required for digital growth.

Over time, these costs do not remain with producers. They are passed through to American consumers on staggered timelines across multiple sectors. In the automotive sector, higher aluminum input costs translate into vehicle price increases or slower price declines in the range of roughly $100 to $400 per vehicle, typically appearing within 6 to 18 months as model years turn over and incentive budgets tighten.

In beverage packaging, higher aluminum prices raise the cost of cans for soda and beer, adding on the order of a few cents per six pack or case. These increases tend to appear quickly, often within 3 to 9 months, as can contracts reset and packaging costs are passed through to beverage brands and then to retail prices.

In the electricity system, higher aluminum and metals costs raise the capital cost of transmission, substations, and grid equipment. Utilities recover these costs gradually through rate cases, leading to electricity bill increases that are smaller in any given year but persistent, often amounting to a few dollars per household per month over a 3 to 10 year horizon.

In construction, higher aluminum costs feed into windows, cladding, and structural components, contributing to incremental increases in housing costs that surface over multiple years as projects are repriced and delivered. Public budgets absorb part of the shock through subsidies and infrastructure support, which shifts costs into higher taxes or public debt over longer time frames. The incidence is delayed, spread across sectors, and difficult to trace to a single policy, but it is cumulative and unavoidable.

This pattern is regressive in its effects. Electricity and packaged goods costs represent a larger share of household spending for low income Americans, so even modest increases have disproportionate impacts. Higher beverage prices are visible and frequent, while higher vehicle prices delay access to EVs that offer lower operating costs, extending reliance on more expensive fuel and maintenance. Higher electricity rates affect all households as electrification advances and electricity becomes a larger share of total energy spending. What is framed as protection for domestic industry in practice functions as a broad cost transfer to consumers, delivered through higher prices and slower cost reductions, without producing a durable revival of domestic aluminum smelting capacity.

Beyond the current administration, the implications are strategic. Electrified economies are more productive, resilient, and competitive. They rely on abundant electricity, strong grids, and efficient materials supply chains. Policies that raise the cost of electrification inputs while failing to resolve core constraints slow the transition to an electrostate. Even if future leadership shifts course, the lost time and deferred investment compound.

A coherent strategy would need to align power policy, transmission buildout, trade stability, and targeted industrial support. It would need to recognize that electrons, capital, and skilled labor are the real bottlenecks. Blunt price levers applied to one part of the system ripple outward in unintended ways. The experience of 2025 shows that raising aluminum prices does not rebuild smelting, but it does raise costs across the economy.

Electricity will continue to flow to the highest value uses. Markets will keep choosing data centers over smelters when power is scarce. Unless policy addresses physical realities rather than price signals alone, Americans will continue paying more without securing the industrial future those costs were meant to buy.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_9kpu1f9kpu1f9kpu-800x442.png,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:15.005471

The minister for resources, Madeleine King, this week announced five new areas in the Otway basin, stretching from waters off the south-west coast of Victoria to the ocean west of Tasmania, would be opened up for gas exploration as part of the government’s future gas strategy.

As cabinet deliberates over a major intervention into the east coast gas market, including a gas reservation, King said unlocking new supplies would help contain gas prices and avert potential shortfalls forecast for the end of the decade.

“Exploration and new discoveries will play an important role in underpinning our energy needs and support Australian industry and households as we meet our net zero commitments,” King said in a statement.

The announcement comes just days after the Victorian government opened tenders for gas exploration in the Otway and Gippsland basins.

The Australian Greens and the Wilderness Society have sharply criticised the federal government’s move, warning the search for new gas supplies would worsen the climate crisis and endanger marine wildlife.

“Labor’s new ocean acreage handout is an environmental betrayal and an early Christmas gift to the fossil fuel companies driving the climate crisis,” the Greens’ resources spokesperson, Steph Hodgins-May, said.

The party’s oceans spokesperson, Peter Whish-Wilson, questioned how opening new gas fields squared with the transition to clean energy.

“Labor’s two-faced climate act is wearing thin,” he said.

The Wilderness Society’s fossil fuel industry campaigner, Fern Cadman, said the waters earmarked in the latest acreage release were “wholly unsuitable” for gas exploration.

“It’s deeply disturbing that while parts of our country are on fire, fuelled by climate heating and burning of fossil fuels, the Albanese government is mindlessly paving the way for new gas drilling. Australia is meant to be on a path transitioning away from fossil fuels, not opening the door to brand new gas,” Cadman said.

King said the five new areas – all in commonwealth waters – had buffer zones to protect marine park boundaries.

Public consultation on the five zones is open until 6 February, with applications for exploration permits closing on 30 June.

The announcement comes as the Albanese government prepares to release the findings of a six-month review of the east coast gas market, which is widely expected to recommend establishing a new scheme to force producers to reserve supplies for domestic use.

Cabinet ministers are also reportedly considering bulk-buying gas and selling it to businesses at discounted rates to prevent the closure of struggling manufacturers.

Ahead of the review’s release, a coalition of environmentalists, inequality advocates and clean energy groups issued a statement opposing new taxpayer subsidises for gas companies, which they said have been “allowed to plunder Australia’s public resources without accountability for too long”.

The nine organisations backed a 25% tax on gas exports, an Australian Council of Trade Unions’ policy that has been championed by the Greens.

“Australia’s focus on gas exports has tripled domestic gas and electricity prices driving up inflation and household bills,” said Australian Council of Social Service climate and energy program director Kellie Caught, whose organisation was among the nine groups.

“The government must implement gas export market controls and avoid options that effectively subsidise gas companies or incentivise new polluting gas production.

Just as importantly, it positions New Mexico to attract billions in clean energy investments flowing to states with strong, consistent climate rules.","Here in New Mexico, we take care of our families, our communities, and our unique way of life. It’s who we are. From the acequias that feed our fields to the small businesses that anchor our towns, New Mexicans know that when one of us is struggling, all of us step up. That spirit is what has sustained us through fires, floods, droughts and economic hardship and it’s the same spirit we need now as we confront the growing costs of a warming climate.

Because the truth is undeniable: Climate change is already reshaping daily life in New Mexico.

In the last fiscal year alone, our state spent more than $256 million responding to climate-driven disasters — from wildfires to flooding — through emergency executive orders, and this year the trend has been no different. Scientists and fiscal experts recently warned lawmakers that if we fail to act and prepare, climate-related losses could reach one-third of New Mexico’s annual budget by 2040. That would mean fewer dollars for the things we care about most: our children’s education, future infrastructure needs like roads and drinking water systems, affordable health care and the essential services that keep communities safe.

These aren’t abstract projections, they’re lived experiences happening today.

In Mora and San Miguel counties, the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire burned for nearly five months, destroying more than 630 homes and causing over $4 billion in damages. In Ruidoso, families endured the worst wildfire in their history, only to be hit again by catastrophic flooding that damaged hundreds more homes. Our ranchers have watched 20% of the state’s grazing lands disappear to heat and drought since the 1970s, and homeowners and communities statewide are facing double-digit insurance increases and dried out wells as the impact of extreme weather expands.

But New Mexicans don’t back down from big challenges. We meet them with resilience, responsibility and a commitment to protect what we love. That’s why we must commit to an economy-wide path to addressing the pollution that is causing our climate to change at a rate that’s outstripping our ability to adapt.

We’ve already taken strong steps. Our state passed the Energy Transition Act, adopted nation-leading methane rules and expanded renewable energy production. Thanks to these efforts, New Mexico is now a national leader in wind and solar, with clean-energy job growth outpacing the rest of the economy.

But our current goals to cut climate-damaging pollution rely on an executive order that can change with political winds. Families, workers and businesses deserve stability they can count on.

The Clear Horizons Act, introduced this year, provides that certainty. It codifies our 2050 net-zero targets into law, ensuring we have a real plan to reduce harmful pollution and protect the health, safety and economic security of New Mexicans. It gives state agencies the tools they need to track progress, address gaps and hold the largest polluters who emit over 10,000 tons of harmful pollution a year accountable.

Just as importantly, it positions New Mexico to attract billions in clean energy investments flowing to states with strong, consistent climate rules. That means new opportunities for working families: from solar installation and battery storage to energy-efficient construction, manufacturing and land restoration projects.

Next legislative session, let’s come together — urban and rural, northern and southern, conservative and progressive — and choose once again to take care of each other and our future by passing the Clear Horizons Act.",https://image.abqjournal.com/2938636.jpg?imageId=2938636&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-12-13 15:58:26.850808

This Insight addresses changes to IRA tax credits for electric vehicles, building energy use, and clean fuel production.

Electric Vehicles

The OBBBA repealed three electric vehicle (EV) tax credits originally enacted or expanded in the IRA, as described in Table 1.

The OBBBA terminated these credits for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. In August, the IRS announced that it would interpret the term ""acquired"" to mean ""paid for,"" such that if an individual purchases an EV before October 1st, then takes possession of the vehicle at a later date, that individual will be eligible for a tax credit.

The OBBBA also repealed the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (AFVRPC). Prior to the enactment of the IRA, the AFVRPC subsidized 30% of the costs of installing refueling equipment for alternative fuel vehicles, with a maximum credit of $30,000 for businesses and $1,000 for individuals; the credit originally expired at the end of 2021. The IRA reinstated the AFVRPC through 2032, made EV charging equipment eligible for the credit, and increased the maximum business credit to $100,000. The OBBBA terminated the AFVRPC for property placed in service after June 2026. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projects that repealing the credit will increase federal revenues by $2.0 billion during fiscal years 2026-2034.

Residential and Commercial Building Energy Use

The OBBBA repealed three tax credits and one tax deduction for building energy use that were previously modified by the IRA. The three credits previously expired at the end of 2021 and were reinstated by the IRA in 2022.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC) subsidizes 30% of the costs that individuals bear for purchasing, assembling, and installing solar electric panels, geothermal heat pumps, and other renewable energy equipment at their residences. The IRA originally extended the credit through 2034, but the OBBBA repealed the RCEC for all equipment completing installation after December 31, 2025.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) subsidizes 30% of the costs of purchasing and installing energy-efficient equipment at their homes. Annual credit amounts are limited to $3,200 per taxpayer and generally to $600 per item, with some exceptions. The EEHIC was increased to its current amounts and extended through 2032 by the IRA. The EEHIC's repeal in the OBBBA is worded somewhat ambiguously, but appears to indicate that property placed in service after 2025 will be ineligible for the credit.

Contractors may claim the Credit for Construction of Energy-Efficient New Homes (CCEENH) for building and selling new energy-efficient homes. The IRA increased the credit's maximum value from $2,000 to $5,000 per home and changed the credit's expiration year to 2032. The OBBBA terminated the CCEENH for homes acquired after June 30, 2026.

Finally, the OBBBA terminates the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (EECBD) for property beginning construction after June 30, 2026. The EECBD allows businesses to deduct the costs of purchasing and installing energy-efficient equipment more quickly than they otherwise would under normal tax rules. The IRA made the deduction more generous, although it had low take-up.

The JCT projects that, through the end of FY2034, federal deficits will be reduced by $77.4 billion due to repeal of the RCEC, $21.2 billion due to repeal of the EEHIC, $5.4 billion due to repeal of the CCEENH, and $134 million due to repeal of the EECBD.

Clean Fuel Production

Prior to the enactment of the IRA, there were separate federal tax credits for biodiesel, biodiesel mixtures, agri-biodiesel, renewable diesel, second-generation biofuel, mid-level ethanol blends, alternative fuels, and alternative fuels mixtures. The IRA added a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), then scheduled the SAF credit and all other fuel credits to expire at the end of 2024. The IRA consolidated these provisions into a single tax credit, the Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC), starting in 2025. CFPC amounts scale up or down according to a fuel's global warming potential, but had maximum values of $1 per gallon for highway vehicle fuel and $1.75 per gallon for aviation fuel.

The OBBBA reinstated the small agri-biodiesel producer credit between July 2025 and December 2026. The OBBBA doubled the credit's value from 10 to 20 cents per gallon; made the credit transferable; and allowed credit recipients to claim the CFPC for the same fuel.

The OBBBA also made a number of reforms to the CFPC. Three of the most consequential reforms were:",https://www.EveryCRSReport.com/reports/IN12625.png,N,,2025-12-13 17:58:35.102021

In the quiet industrial town of Somerset, Massachusetts, the Brayton Point Power Station has finally gone dark. Once a towering symbol of the region’s energy might, this coal-fired behemoth ceased operations three years ahead of its scheduled retirement, marking the end of an era for New England’s coal power. As reported in a recent update from Slashdot, the plant’s early shutdown underscores a broader trend sweeping across the United States, where coal plants are shuttering at an accelerating pace amid economic pressures and shifting energy priorities. This closure isn’t isolated; it’s part of a wave that has seen dozens of facilities bow out, driven by cheaper alternatives and environmental imperatives.

The numbers tell a stark story. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, planned retirements of coal-fired capacity are set to surge in 2025, with projections indicating a significant uptick from previous years. Analysts point to a combination of factors: the plummeting costs of natural gas and renewables, stringent emissions regulations, and a market increasingly favoring cleaner sources. In states like Washington, the last remaining coal plant, operated by TransAlta, was slated for closure this year but has instead pivoted to natural gas under a new agreement with Puget Sound Energy, as detailed in a report from Washington State Standard. This transition highlights how some operators are adapting rather than fully decommissioning, yet it still signals coal’s diminishing role.

Beyond individual plants, the ripple effects are profound. Coal once powered nearly half of America’s electricity, but its share has dwindled to around 13% in 2025, down from 51% two decades ago. Posts on X from energy analysts reflect a mix of sentiment, with some users noting the inevitability of this shift while others decry the loss of jobs in coal-dependent communities. The closures are not just about environmental wins; they reshape local economies, forcing workers to retrain or relocate as the industry contracts.

Shifting Winds in Energy Production

The pushback against coal’s decline has gained traction under the current administration. President Trump’s policies aim to bolster fossil fuels, including efforts to relax air pollution limits and stem plant closures. A Politico analysis reveals how the surge in electricity demand from data centers, fueled by the AI boom, is granting some coal plants a temporary reprieve. States are delaying retirements to meet this hunger for power, even as pollution levels tick upward—a reversal of the downward trend in emissions seen in prior years.

This lifeline, however, may be short-lived. The newest major coal plant in the U.S., plagued by operational failures, remains offline until 2027, according to insights from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Such setbacks underscore the unreliability and high costs of maintaining aging infrastructure. Meanwhile, international developments add pressure; South Korea’s announcement at the COP30 climate conference to phase out all coal by 2040 has alarmed exporters like Australia, as covered in The Guardian, signaling a global retreat from coal that could further isolate U.S. holdouts.

On the domestic front, regulatory bodies are navigating a delicate balance. In West Virginia, the Public Service Commission has stated it has no plans to approve shutdowns of coal-fired plants, emphasizing the need to maintain grid reliability amid rising demands. A recent WV MetroNews report quotes officials warning that replacing coal too hastily could lead to blackouts, especially as renewable integration lags in some regions. This stance reflects broader tensions between energy security and sustainability goals.

Economic Ripples and Job Market Shifts

The human cost of these closures cannot be overstated. Communities built around coal mining and power generation face uncertain futures. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the retirement of plants like Homer City has led to hundreds of job losses, compelling local governments to seek federal aid for retraining programs. Economists estimate that the ongoing phaseout could eliminate tens of thousands of positions by 2030, though new opportunities in renewables and natural gas are emerging to fill some gaps.

Yet, the transition isn’t uniform. While some states accelerate closures, others, influenced by the Trump administration’s “market-based” plans, are crafting strategies to keep plants operational longer. A piece from Energy Connects details how these initiatives aim to boost electricity supply before a full pivot to alternatives, potentially delaying the inevitable by a few years. This approach contrasts with historical trends; back in 2021, Reuters noted plans to retire over 6,100 megawatts of coal capacity, a figure that has only grown as economic realities bite harder.

Global comparisons provide further context. Asia’s major economies, including China and India, have outpaced the U.S. and Europe in cleaning up their power sectors this year, according to a Reuters report. This divergence highlights America’s slower progress, partly due to political resistance and the AI-driven demand spike that has prompted 15 coal plants to delay retirements since the election, as analyzed by DeSmog in recent X discussions and their publications.

Technological Pressures and Grid Challenges

The rise of artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword for coal. Data centers’ insatiable appetite for power has led to unexpected extensions for some facilities, but it also exposes the grid’s vulnerabilities. Posts on X from industry watchers, such as those discussing the 47% decline in U.S. grid reliability under past restrictive policies, underscore the urgency of diversification. One user highlighted how China’s addition of 243 coal plants in 2024 contrasts with America’s closures, raising questions about competitive energy strategies.

Technological failures compound the issue. The offline status of the nation’s newest large coal plant until 2027, as per the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, illustrates the maintenance challenges and high costs that make coal less viable. Operators are grappling with outages and repairs that erode profitability, pushing more toward retirement.

Looking ahead, projections from S&P Global, echoed in X analyses from years past, suggest coal’s share could plummet to just 5% by 2030 from 22% today. This forecast aligns with the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s outlook, which anticipates coal dropping to 7% of generation by 2035 even without stringent EPA rules, as noted in recent posts by energy commentators.

Policy Crossroads and Future Trajectories

At the policy level, the Trump administration’s relaxation of pollution controls, as explored in Politico, allows dirtier operations to persist, but environmental advocates argue this delays necessary innovation. The interplay between federal directives and state actions creates a patchwork of outcomes, with places like Washington opting for gas conversions while others cling to coal.

Economic modeling adds another layer. Analyses of initiatives like Project 2025 indicate potential job losses and GDP hits in states reliant on coal, with Pennsylvania facing up to 37,700 job cuts and billions in economic drag by 2030, according to reports shared on X. These figures emphasize the need for balanced transition strategies that mitigate harm to workers.

Internationally, the Guardian’s coverage of South Korea’s 2040 phaseout serves as a cautionary tale for U.S. policymakers, illustrating how swift commitments can reshape export markets and global supply chains. Australia’s coal industry feels the pinch, a reminder that America’s decisions ripple outward.

Balancing Reliability and Renewal

As closures mount, the focus shifts to grid stability. Officials in West Virginia, via WV MetroNews, stress keeping plants open to avoid disruptions, especially with data center growth straining resources. This sentiment echoes across X, where users debate the merits of coal versus renewables in maintaining baseload power.

Innovations in energy storage and transmission could ease the shift, but implementation lags. The Washington State Standard’s report on TransAlta’s gas switch exemplifies adaptive strategies, potentially serving as a model for other regions.

Ultimately, the story of America’s coal plants is one of inexorable change, driven by market forces, technological advancements, and policy evolutions. While some facilities gain brief extensions, the trajectory points toward a coal-free horizon, reshaping the nation’s energy framework for generations to come.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3784-1765649797.jpeg,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:17.804791

Ford and SK On formed BlueOval SK in 2021 to build three battery plants: two in Kentucky and one at Ford's 6-square-mile manufacturing site in rural West Tennessee. The plants represent a combined $11.4 billion investment.

Under the mutual restructuring agreement announced Thursday, a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the Kentucky battery plants, and SK On will own and operate the battery plant in Tennessee, according to a statement from SK On. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be complete by the first quarter of 2026.

The agreement allows SK On to ""improve its operational efficiency"" and ""respond more effectively to evolving market dynamics and diverse customer needs,"" the company stated.

The start of production at the Tennessee battery plant ""remains flexible at this time, as it's tied to the ownership transition,"" an SK On spokesperson said Thursday.

BlueOval SK External Affairs Director Keli McAlister wrote in a statement that the company is aware of SK On's announcement and BlueOval SK is ""working with both of our parent companies to determine what this means for BlueOval SK.""

A representative for Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

State officials are keeping a close eye on the arrangement because of a nearly $1 billion investment in BlueOval City.

""We are aware of Ford and SK On's decision to end their U.S. battery joint venture. However, this corporate decision does not change or diminish the commitments made to West Tennessee,"" the state's Department of Economic and Community Development wrote in a statement. ""The jobs, investment and long-term, generational impact promised to the region remain on track.""

Ford has pushed back its start date for mass production at the BlueOval City campus twice over the last two years amid a shifting electric vehicle market.

The industry has faced heightened political turbulence as President Donald Trump's administration targeted Biden-era electric vehicle funding and tax credits.

As of August, Ford plans to start mass production of its next-generation electric pickup truck in 2028, three years after its initial production goal of 2025.

SK On ""plans to focus on profitable and sustainable growth in the U.S. by supplying electric vehicle batteries to Ford and various customers, as well as energy storage systems, from its Tennessee plant,"" the company stated.

It emphasized its ongoing commitment to the Tennessee plant, stating the facility is a ""cornerstone of its expanding U.S. advanced battery manufacturing capabilities and production.""

SK On will ""maintain its solid strategic relationship with Ford going forward,"" as the Tennessee battery plant is on the Ford campus.

When the BlueOval City project was announced in 2021, it received nearly $1 billion in state economic incentives contingent on creating 5,760 direct new jobs over a 10-year period, with Ford's vehicle manufacturing plant slated to employ 3,000 of those workers. The remainder would be employed by the BlueOval SK battery plant.

BlueOval SK reported in September that it had hired 350 employees in Tennessee and 1,450 at its battery plants in Kentucky.

Ford announced a $2 billion investment in August to convert a Kentucky manufacturing plant to build electric vehicles, starting with a mid-sized electric pickup truck slated to launch in 2027.

Figueres asks the key question: Can this new exponential curve of clean energy innovation outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts?","By Paul Roberts / For The Herald

The annual United Nations climate talks (COP30) concluded Nov. 22 in Belem, Brazil, with tepid agreements for more funding to address adaptation and slow progress to reduce emissions. The agreements did not include commitments to phase out fossil fuels as demanded by many nations.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The deal shows that nations can still come together to confront the defining challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

Nearly 200 nations sent delegations to COP30. The US was noticeably absent joining Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino. Still, there are reasons for hope. Huge strides are being made in clean energy innovation and economics, notably from China.

In an essay published in The Economist magazine, Christiana Figueres, Costa Rican diplomat and one of the primary architects of the 2015 Paris agreement said: “The question now is weather this exponential curve of clean energy innovation can outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts.” She went on to say: “The era when American politics could make or break global climate co-operation is over. The world is no longer waiting for Washington.”

Indeed, China is leading the world in clean energy development and technology. And they are exporting their technology, to the benefit of the Chinese economy and the global environment. The Nov. 8 issue of The Economist magazine published a “Special Report: China, energy and climate” (https://tinyurl.com/EconomistChinaReport.)

The “Leader” section of The Economist (https://tinyurl.com/EconomistChinaCleanEnergy) is quoted here: “The scale of [China’s] renewable revolution is almost too vast for the human mind to grasp. By the end of last year, the country had installed 887 gigawatts of solar-power capacity; close to double Europe’s and America’s combined total.”

The Economist report continues: “The coming-together of China’s enormous manufacturing capacity and its ravenous appetite for copious, cheap, domestically produced electricity deserves to be seen in a world changing light. They have made China a new type of superpower: one which deploys clean electricity on a planetary scale.”

China is on track to meet or exceed its emission reduction targets set under the Paris agreement. The COP30 negotiators have taken notice. So have other nations seeking to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, seeking energy independence, and emissions reductions.

“China is exporting it’s [renewable] revolution to the rest of the world,” The Economist continues. “America’s current government rejects renewable technologies. … China is now making more money from exporting green technology than America makes from exporting fossil fuels. … In a world where China and America vie for advantage of all sorts, climate is an area where China has a particularly strong hand; and President Donald Trump has folded America’s.”

China is demonstrating that the technical capacity to reduce emissions is here now. What has been lacking is political will. That, too, is changing with the economics. The Economist reports: “The anti-emissions machine is powered by self-interest. More clean tech elsewhere lowers China’s own climate risks by reducing global emissions. At the same time it brings economic benefits. For many years countries’ economic and climate interests have often been thought to diverge. … Today the economic and climate interests of the world’s biggest manufacturer and many of its export markets are increasingly aligned.”

China is well aware of it’s growing global stature from exporting clean technology. They are developing global partnerships while the U.S. is abandoning them.

Some states are filling the vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal from climate agreements. California, (the world’s fifth-largest economy), and Washington (the nation’s fourth-largest state economy) are leaders in climate change and clean energy technology. Both were represented at COP30 and are positively engaged in trade with China.

Figueres asks the key question: Can this new exponential curve of clean energy innovation outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts? China is demonstrating that it is possible, responding at both speed and scale.

Imagine what could be done if we were to commit the same level of resources and energy currently dedicated to AI development, toward clean renewable energy and combatting climate change? China is giving the world hope, and the world — minus one — is paying attention.

Eco-nomics

“Eco-nomics” is a series of articles exploring issues at the intersection of climate change and economics. Climate change (global warming) is caused by greenhouse gas emissions — carbon dioxide and methane chiefly — generated by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and agricultural practices. Global warming poses an existential threat to the planet. Successfully responding to this threat requires urgent actions — clear plans and actionable strategies — to rapidly reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate-influenced events.",http://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heraldnet_logo.png,N,,2025-12-13 14:59:58.746664

The legislative push to streamline energy infrastructure permitting represents a significant shift in federal policy.","The U.S. House of Representatives has taken a pivotal step in reshaping the permitting process for interstate natural gas pipelines. By passing the Improving Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act, the House aims to expedite the federal permitting process, designating the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as the lead agency. This move is expected to streamline the often lengthy and cumbersome approval process, potentially leading to quicker development of energy infrastructure across the country. As energy demands continue to rise, this legislative shift could have significant implications for both energy companies and consumers.

Streamlining the Permitting Process

The passage of the bill by a vote of 213-184 marks a concerted effort by lawmakers to address inefficiencies in the current permitting system. Traditionally, interstate pipeline projects have faced delays due to multiple layers of regulatory oversight, particularly involving water quality certifications under the Clean Water Act. By allowing FERC to include water quality assessments in its environmental review process, the bill seeks to eliminate the need for separate state certifications, which have often been a bottleneck.

This legislative push comes amid growing concerns about the adequacy of existing infrastructure to meet increasing energy demands. With data centers and other high-energy-use facilities proliferating, the need for rapid expansion of the energy grid is more pressing than ever. Moreover, the bill is part of a broader legislative agenda aimed at reducing household energy costs, which have been on the rise. By expediting infrastructure development, the hope is to create a more reliable and affordable energy supply.

Support and Opposition

The bill has garnered support from various stakeholders, including industry groups and some policymakers who view it as a necessary step towards modernizing America’s energy infrastructure. American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers emphasized the importance of the legislation, stating,

“These bills help unlock the infrastructure America needs to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable energy.”

US Commits $800 Million to Small Reactors, Transforming Energy Landscape and Supporting Green Innovation

However, the bill is not without its critics. Environmental groups and some state governments have expressed concerns about the potential weakening of environmental safeguards. They argue that by reducing state involvement in the permitting process, the bill could lead to insufficient consideration of local environmental impacts. This tension highlights the ongoing debate between advancing infrastructure and preserving environmental integrity.

The Broader Legislative Landscape

The House’s action is part of a larger legislative effort to reform energy permitting processes. Another bill, Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today, has also passed with bipartisan support, signaling a strong desire across party lines to tackle energy infrastructure challenges. The Senate is concurrently working on its own set of reforms, focusing on amendments to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

US LNG Exports Surge to Record Highs in November, Driven by Cooler Weather and Robust Production

NEPA, a cornerstone of environmental legislation, mandates rigorous environmental reviews for major infrastructural projects. The Senate’s proposed reforms aim to streamline these reviews, potentially facilitating quicker upgrades to electric transmission lines and other critical infrastructure. As both chambers of Congress work on complementary but distinct legislative paths, the outcome could significantly reshape how energy projects are developed and approved in the United States.

Potential Impacts on Energy Costs and Infrastructure

If successful, these legislative efforts could lead to substantial changes in the energy landscape. By reducing the time and complexity involved in pipeline permitting, companies may be more willing to invest in new projects, potentially increasing the availability of natural gas and other energy resources. This could, in turn, lead to lower energy costs for consumers, who have been bearing the brunt of rising prices.

Moreover, enhanced energy infrastructure could improve reliability and reduce the risk of outages, especially as the country transitions to more renewable energy sources. However, the balance between speed and environmental protection remains a delicate one. Policymakers will need to ensure that the push for efficiency does not come at the expense of environmental standards and public health.

The legislative push to streamline energy infrastructure permitting represents a significant shift in federal policy. As the Senate and House continue to refine and negotiate their respective bills, the coming months will be critical in determining the future of energy development in the United States. How will these changes impact the balance between energy independence and environmental stewardship in the long term?

New Mexico tells a different story. Here, we’ve shown that when a state aligns talent development, policy and infrastructure, innovation becomes a powerful engine for economic growth.

Over the last few years, New Mexico has committed to a willingness to work together. Policymakers, universities, national labs and local businesses have built a foundation for a modern technology economy, one that is growing faster than many may realize. But as this new era of innovation accelerates, driven by artificial intelligence, advanced computing and electrification, the states that will lead are those that ensure they have the power and related infrastructure to sustain it.

Any long-term innovation strategy must first start with people, and New Mexico’s talent pipeline is increasingly one of our greatest strengths. Our workforce programs and higher education institutions are the engine of this effort, working hand-in-hand to prepare the next generation of innovators who will power our economy for decades to come.

The University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University and New Mexico Tech are producing thousands of STEM graduates each year and partnering directly with New Mexico businesses to match degrees in fields like cybersecurity, clean energy, aerospace and advanced manufacturing. In fact, New Mexico now ranks sixth in the nation for manufacturing employment growth and has added more than 12,000 new jobs in the last year alone.

Our state is also benefiting from organizations that nurture local talent in local companies. In Albuquerque, CNM Ingenuity has helped launch hundreds of startups and placed thousands of New Mexicans into high-wage tech jobs while the Elevate Quantum Tech Hub has positioned the state as a leader in quantum information science and attracted national partners in AI, defense and semiconductor innovation. These hubs, combined with a growing network of accelerators and university partnerships, are creating opportunities that keep our homegrown talent right here in New Mexico.

To help strengthen this foundation, I was proud to champion House Bill 20, which established the Technology and Innovation Division within the Economic Development Department. The bill secured more than $90 million to support recruitment, retention and training in high-tech fields — investments that will continue to attract companies specializing in AI, clean energy, advanced computing and bioscience. These are the kinds of employers that bring not only high-paying jobs, but long-term economic stability.

New Mexico also benefits from an unparalleled concentration of scientific power. World-class research centers like Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory are anchoring billions of dollars in federal research and increasingly partnering with local businesses to translate research into commercial products, new companies and career pathways for New Mexicans. Growing companies like UbiQD in Los Alamos, Descartes Labs in Santa Fe, and RS21 in Albuquerque are just a few examples of what’s possible when federal R&D is paired with local innovation.

But leading the next generation of technology requires more than talent and R&D. It requires reliable, affordable energy. Across the country, electricity prices are rising not because of AI or data centers, but because America has under-invested in its power grid for decades. Our aging infrastructure is forcing utilities to play catch-up, and our innovation ecosystem is paying the price.

As one of the nation’s leaders in wind and solar potential, New Mexico is better positioned than almost any other state to support the growth of energy-intensive industries like data centers and AI development. With grid modernization already underway, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build an energy backbone that supports innovation while keeping costs affordable for families and businesses.

Across every sector, New Mexico continues moving forward. Whether it’s strengthening our workforce, deepening partnerships with the national labs or modernizing our energy infrastructure, New Mexico has proven that smart, proactive policy leads to measurable economic outcomes.

New Mexico’s story shows what is possible when states take the lead: innovation thrives, jobs grow and communities benefit. As the national conversation continues, our example stands as a reminder that the future of America’s tech leadership won’t be written in Washington, but in states like New Mexico, where collaboration, creativity and long-term thinking are already shaping the next era of economic opportunity.

As Newsweek recently put it, America is “running out of children.” Pelosi’s San Francisco home is the epicenter, with children under age five in the Bay Area plunging by 38 percent since 2005.

The video briefly displays a beaming Pelosi surrounded by children on first becoming Speaker.","Since former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced she will not run for re-election, retrospectives have poured in on everything from her role in passing Obamacare to her skill in stock trades. But tributes have been noticeably missing on one theme Pelosi often stresses: that “we’re here for the children,” as she put it while surrounding herself with children in a 2007 photo-op on first becoming Speaker. There are good reasons why.

In his recent valedictory, Pelosi’s successor Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) could offer only generalities about that legacy: “For the children, as she often says, Speaker Pelosi has lived out the bedrock Jesuit value of working for the greater good.” He did no better in listing her “giant and historic legislative accomplishments,” touting specifically the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), Inflation Reduction Act, and American Rescue Plan Act. Those laws include few enduring policies focused on children.

Passed during Pelosi’s first stint as Speaker, Obamacare expanded taxpayer subsidies in all directions, yet its most prominent “children’s issue” may be a guarantee of coverage for “adult children” under their parents’ policies. The law’s broader legacy includes increasingly expensive workplace coverage. “The average cost of insuring a family of four through the workplace has nearly tripled since 2005,” according to the Milliman Medical Index.

Those growing costs compound the housing affordability crisis plaguing young adults. Large numbers live with their parents well into their 30s, contributing to historic lows in birth rates and a continuing drop in children. As Newsweek recently put it, America is “running out of children.” Pelosi’s San Francisco home is the epicenter, with children under age five in the Bay Area plunging by 38 percent since 2005. According to the 2020 Census, San Francisco has the fewest children of any US city.

Crafted during Pelosi’s second stint as Speaker, the American Rescue Plan Act notably included a massive expansion of the child tax credit, which Democrats hailed as transformative for children. In promoting the expanded benefit, Pelosi boasted “As I always say, the three most important issues facing our Congress are our children, our children, our children.”

But the expansion was temporary, and provided the credit for the first time to nonworking parents, effectively reviving work-free welfare checks eliminated on a bipartisan basis decades ago. Even Democrats balked at extending it, and it expired after just one year. As Sen. Joe Manchin, then a critical swing Democrat, put it in opposing an extension, “There’s no work requirements whatsoever. . . . Don’t you think, if we’re going to help children, that the people should make some effort?”

The subsequent Inflation Reduction Act included no major policies identifiable with children. Instead, it was panned by liberal advocates for rejecting new entitlements to child care proposed by President Joe Biden. “An important group of Americans was lost in the text of the final legislation: young children,” they lamented.

Liberal children’s advocates might find other faults. A federal paid leave program for parents failed to materialize. Food stamp expansions tilted toward childless adults, not children. And while spending is not the same as effectiveness andstates pick up many education, health, and welfare costs for kids, Eugene Steuerle and Urban Institute colleagues note federal spending “on children in 2023 was 9 percent of all federal outlays.” That is “projected to decline to 6 percent over the next decade” as spending on seniors continues to soar. Meanwhile interest on the ballooning national debt is “expected to grow from 11 percent to 17 percent.” One headline summarizes the result: “Congress Has Bankrupted America’s Future.”

That bankruptcy has been decades in the making, and both parties are complicit. But the burden of soaring debt may be Pelosi’s greatest legacy for children, contradicting promises she made on becoming Speaker.

Back then she pledged “Congress will commit itself to a higher standard: Pay as you go; no new deficit spending.” Instead, her eight years as Speaker saw federal debt explode by over $14 trillion. The financial crisis and pandemic contributed, but that’s surely not the “new America” she promised future generations, which would “not burden them with mountains of debt.”

That may explain something missing in Pelosi’s own retirement announcement. In a slick six-minute video, she describes her love of San Francisco, long House service, and billions delivered to favored projects and constituencies. The video briefly displays a beaming Pelosi surrounded by children on first becoming Speaker. But in 800 words reflecting on her legacy, it’s telling that Pelosi doesn’t once mention the group she regularly calls the most important: the children.

This strategy has been driven by lower oil and gas prices, which have limited opportunities for significant profit margins.
As U.S. energy firms navigate these challenges, they must consider how to leverage technological innovations and efficiency improvements to maintain competitiveness.","In recent weeks, U.S. energy firms have made notable adjustments to their oil and natural gas operations, as detailed by the energy services company Baker Hughes. According to their latest report, the number of operational rigs has decreased for the second time in three weeks. This reduction brings the total count to 548, marking the lowest level since late November. These changes are occurring amidst fluctuations in oil and gas prices, prompting companies to reassess their strategies. Despite these shifts, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects an increase in crude and gas output for the coming year, indicating potential growth in production.

Fluctuating Rig Counts and Market Impacts

The reduction in the U.S. oil and natural gas rig count is a key indicator of future production levels. Baker Hughes reports that the total rig count has decreased by 6.9% compared to the same period last year. This brings the current number to 548, reflecting a broader trend of declining rig counts over the past two years. In 2024, the count dropped by about 5%, and in 2023, it saw a more substantial decrease of 20%. These decreases have been largely influenced by falling oil and gas prices, which have led firms to prioritize financial stability over expanding production.

Despite the recent downturn in rig numbers, Baker Hughes noted a slight increase in oil rigs, which rose by one to 414, the highest since November 21. Conversely, gas rigs fell by two, bringing the total to 127. Such fluctuations highlight the volatile nature of the energy market as firms navigate changing economic landscapes and consumer demands.

Price Trends and Production Projections

Analysts predict that U.S. spot crude prices will continue to decline for a third consecutive year in 2025. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a rise in crude output. Production is expected to increase from a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to approximately 13.6 million barrels per day in 2025. This anticipated increase suggests that while prices may remain low, production efficiency and technological advancements could drive higher output levels.

On the natural gas front, the EIA projects a significant 63% increase in spot gas prices for 2025. This rise follows a 14% price drop in 2024, which led many energy firms to cut output. The downturn in 2024 was the first since the COVID-19 pandemic impacted demand in 2020. With higher prices, producers are likely to ramp up drilling activities, potentially leading to an increase in gas production to 107.7 billion cubic feet per day, up from 103.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.

Economic Considerations for Energy Firms

Energy companies are facing a complex economic environment as they balance production demands with financial health. The priority for many firms has shifted toward enhancing shareholder returns and reducing debt. This strategy has been driven by lower oil and gas prices, which have limited opportunities for significant profit margins. By focusing on financial stability, companies aim to secure their long-term viability in a competitive market.

Meanwhile, the anticipated rise in gas prices could offer a reprieve for producers. A higher price point might enable these firms to increase their drilling activities and production without compromising their financial strategies. However, the success of such endeavors will depend on the ability of energy firms to adapt to ongoing market changes and manage operational costs effectively.

Future Outlook and Industry Adaptation

The energy sector is at a crossroads as it contends with evolving market dynamics and environmental considerations. While projections indicate potential growth in production, firms must remain agile in response to fluctuating prices and regulatory shifts. The industry is also under increasing pressure to incorporate sustainable practices, which could redefine production methods and energy outputs.

As U.S. energy firms navigate these challenges, they must consider how to leverage technological innovations and efficiency improvements to maintain competitiveness. The balance between increasing output and sustaining financial health will be crucial in shaping the future of the industry. How will energy companies adapt to ensure resilience in the face of ongoing economic and environmental shifts?

Being polite has gotten us nowhere.” Blackburn copied The Denver Gazette a memo she sent to Gov.","Colorado residents could be paying a lot more for home energy, following the state’s decision last week to turn away from natural gas as a home cooking and heating fuel, experts said.

Some 1.9 million Colorado households warm their homes each winter using gas. That’s also how how tens of thousands of businesses heat their buildings. But that could change significantly in the near term under an order handed down by the state’s 3-person Public Utilities Commission.

Policy experts and advocates were all ears on Dec. 1, when energy regulators ordered Xcel Energy – the state’s biggest utility company – and other non-municipal utilities to slash their carbon output by 41% by 2035 as a step toward a 100% carbon-free future fired by solar and wind.

The only way to reduce carbon that much is by switching out the gas-fired furnaces, stoves and appliances of as many as 600,000 customers and changing them to electric heating. That’s according to the Colorado Energy Office, which was among two state agencies that cautioned the utility commission against its ultimate decision.

‘EXCESSIVE COLLATERAL DAMAGE‘

Some environmental activists embraced the commission’s decision, while it spawned shock and surprise among many other advocates, some of whom were confused by the order.

“This will cause excessive collateral damage for those least able to afford it,” said Sara Blackhurst, president and CEO of Action Colorado, a nonprofit community advocacy group based in southern Colorado.

​“Meeting the approved goal will be … challenging and difficult to achieve,” Michelle Aguayo, a spokeswoman for Xcel Energy, told The Denver Gazette in a written response. She added it “will increase customer costs.”

Although state legislation passed in 2021 had required any cost of carbon cutting to be capped at 2.5% of customers’ annual gas bills, sources suggested the actual costs of a conversion might easily exceed $12 billion – or higher.

News of the order happened just as Xcel warned customers of an impending major rate hike. This week, Xcel notified that it had submitted a proposal to the PUC for a 9.93% increase to take effect next summer. Small businesses would see a 9.48% rise.

Missing almost entirely from the Public Utility Commission’s order was any mention of rates or rate increases.

In the Dec. 1 order, 28 pages in length, there were three uses of the word “rate” or “rates” apart from references to “ratepayers” — utility parlance for customers.

Some advocates said the impact of such a transition would be shouldered entirely by customers.

“Who pays for those solutions are ratepayers,” a senior executive at a large utility told The Denver Gazette, who asked to remain anonymous to freely discuss the subject.

The Denver Gazette spoke with a dozen utility experts, company spokespeople, consultants, and consumer advocates, practically all of whom offered a negative assessment of the order, on whether the reduction could be carried out in 10 years and how it could be apportioned and financed.

Virtually all said they are hesitant to go on record in criticizing an order that began in the Colorado legislature and was handed down by the commission that directly oversees their industry’s operations.

‘IT’S PAID BY THE CUSTOMER’

“The biggest misdirection is in saying it is not directed at customers,” the senior executive said. “Electric costs are going up to pay for those transitions. It’s a simple understanding of how utility programs work, whether by a non-jurisdictional utility or an investor-owned or municipally-owned utility. It’s paid for by the customer.”

Those costs could be astronomical, according to experts.

The 600,000 customer figure, cited in testimony by the Colorado Energy Office in tandem with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, works out to be around a third of the state’s households using gas as their primary heating and cooking source.

Discussion of the climate goals in the order are specific to metric tons of carbon reduction, but the language gets vague as to whether customers would be required to switch out specific appliances or whether they would be entirely converted, starting with their gas furnaces.

If a conversion cost in the $20,000 range, the tab would be $12 billion.

However, that may not figure in the systemic costs of altering the gas distribution system and of gearing up electric production, transmission, and supply to meet any jump in demand, experts said.

Meanwhile, experts are frank in admitting there is little evidence that customers are anxious to have their gas ranges converted to electric or their heaters switched out for ground-source electric heat pumps.

“What if the consumer says, ‘I’m good with what I have?’” the senior utility executive asked.

The order also brings into question what responsibilities utilities have to their customers – for whom they are supplying a popular commodity, the executive added.

A source familiar with the commission’s internal workings who declined to be named questioned the origins of the 41% reduction figure, suggesting it seems arbitrary and in conflict with the enabling legislation.

This source noted that the major affected utilities had each submitted pleadings, and all had effectively countered that the approach isn’t realistic in a 10-year timeframe.

UTILITIES SOUGHT LOWER TARGETS

In pleadings leading up to last week’s decision, Dallas-based Atmos Energy, which supplies gas to some 129,000 Colorado customers, asked that the target be held at 22%, which was specified for 2030 in the original Senate bill requiring utilities to create “clean heat plans.”

Atmos told the commission it has an “overarching duty to ensure just and reasonable rates for customers,” adding higher target levels failed to acknowledge that customers continue to demand natural gas as a fuel. Even meeting the lower target by 2030, the company said, would require average annual costs of $55 million.

When asked about the decision, Atmos would only tell The Denver Gazette that its 2024 clean heat plan focused primarily on incentives to help customers improve the efficiency of their existing appliances, and that the company is working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while also prioritizing safety, “energy choice,” affordability, and reliability.

Atmos serves customers in areas including Greeley, Steamboat, Craig, Salida, Gunnison, Canon City, Lamar, and Durango.

In like manner, Black Hills Energy, which serves some 200,000 gas customers in southern Colorado, pleaded that recent targets are not achievable without “incredible investments.” Black Hills added that baseline data used by the commission in setting the new requirements are no longer accurate due to significant growth.

Following a query about the decision, a Black Hills representative would say only that the new reductions are significantly greater than what the legislature originally required, and that the company would balance state policy requirements with customer affordability.

“Recent survey results show that 90% of our natural gas customers value the ability to choose their energy source, and we will continue to advocate for their interests, “ Black Hills added in a written statement to The Denver Gazette.

Xcel Energy’s Aguayo told The Denver Gazette that her company, with 1.5 million gas customers in the state, is charting a similar course.

“With the support of state agencies, we brought forward a reasonable proposal to balance emissions reductions and affordability,” she said in her written reply.

‘MORE AGGRESSIVE GOALS’

“As our current plan shows, the overwhelming majority of participating customers are choosing natural gas as their backup fuel source, and the shift to these more aggressive goals is not in line with customer expectations, thereby creating achievability and feasibility concerns for the future,” she added.

Using natural gas power plants to replace older coal-fired plants has been widely credited for a major decline in carbon emissions across the U.S. over the past decade. Gas emits around half the carbon dioxide per unit of energy, compared to coal as a fuel. ​

Some environmental advocates have long sought to eliminate fossil-fired energy, including natural gas, as the source to power homes and industries. They have argued that newer technologies – notably wind and solar, backed by batteries – have become cheaper over time, and Colorado should fully embrace them quickly as they are better for the environment and human health.

Critics of that transition have countered that it is happening too quickly – and that low-income residents will ultimately bear the cost of that rapid change in jobs lost and higher energy bills.

Multiple sources suggested that gas household customers and apartment renters have little or no awareness of the major changes that could soon be headed their way – or of the possible rate impacts.

Sources also pointed out that the state’s own agencies had advised the commission to accept a lower target.

The Colorado Energy Office and the Department of Public Health and Environment originally proposed a reduction of 41% across the three gas utilities by 2035. But the agencies later changed their target, suggesting 31%.

Achieving the higher target, they testified, is questionable “in a setting where the uptake rate is low” and where 600,000 customers would have to fully electrify – requiring a switch to electric water heating, cooking, and clothes drying, in addition to space heating.

Most electrification to date had been “partial electrification,” the agencies told the commission, where customers switch over some appliances while leaving others.

“If the trend of partial instead of full electrification continues, the required number of customers adopting electrification to reach the 41% target would likely be much higher than 600,000,” the agencies added.

They recommended more study to determine whether even a 31% reduction would appear ambitious.

The Denver Gazette spoke with Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, about the change in direction and whether he was surprised the commission had adopted the steeper carbon reduction goal than the agencies recommended.

“We certainly respect the decision the PUC made,” Toor said.

He added that the picture would become clearer as cost trends are revealed and as more is learned about whether new measures to recover lost methane can help meet the reductions.

‘CRACY REAL QUICK’

“Utility costs are at the top of mind on both the electric and gas sides,” Toor added. “If it brings on a lot of demand and they need to be building new transmission lines, it can certainly affect rates. But a lot of upgrades are needed to distribution systems just because they are old.”

The Denver Gazette asked whether wind and solar, growing as a share of the grid’s capacity in Colorado, could actually be relied on to pick up demand in a major switch from gas.

Toor replied that a switch to greater electric might rebalance the annual demand of electric customers away from summer, when cooling demand peaks. But the supply side, he added, wouldn’t solely focus on wind and solar – but also on technologies like gas with carbon capture, geothermal, and small modular nuclear reactors.

However, the senior utility executive who spoke anonymously is less sanguine about a turnover.

“It gets crazy really quick. Every customer participates in those costs,” the executive said, musing over how a utility would pick which customers need to move over to electric.

The executive questioned whether broader costs of those utilities covered by the PUC action are being taken into account, including retrofitting their existing services where their territories for gas don’t necessarily align with service for electric.

“The system is sized to meet the load,” the executive added. “To retro existing service will be very expensive, and that’s been completely overlooked.”

That executive suggested that market considerations — the willingness of customers to cooperate and the workforce availability to carry out conversions — have not been well evaluated.

“If it’s desirable to drive customers to an all-electric economy, the best way to incentivize that is to make it as affordable as possible, but Colorado has done exactly the opposite of that,” the executive said.

“It’s a vanity that we can attack everything all at once and assume it will be free.”

Meanwhile, the cost implications arrive at a moment when Colorado’s job market could be headed for decline after a decade of growth. Latest jobs data shows the state continuing to show better than average employment.

However, unemployment is running above average in some areas, warned Brian Lewandowski, who heads the University of Colorado’s Business Research Division.

With the potential for serious rate increases a possibility, The Denver Gazette reached out to all three announced gubernatorial candidates to weigh in on the PUC’s action.

Attorney General Phil Weiser’s spokesman replied he would be unable to comment at this time. Following the PUC order, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet’s campaign distributed what it calls a “cap-and-invest” plan to “Address Climate Change and Cut Energy Costs.” However, the campaign did not follow up on a conversation requesting a specific comment on the order.

‘A ONE-TWO HIT’

Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, R-Weld County, one of the Republicans running for governor, told The Denver Gazette that the PUC order is worrisome.

“A mandate to transition away from reliable, affordable, clean natural gas to unreliable and more costly wind and solar energy just doesn’t make sense,” she said in a written reply.

“The reality is pretty simple: people are going to pay more and have fewer options when it comes to heating their homes and keeping the lights on. When the PUC isn’t honest about the costs, it’s everyday Coloradans who end up feeling it the most,” she said.

Sara Blackhurst with Action Colorado noted that her organization serves counties around Pueblo, whose residents are already worried about potential job loss as its Comanche coal-fired power plant faces a scheduled closure.

The plant’s older Unit 2 generator, which had been scheduled to close this year, is being kept online after the newer, more efficient Unit 3 showed reliability issues, jeopardizing the stability of the grid.

Blackhurst said that, among the consequences of the order, is to “take effective replacements for Comanche off the table.”

“They went rogue. What they’re doing to my hometown is a one-two hit,” Blackhurst said about the PUC decision. “We’ve gone past go-along to get-along. Being polite has gotten us nowhere.”

Blackburn copied The Denver Gazette a memo she sent to Gov. Jared Polis following the PUC’s order, questioning how home heating reliability would be maintained, how the load growth would be covered, and how low-income and rural households would be protected.

She also criticized the public messaging around electrification that she says depicts electric heat pumps as a cheaper alternative to gas heat.

“The real-world data — including from climate-conscious Colorado homeowners who already use heat pumps — shows a different picture,” she said.

“If heat pumps were truly cheaper in Colorado winters, we wouldn’t have to mandate them. People would choose them voluntarily,” Blackburn wrote.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fe69352d3b53fa58932010138ea09a3b-1024x706.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 12:00:11.774578

India’s electric vehicle (EV) industry is on track for a dramatic transformation as demand for EV batteries is expected to grow more than fourteen-fold by 2032, according to a new industry report. The 2025 EV Battery Technology Review Report by Customized Energy Solutions (CES) projects that annual battery demand in India will soar from around 17.7 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2025 to an astonishing 256.3 GWh in 2032 — a growth rate that reflects the rapid adoption of electric mobility across the nation. This expansion underscores not only the increasing number of EVs hitting Indian roads but also the mounting government support, emerging battery technologies, and aggressive model launches that are reshaping the country’s automotive landscape.

The CES report highlights that this growth trajectory is being fuelled by a combination of rising fuel prices, stronger consumer demand for cleaner and cost-efficient transport options, and supportive policy frameworks aimed at accelerating electrification. A compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 35 per cent is expected over the next seven years, painting a picture of one of the fastest expansions in India’s clean-energy sector. As battery demand climbs, manufacturers and investors are gearing up to scale production, diversify technology portfolios, and attract new capacity investments to meet this surge.

One of the key drivers of this transformation is innovation in battery chemistry and technology. Technologies such as next-generation LFP (lithium iron phosphate) Gen 4, advanced NCM (nickel-cobalt-manganese) cells, and emerging alternatives like sodium-ion batteries are poised to make EV batteries safer, more affordable, and capable of delivering better performance and longer driving ranges — all critical factors in driving wider adoption of electric vehicles in India’s diverse market. This technological evolution is expected to benefit everything from two-wheelers and three-wheelers to passenger cars and commercial EVs, making electrification more accessible across vehicle segments.

In addition to technological advances, India’s energy and automotive policy environment is playing a significant role. Government incentives, regulatory norms aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and targeted support for EV and battery manufacturing are helping to build a robust ecosystem that encourages both domestic production and foreign investments. Local battery makers are now exploring major capacity expansions while global firms look toward India as a promising hub for EV battery production and innovation.

Analysts say the anticipated increase in battery demand will have wide-ranging impacts. It is expected to spur job creation in manufacturing and related services, reduce reliance on imported energy and battery components over time, and strengthen India’s positioning in the global EV supply chain. However, meeting this demand will require sustained investment in infrastructure — including battery gigafactories, charging networks, and raw material supply chains — alongside continued research in battery recycling and sustainability practices.

For consumers, this growth may translate into a broader range of EV models, improved affordability, and better performance, making electric vehicles a more attractive choice for daily commuting and long-distance travel.

Thirty-six buildings, including single- and multifamily homes, the local housing authority and municipal buildings are being heated and cooled in this pilot program, which could serve as a model for the country.

Geothermal networks can extract heat stored in the Earth to warm buildings in the winter, as well as cool them by pumping heat from buildings back into the ground during the summer. This technology taps local energy that’s always available, shielding customers from fluctuating fossil fuel prices and availability issues.

Boston-based HEET.org was instrumental in driving the Framingham project. The organization aims to evolve our energy system to an affordable, clean energy model. In assessing areas for greatest climate impact, HEET elected to target building stock, which accounts for roughly 30% of all carbon dioxide emissions, explained Angie Alberto Escobar, HEET’s gas-to-geo transition director, during a recent webinar hosted by MetroWest Climate Solutions. (A link to a recording of the session is on the MCS website.)

To decarbonize buildings, HEET explored how we could most effectively achieve building electrification, the dominant strategy for reducing the sector’s carbon footprint. HEET also researched the effect of increasing demand for electricity on the electric grid and electric peaks — key energy cost drivers.

To address these issues, HEET proposed in 2017 that gas utilities, which have millions of miles of aging pipes laid under streets, replace those pipes with water-filled geothermal pipes. The pipes could transfer their energy to ground-source heat pumps, which can both heat and cool homes. Ground-source heat pumps are roughly twice as efficient as the popular air-source heat pumps, which incidentally have been outselling gas furnaces since 2022. An Oak Ridge National Laboratory study on geothermal heat pumps (Feb. 14, 2024) showed it would cost 30% less to decarbonize the grid through individual ground-source heat pumps than it would using air-source heat pumps.

Escobar explained that the team asked: “What if we took advantage of the right-of-way that the gas system currently has, used the utilities’ expertise of laying pipe in the street, and simply changed the energy transfer medium from gas to water?”

This type of geothermal network is similar to the gas system, in that it has a distribution pipe that runs down the street’s right-of-way, with service lines to each building. Instead of a gas furnace, a heat pump in each home or building is supplied with water by this distribution loop. This closed-loop system avoids the risk of dangerous leaks because the energy transfer medium is water, with a very small amount of antifreeze.

HEET collaborated with Eversource, which started work on the Framingham project in 2024. After a year of construction, the pilot is up and running. By January, HEET expects to have data on the project’s payback period and cost-effectiveness.

A key benefit of this approach is that it gives utilities a path to migrate their aging gas systems to a carbon-free energy source. Massachusetts has one of the oldest gas systems in the country, with about 17% of its underground pipes considered leak-prone as of 2024. These pipes leak methane — a greenhouse gas that has 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.

Fixing these leaks is costing ratepayers about $500 million per year, according to HEET. Repair costs are expected to exceed $40 billion, which would make updating the gas infrastructure one of the most expensive projects ever undertaken by the state (by contrast, the Big Dig cost about $14.8 billion). Given these phenomenal costs, along with the state’s legislative mandate to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, it makes sense to explore alternatives, Escobar notes.

These types of projects would also allow the existing gas workforce to transition their skills. These workers, who did the majority of the work on the Framingham project, have invaluable expertise in laying and repairing pipes.

HEET is supporting another local project at the Franklin Field Apartments (129 units) in Dorchester. It will be the first networked geothermal pilot project in Boston. The project is being led by National Grid, in partnership with the Boston Housing Authority.

In addition, Escobar reports increased utility interest throughout the nation. A utility network group meets quarterly to actively explore this technology.

“This technology offers a hyper-local energy source,” she said. “We are harvesting what is already around us; it is not subject to supply disruptions or pricing variability of fuels being shipped from far away. By using the energy already around us and leveraging the systems that serve us today, we can protect future ratepayers and build the equitable, carbon-free future we all want, at the speed the climate needs.”

Zambia seeks to ease its 90% reliance on hydropower through private-sector projects

The Tanzanian conglomerate Amsons Group signed a partnership agreement on Tuesday, December 9, with Exergy Africa, an energy-focused investment firm active in East and Southern Africa, to develop 1,300 megawatts (MW) of solar and coal-based power capacity in Zambia.

The total investment for the planned projects is estimated at about $900 million, according to the agreement signed in Lusaka.

The projects aim to improve grid reliability for key industrial sectors and enable new investment in manufacturing and mining.

Solar capacity of 500 MW is expected to be added to the national grid within 18 months, and the full 1,300 MW should be completed within 24 months. In detail, 1,000 MW will come from solar plants and 300 MW from a coal facility.

Amsons Group CEO Edha Nahdi said Zambia is a strategic and fast-growing market for the group, noting that the conglomerate will bring logistical strength and clean-energy investment to support Zambia’s industrialization and energy stability.

“This partnership represents a major commitment to Zambia’s power sector and industrial future. By partnering with a group that already operates at scale across multiple African markets, we have paced ourselves to move faster, reduce project risk, and deliver reliable power where it is needed most,” said Exergy Africa Limited director Monica Musonda.

Reducing hydropower’s dominance in the energy mix

Zambia’s Minister of Energy, Makozo Chikote, who attended the signing ceremony, said the projects announced by Amsons Group and Exergy Africa support the government’s energy-sector development strategy, which calls for a stronger role for private investors.

In recent months, the Zambian government has multiplied announcements of new solar-plant projects developed with local and foreign private partners to reduce its dependence on hydropower, which accounts for 90% of the country’s electricity mix, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). This heavy reliance exposes the grid to climate-related risks, including droughts that lower reservoir levels and trigger production deficits.

Amsons Group is a diversified energy and industrial conglomerate operating in Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique, the DRC, and Zambia. Its activities include fuel distribution, cement manufacturing, milling, logistics, packaging, real estate, and electronics assembly.

The latest round of FAST NY grants will fund infrastructure upgrades in Albany, Erie, Fulton, Herkimer, and Orange counties, aiming to make large sites ready for employers looking to build quickly.

What FAST NY does

FAST NY, short for Focused Attraction of Shovel-Ready Tracts New York, helps communities upgrade land so companies can move in without long delays. The program supports roads, water and sewer systems, power, and other infrastructure critical for advanced manufacturing.

Since the program launched, New York has awarded more than $326 million to 39 sites across upstate. The state also added another $100 million to FAST NY in the current budget year.

Where the money is going

The largest award, $25.48 million, will go to the Village of Maybrook in Orange County. The funding will help redevelop the long-vacant Maybrook Rail Yard into the Switchyard Terminal for Economic and Advanced Manufacturing, creating six rail-accessible building sites about 75 miles from New York City.

Fulton County will receive $8.99 million to revitalize Tryon Technology Park, a former state juvenile correctional facility in Perth. The upgrades will prepare a 220-acre site for multiple large manufacturing buildings, with a focus on agribusiness, food processing, and life sciences.

In Herkimer County, $7.9 million will support infrastructure upgrades at the Central New York Business Center in Frankfort. The project includes gas main upgrades, fire protection water storage, road improvements, and utility extensions to attract advanced manufacturers.

Albany County and Erie County will each receive $500,000 for pre-development work. In Albany County, the funding advances planning for the Al Tech Advanced Manufacturing Campus in Colonie. In Erie County, the money supports engineering and permitting for sewer and wastewater upgrades in the Town of Elma.

A statewide economic push

State officials say the grants aim to bring good-paying jobs back to regions that lost manufacturing decades ago. FAST NY sites target industries like semiconductors, clean energy, life sciences, agribusiness, and advanced manufacturing.

Companies already attracted through FAST NY-backed sites include fairlife, Chobani, Siemens Mobility, and Edwards Vacuum. Those projects are expected to bring more than $2.2 billion in private investment and nearly 3,000 jobs statewide.

Local leaders in the funded counties say the projects will help turn long-idle or underused land into engines for regional growth, while giving New York a competitive edge in attracting large employers.

The Kentucky Resources Council, Earthjustice, the Mountain Association, and the Metropolitan Housing Council commissioned the 65-page report.

Kentucky electricity customers could save $2.6 billion by 2050 by moving away from fossil fuels and toward more renewables and battery storage, according to the report.

It says that two laws enacted by the General Assembly make it harder to wean Kentucky off the fossil fuels that are becoming more expensive.

Ashley Wilmes is the executive director of the Kentucky Resources Council. She says that threatens to make electricity unaffordable for many residents.

“When people are choosing between their grocery bills and keeping the lights on, and when employers face rising electricity bills, our economy suffers,” she said. “Kentucky's economic future is directly tied to whether families and businesses can afford their electricity bills.”

Four major Kentucky utilities are seeking rate increases. They rely heavily on coal.

Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities are seeking approval for increases of $9 and $5 per month, respectively, for the typical customer.

East Kentucky Power Cooperative’s plan would raise the average bill by about $5 a month.

Kentucky Power’s proposed rate increase – $27 a month – is the highest in the region.

Wilmes says those plans won’t make Kentucky a more attractive place to live or do business.

“Continuing to rely on these aging, costly coal plants and then adding new gas on top of them is the most expensive and the most risky path we can take,” she said. “It drives up our rates, and it undermines the very economic development that we are all working to attract.”

The report says Kentucky could achieve a 95% clean electricity portfolio by 2050 and still save customers $1.6 billion.

Either way, the report says, the state should move away from building new gas plants, as all four utilities plan to do over the next several years, and continue investing in old coal plants.

The report says Senate Bills 4 and 349 increase future risks to electricity customers by effectively requiring replacement capacity to come from fossil fuels.

Kentucky generated 67% of its electricity from coal in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, more than any state but West Virginia.

Nationwide, coal fell to 15% of electricity generation in 2024, down from nearly half two decades ago. Wind and solar surpassed coal for the first time last year.

Coal production and jobs in Kentucky have fallen precipitously in the past few decades. The industry employed fewer than 4,000 workers in the June-to-September quarter, according to the Energy and Environment Cabinet’s coal dashboard.

Annual coal production is down to what Kentucky used to produce every three months.

Would this have happened without the Paris agreement?

Roughly 90% of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the Paris agreement has come from China.","Ten years on from the historic Paris climate summit, which ended with the world’s first and only global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions, it is easy to dwell on its failures. But the successes go less remarked.

Renewable energy smashed records last year, growing by 15% and accounting for more than 90% of all new power generation capacity. Investment in clean energy topped $2tn, outstripping that into fossil fuels by two to one.

Electric vehicles now account for about a fifth of new cars sold around the world. Low-carbon power makes up more than half of the generation capacity of China and India, with China’s emissions now flattening, and most developed countries on a downward trend.

For Laurence Tubiana, a former French diplomat who was one of the main architects of the Paris accord and is now chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, this is a remarkable achievement. “The Paris agreement has set in motion a shift towards clean energy that no country can now ignore,” she said.

Would this have happened without the Paris agreement? Unlikely, according to Bill Hare, chief executive of the Climate Analytics thinktank. He said: “The 1.5C limit [for rising global temperatures] and the net zero goal have reshaped policy, finance, litigation and sectoral rules, helping to rewire how states, markets and institutions work.”

Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, said look where temperatures were headed before Paris, if you want to judge the summit’s impact. The planet was on track for more than 4C of heating, a catastrophic increase.

After Paris, that came down to 3C. Then, after Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, which reaffirmed the 1.5C pledge, carbon-cutting commitments brought the projected temperature rise to about 2.8C. Today, the forecast stands at about 2.5C, if all existing promises are fulfilled.

“We’ve made progress as a world, but we also know that is far short of what we agreed at Paris,” said Miliband. “You’re trying to get 193 countries to agree to these big fundamental questions about the trajectory of their economies, their societies, the way their energy systems work. No wonder it’s difficult.”

Yet the shaky response to the Paris agreement from some key countries in its immediate aftermath has added significantly to the climate crisis we now face, and the failure of rich governments in more recent years to uphold their side of the bargain with the poorer world threatens to implode the global consensus.

The question now is: can countries learn from the mistakes of the past decade, in order to keep the Paris agreement alive in the next?

The history of the last 10 years in climate politics is one of glaring contradictions, forward leaps followed by backsliding, and cooperation attended by fracture. The first blow to the fledgling Paris agreement came within just a year, with the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016. He vowed to withdraw from the pact, and began the process in 2017.

This year, that pattern looked set to repeat: in January, on re-entry to the White House, Trump began the withdrawal process again, while kicking off damaging global trade turmoil through the imposition of swingeing tariffs.

Though Trump’s first withdrawal did not create the “snowball” effect some had feared – no other functioning country has left since – he may also bear partial responsibility for another blow: after 2016, China vastly speeded up its rate of carbon dioxide output.

When Xi Jinping travelled to Paris in November 2015, and for a short time after, emissions from the world’s second biggest economy looked to be peaking at just under 10bn tonnes per year.

But in 2017, that dream was dashed. Coal-fired power took off again, and China’s carbon output resumed its upward march, at an accelerated pace, reaching 12.3bn tonnes last year.

Beijing economic thinking is opaque and there are still differing conclusions about what caused the spike. Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, believes the government was seeking to shore up economic growth by traditional means: “It was the real estate market, it was buildings, steel, cement. It’s different now,” he said.

But Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser, warns of the damage China’s actions did to arguments for climate action in the US: “In the immediate aftermath of Paris, China began the biggest building spree of coal-fired power plants in history. They went on a coal binge, and the rest of us just had to hope it would subside. It made everyone cynical.”

Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, discerns the hand of Trump in the rise in emissions from 2017. He argued it was “partially a reversal of [China’s] overall economic policy, then it was a response to Trump’s tariffs, then redoubling on using real estate as a growth driver”.

Roughly 90% of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions since the Paris agreement has come from China. And yet those emissions tell only half the story. Last year, China added more renewable energy than the rest of the world combined, and clean energy made up 10% of the country’s GDP, with similar figures likely this year. China’s manufacturing strength has sent the price of solar panels plunging by about 90% in the last decade.

It is true that China may yet return to coal, but Wang Yi, a senior adviser to the Chinese government, said at Cop30 last month that Xi Jinping was committed to clean energy for the long term. “The central government, including President Xi, is very clear to us that we must, in the next five years, speed up the new power system,” Wang said.

If the world should manage to cling to the 1.5C limit – which is still possible, according to Hare, if the current overshoot is swiftly remedied, then China will deserve a large slice of the credit.

And where China leads, India has followed. The country’s carbon emissions outstrip Europe’s, and it could overtake the US in a decade to become the world’s second biggest emitter after China.

But half of India’s installed power generation capacity is now low-carbon, and the country met its target on renewable energy five years ahead of time. Wind and particularly solar are set to grow even faster this year, but coal production has also surged.

Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water thinktank, said the country is headed for a clean future: “India is now planning for a grid that can absorb much larger volumes of renewable energy. This is transformative. All the building blocks are there.”

The Paris agreement, in which countries agreed to limit global temperature rises to “well below 2C” above preindustrial levels while “pursuing efforts” to stay within 1.5C, was possible only because of the determined efforts of a global alliance in which some of the poorest and most vulnerable countries made common cause with some of the richest and most polluting.

The High Ambition Coalition, spearheaded by the charismatic Marshall Islands diplomat Tony de Brum, brought more than 100 countries together and drove the final months of work.

But many observers are worried about a fracture between developed and developing countries that has appeared to widen at recent Cop summits. Poorer countries were shocked by the global north’s tardiness in sharing vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, but they supported moves at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 to reinforce the 1.5C goal.

They hoped the rich countries would reciprocate the next year with help for the loss and damage fund – money that goes to the rescue and rehabilitation of communities stricken by climate disaster – but only achieved that with a struggle.

Then, last year, at Cop29 in Azerbaijan, rich nations provoked fury from the global south when they refused until the final hours to put numbers on their contribution to the $1.3tn a year promised in climate finance by 2035, and tried to feint at first with a lower sum than the $300bn finally agreed.

Evans Njewa, chair of the UN’s Least Developed Countries grouping, reminds rich countries that providing financial assistance is an obligation, rather than an option. “We expect that these commitments will set into real, sustained financial flows,” he said.

“Climate finance to us is not charity. It is a legal obligation, so it must be mobilised and be provided to us. It is the only means of a global response to this global crisis.”

At the most recent climate summit, poorer countries did achieve the tripling of finance for adaptation, to $120bn a year, though it will not be fully realised until 2035, rather than the 2030 deadline they preferred.

That could go some way to rebuilding trust, but one participant in the talks told the Guardian that poor and vulnerable countries “do not want to be taken for granted”, and would need further evidence of rich countries’ solidarity.

If Paris is to survive, the rich countries will need to do more to fulfil their promises and heal the rift. They will also need to lead on the roadmaps to phase out oil and gas stemming from a voluntary agreement made at Cop30.

That is likely to mean working with petro states – such as the United Arab Emirates, under whose Cop28 presidency in 2023 the promise to “transition away from fossil fuels” was originally made – rather than shunning them.

Meanwhile, the biggest developing economies must show that renewable energy can substitute for fossil fuels, rather than being additional to them, and can bring down carbon rapidly, rather than simply subduing its rate of increase.

All of these efforts will face outright hostility and possibly attempted sabotage by the US.

Though Trump sent no delegation to Cop30, his officials played an extraordinary role at the International Maritime Organisation negotiations on a potential carbon levy in October. Developing country delegates were plagued with intimidatory emails and phone calls from the US state department, threatening visa revocations and economic sanctions. Countries are now braced for what US tactics may come next.

For Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Marshall Islands, today’s changed geopolitics presents the biggest threat to the Paris consensus. “Climate change negotiations do not take place in a vacuum. They reflect the increasingly multipolar world we live in,” she said.

“Unlike some other multilateral processes, though, we continue to make progress against all odds. That this progress is incremental and not in line with needs on the ground is obviously extremely frustrating. [But] we are prepared to continue to work with all partners to secure a viable future for our people.”

For large as well as small countries, she adds, multilateral cooperation on the climate is the best hope, as “We do not have the option to go it alone.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eac5d782849c5423f24be7ca6faf74af4e577f1/312_0_2876_2301/master/2876.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d88345f06d7dcd4a651bf4bd4f1c40ec",N,,2025-12-13 12:59:59.595261

By 2026, five million solar panels will span fields in Nueva Ecija and Bulacan and reshape the entire clean energy sphere.

A significant leap by the “sleeping giant” in Asia

This MTerra development has been labelled as perhaps the largest integrated solar-and-storage installation in the world. This solar and storage project has received backing from Meralco PowerGen and SPNEC and enjoys a $600 million investment from the global infrastructure leader, Actis.

As per the project’s vision, 3,500 MW of installed solar capacity will be supported by 4,500 MWh of battery storage. Although the figures are rather ambitious, the construction has shown rather impressive results already. With 778 MW of operational solar panels already in this Asian country, we are only given a glimpse of what can be expected next.

The project expands beyond clean power generation. Since this Asian country charges some of the highest electricity prices in Asia, a successful project would mean cleaner energy for all and energy that is more affordable. Furthermore, the transition to cleaner power would mean far less reliance on fossil fuels throughout the country.

2026, a rather significant turning point for the MTerra development

The Energy Regulatory Commission recently approved the ₱14.25-billion transmission network, and thus far, high voltage lines are 80% complete. The good news is that in 2026, the project’s core phase will go online. The initial phase is meant to put hundreds of megawatts into the Luzon grid. This project’s full output is scheduled for 2031 and 2040, causing this Asian country to benefit from the project much earlier than expected.

Once activated, the 2026 phase will be responsible for adding daytime generation and will also work towards stabilizing the grid at times of peak demand. For this country, this is a major leap forward, as it is a country known for its brownouts.

Which Asian country is making economic and environmental leaps?

The solar farm will provide power to over 2.4 million households in the Philippines. For many citizens, this will considerably reduce the financial burden of high electricity prices on many Filipino families. The solar output will severely undercut the fossil fuel generation.

With full operation underway, more than four million tons of CO₂ are emitted annually. The reduction in CO₂ emissions would mean that emissions from three million cars would be reduced. The economic benefit is that MTerra has already created more than 9,500 jobs and has created numerous training programs like the TERRAnsform. In the next 10 years, more than ₱23 billion for local economies will be generated.

Rather significant leaps can be found occurring in China as well, with China aligning 6,000,000 solar panels, resulting in megafarms that stretch offshore. While China’s major solar advancements are rather noteworthy, the clean energy development in the Philippines is rather inspirational as well.

The Sleeping Asian giant has woken up

Looking forward to the MTerra 2026 major milestone and the second phase in 2027, this country has shown that it can overcome infrastructural challenges to execute renewable projects on a global scale. With five million panels being aligned, this signifies a major technical achievement. The Philippines is a country proving that sustainable power can come from almost any Asian country.

New York is also looking at solar farm projects, but its record may have been shattered. 370,000 panels are still shining, but it may no longer be the biggest installation. With New York also considering the solar agenda, it can yet be seen whether the Philippines can live up to other ambitious solar projects, too.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/usgs-vdnimoGxyR8-unsplash-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 11:01:28.405789

The U.S. Senate held a couple of votes on Thursday but did not renew them. So it may be that on January 1, the program will return to the original Obamacare subsidies.

Democrats are portraying the imminent return of original Obamacare as a Republican effort to destroy healthcare. They have finally admitted that the Affordable Care Act is a dismal failure.

The original program that’s about to return used tax dollars to subsidize health insurance policies for people who earned up to 400% of the federal poverty level, capping their premiums at between 2% and 9.96% of their income. But the money wasn’t sent to the policyholder. It was sent straight to the insurance companies after the Internal Revenue Service administered a complicated system of “advance premium tax credits” based on an income projection. Later, the taxpayer would have to settle up with the IRS based on actual income, either receiving a higher subsidy or paying some of it back.

Soon after President Joe Biden took office he signed the American Rescue Plan, which temporarily increased the Obamacare premium subsidies and removed the income cap of 400% of the federal poverty level. Then in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act extended these enhanced subsidies to the end of this year.

Democrats have been frantically trying to coerce Republicans into extending the expiring subsidies, even insisting, unsuccessfully, on renewal of the subsidies as a condition for ending the recent government shutdown. So far, Republican leaders in Congress have held firm, ready to allow the enhanced subsidies, which were always supposed to be temporary, to finally end.

This appears to be a fight about fraud, and whether it will be exposed in January or stay hidden for another year or more.

If there’s one thing we’ve learned about Team Biden, it’s that fraud didn’t bother them.

For example, in August 2022, the Biden Treasury Department informed the Office of Management and Budget that the IRS would not be permitted to estimate, report or address “improper payments” in four COVID relief programs: Economic Impact Payments, Recovery Rebate Credits, Sick and Family Leave Credit and Employee Retention Credit.

“Due to the short-term nature of pandemic-related programs, estimating the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources,” the Biden team told the IRS, according to a report released in May by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, also known as TIGTA.

The IRS was still required by law to evaluate these programs’ risk of improper payments. It found them to be “susceptible.”

Estimating and reporting improper payments in certain tax credit programs is something the IRS does every year at the direction of Congress. TIGTA checks in to see whether the agency has reached the goal of reducing improper payments to below 10 percent. They haven’t.

Improper payments are defined by the 2019 Payment Integrity Information Act as “any payment that should not have been made, was made in an incorrect amount, or was made to an ineligible recipient.” The problem was not new in 2019. Similar laws seeking to stop improper payments were enacted in 2016, 2013, 2010 and 2002.

None of them solved the problem. In fiscal year 2024, the Earned Income Tax Credit alone was the source of improper payments totaling $15.9 billion. Overall, the IRS found $21.6 billion in improper payments in fiscal year 2024, spread over the four “high-risk” tax credit programs they regularly examine.

One of those programs is the Obamacare subsidy. Its formal name is the Net Premium Tax Credit, or PTC. The IRS found that in fiscal year 2024, the “improper payment” rate for the PTC was 28.5%.

The enhanced subsidies for Obamacare were made especially vulnerable to fraud. The Biden team considered document-based verification to be a barrier to coverage. The government required only self-attested projected income. There was supposed to be a settle-up of the correct subsidy amount the following year, but the penalties for failing to reconcile the subsidy with actual income were suspended.

By effectively eliminating any enforcement of income accuracy and “streamlining” away documentation requirements, the Biden administration opened the door to massive fraud. Not only could individuals understate their income to receive larger subsidies, shady brokers could sign people up for coverage without their knowledge, or even enroll fictional people in Obamacare policies. This would generate commissions for the brokers and profits for the insurers, who received government payments for the premiums for these policies but never had to pay any claims on them.

A recent study by the Paragon Health Institute, a think tank founded in 2021 by a former Trump administration official, cited data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showing that the number of enrollees who didn’t use their benefits at all tripled between 2021 and 2024 to reach 11.7 million.

Paragon’s researchers estimated that “improper enrollment” jumped from 5 million in 2024 to 6.4 million in 2025, at a cost to taxpayers of more than $27 billion this year alone.

It didn’t help that the Biden administration allowed the auto-renewal of coverage without annual verification of income eligibility. In 2025, nearly 11 million Obamacare enrollees were automatically re-enrolled.

Freed from the “barriers” of documentation, enrollment soared. Before the enhanced subsidies began in 2021, there were about 12 million people enrolled in coverage from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. This year, it’s 24 million. But how many are real?

The Department of Health and Human Services tried in August to implement a new “Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule” to fight fraud. It was immediately challenged in court, postponing enforcement.

Fraud in government programs has plenty of bodyguards.

The challenge is to tell stories that are honest about the scale of the crisis while remaining faithful to evidence about what works.","For a movement so often framed by loss—and confronting a particularly difficult moment—conservation is relearning how to talk about itself. This shift may signal something deeper than messaging: a recalibration of what persuades people to care, to fund, and to act, especially as the world edges toward 2030 amid ecological strain, political volatility, and thinning public trust.

A few months ago, I put out an invitation to the conservation sector: share how you are navigating this moment, which many have described as a period of crisis. That invitation resurfaced on Friday when Crystal DiMiceli referenced it during a fireside chat at the Emerging Leaders in Wildlife Conservation 20th anniversary event in Washington, D.C.

DiMiceli asked what lessons are emerging so far. One of the most consistent responses has centered on communication: “Less crisis, more agency.”

Not because the crisis has abated, but because alarm on its own no longer mobilizes as reliably as it once did. If anything, it exhausts. Years of grim headlines have revealed an uncomfortable truth: when people are offered only catastrophe, many disengage. They stop reading, stop caring, and, in some cases, stop believing that anything meaningful can still be done.

What seems to be gaining ground instead is a focus on success—often partial, sometimes fragile, but demonstrable. Not triumphalism, but optimism grounded in evidence. Conservation framed as something people actively do, rather than something that merely happens—or fails to happen—to nature.

This reframing has another effect: it broadens the constituency. When conservation is presented solely as the protection of pristine places or distant species, it can feel remote, even exclusionary. When it is tied to livelihoods, rights, health, and local resilience, it becomes more immediate and more widely owned.

That shift necessarily includes Indigenous peoples and local communities, long treated as stakeholders and only belatedly recognized as rights-holders and decision-makers. Initiatives that scale tend to share a simple, if demanding, feature: genuine local buy-in. Not consultation after the fact, but ownership from the outset. Programs designed externally may pilot well; they are far less likely to replicate. Those rooted in place often spread precisely because they are not generic.

Scale, in this sense, is not synonymous with size. It more often emerges from accumulation: many small successes, repeated and adapted. The idea sounds modest, but it reflects how change actually travels. Replication depends less on grand design than on transparency, data, and narrative clarity. Successful programs can point to visible benefits—more fish on the reef, steadier incomes, safer water—and explain how those outcomes were achieved. They show their work: documenting evidence, acknowledging failures, and describing what was adjusted along the way. That openness builds credibility locally and makes the work easier for outsiders—like funders, partners, and peers—to understand and adapt.

The importance of diversified funding has surfaced repeatedly as well. Conservation efforts tethered to a single donor, funding stream, or a specific political moment tend to be brittle. Initiatives supported by a mix of philanthropy, public finance, community enterprise, and earned income are more likely to absorb shocks. In an increasingly volatile funding environment, that diversity functions less as a luxury than as a form of resilience.

The next five years will test whether the sector can meaningfully internalize these lessons. Integrating people and nature is no longer rhetorical garnish; it increasingly shapes whether conservation efforts are seen as legitimate or extractive. Rebuilding trust through transparency may, in some contexts, matter as much as the number of hectares protected. Narratives are beginning to shift toward agency, though doing so without drifting into fantasy will require discipline. Technology, deployed with care, can help—by lowering monitoring costs, improving access to data, and linking local efforts to wider audiences. Rights and environmental justice will shape outcomes regardless of whether they are explicitly acknowledged. Treating them as secondary concerns is not a neutral stance; it carries consequences that are often both predictable and expensive.

One model that illustrates how these threads can come together is Health in Harmony’s “health for forests” approach in Borneo. Rather than asking communities to stop logging because forests matter globally—an argument that can feel abstract or even alien—the organization begins with a more proximate question: What do you need? Frequently, the answer is access to affordable, reliable health care.

Health in Harmony responds by providing tiered health services, sometimes at no cost, in indirect exchange for verifiable conservation actions such as monitoring forest boundaries or restoring degraded land. What emerges is not a transaction so much as a shift in how the forest is perceived. It is no longer framed as a global asset preserved at local expense, but as integral to community health, security, and dignity. Crucially, the conservation solutions themselves are developed by the community, ensuring genuine ownership rather than compliance. The model aligns environmental outcomes with immediate human well-being—a linkage that feels increasingly central as conservation looks toward 2030.

In this context, the parallels with journalism are hard to miss. Journalism’s role can appear almost old-fashioned: to check abuses of power, inform the public, and offer ideas that expand what people consider possible. Yet the conditions under which it operates may be harsher. Disinformation spreads faster than corrections. Resources are shrinking across much of the media landscape. Civic space is narrowing in many places where environmental stakes are highest.

Still, journalism remains a public good that underpins nearly every other intervention, in conservation and beyond. Without credible information, policies misfire, markets distort, and communities are sidelined. Accountability begins with facts that can be trusted. So, often, does hope.

At Mongabay, our response has been to move closer to the ground: establishing autonomous local bureaus, expanding multilingual reporting, and deepening partnerships with local journalists. We have tried to pair investigative reporting with solutions coverage—on the premise that exposing wrongdoing matters, but so does documenting what works. Not as advocacy, and certainly not as cheerleading, but as evidence. Tracking how information is used—who it reaches, how it circulates, and what it influences—adds another layer of accountability.

This thinking sits behind a phrase that can sound suspect until unpacked: “optimism is a strategy.” It is not blind positivity. It is deliberate. A form of realism that recognizes despair as paralyzing and treats hope, when grounded in evidence, as a catalyst for action. Hope untethered from facts quickly curdles. But when anchored in proof, it sustains effort. Jane Goodall has long articulated this idea, often describing her role as that of a messenger of hope.

There is no shortage of examples. Mountain gorillas have recovered against the odds. Black-footed ferrets, kākāpō, and saiga antelopes have returned with sustained conservation effort. Entire island ecosystems have rebounded following the removal of invasive species. Forest loss has slowed in places once written off entirely. These stories are not just moving; they are instructional. They offer concrete lessons about what made recovery possible and how similar conditions might be recreated elsewhere.

Telling these stories has become a more intentional part of journalism’s contribution. I was told more than once that Mongabay was among the most depressing sites on the internet, chronicling species loss, forest destruction, and the rising toll of environmental defenders killed for their work. The description stung because it was not entirely wrong. So we made a conscious decision to expand our solutions reporting—not to dilute the gravity of the crisis, but to pair it with verified accounts of progress. Not ignoring what is broken, but insisting on documenting what is being repaired, and how.

That effort has taken shape through series on Indigenous-led conservation, conservation technology, agroecology and regenerative landscapes, and women at the forefront of community conservation, among others.

This evolution has coincided with another trend: news avoidance. Research from the Reuters Institute suggests a growing share of people – about 40% on average – actively tune out the news. The reasons vary, but two categories of reporting consistently retain their attention: solutions-focused stories and positive news. That finding loops back to the same insight emerging in conservation conversations—agency matters, even for engagement.

Narrative, in the end, is not incidental. Facts alone rarely move people. Stories do. The challenge is to tell stories that are honest about the scale of the crisis while remaining faithful to evidence about what works. If people conclude that nothing can be done, they will not try. If they see that effort yields results, even incremental ones, they are more likely to stay engaged. Optimism, in that sense, is an antidote to paralysis.

What sustains my own optimism? Mostly evidence. People doing extraordinary things with modest resources. Recovery demonstrated rather than promised. Enough is now known that ignorance is no longer a plausible excuse. A constituency for conservation that is widening—slowly, unevenly, but perceptibly. And time spent in nature itself, a reminder of both what is at stake and what still endures.

That impulse is also why I’ve been writing more tributes to those we’ve lost: people who quietly carried conservation forward, often without recognition or institutional backing. Their passing is a loss, but the purpose of remembering them is not elegy alone—it is to show what one person can do, and to leave readers not only saddened, but asking a simple, generative question: what might I carry forward?

Hope, grounded in evidence, is not a mood. It is a method. In conservation, as elsewhere, it is increasingly clear that lasting change depends on it.",https://www.butlernature.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/04-brunei_251115216942_0235z-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:00:10.004090

Across the center-right, a growing number of U.S. policymakers, business leaders, and investors are returning to classical principles — recognizing that markets, not government intervention, are the best way to secure America’s energy future.That’s what makes Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against major asset managers so misguided. The lawsuit accuses firms like BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard of conspiring to limit investment in coal. But what’s really being challenged is the freedom of investors to make market-based decisions about risk, technology and opportunity. Paxton isn’t fighting overreach. He’s fighting capitalism itself.

In the 2010s, the American Tea Party movement rose by explicitly campaigning against big-government mandates — from Common Core to the Affordable Care Act to Wall Street bailouts. Whether you agree with the movement or not, Paxton’s effort flips that logic on its head, substituting the judgment of politicians for that of investors and consumers.

Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who served as President Trump’s Energy Secretary, has called Paxton’s lawsuit “misguided,” warning that it will undermine President Trump’s energy agenda. He’s right. The reality is that investors are responding to economics, not ideology. Renewable energy, like wind and solar, have become more competitive and cost-effective. It is why investment in clean energy globally is expected to top $2.2 trillion by the end of the year. Emerging technologies are gaining traction. Markets reward efficiency and innovation, and they penalize waste and stagnation. When the government steps in to dictate how capital should be deployed, it distorts these signals and increases costs for everyone.If the goal is to strengthen America’s energy leadership, the path forward isn’t litigation, it’s certainty. China is moving full speed ahead to dominate global clean energy manufacturing and electric vehicles. Investors, utilities, companies, and developers need stable policy and predictable rules to plan decades-long projects. Permitting reform, consistent tax policy, and clear regulatory standards will do far more to unleash American energy investment than courtroom battles waged by politicians with a vendetta.Investment is already flowing. Across the country clean energy projects are expanding, many of them in Republican-represented districts. These projects aren’t ideological. They’re about job creation, reliable power, and economic competitiveness. As demand for electricity grows — driven by data centers, electric vehicles, and industrial production — the United States must bring more generation onto the grid. Every credible forecast shows that we will need more energy sources to meet that demand.This is where conservatives have a clear advantage. A market-driven energy agenda doesn’t require choosing between fossil fuels and renewables. It simply requires letting competition decide which technologies deliver the most affordable, reliable, and secure energy. That approach aligns perfectly with conservative values: economic freedom, property rights, and limited government.The language conservatives use also matters. Energy security, reliability, and economic growth are the winning arguments. Last month, I joined a group of former Republican members of Congress to push this message home: American competitiveness depends on abundant, affordable energy. If we fail to provide it, electricity prices will rise for everyone, industries will leave, and our geopolitical strength will weaken. The choice before conservatives is straightforward. We can embrace a forward-looking, pro-market energy strategy that builds on our strengths — or we can drift toward using government power to pick winners and punish others because of politics. The former leads to innovation and growth. The latter leads to stagnation and uncertainty.Conservatives built their legacy by trusting markets, empowering entrepreneurs, and limiting government interference. It’s time to apply those same principles to energy. The market, not the courtroom, should decide America’s energy future.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/9e/19ee3839-7ca8-4e81-aa4e-31f8abe6c465/68d5a29c1bb25.image.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:00:49.584211

Yves Béhar has spent his career shrinking problems down to size — making laptops lighter, office chairs more ergonomic, and technology more user-friendly. (Just ask customers of Jimmyjane, whose waterproof dildo (opens in new tab) was designed by Béhar.) Now the Swiss-born industrial designer is tackling America’s largest excess of all: the colossal truck.

His latest creation is a petite electric truck called Telo. It presents a bizarre optical illusion. At just 12.5 feet, it is the same length as the standard two-door Mini Cooper but has a truck bed bigger than a Rivian R1T. The five-seat interior has more space than a Toyota Tacoma cab, and Telo has a more efficient battery and lower price than most electric trucks on the market. The only thing it’s missing is a front: If Telo were a dog, it’d be a snub-nosed pug.

“From a design standpoint, you really need to create iconography,” Béhar said. “My inspiration is always what people need — the idiosyncrasies of modern life.”

With financing from local tech titans Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Tesla cofounder Marc Tarpenning, Telo positions its debut truck as a small yet mighty alternative to electric pickups from Rivian, Tesla, and Ford.

“When you see the car, you can’t help but react in some way,” Tarpenning wrote in a blog post last year, comparing Telo’s rise to that of Tesla, though with far less time, money, and manpower.

But with the EV market colder than an expired lithium battery, Béhar and his team face a precarious time in the industry. We visited Béhar’s design studio to see why he thinks he can make Americans fall in love with small, idiosyncratic electric trucks at a time when they seem to want everything bigger.

‘I want the truck now’

Three engineers were on their hands and knees, combing over the epoxy floor of Fuseprojects, Béhar’s design firm in the Potrero Flats, searching for a screw that belonged to a motherboard they were tinkering with moments earlier. Dressed in sweatpants and with hay-colored, unkempt hair, Béhar strode beside them to shake my hand.

Charming and a bit of a dude, Béhar grew up in Lausserne, Switzerland in a multicultural home with a German mother and a Turkish Jewish father. Though they visited museums and archeological sites across Europe, where Behar was exposed to different cultures, design was not something he learned about at home. Rather, his design sensibilities were shaped largely by two industrial-era movements: the American modernists Charles and Ray Eames and the Italian modernists the future-forward experimentalists like the Italian visionaries such as Joe Colombo and Achille Castiglioni, celebrated for their future-oriented experiments with how people live and interact., and the American modernists Charles and Ray Eames.

After moving to California in the late 1980s and graduating from ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Béhar went on to create products and companies that helped shape the look and feel of contemporary technology — often with a built-in ethos of sustainability. He would go on to implement his passion for the Eames’ in his Herman Miller Sayl chair, now a fixture of modern workplaces., His and OLPC XO laptop, a Y2K-era device designed to make computers—and thus education — more accessible to low-income students, incorporated mapping the Italians’ idea that objects could be instruments for new ways of living. (The laptop is one of several Béhar-designed pieces in SFMOMA’s permanent collection.)

“I believe in humanistic technologies,” he said. “It’s important for us to show not just where tech can go but should go, because I’m a little puzzled by what some of these tech companies are doing.”

Behar lives in Cow Hollow with his wife, art dealer Sabrina Buell, daughter of Democratic Party mega-donors and San Francisco socialites Susie Thompkins Buell and Mark Buell. Behar and his wife also share a home in Bolinas, beside a large cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

“We have never been fazed by the elements,” Buell told The Nob Hill Gazette in 2018 after she and Behar got married on the alkali floor of Burning Man’s playa.

At Fuseprojects, products and design awards are plopped around the foyer. Among these is a cardboard model of the Mission motorcycle, an electric two-wheeler that Béhar and Forrest North, Telo’s chief technology officer, worked on in 2008. It set the land-speed record for electric two-wheelers at the time, reaching 150 mph, but the company folded after years of financial strain, infighting, and the loss of key engineers to Apple (opens in new tab).

In 2022, Béhar and North got together again, this time with Jason Marks, now CEO of Telo, around the idea of making another electric vehicle. They figured they’d try another motorcycle, North said.

“We kept showing the slide to people that showed the motorcycle, a small car, then a small truck, with the whole idea of mobility for the city,” North said. “Every time they would say, ‘Oh, I want the truck now.’”

The group listened, founding Telo in 2022 with the goal of delivering a tiny, electric truck.

A difficult time to come to market

When Telo was founded, the EV market was flying high. While gas-powered car sales plummeted during the pandemic, EV sales skyrocketed at a rapid clip, thanks in large part to the momentous success of Tesla, government incentive programs, and an expansion of charging infrastructure.

In 2021, President Joe Biden clambered into a hulking Ford F-150 Lightning in Dearborn, Michigan. “Anyone want to jump in the back or on the roof?” Biden asked reporters. “These suckers are something else!”

That year, global sales for EVs hit a high point, surging more than 160% from 2020 to roughly 6.5 million vehicles — leading Ford, General Motors, and others to announce that they would phase out gas-powered cars in the coming decades.

But that was then. In the years since, the market has cooled. The cost of EVs continues to rise. President Donald Trump nixed federal credits that offered up to $7,500 in tax breaks for EV buyers. And the AI boom has vacuumed nearly all available funds for startups, making it a difficult time to raise money for hardware.

Ford is reportedly considering halting production (opens in new tab) of the F-150 Lightning, its flagship EV, which Biden so enjoyed.

Still, plenty of people want EVs. “At the end of the day, it’s an affordability issue, not a demand issue,” said Stephanie Valdez, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. “There’s a market [for Telo], but there’s a lot of headwinds.”

Telo isn’t the only tiny electric truck on the horizon. Slate Auto, which has backing from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, made waves this year when it announced an electric truck with a $20,000 price tag. Telo’s truck is priced at $41,000, still well below the roughly $60,000 for EV cars and for conventional trucks. Its 350-mile range is exceptional for an electric pickup, and its positioning as a city-friendly vehicle could prove compelling for urban drivers.

Many high-profile San Franciscans are have shown interest. Last week, Béhar’s friend Mayor Daniel Lurie arrived at Fuseprojects to test-drive the Telo. Lurie climbed into the driver’s seat, his hulking security guard fitting in the back, while the designer hopped up front. The crew sped off up Potrero Hill.

Political stunts, it seems, might not be disappearing from the EV marketing playbook anytime soon.

Testing it out

While Béhar’s design team works out of Portrero, Telo is headquartered in a small building in the dusty end of San Carlos, a Peninsula town that has become a breeding ground for EV technology. Across the street is the flying car company Joby, and next door is a former Tesla office where North worked 20 years ago on the frontier of electric vehicles.

It was there that I got to take one of the tiny trucks for a test drive. The first thing I noticed was that despite being 6-foot-2, I had ample space. Telo handled with the responsiveness of the average EV and had a surprisingly sharp turning radius for a truck. When I pulled out of the parking lot, I pushed the pedal to the floor to test the 0-60 capability. Four seconds might not beat a Tesla, but it’s faster than most EVs and was enough to turn my stomach upside down.

As North and I zoomed through the cookie-cutter suburb of San Carlos, electric and gas-powered trucks towered over us. We paused next to a 20-foot-long, 8,500-pound green Rivian, and North scoffed that this was all the auto industry had to offer.

For people who want something smaller, “that’s where we come in,” North said.

Telo considers itself at the vanguard of the third generation of electric vehicles. The first wave was the hybrid era ushered in by the Toyota Priuses in the early 2000s; the second was dominated by Tesla and Rivian; the third, Béhar argues, begins with companies like Telo and Slate, where design is freed from the old constraints of industry-standard EVs.

“In many ways, the designs of the previous generations of EVs are more conventional, because they followed industry standards,” Béhar said. The new generation, he added, lets designers break them.

There is still plenty of engineering work ahead before Telo hits full production. In September, Telo secured a $20 million Series A investment — modest by industrial automotive standards, but notable in a slowing EV market. Thirteen thousand pre-orders suggest at least a sliver of pent-up demand for a truck that doesn’t require its own ZIP Code.

Earlier this year, as Mini Cooper unveiled its latest two-door model, something unexpected happened: The Mini got bigger.

Béhar, back at Fuseprojects, considered that development. In a moment that could read as quiet pride in his tiny outlier of a truck, he raised his eyebrows and let a slow grin spread across his face.

“They actually made it bigger,” he said. “The new Mini — it’s 1 inch longer than us.”",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_qo5523ipbp3cj7432l5ld2re2d/-C100.00%25x78.71%25%2C0.00%25%2C0.00%25-FWEBP,N,,2025-12-13 11:02:29.047097

According to a report from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, California’s cap-and-trade program is one of the largest cap-and-trade projects in the world.

Gavin Newsom’s announcement that almost $865 million acquired from some of the state’s biggest emitters will pay for affordable housing and clean transportation projects, among other efforts funded by the state’s cap-and-trade program.

“We saw that in 2022, wildfires erased nearly 20 years of emission progress,” Assemblymember Tom Lackey, R-Palmdale and a member of the Assembly Transportation Committee, told The Center Square. “I’m a bit frustrated by that, and unfortunately, the administration still has no comprehensive wildfire prevention strategy. I think it’s a little bit disingenuous to brag about climate leadership while doing so little to stop the biggest source of our pollution and devastation - the wildfires.”

State Sen. Meghan Dahle, R-Redding, and a member of the Senate Transportation Committee, added that while she sees good housing projects being developed by the state’s cap-and-trade program, especially in rural communities, she also sees cap-and-trade increasing living expenses for most Californians.

“I am also very mindful that the cap-and-trade program is a tax on energy that drives up the cost of fuel for California drivers, who pay the highest pump prices in the nation to drive to work,” Dahle told The Center Square. “I recognize the good work being done, but we can’t tax our way out of the cost-of-living crisis in California.”

Six Democratic legislators, including the chairs of the transportation committees in the Assembly and Senate, were not available to speak to The Center Square on Friday. Five Republican legislators who are members of each chamber's transportation or housing committee were also not available to comment.

According to a press release sent out by Newsom’s office, the projects that will get portions of the cap-and-trade money include an expansion of public transit. Other projects include building affordable housing and rebuilding infrastructure damaged in this year’s wildfires, among other efforts. Projects also include buying 30 new zero-emission public transit vehicles, construction of 150 bus shelters, and the creation of 45 miles of bikeways and 20 miles of walkways, the governor’s office said.

The cap-and-trade program requires big emitters to buy “allowances” for the greenhouse gases they emit, the governor’s office said, generating billions of dollars in funding over the years that go into projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In all, 39 affordable housing projects in 21 communities across the state will get some of this money and major sustainable transportation upgrades, the governor’s office said.

According to a report from the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, California’s cap-and-trade program is one of the largest cap-and-trade projects in the world. The program is a big part of the state meeting its greenhouse gas emission goals. Five billion dollars has been generated since the Golden State launched the cap-and-trade program in 2012. A database from the International Carbon Action Partnership identifies agriculture, forestry fuel use, mining and extractives, transport, buildings and power as the economic sectors or industries that are included in the program.

Lindsay Buckley, the communications director for the California Air Resources Board, said the money comes from the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is financed by the state’s cap-and-trade program. The program is more than a decade old and has generated more than $33 billion that have been re-invested into climate-related projects, like affordable housing and sustainable communities.

Companies that include oil refineries and food processing facilities are part of the program, Buckley told The Center Square on Friday. They are some of the companies that are considered what Newsom called “the biggest polluters” in the state.

“We refer to them as just the state’s biggest emitters, and literally, on paper, they are the ones that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions in the state,” Buckley said.

More than $453.5 million went to grants that pay for transportation projects close to schools, workplaces and other common destinations, the governor’s office said. An additional $185.6 million will go to rebuilding infrastructure in Los Angeles after the damage of this year's wildfires.

“The funding puts billions of dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening the economy, and improving public health and the environment -- especially in disadvantaged communities,” said Kalin Kipling-Mojaddedi, communications lead for the Governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation.

“California is using California Climate Investment funds to protect health, stability, and opportunity across the state,"" Kipling-Mojaddedi wrote The Center Square in an email Friday.

A report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit, estimates that up to 3.9 million acres of Louisiana wetlands — roughly half of the state’s remaining wetlands — could lose protection under the proposed rule.
But inland wetlands — including wetlands areas in parishes such as Avoyelles, Concordia and St. Tammany — could lose federal safeguards.
That’s one reason the homebuilding and agricultural industries have pushed for a narrower federal rule.
Wetlands act as natural storm-surge buffers, slow the flow of floodwaters, filter pollution and provide crucial habitat for fisheries.","A proposed federal rule could dramatically reduce the number of wetlands in Louisiana that qualify for protection under the Clean Water Act, a move that could expose millions of acres to development.

Under the proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to waters that are “relatively permanent” — meaning they hold water year-round or with only brief interruptions — would remain federally protected. Wetlands that are seasonal, intermittent or connected only after storms would likely fall outside federal jurisdiction.

The change is intended to conform with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, which sharply restricted how wetlands can be regulated. But the new proposed rule, issued last month, goes further by removing several longstanding categories of protected water, like interstate waters, and by formally defining terms that are likely to make federal oversight even narrower.

“This rule would turn the Clean Water Act on its head,” said Mark Davis, the director of Tulane University’s Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy.

A report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit, estimates that up to 3.9 million acres of Louisiana wetlands — roughly half of the state’s remaining wetlands — could lose protection under the proposed rule. Nationally, the group projects that as much as 84% of wetlands protected prior to the Sackett ruling, or 55 million acres, could fall outside federal authority.

Since the 1930s, Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of wetlands.

The EPA, led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, said the proposal is designed to provide legal clarity by defining a “Water of the United States,” or area protected under the Clean Water Act.

“Democrat Administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families,” Zeldin said in a statement. “No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.”

Where in Louisiana will wetlands lose protection?

A map produced by NRDC from federal data illustrates the potential impact in Louisiana. Coastal wetlands that are continuously connected to the Gulf of Mexico are likely to remain protected. But inland wetlands — including wetlands areas in parishes such as Avoyelles, Concordia and St. Tammany — could lose federal safeguards.

Other parts of the state, including deep marshes in lower Terrebonne Parish and wetlands near the mouth of the Mississippi River, appear as gaps on the map because water there is considered sufficiently deep and permanent to retain federal protections. The map focuses on areas where protection status is likely up for debate.

Even so, the analysis is only an estimate. Determining whether a wetland is protected requires a site-specific assessment, which can be time-consuming and costly. That’s one reason the homebuilding and agricultural industries have pushed for a narrower federal rule.

“When the Clean Water Act passed, it was the best thing that ever happened. We needed it,” said Randall Noel, the president of Reve, Inc., a homebuilding company in Laplace, and a former president of the National Homebuilders Association, which supports the proposed rule. But in the years since it was first passed, Noel said the law’s scope has expanded past its original intent.

“A quarter of Americans can’t afford a house, in part due to the costs required for wetlands determinations at the beginning of a project,” he said. Noel pointed to a sugarcane field he hoped to build on that was initially classified as a wetland, a decision he disputed. He said the new rule would make the permitting process more predictable.

But environmental groups say the proposal would leave large portions of the state vulnerable. Wetlands act as natural storm-surge buffers, slow the flow of floodwaters, filter pollution and provide crucial habitat for fisheries. Those functions could be compromised if protections are lifted.

“It will reduce the number of streams, wetlands and other waters that the Clean Water Act protects from pollution and destruction,” said Matthew McKinzie, a senior director with the NRDC. “Even for those waters that remain technically protected, it will make it harder to enforce the law against illegal polluters.”

Davis argues that the rule’s lack of clarity means it could make permitting decisions more difficult. The agency says a wetland must be connected to a relatively permanent waterbody at least during the area’s wet season, though the rule does not define when that season occurs.

“What is the ‘wet season?’ Nobody knows,” Davis said. “For something that's supposed to eliminate confusion, it creates a lot of confusion.”

The EPA and Army Corps published the proposal on Nov. 17 and are accepting public comments through Jan. 5.

Under the proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to waters that are “relatively permanent” — meaning they hold water year-round or with only brief interruptions — would remain federally protected. Wetlands that are seasonal, intermittent or connected only after storms would likely fall outside federal jurisdiction.

The change is intended to conform with the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency, which sharply restricted how wetlands can be regulated. But the new proposed rule, issued last month, goes further by removing several longstanding categories of protected water, like interstate waters, and by formally defining terms that are likely to make federal oversight even narrower.

Today, West Virginia produces about 15 GW of capacity generation.
For businesses, the state’s West Virginia Forward — a collaborative project between the state, West Virginia University and Marshall University on economic development strategies — reveals that rising electricity costs are already hurting competitiveness.
West Virginia businesses are focused on getting by, when they should be focused on growing operations.
West Virginia businesses don’t have that option.","The cold days of winter have barely set in, and electricity is already one of the biggest concerns in West Virginia. At kitchen tables, in campaign speeches, and at national energy forums, people are asking the same questions: How do we keep power affordable? reliable? All while demand grows?

At local hearings, residents are worried about rising bills. At economic-development meetings, leaders are debating how to power energy-hungry data centers. And just the other week in Charleston, energy experts at the West Virginia Energy Summit outlined a stark reality: demand is climbing, costs are rising, and staying competitive will require a new approach. A major focus of the Summit was Governor Patrick Morrisey’s “50 by 50” goal — a forward-thinking plan to generate 50 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity by 2050. Today, West Virginia produces about 15 GW of capacity generation. Meeting that target would mean unprecedented energy investment and could position the state to attract new industries and drive economic growth.

But as we consider how to meet that goal, we can’t ignore a hard truth: electricity in West Virginia is becoming too expensive for the businesses and families who rely on it.

And for utilities to build new power plants, energy users will only continue to see their bills rise to pay for those costs. For businesses, the state’s West Virginia Forward — a collaborative project between the state, West Virginia University and Marshall University on economic development strategies — reveals that rising electricity costs are already hurting competitiveness. Since 2008, the price percentage change for large energy user electricity rates has increased more than almost all other states:

Commercial businesses have risen by 92 percent — the second-fastest increase in the nation.

Industrial businesses are up 85 percent, also second worst in the country.

West Virginia businesses are focused on getting by, when they should be focused on growing operations.

While West Virginia’s energy costs surge, neighboring states — Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia — allow large commercial and industrial customers to procure their own electricity through a competitive wholesale market. This simple policy difference lets businesses shop for contracts and prices that fit their needs, potentially saving them millions in the process. The results are undeniable. A Cleveland State University study found that between 2019 and 2024, Ohio businesses using competitive procurement — instead of their local utility — saved $1.17 billion per year. That’s a billion-dollar proof point that choice lowers cost.

West Virginia businesses don’t have that option. They’re required to buy electricity at rates set by the utilities — no matter how high those rates climb. That rigidity is discouraging new companies from locating or expanding here. And many existing employers are struggling under the weight of rising power bills.

The problem could accelerate if utilities begin building new generation to meet the 50 by 50 goal. Constructing just one 700-megawatt natural gas plant could cost more than $800 million — and those costs are not paid by the utilities, but passed directly on to you, the ratepayer.

There’s a better way to meet growing energy needs, protect consumers, and make West Virginia more attractive for future business: allow the largest energy users to buy their own electricity.

A modernized wholesale shopping option simply gives large employers an additional tool to manage their energy needs. Utilities would continue serving the vast majority of West Virginia customers and still serve as the default option for large users. This approach doesn’t replace the existing structure — it complements it — giving major employers more flexibility and stability in planning their long-term energy costs.

Opening the market would also send a clear and constructive signal to independent power producers that West Virginia welcomes private investment in new generation.

Rather than relying solely on utility-built projects — and the ratepayer obligations that come with them — the state could tap billions in outside investment to supplement utility plans. Importantly, this structure shifts the financial risk of new generation away from households and small businesses and onto private developers, especially in the event that future demand does not materialize as projected. That’s a safeguard to protect the pockets of consumers.

Critically, none of this requires sacrificing oversight, reliability, or West Virginia’s longstanding commitment to a strong grid. Neighboring states have shown that competitive procurement and incumbent utilities can coexist successfully. The result is a system that accelerates investment, attracts new industry, and applies downward pressure on price — without compromising reliability.

West Virginia must stay competitive and prevent jobs from drifting to neighboring states. Give businesses confidence to invest, and put the Mountain State back in the running to attract new industries — and keep those that are already here. Letting large users manage their own power is a simple way to stay in the highly competitive fight; and just as important, help protect the pockets of Mountaineers.

Under the stipulated agreement, Georgia Power has pledged to use extra revenue from data centers to keep other customers' rates in check.
It's far from guaranteed customers' bills will shrink that much, if at all — a point PSC staff conceded during Wednesday's hearing.
In a statement, Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said the agreement will mean ""more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia's future.""
""This agreement gives Georgia Power everything they've asked for with very little in return for regular Georgians,"" he added.","Georgia Power and the Public Service Commission's staff unveiled a deal Wednesday that would allow the utility to add about 10,000 megawatts of power supplies in just five years, an unprecedented expansion that's mostly to serve data centers.

The agreement, known as a stipulation, is not final. I tstill must be approved by the five members of the PSC. But in other cases in which stipulations were reached, the commission has stuck closely to the agreement, so the deal is likely a preview of what the PSC will approve.

The deal calls for all 9,885 megawatts of new power plants and other generation resources Georgia Power was seeking to be ""certified,"" a key step that would allow the company to start construction and paves the way to charge customers down the road. The overall expansion is more than double the combined generating capacity of the four nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle near Augusta.

Most new electricity supplies the utility wants to build itself or buy from other power plants would rely on burning gas, which produces potent greenhouse gases that are warming the planet. The rest would come from battery storage systems and some solar.

Nearly all the new power generation muscle is needed to serve data centers, the energy-intensive computing warehouses springing up across Georgia to serve artificial intelligence and other digital products.

Monopoly utilities like Georgia Power earn profits on investments in new power plants and transmission lines, so the deal, if approved, would likely boost the bottom line of its parent, Southern Company.

In a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, Georgia Power estimated the new power resources it would be allowed to build would require at least $16 billion in capital investment. That does not include power the company would purchase from third parties or other related costs, so the plan's ultimate price tag could be significantly higher.

In testimony filed before the hearings, PSC staff had warned residential customers could eventually see monthly bills jump $20 or more if the utility's full expansion were approved and data center demand does not materialize. Staff had previously recommended the commission sign off on only about a third of the new power supplies, at least for now. The rest, they said, were ""speculative"" and risky investments for customers.

'Downward pressure'

Rising power bills have emerged as a potent political issue nationally and in Georgia. Georgia Power customers have seen their monthly electricity bills rise six times in roughly three years because of decisions made by the all-Republican commission.

Democrats flipped two Republican-held PSC seats last month in an election that largely became a referendum on utility bills with Democrats alleging the GOP members were rubber stamps for Georgia Power. Those Democrats, incoming commissioners Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, will be sworn in next month and will not have a say in this deal.

Under the stipulated agreement, Georgia Power has pledged to use extra revenue from data centers to keep other customers' rates in check.

In return for the endorsement of its fleet expansion, Georgia Power agreed to structure its next rate adjustment — slated to be proposed in 2028 — to put at least $8.50 in ""downward pressure"" on residential customers' monthly bills.

It's far from guaranteed customers' bills will shrink that much, if at all — a point PSC staff conceded during Wednesday's hearing. ""Downward pressure"" is not the same as a rate cut and many residential customers use more electricity each month than the 1,000 kilowatt-hours used to estimate bill impacts.

Any rate increases or decreases resulting from the agreement won't be felt until 2029.

In a statement, Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene said the agreement will mean ""more money stays in your pocket while we power Georgia's future.""

""Large energy users are paying more so families and small businesses can pay less, and that's a great result for Georgians,"" Greene added.

Environmental and consumer groups have a less rosy view of the deal.

Thomas Farmer, the vice president of advocacy for the Southface Institute, called the proposed deal an ""extraordinary ask that will impact our state for decades.""

""This agreement gives Georgia Power everything they've asked for with very little in return for regular Georgians,"" he added.

'Closed door' deal

The deal was announced just 90 minutes before hearings on the company's plan were set to start Wednesday and was met with surprise at the PSC's downtown headquarters. The hearings this week are the last chance for parties to argue for and against the deal before the commission votes on Dec. 19.

The hearings themselves, which could last through Friday, got off to a rocky start Wednesday.

As PSC Chair Jason Shaw tried to kick off the proceedings, he was drowned out by a group of environmental and consumer advocates that stood in front of the dais chanting things like ""Power to the people, not Georgia Power."" Several protesters were forced out of the hearing room by police, but a Georgia State Patrol office confirmed none were placed under arrest.

Once the hearing got underway, commissioners continued to get an earful during the public comment period. For more than two hours, a chorus of speakers said they were frustrated by high power bills and worried about the higher temperatures that will result from increased burning of fossil fuels.

Georgia Tech student Kiran Kapileshwari said the stipulated agreement was negotiated ""behind closed doors"" and blasted it as a ""profound breach of public trust.""

PSC spokesperson Tom Krause said these agreements are common in PSC cases and called the process ""very open and public.""

""It was negotiated in the same manner as stipulations in any legal process,"" Krause said.

Kapileshwari and others also criticized the timing of the PSC's scheduled vote on Georgia Power's historic expansion. The final vote on Dec. 19 will take place less than two weeks before Hubbard and Johnson take office. Two environmental groups unsuccessfully sought to delay the vote until the New Year.

In a rally Wednesday morning outside the PSC offices, Hubbard said there are cleaner and better alternatives to the gas plants Georgia Power wants to build, and said he did not believe the customer impacts of the company's plan have been fully vetted.

Hubbard said he had not heard about the deal the utility struck with the PSC staff and learned of it only when asked by reporters.

""I don't know what's going on behind closed doors, so I can't speak to that, but I will be sitting at the table very soon,"" Hubbard said. ""And if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu, and that's appears to be what happened today.""

Down here in the Bootheel, farmers are struggling with the same energy problem that sank the smelter.
It’s been almost two years since the smelter closed, but I still think of the job and people I worked with every day.","When I fire up the tractor before sunrise in Campbell, the hum of the engine takes me back to a different kind of power — the kind that used to surge through the aluminum cells at Magnitude 7 Metals in Marston before it closed its doors almost two years ago.

Back then, I worked nights surrounded by sparks and heat, helping turn raw ore into the lightweight metal that keeps America running. These days, I work the same Bootheel land at my neighbors farm, but the story hasn’t changed much: whether you’re smelting or farming, you’re fighting the same battle for affordable energy, steady pay and a future worth passing on.

When the Magnitude 7 Metals smelter closed nearly two years ago for the second time, hundreds of good-paying union jobs vanished overnight. Those were jobs that kept local diners open, hardware stores busy, and families rooted in this corner of Missouri.

I thought tariffs would keep us safe — after all, that’s what we were told in 2018 when President Donald Trump imposed Section 232 tariffs to bring our industry back from the brink. For a while, it felt like that might happen. The former Noranda plant restarted. Paychecks flowed back into our towns. But without addressing the root problem — sky-high electricity costs driven by our reliance on the aging New Madrid coal plant — tariffs, though helpful, are only a temporary patch.

Without investment in affordable, reliable power, tariffs won’t cut it. That’s why the gates at Magnitude 7 are still closed today.

The truth is, Missouri’s economy runs on the same current: whether you’re melting metal or tending crops, you need dependable electricity at a fair price. Down here in the Bootheel, farmers are struggling with the same energy problem that sank the smelter. High power costs drive up grain drying bills, squeeze irrigation budgets, and eat away at razor-thin margins. And most of that power still comes from the New Madrid coal plant, a costly system that’s left both industry and agriculture in a tough spot.

We’ve got what it takes to fix this. Missouri is rich in natural and human resources: flat land, steady wind, strong sun, and hardworking people ready to make a living. If we invested in renewable energy right here — from solar arrays outside Sikeston to wind projects across the state — we could lower costs, strengthen the grid, and give towns like Marston and Campbell a second chance.

Coal is still essential in the short term, since we lack the infrastructure to switch fully to renewables right away, but the transition has to start somewhere and coal won’t be around forever. Cleaner, cheaper power could help farms grow and maybe even bring primary aluminum production back to life.

America still needs aluminum, and it’ll need a lot more of it in the coming years. Every tractor, truck, and transmission line depends on it. And Missouri can play a bigger role in meeting that need, not by relying on quick political fixes like tariffs, but by giving workers and farmers the tools to compete with cleaner, more efficient energy.

Across America, data centers are booming, and billions in new investments are being proposed right here in Missouri. But for all that growth, these massive facilities won’t create anywhere near the number of steady jobs a smelter once did. What they will do is compete for the same limited supply of electricity — driving up demand and making it even harder for industries like aluminum and agriculture to afford the power they need to survive

Let’s stop pretending tariffs will rebuild our economy. The people who power Missouri — on the factory floor and in the fields — know what we really need: investment in affordable, modern energy that lets us work hard, earn fair, and stay rooted right here at home.

It’s been almost two years since the smelter closed, but I still think of the job and people I worked with every day. Every time I do, I think about how connected our struggles are in this part of the state. The lesson is clear: if we want to rebuild Southeast Missouri, we have to invest in energy that works for everyone — from the aluminum cell to the plow.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/smelter.png,N,,2025-12-13 11:01:35.611417

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by one to 548 in the week to December 12, the lowest since November 26.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 41 rigs, or 6.9% below this time last year.

Baker Hughes said oil rigs rose by one to 414 this week, their highest since November 21, while gas rigs fell by two to 127.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third year in a row in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to around 13.6 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 63% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020. EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

(RFD-TV) — Efforts are moving forward in Congress to advance domestic energy development, with the House set to vote on the SPEED Act. The legislation aims to reform the National Environmental Policy Act and streamline the federal permitting process for energy and infrastructure projects.

House Natural Resources Committee Chair Congressman, Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, joined us for this week’s Champions of Rural America to discuss the proposal and its potential impact on rural communities and agriculture.

In his conversation with RFD-TV News, Westerman highlighted that the SPEED Act passed out of committee on November 20 by a 25–18 vote.

Congressman Patronis: “Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, Aaron Bean, for introducing this amendment. Mr. Chairman, after working hard to obtain Federal approval in the first Trump administration, a weaponized court system pulled Florida’s 404 permitting out from under us, even though our program was thoroughly vetted and approved in 2020. Florida’s DEP has become a national model for environmental protection, and Washington should be learning from us, not tying our hands. The amendment makes it clear that once a State assumption program is approved, the EPA cannot withdraw it unless Congress explicitly says so—no more regulatory whiplash, no more political games. For Florida, this is critical. It protects our section 404 program, and it ends the uncertainty caused by conflicting court rulings and shifting in interpretations in Washington. Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers got a gut punch with an overwhelming caseload while working hard to try to solve dozens of projects that an activist judge has placed on hold in our communities that they desperately need, like stormwater, schools, and even sewer treatment plants not under construction, protecting our most precious environments. But we can’t unless the permits can be issued. This is about predictability, federalism, and letting the States manage their own waterways. It is proinfrastructure, prodevelopment, but, most importantly, it is proenvironmental protection.”

Two-thirds of that infusion was earmarked for Sunrise Wind alone, underscoring both the size of the undertaking and the difficulty Ørsted faces in securing private partners willing to shoulder U.S. offshore wind uncertainty.
The project’s financing structure ensures that Long Islanders will cover the bulk of Sunrise Wind’s cost.
While Hochul has not released a clear accounting of how much Sunrise Wind will raise electric bills, her office has previously reported only a few dollars per month for the average household.
The true cost to consumers—and the final price of the nation’s largest wind project—will only become clear once the turbines start spinning.","The price tag for Sunrise Wind, New York’s flagship 924-megawatt offshore wind project, has become increasingly difficult to pin down as costs escalate and financial assumptions shift. Early state documents put the project’s cost at roughly $1.5 billion, but industry analysts now say a more realistic figure is somewhere between $6 billion and $9 billion once inflation, supply-chain pressures, and higher interest rates are factored in.

Ørsted, which owns 100 percent of the project, has not publicly stated a firm estimate—one that most likely will not be finalized until construction is complete over the next few years.

To keep the project alive, the Danish company has taken extraordinary steps to raise capital. After failing to “farm down” a stake in Sunrise Wind—its preferred model of selling partial ownership to reduce risk—the company turned to shareholders with a massive $9.4 billion rights offering. Two-thirds of that infusion was earmarked for Sunrise Wind alone, underscoring both the size of the undertaking and the difficulty Ørsted faces in securing private partners willing to shoulder U.S. offshore wind uncertainty.

Where that money ultimately comes from, however, is not in dispute. The project’s financing structure ensures that Long Islanders will cover the bulk of Sunrise Wind’s cost. A 25-year Offshore Renewable Energy Certificate contract with the state guarantees Ørsted a fixed payment for every megawatt-hour produced—paid directly through electric bills.

At the federal level, Inflation Reduction Act incentives, including a 30 percent Investment Tax Credit, could shift billions more onto U.S. taxpayers. With the Trump Administration souring on wind projects, federal support may dry up, leaving New Yorkers to carry the burden alone. Critics warn that Gov. Kathy Hochul may throw the company a taxpayer-dollar lifeline—an investor bailout that could make one of the highest-taxed regions in the nation even more unaffordable.

While Hochul has not released a clear accounting of how much Sunrise Wind will raise electric bills, her office has previously reported only a few dollars per month for the average household.

As of late 2025, a dramatic recalibration of market share is underway, driven by aggressive new model launches, innovative technological advancements, and strategic pricing from both established automotive giants and agile newcomers, particularly from China. This shift signals a maturation of the EV industry, moving beyond a single leader to a more fragmented and intensely competitive landscape, with immediate implications for consumer choices, manufacturing strategies, and investor portfolios worldwide.

A New Era of Competition: Tesla's Grip Loosens as Challengers Accelerate

The narrative of the EV market in 2025 is increasingly defined by Tesla's shifting position. Once the undisputed titan, Tesla's global EV market share saw a notable decrease to 7.5% in the first half of the year, a 4.2 percentage point drop year-over-year. While it held over 13% of the global Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) market share in Q3 2025, with a 7% year-over-year sales increase, its regional performance paints a more complex picture. In 13 European countries, Tesla's market share plummeted from a peak of 36% in Q3 2019 to 10.2% in Q3 2025, with overall sales down more than 50% compared to 2024.

In the United States, November 2025 saw Tesla's sales hit a four-year low, falling nearly 23% year-over-year to 39,800 units. This decline was largely attributed to the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025, which caused the overall U.S. EV market to contract by over 41% in November. Paradoxically, due to even sharper declines among competitors, Tesla's U.S. market share actually increased from 43.1% to 56.7% during this period, highlighting the significant impact of policy changes on the entire sector. In China, Tesla's retail sales in November experienced a 5% year-over-year decline, placing it fifth in the country's New Energy Vehicle (NEV) retail sales ranking.

This evolving landscape is a direct result of the aggressive strategies employed by Tesla's rivals. BYD (Build Your Dreams) (SHE: 002594, HKG: 1211) has emerged as a formidable global force, dominating the EV market in the first half of 2025 with a 19.9% share. In China, BYD led the NEV market in November 2025 with a 23.2% market share. Its global exports reached a record 131,935 units in November, with sales quadrupling in Europe, doubling in Southeast Asia, and increasing by over 50% in South America in 2025. Notably, BYD outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time in April 2025.

The Volkswagen Group (XTRA: VOW3) is solidifying its position, especially in Europe, where it holds about 27% of the BEV market. By the end of September 2025, its global BEV deliveries reached 717,500 units, a 42% increase from the same period in 2024. Popular models like the Volkswagen ID.4/ID.5, ID.3, Audi Q4 e-tron, Audi Q6 e-tron, and Škoda Elroq have driven this growth. In the U.S., General Motors (NYSE: GM) has become the second-largest EV seller, delivering 144,668 EVs through the first three quarters of 2025, a 103% jump from all of 2024. Strong demand for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, and GMC Sierra EV propelled GM's record third quarter with 66,501 EV deliveries.

Chinese manufacturers are also making significant strides. Geely (HKG: 0175) ranked third globally in BEV sales in Q3 2025 with a 10% market share, and its Zeekr brand alone recorded 61,000 deliveries in October. New entrant Xiaomi (HKG: 1810), a smartphone giant, made a splash with its SU7 sedan, which outsold Tesla's Model 3 in China in December 2024. Its YU7 SUV, launched in mid-2025, garnered nearly 240,000 firm orders in just 18 hours, priced lower than the Tesla Model Y with a claimed higher range. XPeng (NYSE: XPEV) saw its sales surge by 270.26% year-over-year in the first seven months of 2025, while Leapmotor (HKG: 9863) exceeded 70,000 deliveries in November. Nio (NYSE: NIO) delivered a record 87,071 vehicles in Q3 2025, a 40.8% increase year-over-year, driven by its NIO, ONVO, and Firefly sub-brands. Even Ford (NYSE: F), despite a significant plunge in its November 2025 EV sales after the loss of federal tax credits, hit record highs in Q3 2025 for its EV models like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, though its hybrid sales are now outperforming pure EVs.

The Shifting Tides: Who Wins and Who Loses in the EV Race

The current dynamics in the EV market are creating clear winners and losers, reshaping the competitive landscape. Companies that have embraced diversification, aggressive pricing, and regional market specificities are generally thriving, while those relying heavily on past successes or singular market strategies face increasing pressure.

Winners:

BYD (SHE: 002594, HKG: 1211): Undoubtedly a major winner, BYD's comprehensive strategy encompassing battery production, diverse model lineups (including hybrids and BEVs), and aggressive international expansion has propelled it to global leadership in market share. Its strong performance in Europe, Southeast Asia, and South America, coupled with its dominant position in China, positions it for continued growth.

Volkswagen Group (XTRA: VOW3): Leveraging its vast manufacturing capabilities and brand portfolio, Volkswagen has successfully positioned itself as the BEV market leader in Europe. Its strategy of offering a wide range of EV models across its brands (Volkswagen, Audi, Škoda, Porsche) allows it to cater to various consumer segments, from affordable to luxury.

General Motors (NYSE: GM): GM's significant investment in its Ultium platform is bearing fruit, making it the second-largest EV seller in the U.S. The strong demand for models like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, and GMC Sierra EV indicates that traditional automakers can effectively transition and compete in the EV space with compelling products.

Chinese EV Startups (Geely (HKG: 0175), Xiaomi (HKG: 1810), XPeng (NYSE: XPEV), Leapmotor (HKG: 9863), Nio (NYSE: NIO)): These companies are demonstrating immense agility and innovation, rapidly introducing new models with advanced features and competitive pricing tailored to the vast Chinese market. Xiaomi's immediate impact with its SU7 and YU7, and the consistent growth of XPeng, Leapmotor, and Nio, highlight the strength and dynamism of the Chinese EV ecosystem. Their increasing focus on overseas expansion also signals future global competition.

Losers/Challenged:

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA): While still a major player, Tesla is undeniably facing significant headwinds. Its declining market share in crucial European and Chinese markets, coupled with a U.S. sales slump post-tax credit expiration, indicates that its premium pricing and relatively limited model lineup are becoming vulnerabilities. The strategy of introducing cheaper variants appears to be cannibalizing sales of higher-margin models rather than expanding its customer base, impacting overall revenue. Tesla's long-term focus on AI and autonomy, while strategic, may not be sufficient to fend off rivals focused on immediate, competitive product offerings.

Ford (NYSE: F) (Pure EV Segment): Despite record EV sales in Q3 2025, Ford's significant plunge in November 2025 EV sales post-tax credit removal, coupled with a $1.4 billion loss in its EV business in Q3, highlights the fragility of its pure EV strategy. While its hybrid sales are robust, the challenges with models like the F-150 Lightning suggest that the transition to pure EVs is proving more difficult and costly than anticipated for some legacy automakers.

The fierce competition is also leading to intensified price wars, particularly in China, which benefits consumers but pressures profit margins for all manufacturers. The ability to innovate rapidly, manage supply chains efficiently, and adapt to diverse regional consumer preferences will be crucial determinants of long-term success.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Global Automotive Landscape

This dramatic shift in the EV market extends far beyond individual company performance, signaling profound implications for broader industry trends, regulatory frameworks, and geopolitical dynamics. The diminishing dominance of a single player, Tesla, and the rise of a multipolar EV ecosystem represent a maturation of the industry, moving from early adoption to mass market competition.

One of the most significant trends is the diversification of EV offerings. Manufacturers are no longer just producing premium sedans; they are rolling out SUVs, compact cars, commercial vehicles, and even ultra-luxury options, catering to every segment. This broad appeal, particularly from traditional automakers like Volkswagen and GM, is allowing them to leverage existing customer bases and dealer networks to gain traction against Tesla's more focused lineup. The rapid emergence of affordable, feature-rich EVs from Chinese brands is also fundamentally altering consumer expectations, especially in cost-sensitive markets.

The ripple effects are being felt across the entire automotive supply chain. Battery manufacturers, charging infrastructure providers, and software developers are all experiencing increased demand and diversification of their client base. This competitive pressure is accelerating innovation in battery technology, charging speeds, and in-car software, pushing the boundaries of what EVs can offer. Furthermore, the rise of Chinese brands on the global stage challenges the long-standing automotive order, potentially leading to new manufacturing hubs and export routes, particularly as these companies expand into Europe and Southeast Asia.

Regulatory and policy implications are becoming increasingly critical. The U.S. federal EV tax credit's expiration in September 2025 vividly demonstrated the profound impact government incentives have on consumer demand and sales volumes. This event underscores the need for stable, long-term policy frameworks to support EV adoption and manufacturing. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to balance environmental goals with economic competitiveness, often leading to domestic content requirements or specific incentive structures that can favor local manufacturers. The ""Inflation Reduction Act"" in the U.S., for instance, aims to bolster domestic EV and battery production, potentially creating trade tensions with countries like China and Europe.

Historically, major technological shifts in industries have rarely been dominated by a single entity indefinitely. From the early days of computing to mobile phones, initial pioneers often face stiff competition as technology matures and market entry barriers lower. Tesla's current situation can be compared to how early tech giants eventually faced robust competition from a multitude of innovative players. This period of intense competition is healthy for the industry, fostering innovation, improving product quality, and ultimately benefiting consumers through more choice and competitive pricing.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Evolving EV Landscape

The coming months and years will be pivotal for the electric vehicle industry, with several short-term and long-term possibilities shaping its trajectory. The current competitive intensity is unlikely to wane; instead, it is expected to escalate, demanding strategic pivots and continuous adaptation from all players.

In the short-term, expect continued price wars, especially in high-volume markets like China, as manufacturers vie for market share. This will put significant pressure on profit margins, potentially leading to consolidation among smaller or less efficient EV startups. We may also see an acceleration of new model launches, with a focus on affordability and advanced features like improved range, faster charging, and sophisticated AI-driven infotainment systems. The impact of government incentives will remain a critical factor, with regions adjusting policies based on market performance and environmental targets. For instance, the U.S. market will be closely watched to see how it recovers from the post-tax credit slump and if new state-level incentives emerge.

Long-term possibilities include a more diversified global EV market, with regional powerhouses emerging. Chinese brands are poised to become significant global exporters, challenging established players in Europe and other international markets. Traditional automakers, having invested heavily in EV platforms, will likely continue to gain ground, leveraging their brand recognition and extensive service networks. The focus will shift beyond just selling vehicles to building comprehensive EV ecosystems, including charging networks, battery swapping services, and integrated energy solutions.

Potential strategic pivots will be crucial. Tesla, for instance, might need to diversify its product lineup more aggressively, potentially introducing more affordable models or expanding into new segments like commercial vans, rather than solely relying on its existing premium offerings and long-term autonomy vision. Competitors will need to focus on supply chain resilience, battery technology innovation, and software differentiation to maintain an edge. Partnerships and collaborations, such as joint ventures for battery production or charging infrastructure, could also become more common as companies seek to share costs and accelerate development.

Market opportunities will emerge in niche segments, such as rugged off-road EVs, specialized commercial vehicles, or ultra-luxury electric offerings. The development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and fully autonomous driving will continue to be a battleground, attracting significant R&D investment. Furthermore, the burgeoning demand for sustainable energy solutions will create opportunities for companies integrating EVs with home energy storage and smart grid technologies.

However, challenges will persist. Raw material scarcity and price volatility for battery components, the need for robust and widespread charging infrastructure, and consumer range anxiety remain significant hurdles. Geopolitical tensions could also impact supply chains and market access, forcing companies to localize production. The overall profitability of EV divisions will be under intense scrutiny, as many traditional automakers are still reporting losses in this segment.

Ultimately, the EV market is heading towards a future characterized by intense innovation, consumer-centric product development, and a highly competitive landscape where agility and strategic foresight will be paramount.

Wrap-up: A New Dawn for the Electric Vehicle Industry

The year 2025 marks a definitive turning point in the electric vehicle market. The era of single-player dominance is drawing to a close, giving way to a dynamic, multi-faceted competitive environment. The rise of formidable rivals like BYD (SHE: 002594, HKG: 1211), Volkswagen Group (XTRA: VOW3), and General Motors (NYSE: GM), alongside an agile cohort of Chinese innovators, has fundamentally reshaped the industry's contours. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), while still a major force, is facing unprecedented pressure on its market share and profitability, signaling a need for strategic re-evaluation.

The key takeaways from this shifting landscape are clear: diversification of product offerings, aggressive pricing strategies, and regional market adaptability are now paramount for success. The expiration of government incentives, as seen in the U.S., underscores the sensitivity of EV demand to policy changes, highlighting the need for stable regulatory environments to foster sustainable growth. This period of heightened competition is not merely a challenge but also an accelerator of innovation, pushing the boundaries of battery technology, charging infrastructure, and vehicle intelligence.

Moving forward, the EV market will likely be characterized by continued innovation, intense price competition, and a battle for technological leadership. Investors should closely watch for companies that demonstrate strong capabilities in battery supply chain management, software integration, and the ability to scale production efficiently while maintaining profitability. The global expansion strategies of Chinese EV manufacturers will be a key trend, potentially altering the automotive trade landscape. Additionally, the development and deployment of robust charging infrastructure will be critical to unlocking broader consumer adoption.

The next few years will define the long-term leaders in the electric mobility revolution. While the journey may be volatile, the overall trajectory towards an electrified future remains undeniable, offering both immense opportunities and significant challenges for all stakeholders.

The WOTUS rule, borne of the Clean Water Act, identifies those waters that are federally protected from pollution by development and industry.
The EPA’s proposed rule change would strip Clean Water Act protections from 80% of all wetlands and over 5 million miles of streams across the country.
The good news is that this rule change is not a done deal – yet.
The EPA is taking public comments on the proposed WOTUS rule change until Jan. 5, and we must speak up forcefully against it.","Right now, our country is facing a serious and significant threat to wetlands, water, and the spirit of the federal Clean Water Act. And that threat is being made by the very people who are tasked with protecting our environment.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced in mid-November that it intends to significantly weaken the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, gutting wetland and water quality protections across the country, and leaving every state more vulnerable to flooding and contaminated water. The WOTUS rule, borne of the Clean Water Act, identifies those waters that are federally protected from pollution by development and industry.

The EPA’s proposed rule change would strip Clean Water Act protections from 80% of all wetlands and over 5 million miles of streams across the country. We're not talking about tiny, insignificant puddles. These small streams feed their waters – and whatever those waters contain – into our rivers and lakes, and thus into our children’s drinking water. If they are left unprotected, then we – as individuals, families and communities – are at risk.

Wetlands exist in a dozen or more forms across North Carolina, including the mountains, where you might be lucky enough to stumble on one of the last of the mountain bogs; it’s spongy ground home to many endangered and threatened plants and animals. Wetlands sequester carbon, nurture our fisheries, provide wildlife habitat and flood mitigation (particularly during large storm events), and help keep our drinking water clean. This rule change would erase protections from millions of acres of wetlands, leaving them – and we, who depend on them – vulnerable to unchecked destruction.

It's difficult to overstate the devastating impacts this rule change would have on water quality and the increased risk of flooding for all Americans, but North Carolina finds itself in a particularly precarious position. In the past, North Carolina's legislature recognized the critical role wetlands play in our unique environments statewide, establishing protections for them above the minimum required by federal law.

But in 2023, we suffered a one-two punch to those protections, beginning with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that willfully mischaracterized the nature of wetlands in favor of development, and then the baffling decision by our state's legislative leaders to cede regulatory authority and align North Carolina's wetlands definition with the weakened federal standard.

With this decision, the General Assembly abdicated its sworn responsibility to protect our state, and made it impossible for us to exert any autonomy in the name of wetland protections. This alignment, under the newly proposed change to WOTUS, could ravage North Carolina’s wetlands. It would be, quite literally, a disaster.

The good news is that this rule change is not a done deal – yet. We have a chance to stop it. Americans – and North Carolinians – have historically demanded strong protection for our waters and wetlands, and we can do it again.

In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught on fire. Decades of unregulated industrial discharge had created an incongruous catastrophe: The river, the water itself, was ablaze. Americans were outraged. As the country looked on in horror and the environmental damage we had wrought was laid bare, a visceral understanding settled on the collective: Our survival relied directly on the health of the world around us, and that world was literally burning. Something needed to be done, and Americans demanded change. Our government took action, promising ""never again"" – and the Clean Water Act was born.

Now, we must demand of our government that same vigilance, that same common-sense response, that same display of courageous leadership. The EPA is taking public comments on the proposed WOTUS rule change until Jan. 5, and we must speak up forcefully against it.

Once upon a time, we lived in a country that believed in protecting its people by protecting the environment they live in – a country whose leaders listened to scientists, understood the critical importance of wetlands and forests and rivers, and enacted the regulations necessary to protect them.

We can live in that country again. We can again demand that our leaders do their job by protecting us from all threats, foreign and domestic – including the folly of those who would carelessly jeopardize the health of the environment that sustains us all.

In Europe, Tesla’s market share is under siege from both Volkswagen Group and Chinese entrants.","For years, the narrative around Tesla was one of unstoppable momentum. Even when quarters were tough, the trendline pointed up. But the data from November 2025 has delivered a stark reality check: Tesla’s US monthly sales have dropped below the psychological floor of 40,000 units.

According to the latest industry estimates, Tesla moved approximately 39,800 vehicles in the US last month—a figure we haven't seen since the supply-constrained days of January 2022. This represents a stinging 23% year-over-year decline and a massive deceleration from the frantic pace of the third quarter.

This isn’t just a blip; it is the culmination of a ""perfect storm"" involving policy shifts, an aging product lineup, and a brand identity crisis that centers squarely on its CEO. Here is a deep dive into why the EV king is losing its crown in its home market and what it will take to stop the bleeding.

The Tax Credit Hangover and the ""Standard"" Misstep

The immediate catalyst for this drop is clear: economics. The expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025 created a massive demand vacuum. We saw a ""pull-forward"" effect in Q3, where buyers rushed to lock in deals, leaving the Q4 cupboard bare.

Tesla anticipated this. In October, they launched new ""Standard"" range variants of the Model 3 and Model Y, priced roughly $5,000 lower to bridge the gap left by Uncle Sam. On paper, it was a logical move. In practice, it has backfired.

Early data suggests these cheaper variants aren't bringing in new buyers; they are simply cannibalizing sales of the higher-margin Premium trims. As Electrek reported this morning, the demand for these stripped-down models is tepid at best. Buyers are looking at the value proposition—a lower-range, de-contented Tesla without a tax credit versus a flood of feature-rich competitors—and walking away.

The ""Musk Penalty"": When the Brand Becomes Baggage

We cannot discuss Tesla’s 2025 slump without addressing the elephant in the room: Elon Musk.

For a decade, Musk was Tesla’s greatest marketing asset. Today, he is arguably its biggest liability in the US and Europe. His deep involvement in polarizing political campaigns throughout 2024 and 2025, specifically his leadership role in the ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE) and vocal support for far-right figures, has alienated a significant portion of the EV-buying demographic.

The data supports this ""reputational fatigue."" Surveys from Forrester and other firms have noted that the ""sheen"" has worn off the brand. Liberal and centrist buyers, who once viewed owning a Tesla as a badge of environmental honor, now increasingly view it as a political endorsement they aren't willing to make.

Even Musk seems to recognize this strategic error. In a candid moment recently cited by InsideEVs, Musk admitted regrets regarding his political entanglements, noting that the backlash has had tangible effects on the company. When the CEO’s personal brand actively repels 50% of the market, sales slumps are inevitable.

An Aging Fleet in a Fresh Market

Beyond politics and tax credits, there is a fundamental automotive problem: The cars are getting old.

The Model Y is the best-selling car in the world, but it is no longer the newest or most exciting. The Model 3 received a refresh (Highland) back in 2024, but the core platform is aging. Meanwhile, the Cybertruck remains a polarizing, high-priced niche product that has not ramped up to the mass-market volumes needed to offset declines in the sedan and SUV segments.

Contrast this with the competition. Hyundai and Kia have released a blitz of varied, stylish, and high-performing EVs. The US legacy automakers are finally finding their footing with reliable electric trucks and SUVs. Customers walking into showrooms today have choices that didn't exist three years ago. Tesla’s ""minimalist"" interior and tech-first approach are no longer unique selling points; they are just one option among many.

Global Pressure: The Walls Are Closing In

The US sales drop is mirrored by struggles abroad. In Europe, Tesla’s market share is under siege from both Volkswagen Group and Chinese entrants. In China, BYD continues to be the juggernaut.

While Tesla still holds its own in profit margins, its volume growth—the engine of its stock valuation—has stalled. Reports indicate that while global EV sales are up 21% in 2025 driven by Europe and China, the US is stalling, and Tesla is losing its grip on the narrative of being the ""only game in town."" The Chinese OEMs are moving faster, iterating software quicker, and offering luxury interiors at price points Tesla has refused to match.

What Tesla Needs to Do to Turn Around

Is this the end of Tesla? Absolutely not. But it is a severe pivot point. To reverse this slide and climb back above the 50k monthly sales mark in the US, three things need to happen immediately:

Launch the ""Model 2"" (Next-Gen Platform): The time for rumors is over. Tesla needs a true mass-market vehicle priced under $30,000 before incentives. The ""Standard"" Model 3 cuts aren't enough. The market needs a compact, affordable Tesla to compete with the incoming wave of cheap Chinese EVs and affordable options from Kia/Hyundai.

Decouple the Brand from the Man: Tesla needs a stronger, independent marketing voice. The company has historically spent $0 on advertising, relying on Musk’s X (Twitter) account. That strategy is now broken. Tesla needs traditional, high-quality brand advertising that reminds people why the cars are good—safety, Supercharging network, and software—without the political baggage of its CEO.

Refocus on Core Auto Execution: While Robotaxi and Optimus robots are exciting for the stock price long-term, they don't sell cars today. Buyers are frustrated with ""FSD"" promises that haven't fully materialized. Tesla needs to improve service center availability, build quality, and customer support to win back the trust of the ""normie"" car buyer who just wants a reliable vehicle, not a science experiment.

Wrapping Up

November’s drop below 40,000 units is a wake-up call that cannot be ignored. It signals that the era of easy growth for Tesla is officially over. The company is no longer fighting against gas cars; it is fighting against its own aging lineup, a polarized brand image, and a hungry field of competitors.

Tesla has the engineering talent and the cash reserves to fix this. The question is whether leadership is willing to put aside the political distractions and the ""robotaxi or bust"" mentality to do the hard work of being a car company again.

The executive order also seeks to get rid of state standards that protect Americans from water pollution, water depletion, and toxic fossil fuel pollution at data centers.
In response, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Director Pam Mackey-Taylor issued the following statement: “This executive order won’t do anything to decrease costs or protect us.
Utility bills are skyrocketing nationwide due to growing energy demand from data centers and utilities’ reliance on expensive fossil fuels—Iowa doesn’t want to be next.","DES MOINES, Iowa — Last night, Donald Trump issued an executive order seeking to remove state guardrails around artificial intelligence and the infrastructure needed to run AI, including popular state-level initiatives to require data center build transparency, protect privacy, and reduce impacts on electric affordability, air pollution, and water usage. While two new data center campuses are under construction in Cedar Rapids, several other data center projects are underway or have been proposed in Iowa.

The critical state protections at risk—including guardrails like large load tariffs—are in place to ensure everyday Americans are not held liable for data centers’ massive power, water and infrastructure use. Across the country, Sierra Club has helped utilities, regulators, and consumer advocates implement commonsense safeguards like long-term contracts, credit guarantees, and minimum bills that protect affordability for residential customers.

The executive order also seeks to get rid of state standards that protect Americans from water pollution, water depletion, and toxic fossil fuel pollution at data centers. If these protections get rolled back—which Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency is already trying to do—Americans will be exposed to far more pollutants in their air and water.

In response, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Director Pam Mackey-Taylor issued the following statement:

“This executive order won’t do anything to decrease costs or protect us. Here in Iowa, we are fighting for state protections because we all have a right to privacy and transparency, and everyday Iowans should not be held responsible for the massive costs of data centers operated by the likes of Google and Microsoft.

Utility bills are skyrocketing nationwide due to growing energy demand from data centers and utilities’ reliance on expensive fossil fuels—Iowa doesn’t want to be next. We care about keeping our state affordable and shouldn’t have to compete with Big Tech for water. Our state leaders must be doing everything in their power to lower these costs, prioritize affordability, and set safeguards for all of us, rather than bulldozing secret or unvetted projects through communities that are struggling to keep the lights on and keep water drinkable. We need to stand up for an affordable, livable future in Iowa.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-13 11:02:24.537235

Eaton Expands With $50M Investment In Henrico County

In Henrico County, intelligent power management company Eaton will invest more than $50 million to expand its existing manufacturing footprint. Upon completion, the project is expected to create 200 new jobs, bringing Eaton’s local team to nearly 500 employees. The company selected Henrico after assessing multiple locations across the country.

Eaton will open a new campus in Henrico County, more than doubling its regional footprint, to increase manufacturing of critical power distribution technologies to help meet record demand from data center customers. Production at the new 350,000-square-foot Richmond area facility is expected to begin in 2027. The expansion will support production of static transfer switches, power distribution units, and remote power panels — essential technologies that provide reliable, uninterrupted power.

“Eaton is continuing to invest in U.S. manufacturing and is thankful for the strong collaboration and support in Virginia. Our latest manufacturing expansion builds on our history in the region and reflects on the incredible abilities of our longtime local employees,” said Aidan Graham, senior vice president and general manager of Critical Power Solutions at Eaton. “We’re uniquely positioned to help our data center customers meet the rapidly increasing power requirements for AI factories through our expansive manufacturing footprint and our focus on innovation and engineering excellence.”

“Eaton’s latest investment in Henrico is proof that Virginia companies and workers are stepping up to meet our growing power needs,” said Gov. Youngkin. “The only thing better than bringing a new business to Virginia is watching an existing Virginia business expand. By producing even more critical power equipment in the Commonwealth, Eaton is helping drive Virginia’s future and strengthening our competitive edge.”

The VEDP worked with Henrico County to secure the project for Virginia. To support Eaton’s investment, Gov. Youngkin approved a performance-based grant of $1,000,000 from the Virginia Investment Performance Grant.

“Eaton’s decision to expand in Henrico reinforces our reputation as a place where manufacturers truly succeed,” said Henrico EDA Board of Directors Chair Edward S. Whitlock, III. “With this second major investment in the past five years, Eaton is doubling down on its commitment to our community, further strengthening our local workforce, and supporting technologies people rely on every day. We wish them continued success as they grow and create new opportunities here in Henrico.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lscs.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:00:58.286829

In one of the most barbaric episodes during WWII, the Nanjing Massacre took place when Japanese troops captured the then-Chinese capital Nanjing on Dec 13, 1937.
Int'l guests call for remembering history at China's national event honoring Nanjing Massacre victims","The U.S. auto market's push toward electric vehicles (EVs) is hitting major roadblocks as the federal government not only removes purchase incentives but also proposes to relax long-term fuel economy standards.

The global EV market grew by nearly 28 percent in the first half of 2025 compared to a year ago.

While growth in China and Europe appears strong, the U.S. market is facing challenges.

At the end of September, the Trump administration ended the 7,500-dollar tax credit for buying electric vehicles.

Tesla saw a sales bump as people rushed to buy before the credit was eliminated.

But in October, U.S. EV sales fell nearly 50 percent compared with a year earlier.

Dealers sold 74,835 electric vehicles in the U.S. in October, according to Cox Automotive data, representing a 48.9 percent year-over-year decrease.

In a further blow to the EV industry, the Trump administration proposed lowering the average fuel economy standard automakers need to meet by 2031 by nearly 16 miles per gallon, or 6.8 kilometers per liter.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed significantly reducing fuel economy requirements from model years 2022 to 2031, requiring an average of 34.5 miles per gallon by 2031, down from 50.4 miles per gallon (21.4 km per liter).

The big three automakers praised Trump's move that could loosen regulatory pressure on emissions from gasoline-powered cars.

Brian Moody, executive editor for Autotrader and Kelly Blue Book, a U.S. auto evaluation and research company, believes hybrid vehicles should get a boost.

""The less gasoline a car burns, the less it pollutes. And so when you start looking at vehicles like hybrids that get 40, 50, 60 miles per gallon, or a plug-in that can get 75 to 80 miles per gallon, that has to be part of the solution too, because it uses existing infrastructure, and it's what consumers want or what they feel comfortable with,"" he said.

Moody agrees that the Trump administration's policies have hurt EV sales, but they may also force EV makers to improve their products.

""They'll just have to be better. They'll have to be as good as a gasoline-powered car, as good as a hybrid, or better than a diesel. And they can't cost more. So, now consumers will be looking at the total landscape. And when a car has the right combination of value, price, durability and resale value,"" he said.

The state of California has one of the most ambitious green goals in the country, set by Governor Gavin Newsom: to make 100 percent of new cars sold in the state zero-emission vehicles by 2035.

But in June, the Trump administration revoked California's special permission to set its own high vehicle pollution standards, which a dozen other states chose to follow. That leads many to believe California will no longer be able to meet its zero-emission vehicle goal.

Moody pointed out that without major infrastructure investments, the U.S. power grid could not handle the rapid growth of EVs, unlike those in places like China or Europe.

EV sales face challenges due to cancellation of US gov't incentives

International guests who have dedicated their lives to historical truth joined China's 12th national memorial event honoring the hundreds of thousands of victims killed by Japanese troops in the Nanjing Massacre during World War II.

The memorial was held on Saturday at the public square of the Memorial Hall of the Victims in Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province. China's national flag was flown at half-mast in the presence the crowd that included survivors of the massacre, local students, and international guests.

In one of the most barbaric episodes during WWII, the Nanjing Massacre took place when Japanese troops captured the then-Chinese capital Nanjing on Dec 13, 1937. Over the course of six weeks, they proceeded to kill approximately 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers.

Joining the crowd was Christoph Reinhardt, the great-grandson of John Rabe (1882-1950) who was then a representative of German conglomerate Siemens in the war-ravaged Nanjing. During the Nanjing Massacre, Rabe set up an international safety zone with other foreigners, and they together saved the lives of around 250,000 Chinese people between 1937 and 1938 from the Japanese invaders.

Throughout the massacre, Rabe continued to keep a diary. To this day, all his pages remain one of the most comprehensive historical records of the atrocities committed by the Japanese aggressors.

Sayoko Yamauchi, who was also in the crowd of mourners, arrived in Nanjing on Friday from Japan's Osaka to attend Saturday's ceremony, just as she has done almost every year since China designated Dec 13 as the National Memorial Day for the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre in 2014.

Yamauchi's grandfather was one of the Japanese soldiers who invaded Nanjing in January 1938. However, since first setting foot in Nanjing in 1987, she has dedicated herself to uncovering and spreading the truth about Japan's history of aggression and enlightening the Japanese public about their country's wartime atrocities.

In 2014, ahead of China's first National Memorial Day for the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre, Yamauchi, along with 10 other individuals, received an award for her special contribution to the Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders.

By attending the grand memorial event, Reinhardt and Yamauchi both said they hope to convey a message of remembering history and cherishing peace.

""This is my fifth visit to China, and Nanjing, and the third times I visited the ceremony. I have a wish that these survivors survive again and again and again. But my other wish is that the families of the survivors, that they transport the information, the right intention like their ancestors, because anyone must hold a hand (during) this remembering,"" Reinhardt told China Central Television (CCTV) in an interview before the event began on Saturday.

""Our delegation is on its 20th visit to China, coming to Nanjing to express our heartfelt condolences to those who perished 88 years ago, to remember this history, and to reflect on what we can do for a new future. That's why we are here,"" Yamauchi told CCTV on board the bus that took her to a local hotel in Nanjing on Friday evening.

Piedmont Natural Gas says there are several simple steps customers can take now to save money while staying warm.

Piedmont recommends setting thermostats to the lowest comfortable temperature. Using a smart or programmable thermostat can automatically reduce energy use while residents are asleep or away from home.

Taking advantage of sunlight can also help cut costs. Leaving blinds or curtains open during sunny winter days allows natural heat to warm a home. Closing them at night helps prevent heat from escaping through windows.

Routine maintenance is another way to save. Changing air filters regularly helps heating systems run more efficiently, reducing energy use. Dirty filters force systems to work harder, which can drive up costs.

Water heating is another major expense. Piedmont suggests setting water heater temperatures to 120 degrees. Homeowners may also consider on-demand or tankless water heaters, which only heat water when needed.

Sealing drafts can result in significant savings. Caulking, sealing and weather-stripping cracks and openings can reduce heating and cooling costs by as much as 10% to 20%. Ensuring air ducts are properly sealed is also important, as leaks into attics or crawl spaces can significantly increase energy bills.

Adding insulation to ceilings, floors or walls can further reduce energy demand, helping homes stay warmer while lowering monthly costs.

Piedmont Natural Gas says it offers online tools to help customers better understand and manage their natural gas use. Customers can view monthly usage history through their online accounts to spot trends and identify savings opportunities.

Dec 12 (Reuters) – The Trump administration is not expected to finalize 2026 biofuel-blending quotas before the end of this year, according to three sources familiar with the situation, extending uncertainty over a policy closely watched by the rival oil and ‍agricultural sectors.

The slowdown would throw one of the administration’s most consequential energy policy choices into next year and folds the highly anticipated quotas into a growing cluster of interlocking decisions the White House is weighing on biofuels policy.

Together, the moves have raised expectations the administration may look to strike a broader – albeit elusive – agreement between rival oil and agricultural interests.

The Environmental Protection Agency, which administers biofuels policy, has scheduled meetings with ‌stakeholders on the quota rule early next, two sources told Reuters, a ‌sign that the issue will be pushed into next year.

A third source also said the EPA’s decision was unlikely by the end of this year.

The sources spoke about the matter on condition of anonymity.

The EPA told Reuters it was still reviewing public comments on the volume requirements and declined to offer any ​guidance on timing. The volume mandates are administered under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), the federal program that mandates the blending of biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel into the U.S. fuel supply.

A ‍delay in finalizing the mandates is important because fuel ​makers, farmers and commodity traders use them to lock in supply contracts, ​hedge volatile crop and energy markets, and justify investments in new production capacity.

Without clarity on next year’s ‍quotas, companies say they are forced to hold back on deals and delay spending decisions that shape biofuel output and margins.

WHITE HOUSE LOOKS FOR COMMON GROUND

Earlier this year, the EPA proposed raising total renewable fuel requirements for 2026 and 2027, significantly increasing targets for advanced biofuels and biomass-based diesel targets while tightening rules on the use of imported biofuels.

The EPA had initially been expected ‍to finalize the proposal by the end of October.

The quotas have increasingly been swept into a broader set of critical energy and agricultural policy decisions the administration is weighing in the coming weeks – issues ‍that appear separate on their ‍own but could be linked as part of a wider bargain between ​rival oil and agricultural interests, the sources said.

Those issues include legislative efforts ​to ⁠allow year-round sales of gasoline containing higher blends of ethanol, a proposal ‌to penalize imported biofuels and feedstocks, and unresolved questions over whether and how larger refiners could be required to make up for gallons exempted from the RFS.

The White House has held several meetings in recent weeks with oil and agricultural groups in hopes of finding common ground.

Asked whether these issues are becoming increasingly connected, the EPA said it is “committed to strengthening American energy security and supporting American farmers.”

Most Wall Street experts kept their ratings the same after Rivian held its first “Autonomy and AI Day” event.
“RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,” Needham analyst Chris Pierce wrote Friday.
“We attended Rivian’s Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,” Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu wrote Friday.
Electric vehicle sales have slumped since tax credits worth up to $7,500 ended in September.","Rivian Automotive showcased its plans for artificial intelligence and self-driving technology on Thursday, drawing interest from investors even as the electric vehicle company faces tough questions about sales and money.

The stock had a rough day Thursday, dropping 6.1% to finish at $16.43 per share. But things turned around Friday, with shares climbing more than 15% during trading hours.

Most Wall Street experts kept their ratings the same after Rivian held its first “Autonomy and AI Day” event. However, Needham bumped up its price target by 64% to $23 per share, citing the technology reveals and possible future deals where Rivian could license its systems to others. The firm also expects stronger sales next year when the company launches its new midsize R2 SUV.

“RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,” Needham analyst Chris Pierce wrote Friday.

“We attended Rivian’s Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,” Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu wrote Friday. “However, the stock’s weakness seems warranted given the run-up since earnings and lack of a major AI partnership/deal announcement.”

Company unveils custom chip and self-driving plans

At the event, Rivian unveiled several new technologies. These included RAP1, a custom chip built for “physical AI” and self-driving features, along with updated software that acts as the vehicle’s brain, a new AI helper, and a plan for reaching “personal L4″—meaning cars that can drive themselves completely.

The rollout starts later this month with improvements to the hands-free driving system. Rivian plans to keep adding features until vehicles can drive fully on their own in the coming years. The company didn’t say exactly when full self-driving or a robotaxi service might arrive.

Before the event, Rivian shares had jumped more than 30% to $17.50. Even with those gains, the stock remains far below its IPO price of $78 per share in 2021.

Barclays analyst Dan Levy and others said the technology announcements, including the surprise chip reveal, looked good, but Rivian still needs to prove itself in difficult market conditions.

“With RIVN facing a tougher path to breakeven on core vehicle sales alone, we believe with enhanced AV/AI capabilities, RIVN is further paving the path to additional software/service revenues, which would be margin accretive,” Levy wrote Friday. “To be clear, there is certainly a ‘show me’ element for RIVN on its capabilities.”

The company faces several obstacles. Electric vehicle sales have slumped since tax credits worth up to $7,500 ended in September. Support from the Trump administration appears limited, and Rivian has internal problems with products and funding.

Several analysts pointed out that even Tesla, the top EV seller in America, struggles with low adoption of advanced driving features. Rivian is playing catch-up to competitors who have offered such systems for years.

Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe defended the company’s approach, saying building everything in-house, like software, AI, vehicle platforms, and other technology, will make the automaker faster and better than rivals.

“AI is enabling us to create technology and customer experiences at a rate that is completely different from what we’ve seen in the past,” Scaringe said at the event.

This strategy, plus Rivian’s $5.8 billion software partnership with Volkswagen previously reported by Cyptopolitan, has led Wall Street to value Rivian’s software business more than its car manufacturing operation.

Software business valued higher than car sales

Morgan Stanley, which recently downgraded the company, has a $12 price target that breaks down to $7 for software and services and $5 for making and selling vehicles. Some analysts think Rivian could license or sell its new technologies, including chips.

“RIVN is developing a suite of hardware and software offerings to remain competitive in an Auto 2.0 world. However, several risks remain around demand, potentially limiting data capture needed to reach higher levels of autonomy,” Morgan Stanley’s Andrew Percoco wrote Friday, according to CNBC.

Morgan Stanley kept its rating based on concerns about slow adoption of self-driving features, weak EV demand before the R2 launch next year, and a long road to making money.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan agreed: “The advancements enhance Rivian’s product offering but do not address ongoing concerns around liquidity and R2/R3 profitability.”",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rivian.webp,N,,2025-12-13 11:59:59.325767

Troy Balderson’s (R-Ohio) simple Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act underscored the titanic shift in the public psyche over the past decade. Note, it’s neither the “Clean and Reliable Act” nor the “Clean and Affordable Act.” Instead, affordability gets top billing.

This is no accident: Electricity costs are skyrocketing, and affordability is top of mind for Americans. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports average retail revenues per kWh increased in 46 states since last August. Those rates vary significantly from state to state, from a 23% increase in Maine to an 8% decrease in Hawaii.

Looking at American households, residential electricity rates alone rose by 6% over the last three months.

And this isn’t a recent phenomenon. The National Center for Energy Analytics points out that, since the beginning of 2010, the average change in residential electric prices increased by 63%.

What’s driving these double-digit increases? Customers are now experiencing the full impact of decades of divestment from reliable energy generation in favor of intermittent and costly substitutes. For decades, states have engaged in a green-tinted race to the bottom, competing over clean-energy credentials. States have increasingly imposed mandates for renewable energy and insisted that intermittent power from the sun and the wind was the most affordable option.

But in practice, this transition gave us higher rates and a fragile grid. Over the last five years, an alarming number of grid crises have rocked communities nationwide. Major events included the California heat wave in 2020, Winter Storm Uri in Texas in 2021, and Winter Storm Elliot in the mid-Atlantic in 2022. Elliot, though mild compared to other storms, revealed weak points in Pennsylvania’s grid.

Faced with no heat in the depths of winter or air conditioning in the height of summer, it didn’t take long for the consensus on clean and green to shift to reliable and affordable.

But rather than present a realistic correction, several elected leaders opted to scapegoat. Last December, five governors sued PJM Interconnection, claiming the grid operator failed to take steps to bring down prices. However, the prices these governors railed against were the predictable result of supply shortages stemming from their misguided policies, such as enforcing costly climate-related mandates and prematurely closing fossil fuel power plants.

Even blue-state governors have reversed course on the “clean is king” myth. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul approved a new gas pipeline through her state “to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has touted lower costs as a major goal of the latest energy reform bill that ends the state’s moratorium on new nuclear generation. Energy affordability was the leading kitchen-table issue for the recent gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey — though the governors-elect’s policies are suspect.

Clean and green is no longer the consensus as residents begin to question when the rising rates will end.

In Pennsylvania, the pivot away from carbon taxes to spur clean energy was clear when the recent state budget eliminated the years-long effort to enter the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the multistate compact that caps emissions from power producers and sells “allowances” to them.

But the cap-and-trade scheme proved to be politically untenable. Economic forecasts showed that RGGI would increase electricity bills by 30%. Also, even with RGGI, forecasts showed increased carbon emissions across the PJM grid. Despite his best efforts to keep RGGI alive, Gov. Josh Shapiro relented, agreeing to withdraw his appeal to a lower court’s ruling that rightly stated RGGI was an unconstitutional tax–a noteworthy first for any state considering such a compact.

Clean is no longer top of mind, but affordability is. Poll after poll reveals a growing concern among voters about their ability to afford their utility bills.

Fortunately, Pennsylvania can show the way. In fact, the Keystone State pulled off the unimaginable: It cut emissions while also increasing electricity generation. Pennsylvania’s Independent Fiscal Office found that, from 2019 to 2024, the commonwealth removed seven million metric tons of carbon emissions — roughly the same amount cut by its RGGI neighbor to the east, New Jersey. However, during the same period, New Jersey’s electricity generation decreased by 13% while Pennsylvania’s increased by 5%.

With numbers like that, who needs RGGI?

Pennsylvania demonstrates that “affordability” and “clean” aren’t mutually exclusive terms. It is possible to have the best of both worlds.

And that’s what legislation like the Affordable, Reliable, and Clean Energy Security Act accomplishes: It reflects the voters’ desire to balance cost with reliability and environmental stewardship. Lucky for us, that’s precisely what markets can do.

Speight has contributed several articles to Chemical & Engineering News on this topic, including “Why green chemistry makes science safer for everyone” and “Greening Chemistry: Time is a terrible reagent to waste.”

The Speight group’s work is one example of how the W&M community is driving forward sustainability research and working to safeguard the environment. Check out the Year of the Environment webpage to learn more about the university’s initiatives.

Q. What is green chemistry?

A. Green chemistry is less a specific technology and more a guiding philosophy. It’s a thought process of how to make chemistry environmentally safer and more sustainable, while also improving safety for the user. It considers the entire life cycle — from how materials are sourced to how a product is used and ultimately disposed of — with the goal of protecting everyone who interacts with the chemistry along the way. This holistic approach benefits not just the people doing the work, but the broader scientific and commercial communities.

Q. What sparked the genesis of green chemistry?

A. This mindset began gaining traction throughout the 20th century as chemists became more aware of the health and environmental impacts of their work. Earlier laboratory practices were often unsafe by today’s standards — people smoked in labs, mouth-pipetted and handled toxic chemicals with minimal protection. As evidence of harm accumulated, tighter regulations, safer practices and environmental protections followed. Those shifts helped lay the groundwork for what we now call green chemistry.

Q. How is the field of green chemistry developing today?

A. Today’s green chemists are focused on continuing to increase safety for people and the environment while also making chemistry more robust and reliable — meaning reactions are faster, safer and produce higher yields with less waste. Techniques like biocatalysis, photocatalysis and mechanochemistry help us do that by using safer solvents, fewer solvents or none at all.

Q. What are solvents and why can they be problematic?

A. Many chemical reactions are performed in solvents — meaning the reactants are dissolved in a liquid that facilitates the reaction. The issue with solvents is twofold. First, common solvents like chloroform and dimethylformamide can pose health risks to lab workers. Second, they make up a large component of chemical waste and can harm the environment.

Think about having a bowl of cereal. You finish the solid cereal, but the milk left in the bowl has served its purpose and gets poured down the drain. In this analogy, the milk is the solvent — it enabled you to eat the cereal efficiently, but once the “main ingredient” is gone, it’s treated as waste.

The same thing happens in many chemical reactions. You run a reaction, isolate the product and the solvent that enabled the reaction often has no further use, so it gets discarded.

Q. Tell me more about your specialty: What is mechanochemistry and how does it fit into green chemistry?

Instead of mixing chemicals in a solution to perform reactions, mechanochemistry uses mechanical energy, grinding for example, to make bonds or break them apart. Importantly, mechanochemistry uses little to no solvents, which is making it quite a hot field at the moment. But it’s not a new idea. Humanity has been doing mechanical grinding since the dawn of time: Think of grinding herbs to make medicines and spices or crushing berries to make paints for pictograms in caves.

Q. Beyond decreasing solvent use, what are other advantages of mechanochemistry?

A. So disclaimer: Mechanochemistry is not a panacea, but it does allow for some very unique reactivity profiles. For example, this approach can perform some reactions very quickly compared to liquid-based reactions.

If you look at a solution reaction, you’re just kind of swirling things around and hoping that they meet. Sometimes you have to wait a long time for this to happen, especially because a lot of reactions are run very dilute for safety reasons. But in a mechanochemical environment, there’s nothing else there but the reagents themselves. So the chemical compounds are always going to find each other.

And decreasing or eliminating solvents means that mechanochemistry isn’t bound by the rules of solubility. Reagents chemists would normally avoid — because they won’t dissolve or there’s no solvent that drives the reaction you want — suddenly become usable. It creates this open playground we can explore.

Q. How does your mechanochemistry lab differ from a standard chemistry lab?

A. In a standard chemistry lab, you’ll see round-bottom flasks and beakers for mixing solutions. Our lab is fundamentally different; everything we do is a “collision event” or a “grinding event.”

We use a very simple setup: hollow stainless-steel cylinders loaded with chemical reagents and a stainless-steel ball. We then apply force by shaking, spinning or vibrating these cylinders.

This movement isn’t just a way to mix materials; it is the chemistry itself. The specific motion and applied force guide the reaction, offering a powerful way to control outcomes and explore new chemical transformations that aren’t possible in a solution-based environment.

Q. Where do you see the field of green chemistry headed in the next few years?

A. The critical turning point for green chemistry is happening right now, driven by education.

We are training junior scientists to inherently think in an environmentally sustainable way. The future growth of the field lies in equipping the next generation of scientists with the mindset and tools needed to make discoveries in a safer, faster and more conscientious manner.

Q. What’s one way your lab is involved in this movement?

A. The National Science Foundation Center for the Mechanical Control of Chemistry is a multi-institution effort to figure out the fundamental “rules” of mechanochemistry — what makes a reaction work when force is applied, how reactions progress and how we can control them. My students and I are involved in this collaboration in a number of ways, from elucidating fundamental reactivity profiles of early stage mechanochemical reactions to designing 3D printed reaction vessels to creating a database of mechanochemical reactions.

QUOTES OF THE WEEK:

“Today is a win for Hoosiers, and a win for our democracy.”

— Megan Robertson, executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, on the Indiana Senate’s decision not to advance a new gerrymandered congressional map.

“By raising costs with his bans on clean energy, and rolling back dozens of clean air and water protections, Trump is making life less sustainable for regular folks every day.”

— LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis on Trump receiving a medal from the Nobel Sustainability Trust.

“If passed as is, the PERMIT Act will increase pollution in our public waters and strip state and tribal rights to effectively protect their own waters. It will also dramatically increase water bills across the country, particularly in rural communities.”

— Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet speaking on the House floor in opposition of the PERMIT Act.

TOP NEWS IN ENERGY AFFORDABILITY

NEW REPORT OUTLINES HOW WE CAN SLASH ELECTRIC BILLS: A new report from RMI details how the affordability crisis is affecting people’s energy bills across the country, and provides solutions to reduce energy bills for our communities.

RMI TAKE: From the report, “Energy affordability is now a national concern, and many energy experts are saying we’d be lucky to stabilize costs, that cutting bills isn’t even possible. That’s wrong. We can actually cut energy bills a lot.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

HOUSE REPUBLICANS ADVANCE ANTI-ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION: House Republicans advanced a slew of anti-environmental and pro-polluter permitting bills – including the PERMIT Act (H.R. 3898), H.R. 3668, and H.R. 3628 – that would make it easier for expensive dirty energy projects to get approved while sidelining clean, affordable energy, decimating clean water safeguards, and cutting out the public’s voice while doing nothing to lower energy costs.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of Federal Policy Matthew Davis said, “We need to remove the barriers to building cheap and fast-to-deploy clean energy sources that are best positioned to meet rising energy demand, address skyrocketing costs, protect our communities, and ensure access to clean air and water. That starts with stopping the Trump administration from effectively banning clean energy, which threatens half of all new electricity projected to come onto our country’s grid in the next five years. It also means building transmission, speeding up the connection of clean energy projects, modernizing our grid and more.

“But House Republicans are doing none of these things. Instead, they are, once again, prioritizing handouts to their fossil fuel buddies, over helping support the real solutions to address skyrocketing energy costs for hardworking families. Passing this slate of extreme bills would further advantage expensive dirty energy, while kneecapping cheap clean energy and preventing public input on harmful projects that could impact our communities. Our public lands, waters, health and communities are at risk, as these bills could mean more pipelines, coal-fired power plants, and other projects polluting our air, water, and land.”

REP. QUIGLEY TAKE: Representative Mike Quigley, co-chair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition and member of the New Democrats Coalition, said, “This week, House Republicans passed THREE BILLS to raise your electricity costs and abandon cheap, clean energy. Once again, they have chosen to double down on failed policies that have increased electricity prices 13% nationwide since the beginning of Trump’s term.”

ICYMI: STATE NEWS

INDIANA SENATE REJECTS TRUMP’S MID-DECADE REDISTRICTING PUSH: The Indiana state Senate voted 31-19 to reject a Trump-backed push to redraw congressional maps in the state. The proposed maps would have wiped out the only two Democratic districts in Indiana.

ICV TAKE: Indiana Conservation Voters Executive Director Megan Robertson said, “Today is a win for Hoosiers, and a win for our democracy. Lawmakers listened and made the right choice, and we are grateful.

“By halting this unnecessary and deeply unpopular attempt to redraw Indiana’s Congressional maps mid-decade, the Senate affirmed what people across our state have been saying for months: Hoosier leaders need to be focused on issues that affect our everyday lives, not a misguided plan to redraw maps that were just drawn four years ago.”

NEW YORK ESTABLISHES MANDATORY GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM: New York finalized new regulations that require major polluters including factories, power plants, landfills, and fossil fuel companies to measure and report their climate emissions annually. This data will allow state regulators to develop strategies to reduce pollution and track progress and is especially critical since EPA announced it will no longer require greenhouse gas emissions reporting.

NYLCV TAKE: New York LCV said, “We applaud Commissioner Lefton and the Department of Environmental Conservation for finalizing New York’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. With the EPA abandoning their duty to collect this information and protect Americans, this rule could not come at a better time. Reliable, comprehensive emissions data is essential for effective climate action, and this program will provide the information necessary to ensure clean air and healthier communities across New York.

“By identifying the state’s largest emitters, particularly those affecting disadvantaged communities, this rule also strengthens accountability and ensures solutions are directed where they’re needed most through the Clean Air Initiative. NYLCV celebrates this important step forward and will continue to work with state leaders to build a cleaner, healthier, and more equitable future for all New Yorkers.”

MARYLAND GOVERNOR REVERSES COURSE TO FUND CLIMATE CHANGE STUDY: Just months after he originally vetoed a bill to do the same, Governor Wes Moore announced he will approve $500,000 to study the impacts of climate change in Maryland.

SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT TRANSITIONS TO PFAS-FREE GEAR: The San Francisco Fire Department has become the largest fire department in the country to transition to gear that is not made using PFAS, or “forever chemicals.” PFAS are dangerous for human health, and can cause issues ranging from weakened immune system to increased risk for various cancers.

ICYMI: NATIONAL NEWS

SCOTUS POISED TO ROLL BACK 100 YEARS OF PRECEDENT TO GIVE TRUMP MORE POWER: The Supreme Court held oral arguments in the case Trump v. Slaughter this week. The case challenges Trump’s unlawful firing of Democratic Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, but extreme right-wing justices on the Supreme Court seem likely to rule in Trump’s favor, rejecting 100 years of precedent and handing more power to this president to fire independent agency heads.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Director of Judiciary and Democracy Doug Lindner said, “While the Trump administration continues to recklessly grab power from the people, extreme MAGA justices on the Supreme Court appear poised to hand over even more power to the MAGA president at the cost of our freedoms and protections. Giving Trump the green light to fire leaders of independent agencies in defiance of law passed by Congress is anti-constitutional and overturns nearly a hundred years of the Supreme Court’s own precedent. It would endanger our health, safety, freedoms, and protections from corporate abuses at a time when corporate money and power are rising in our politics due to rulings by these same MAGA justices. Preventing abuse of power is critical to ensuring our democracy works for all people across our country. We need judges who will respect the rule of law instead of enabling authoritarianism.”

LCVAF ENDORSES MARK WARNER FOR RE-ELECTION: LCV Action Fund announced its endorsement of Mark Warner for re-election to the Senate representing Virginia. Warner is a dedicated champion for our climate and our democracy.

LCVAF TAKE: LCV Action Fund Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said, “Senator Mark Warner is fighting for a clean energy future and to protect the health and safety of our communities, while the Trump administration continues their attacks on our environment, government institutions and clean energy, raising utility costs for families. It has never been more critical for members of Congress to stand up for our democracy, our rights, and our climate, and LCVAF is all in to support Senator Warner for re-election.”

WARNER TAKE: Senator Mark Warner said, “I’m honored to earn the endorsement of the LCV Action Fund. I’m proud of my work negotiating the bipartisan infrastructure law and enacting the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which are delivering cleaner, more affordable energy. At a time when our country urgently needs more electricity, the Trump administration’s decision to cancel projects funded by these laws is driving costs up for families. I’m committed to working with partners like LCVAF to hold this administration accountable and repair the damage being done to our energy future and our environment.”

FEDERAL JUDGE STRIKES DOWN TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER HALTING WIND ENERGY: A federal judge has ruled that Trump’s executive order halting approvals for all wind energy projects on public lands and waters violates federal law. The order, signed on Trump’s first day in office, has slowed efforts to provide clean, affordable wind energy across the country.

ELM TAKE: Environmental League of Massachusetts Vice President of Policy and Regulatory Affairs Amy Boyd Rabin said, “Yesterday’s victory is a victory for offshore wind and for regulatory certainty. It shows that the federal government can’t make arbitrary rules against certain industries and allows offshore wind to start to get back on track, even within this administration and time period.”

Beijing’s crash-course construction program — both of its power plants and data centers — has contributed to the People’s Republic’s increasingly unsustainable debt burden.
“The Trump Department of Energy is preparing to finance up to 10 nuclear power plants in an effort to usher in a nuclear energy ‘renaissance,’” the Washington Free Beacon reported this week.
In addition, the administration will help finance the development of small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) — transportable nuclear power plants that can generate upwards of 300 megawatts of electricity.
This is a long-term problem, and a handful of nuclear reactors — whenever they eventually come online — will not solve it alone.","The Wall Street Journal has some bad news for the United States. The demand for power is on the rise. It’s expected to keep rising for the foreseeable future. And while China is poised to meet this challenge, America is not.

According to one Goldman Sachs estimate, China will have about “400 gigawatts of spare capacity” by 2030 — more than enough to meet both consumer needs and the demands of the energy-intensive AI sector. By contrast, over the next three years, “U.S. data centers could face an electricity shortfall of 44 gigawatts, the equivalent of New York state’s summertime capacity,” the Journal reports.

Last year, American data centers accounted for 45% of global data-center electricity consumption, according to the International Energy Agency, compared with 25% for China. . . .

Chinese data centers can now secure power for as little as 3 cents a kilowatt-hour using longer-term purchase agreements, according to China’s National Energy Administration. In the U.S., operators in markets such as northern Virginia typically pay 7 to 9 cents a kilowatt-hour, said Michael Rareshide, a partner in charge of the data-center practice at real-estate advisory Site Selection Group.

There may be bumps along the road to Chinese energy dominance. Beijing’s crash-course construction program — both of its power plants and data centers — has contributed to the People’s Republic’s increasingly unsustainable debt burden. Nor is it clear how the AI race will unfold in the long run, or whether the technology will merit the infrastructure investments it is precipitating. Straight-line projections tend to disappoint.

But there can be no doubt that the United States needs more power. With that imperative in mind, the Trump administration is taking steps to reduce the nation’s power deficit.

“The Trump Department of Energy is preparing to finance up to 10 nuclear power plants in an effort to usher in a nuclear energy ‘renaissance,’” the Washington Free Beacon reported this week.

In the outlet’s interview with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the WFB revealed the administration’s plan to provide low-interest financing for a push to build an initial tranche of reactors. That initiative dovetails with the administration’s efforts to get the nation’s mothballed reactors, like Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island and Michigan’s Palisades Nuclear Generating Station, back online.

In addition, the administration will help finance the development of small modular nuclear reactors (SMR) — transportable nuclear power plants that can generate upwards of 300 megawatts of electricity. Indeed, the administration revealed this week that it would provide $800 million to public initiatives and private enterprises designed to jumpstart SMR development.

This is a long-term problem, and a handful of nuclear reactors — whenever they eventually come online — will not solve it alone. But it’s a good start.

Building Wealth Across More Than Just the Market

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Arrived

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

Worthy Bonds

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

IRA Financial

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo Idle Cash

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash.

Are people who do not work in the nuclear power industry similarly happy about this nuclear resurgence?
The also disastrous 2011 nuclear plant meltdown in Fukushima, Japan, was caused by an earthquake’s tsunami flooding the plant.
In 2017 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission released a list of 43 leaks at 65 nuclear power plants, but it includes only tritium leaks.
As the president aggressively abandons renewable energy, both the Ukraine and Japan calamities raise a question: Can one such calamitous nuclear power plant accident wipe out all the savings allegedly cheap nuclear power has brought to the damaged country?","For more than three decades I was the director of grants for a science foundation that funded, in large part, environmental protection. Over that time my attention increasingly turned toward news about huge nuclear power plant disasters, numerous radioactive waste leakages here and abroad, and the lack of a permanent U.S. radioactive-waste storage facility. Through subscribing to many science publications over these decades, I recognized that much of the reporting on these nuclear issues was contradictory, misleading, or incorrect, especially in the lay press — a trend that continues today.

The U.S. currently has 54 nuclear power plants with 94 operating reactors in 28 states. Soon there could be more: President Trump plans to resuscitate the nuclear power industry by building 10 new nuclear reactors, which are scheduled to begin operation as soon as 2030. To make that happen he is speeding up the approval and construction processes while simultaneously laying off more than 2,000 Department of Energy staffers — including Nuclear Security Administration employees.

Oh, and he’s simultaneously decapitating the green energy industry with $22 billion in clean energy projects cancelled just this year, according to an analysis at The Hill.

It all amounts to a huge gamble, not just for the country but for people’s lives — and the planet.

Companies That Profit From Nuclear Power Find Nuclear to Be Safe

Just last summer the U.S. Department of Energy published a long, congratulatory article about Trump’s four executive orders to speed along this process of licensing and launching new reactors. Similar cheerful articles come from the Nuclear Energy Institute, World Nuclear Association, International Atomic Energy Agency, and other organizations that make money from nuclear power.

Are people who do not work in the nuclear power industry similarly happy about this nuclear resurgence? Recent public-opinion surveys by organizations such as Pew Research Center, Bisconti Research, and Gallup suggest that a majority of Americans support nuclear power.

But there’s a problem if you look closer: For example, the Gallup poll asked participants “Do you favor or oppose nuclear energy as one of the ways to provide electricity for the U.S.?” The results yielded a 61% finding that Americans favor nuclear power “strongly” or “somewhat.” What there is no sign of in Gallup’s website discussion about this poll is questioning respondents about whether they ever heard of Chernobyl, Fukushima, or Three Mile Island, or know about the many radioactive leaks from plants in numerous locations in the United States and abroad, or that there’s nowhere to safely store radioactive waste that can remain active for millennia.

In the press coverage of this Gallup poll there was no sign of reporters who actually went beyond the press release summary to the Gallop website to examine the questions asked, find out how the survey audience was selected or how many people were in the survey that claims its results apply countrywide. Nonetheless, the results were found to be worth reporting as fact at Forbes, The Hill, Grist and others, including The Motley Fool.

The Problem Is Everywhere

Today approximately 440 nuclear power reactors operate in 31 countries. An additional 70 are under construction, and more than 110 are in various planning stages around the world, according to the World Nuclear Association.

Megacompanies investing billions in partnerships with nuclear plant owners to accommodate their energy-guzzling AI ambitions include Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

As we’ve seen from the disasters at Three Mile Island, Fukushima and Chernobyl, there’s no such thing as a fail-safe nuclear plant, but these profit-making companies are prepared to take the gamble.

Around the world there have been at least 140 incidents of nuclear power plants malfunctioning in 17 countries, many of them with multiple incidents.

Each plant’s site will react in its own unpredictable way to earthquakes, floods, lightning strikes, wildfires, radioactive leaks, wartime bombs and terrorists, as well as more common human errors of construction and maintenance.

The companies building and operating these plants understand the risk, but as with all gambling, the house always wins. In the United States, reactor owners are limited to $500 million liability for damages by the Price Anderson Act. Retroactive insurance-payment increases can raise coverage, but ultimately the federal government — i.e., the taxpayer — covers damages that rise to hundreds of billions of dollars.

In Japan and Ukraine

To understand the risks, we need to keep the biggest nuclear disasters to date in mind, including the 1986 power plant explosion in Chernobyl, Ukraine, which was caused by errors in the design of the plant’s reactors, as well as errors in their maintenance.

The blast released 400 times more radiation than the Hiroshima bomb, contaminating 40,000 square miles with radioactivity. Residents’ descendants won’t be able to return to their family homes in the 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone for another 24,000 years.

The also disastrous 2011 nuclear plant meltdown in Fukushima, Japan, was caused by an earthquake’s tsunami flooding the plant. Explosions followed the four reactor meltdowns. This should not have come as a surprise: More than three dozen earthquakes have hit Japan since just the turn of the century, and the country registers tremors every day due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire, a subduction zone that causes the constant grinding of two plates in the earth’s mantle.

Estimates of Fukushima’s cleanup costs start at about $540 billion. But when you include the ripple effect throughout Japan’s lands, waters, and economy — along with the 30-40 year duration of the cleanup — costs will soar to 23.4 trillion yen or $1.6 trillion dollars, according to The Japan Times (in an article that was subsequently deleted from its site but remains accessible through Archive.org). An estimated 880 tons of radioactive fuel debris remains at the Fukushima plant and the release of treated, radioactive waters will go on for at least 30 years.

As with Chernobyl, cost estimates do not and cannot accurately include all financial losses that will drift through these economies for decades. While not much information has been published about Chernobyl-caused losses, we do know that Japan does not include indirect economic losses such as the car exports that plummeted after the meltdown, long-term tourism declines, the cost of clearing the ghost towns, years of healthcare expenditures, the cost of contaminated food-fish from untreated radioactive water that leaked into the ocean and soils, and more.

In the United States

The most radioactively polluted site in the world is right here in the United States: the Hanford nuclear site in Washington state, launched in 1944 and still home to 53 million gallons of nuclear waste. Cleanup estimates range from $364 billion to $589 billion with a 2086 completion date, according to a 2025 report from the Department of Energy.

At our 94 operating reactors, the radioactive waste produced is stored right at these facilities, many of which have been known to leak this waste. In 2017 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission released a list of 43 leaks at 65 nuclear power plants, but it includes only tritium leaks. In 2024 the commission put out a second such list in which the number of known tritium leaks dropped to 37 without clear explanation. Since then leaks have been reported state by state, in the absence of a comprehensive list.

What we do know that there is no safe, permanent radioactive-waste storage site in the country — despite the prolonged effort to establish one at Yucca Mountain, Nevada — nor will there ever be a 100% safe way to transport this waste.

Any nuclear reactors operating today — or soon to be built — will become permanent additions to the landscape. It’s not possible to truly “shut down” nuclear reactors after an accident or after they have run their projected life spans. They remain radioactive indefinitely and will always require flawless maintenance of containment domes — assuming we design domes that can function indefinitely. For example, iodine-129 and cesium-135, both produced by nuclear plants and found in nuclear waste, have half-lives of 15.7 million years and 2.3 million years respectively.

While We Build New Nuclear Plants We Waste Energy

Proponents claim we need energy output from these new reactors, but we could achieve the same goals by using energy more efficiently — something we’re still not very good at. Here are some key sources of wasted energy:

Cars and trucks: According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, in 2022 there were a total of 278,870,463 trucks and cars — mostly occupied by a single individual — registered to drivers. Most of these vehicles are bigger and heavier than those in other parts of the world, thus consume more energy according to The Economist.

Electricity: Lights that burn all night, including in empty buildings, are a well-known phenomenon in this country and the problem is increasing at the rate of almost 10% a year. This can be traced to a number of problems: Indifference and ignorance are high on the list, as are inadequate policy and insufficient coverage in the press about the damage done.

Food: The Food and Drug Administration estimates that between 30% and 40% of our food supply becomes waste. In 2010 FDA research found that 133 billion pounds of food worth $161 billion turned into garbage.

Artificial intelligence: AI is extremely energy consuming, and our skyrocketing commitment to it will send energy demand soaring. Power consumption for AI data centers here is anticipated to amount to almost half of the growth in electricity demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. The IEA finds that “Driven by AI use, the US economy is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined…”

Trump Betrumps

As Trump plans to reboot the nuclear power industry, relaunching the Indian Point plant is on the agenda. It shut down in 2021 after 59 years in operation. From 1973 to 2016 there were at least 14 accidents — radioactive leaks, fire, and equipment failures — as well as numerous incidents of sending contaminated water into the Hudson River. This is the plant that’s 25 miles from New York City. If a disaster were to strike Indian Point, there is no safe way to evacuate the city’s millions of residents and the millions more that live nearby.

The Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, about 170 miles from Manhattan, is also set to reboot as early as 2027. The plant’s 1979 meltdown, caused in large part by human error, brought about the shutdown of one of its two reactors just three months after it launched. Two million people were exposed to low-level radiation — insufficient to harm them, due only to good luck. The cleanup took from 1979 to 1993 and cost $2 billion.

In his enthusiasm for nuclear power, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from participation in the United Nation’s international Paris Agreement climate accord on the first day of his second term. With this move he retracted our promised $4 billion contribution to that effort. Trump’s EPA also halted $7 billion in federal grants for solar panels allocated to low- and moderate-income families.

Meanwhile Trump makes frequent claims that climate change is a “hoax.” At the recent U.N. General Assembly convening, in a speech before 150 world leaders, he called the wind energy and solar power alternatives to nuclear a “scam” and “con job.”

His alternatives are anything but clean: Trump has issued numerous executive orders to expedite oil (which can cause spills), natural gas (well known for its explosions), and coal mining (a major cause of air pollution).

As the president aggressively abandons renewable energy, both the Ukraine and Japan calamities raise a question: Can one such calamitous nuclear power plant accident wipe out all the savings allegedly cheap nuclear power has brought to the damaged country?

In light of the decades-long — and for some elements millennia long — recuperation process, the question is unanswered.

And unanswerable.

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc.
Source: XCF Global, Inc.","XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX); Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""); and DevvStream Corp. (""DevvStream"") (Nasdaq:DEVS) (together ""the parties"") today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform and Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, said:

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Assistant Secretary Tim Walsh welcomed U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to the Hanford Site last week.

“I was honored to show U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright the tremendous progress on full display at Hanford,” Assistant Secretary Walsh said. “I congratulate Ray Geimer and his team, our contractor partners and hardworking craftworkers for advancing our critical missions at Hanford. I look forward to building relationships across Hanford, regulators, Congress, tribes, and the community to advance cleanup solutions, unleash economic vitality and unlock potential in the Tri-Cities.”

Secretary Wright and Assistant Secretary Walsh participated in a comprehensive tour of the Direct-Feed Low-Activity (DFLAW) system that has turned over 36,000 gallons of tank waste into glass since October. Tour stops included the Waste Treatment Plant, the Tank Side Cesium Removal System and the tank farms. Secretary Wright and Assistant Secretary Walsh were also briefed on solutions to accelerate progress including opportunities for solidifying portions of Hanford tank waste into grout in parallel to ongoing DFLAW operations.

Additional briefings focused on work at the highly contaminated 324 Building that supported research on radioactive materials, the transfer of radioactive capsules from the Waste Encapsulation Facility to safer dry storage, and other remediation priorities as well as land and facilities ripe for potential beneficial reuse to support economic vitality and American energy dominance.",https://ladailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/favicon_30.ico,N,,2025-12-12 21:59:44.011796

“Canadians want support to transition to electric vehicles, not unrealistic government mandates that can’t be met,” said Brian Kingston, CVMA president and CEO, in a statement.
The federal mandate requires ZEVs to make up 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales in 2026, 60 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035.

Should the mandate hold, dealers will be navigating a market where EV expectations rise faster than consumer confidence.","A new national survey suggests the federal zero-emissions vehicle mandate is struggling to win over Canadians, raising questions about how quickly consumers are prepared to shift to electric vehicles as sales targets tighten.

The Leger poll, commissioned by the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association (CVMA), Global Automakers of Canada (GAC) and the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA), found that only 31 per cent of respondents support the policy, while nearly half (46 per cent) would like to see it scaled back or scrapped.

Industry leaders say the findings reflect a gap between government ambitions and consumer readiness. “Canadians want support to transition to electric vehicles, not unrealistic government mandates that can’t be met,” said Brian Kingston, CVMA president and CEO, in a statement.

The federal mandate requires ZEVs to make up 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicle sales in 2026, 60 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Plug-in hybrids, battery-electric vehicles and fuel-cell models all qualify.

The results of the poll arrive at a moment of cooling momentum for EV sales. ZEVs represented 10.2 per cent of new-vehicle sales in September, down 43.3 per cent from a year earlier.

The poll also suggests that vehicle availability at dealerships, once a prominent concern, is no longer viewed as a major barrier, with only 11 per cent citing it. Instead, Canadians continue to flag affordability, driving range and charging access as the factors limiting adoption.

The persistence of these concerns since 2021 underscores how little progress has been made on core infrastructure and cost challenges.

Why it matters: Nissan is betting on U.S.-built hybrids to compete with Toyota while tariffs reshape the industry.

The Details

Meunier took over as Americas chairman in January 2025 during a company-wide crisis that included 9,000 job cuts and a failed merger with Honda.

The company’s U.S. market share has inched up from 4% to 5% this year by tailoring production to dealer demand rather than bulk output.

Nissan plans to bring its e-Power hybrid technology to the U.S. in 2026 with the Rogue, initially importing from Japan before ramping up Tennessee production in 2027.

Meunier met with U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn last week to discuss accelerating e-Power localization at the Decherd engine plant, according to The Tennessean.

“We need to start selling cars, make money, take care of the customer, forget the rest,” Meunier said. “Cut the bureaucracy, cut the things that don’t add value.”

By the Numbers

FY 2024-25 Operating Loss: 215.9 billion yen ($1.39 billion)

U.S. Market Share: 5% (up from 4%)

Pre-Billing Rate: 60% (up from 30% six months ago)

Rogue Sales Growth (Jul-Sep): +8.9% year-over-year

Pathfinder Sales Growth: +33.2%

Frontier Sales Growth: +19.2%

e-Power Rogue Production Goal (2027): 300,000 units annually in Smyrna

EVXL’s Take

Meunier’s back-to-basics approach shows early traction, but Nissan remains years behind Toyota on hybrids. While Toyota opened its $14 billion North Carolina battery plant last month and doubled down on the hybrid strategy it never abandoned, Nissan is scrambling to bring e-Power technology that debuted in Japan back in 2016. The timing is brutal: Nissan missed the hybrid boom that Toyota rode to record profits.

Tariffs are forcing Nissan’s hand. By localizing e-Power production in Tennessee, Meunier can sidestep import duties while positioning the company for a market that has decisively shifted away from pure EVs. The question is whether Nissan can execute fast enough. As we documented when Nissan posted its record $5.26 billion loss earlier this year, the company’s financial runway is shrinking.

The sweeping legislation signed into law on July 4 phases out the credit starting in 2031 and eliminates it in 2034, removing what had been a permanent incentive under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

The change is forcing companies to reassess project viability and make difficult operational decisions as they compete with lower-cost foreign suppliers, particularly from China and Russia. The 45X credit provides up to 10% of production costs for US-based producers of critical minerals including cobalt, graphite, palladium and platinum — materials essential for renewable energy infrastructure, advanced electronics and defense systems.

Removing the 45X tax credit ""was a huge hit to us,"" said Heather McDowell, senior vice president and general counsel for legal and external affairs, Americas, at Sibanye Stillwater Ltd. ""Having that tax credit indefinitely is really what we expected.""

The company, whose Montana operations include the only US-based palladium, platinum and rhodium mine, has cut approximately 40% of its workforce in recent months, McDowell said.

Operational impacts

Matthew Lengerich, president and executive general manager at Jervois Mining USA Ltd., said his company expanded its Finland project into the US specifically because of the 45X tax credit and other incentives. Jervois operates the only US-based cobalt mine in Idaho, though it has faced operational challenges due to price volatility.

""The project doesn't work without that tax credit,"" Lengerich said, highlighting the fundamental role the incentive played in making US critical mineral projects economically viable.

The discussion reflects broader challenges facing the US critical minerals sector as it attempts to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers while competing against state-subsidized operations. Price support mechanisms are a topic of increasing debate among business leaders and policymakers, with some arguing that Western projects cannot survive without effective government backing.

Perhaps the most obvious of those other diminishing safety nets is groundwater. Data on groundwater reserves throughout the basin is spotty at best. One approximation of a truly regional assessment comes from a creative use of satellite-based tools—namely NASA’s GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) system that can detect tiny changes in gravitational forces associated with the fluctuating mass of aquifers losing (or gaining) storage. Those findings paint a truly disturbing picture. Despite the familiar (and troubling) images of bathtub rings emerging at Mead and Powell, researchers using GRACE data now estimate that, from 2002 to 2024, nearly two-thirds of storage—both surface and groundwater—lost in the Colorado River Basin actually came from groundwater depletions.2 Significant groundwater losses have occurred throughout the basin, but the problem is particularly acute in Arizona and is likely to accelerate as shortages in Central Arizona Project (CAP) deliveries are likely offset by groundwater pumping—an ironic outcome given that CAP was originally proposed as the solution to groundwater mining in the region. Simply shifting unsustainable surface water uses to unsustainable groundwater uses does nothing to address the core mismatch of supplies and demands.

A very different and multi-faceted trend undercutting the regional safety nets is happening within the federal government, where federal agencies, programs and science programs are being systematically dismantled under the guise of “efficiency.” It’s hard to understate the significance of these actions, as it is the federal government that, presumably, has the scope, mandate and resources to oversee the entirety of the River and the full diversity of its roles and values. Interior Department agencies in 2025, like much of the overall federal bureaucracy, have been tasked to achieve significant staffing reductions, and to eliminate (or significantly scale back) spending on key water conservation programs—including programs under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and WaterSMART.3

Additionally, agencies across the federal landscape have mobilized to coerce and shut down climate-related science and scientists, despite the nearly universal acknowledgment among water managers of the central role of climate change in the unfolding crisis.4 Collectively these efforts constitute a systematic effort to discredit and hide the primary cause of the broken water budget, while sabotaging the most effective coping mechanisms available. As members of the research community, the Colorado River Research Group (CRRG)unfortunately has a front-row seat to this culling of the people and programs essential to long-term data collection and analysis. It defies logic, and is dangerous.

Unfortunately, hostility toward the people and programs essential to responding to the Colorado River crisis is not the full extent of federal obstruction. One largely unappreciated threat to the water budget resulting from federal policy shifts comes from efforts to “re-carbonize” (and accelerate) water-intensive energy generation, in part to meet the demands of AI, a particularly troubling trend given that the previous emphasis on renewable energy generation and enhanced energy conservation was one of the few positive trends working to repair the regional water budget.5 Attempts to weaken or dismantle bedrock environmental laws, such as NEPA and the Endangered Species Act, are an additional wildcard likely to inflict irreparable harm on already strained species and ecosystems.6

Given the turmoil at the federal level, it’s tempting to absolve the States for stubbornly clinging to a policy making system reliant on 7-state dealmaking, but that would ignore the reality that the governance of the river has been a problem for decades. A seemingly never-ending series of crisis-inspired negotiations, held in largely secretive forums without direct tribal involvement or tools for meaningful public or scientific engagement, is an uninspired way to manage and protect the economic, cultural and environmental heart of the American Southwest. The river is too big and too important to govern in such an ad hoc and primitive manner. [ed. emphasis mine]

That this approach mostly ”worked” to keep deliveries flowing for so long—except, of course, for the tribes and the environment—rested, in part, on the accepted norm that decisions would emerge collaboratively from the States and would not spill over to the federal courts. But even that governance safety net is eroding, as the States seem to be increasingly resigned—and almost “comfortable”—with the notion that the resolution of existing conflicts may not emerge from a negotiated 7-state agreement. For those parties and viewpoints that have historically been left out of the state-dominated processes and the resulting agreements, then maybe this prospect is welcome. But all would concede that would be a stunning outcome with ramifications that are difficult to predict.

Ever since the Arizona v. California experience, the use of litigation to resolve interstate (and/or interbasin) conflicts in the basin has been a third rail issue, and for very good reasons. As shown by the basin’s earlier foray into Supreme Court action, the process would undoubtedly be lengthy, expensive, and likely to create as many issues and questions as it resolves. It certainly wouldn’t reduce risk, as the states, and the water management community more broadly, would lose control over the process of managing the shared resource. In fact, judicial intervention might be the impetus to trigger yet another traditionally feared decision pathway to be invoked—a Congressional rewrite of river allocation and management—either before or after the litigation concludes. In this setting, the extreme disparity in political influence—as measured by the number of Congressional representatives—between the Upper and Lower Basin is an obvious concern, as is the realization that congressional involvement means the future of the Colorado now becomes a national issue and, potentially, a bargaining chip to be used in the political logrolling necessary to enact legislation in dozens of otherwise unrelated areas.

In Colorado, as in most of the West, older water rights take priority over newer ones when there’s not enough water to satisfy everyone’s claims. On the Colorado River, the Shoshone Hydropower rights limit the amount of water that can be taken out of the river upstream by junior rights that divert water from the river’s headwaters through tunnels under the Continental Divide to cities and farms on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. The new deal to enable the Shoshone rights to be used for environmental flows would preserve those limitations on transmountain diversions in perpetuity.

Upstream from the power plant, near the ranching town of Kremmling, Colorado, the river carries less than half the water it would without the existing transmountain diversions. This stresses fish populations and the iconic cottonwood groves that line the river. The Shoshone rights downstream prevent these diversions from being even larger. Because the power plant returns all the water it uses to the river without consuming it, the water continues to provide benefits downstream from the plant to rafters, farms, cities and four species of endangered fish that exist only in the Colorado River Basin. Securing these flows for the future is particularly important as climate change continues to reduce the river’s flow, which has already declined by roughly 20% over the past two decades.

The people cheering in the hearing room represented cities, towns, counties and irrigation districts from up and down the Colorado River. Their entities had pledged ratepayer and taxpayer dollars to help secure the rights in the complex transaction spearheaded by the Colorado River Water Conservation District. Environmental organizations, including American Rivers, Audubon, Trout Unlimited and Western Resource Advocates, were also parties to the hearing and supportive of the deal, but were vastly outnumbered.

The Coloradans cheering in that room were there because their constituents’ livelihoods, clean drinking water and quality of life depend on a living Colorado River.

For the first time ever, and after decades of failure, the world’s countries agreed to a single international climate treaty — one that applied to developed and developing countries alike.

Since then, international climate diplomacy has played out on what is, more or less, the Paris Agreement’s calendar. The quasi-quinquennial rhythm of countries setting goals, reviewing them, and then making new ones has held since 2015. A global pandemic has killed millions of people; Russia has invaded Ukraine; coups and revolutions have begun and ended — and the United States has joined and left and rejoined the treaty, then left again — yet its basic framework has remained.

Perhaps you can tell: I am not among those who believe that the treaty has been a failure, although it would be difficult — in this politically arid moment — to call it a complete success. Yet the ensuing decade has seen real progress in limiting global temperature rise. When negotiators gathered to finalize the agreement, it seemed likely that global average temperatures could rise by 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, as compared to their pre-industrial level. Today, a rise from 2.5 to 3 degrees Celsius seems more likely.

And for a document that is often described as non-binding, or even as hortatory, Paris has had a surprisingly material influence on global politics in the ensuing years. During the negotiations, the small-island states — the three dozen or so countries most affected by near-term sea-level rise — successfully got the final text to recognize a “stretch goal” of limiting warming to just 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. They also tasked the United Nations’ advisory scientific body to prepare a special report on the virtues of avoiding 1.5 degrees of warming. When that report was released in 2018, it catalyzed a new wave of global climate action, spawning the European Green Deal — and eventually the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

Yet there is at least one way that Paris did not go as imagined.

Cast your mind back to Paris 10 years ago, right as diplomats filed in and began to applaud the final text’s completion. “This is a tremendous victory for all of our citizens — not for any one country or any one bloc, but for everybody here who has worked so hard to bring us across the finish line,” John Kerry, then the U.S. secretary of state, declared to his fellow diplomats.

It was a strange kind of victory. After decades in which western liberals had attempted to secure a globally binding climate treaty — an agreement that would limit each country’s greenhouse gas emissions — the world finally won a non-binding alternative. Under the Paris Agreement, each country would pledge to cut its emissions by as much as it could manage. Countries would then meet regularly to review these pledges, encourage each other to get more ambitious, and gradually ratchet the world into a lower-carbon future.

Kerry was reasonably direct about how such a mechanism would work: capital markets. “We are sending literally a critical message to the global marketplace,” he said. “Many of us here know that it won’t be governments that actually make the decision or find the product, the new technology, the saving grace of this challenge. It will be the genius of the American spirit.”

He was right, in a way: The Paris Agreement did send a signal to the global marketplace— and it did so in part because governments did shape policy and investment outcomes, not because they resisted doing so. But it did not reveal the genius of the American spirit, per se.

In the years running up to and following the Paris Agreement, China rolled out a series of important policies to boost its new energy sectors — a roadmap encouraging “new energy vehicle” sales in 2012, billions of consumer subsidies beginning in 2014, and a domestic content mandate for electric-vehicle batteries in 2015. These programs — along with canny decisions made by Chinese entrepreneurs and engineers, and no small amount of demand pull from companies and policies in the West — have transformed the world’s approach to decarbonization. They have begun to change even what decarbonization means — in the United States, in the western democracies, and around the world.

Ten years ago, Kerry could assume that any eventual solution to climate change would be geopolitically neutral, if not advantageous to the United States. But in 2025, to a degree that commentators still hesitate to describe, the climate story has become the China story. Across a range of sectors, how a country approaches its near-term decarbonization goals depends on how it understands and relates to the Chinese government and Chinese companies.

Consider the power sector, which generates just under a third of all greenhouse gas emissions globally. For many countries, the best way to cut carbon pollution — and to add more power generation to the grid — will be to build new utility-scale solar and battery projects. That will all but require working with Chinese firms, which dominate 80% of the solar supply chain. (They command up to 98% market share for some pieces of equipment, according to the International Energy Agency.)

It is much the same story in the grid-scale battery industry. China produces more than three-quarters of the world’s batteries, and it refines most of the minerals that go into those batteries. Its batteries are at least 20% cheaper than those made in Europe or North America. Most of the world’s top battery firms are Chinese — in part because they have more experience than anyone else; the country’s firms have manufactured 70% of all lithium-ion batteries ever produced. Nearly two dozen countries have bought at least $500 million in Chinese-made batteries this year, according to the think tank Ember.

What if a country wants to build wind turbines, not batteries? Even then, it will have to work to buy non-Chinese products. Although European and American firms have long led among turbine makers, six of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers are now in mainland China, according to BloombergNEF. And for the first time since analysts’ rankings began in 2013, none of the world’s top three turbine makers are North American or European.

Transportation generates another 13% of global climate emissions. If a country wants to tackle that sector, then it will find itself (again) working with China — which made more than 70% of the world’s EVs in 2024. Thanks to the country’s sprawling battery and electronics-making ecosystem, its home-grown automakers — BYD, Geely, Xiaomi, and others — can produce more affordable, innovative, and desirable EVs at greater scale and at lower cost than automakers anywhere else. “The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry,” Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, said recently. As the scholar Ilaria Mazzocco put it in a recent report: “Chinese companies are ubiquitous in the value chain for EVs and battery components, meaning that for most countries, climate policy is now at least in part linked to policy toward China, and more specifically trade with China.”

That insight — that climate policy is now linked to policy toward China — will apply more and more, even when countries wish to tackle the remaining third of emissions that come from energy-related sources. Earlier this year, China approved a plan to build roughly 100 low-carbon industrial parks by 2030, where its firms will develop new ways to capture carbon, make steel, and refine chemicals without carbon pollution. (The Trump administration revoked funding for similar low-carbon projects in the U.S. earlier this year.) At the same time, China is building more conventional nuclear reactors than the rest of the world combined, and it may be pulling ahead of the United States in the race to develop commercial fusion.

This wasn’t inevitable. It happened because Chinese politicians, executives, and engineers decided to make it happen — choices owing as much to the government’s focus on energy security as to its concern for the global environmental commons. But it was also the result of American business leaders and politicians squandering this country’s leadership in climate technologies — and especially the result of choices made by Trump administration officials, who at nearly every opportunity have regarded batteries and electric vehicles as a technological sideshow to the more profitable oil and gas sector.

It was the Trump administration, after all, that licensed and then eventually gave U.S.-funded research on flow batteries to a Chinese company in 2017. It was the Trump administration that gutted fuel economy and clean car rules in 2018 and 2019, setting the American car industry back compared to its Chinese and European competitors. And it was the Trump administration and congressional Republicans that killed electric vehicle tax credits earlier this year, further choking off investment.

For progressives, this all might suggest a pleasant parable: China embraced the energy transition, and America didn’t, and now America is paying for it. Nowadays, commentators often invoke China’s clean energy dominance to inspire awe at its accomplishments. And how can you not, in truth, be impressed? China’s industrial miracle — its move to the frontier of global technological development — is the most important story of the past quarter century. The scale of the Chinese consumer market and the success of Chinese industrial policy (or, at least, its success so far) has wrenched world history in new directions. And Chinese companies have done humanity a great service by bringing down the cost of solar panels, batteries, and EVs on the supply side, even if they did so at first with demand-side assistance from policies in California or Europe.

But climate advocates in North America and Europe cannot be completely sanguine about what this development means globally. For environmentalists and other western liberals who have worked in decarbonization for decades, it will in particular require some rhetorical and political adjustment. We cannot pretend that we are playing by the 1990s’ rules, nor that environmental activism is but one part of a post-1970s progressive coalition, which is free to make demands and ignore inconvenient trade-offs. Basic questions of decarbonization policy now have patent geopolitical significance, which environmental groups attempt to side-step at their own peril.

Yet it isn’t only Americans or Europeans who must answer these questions. China’s dominance of decarbonization technology means that for the time being, every country on Earth must address this dynamic. When the scholar Mazzocco looked at how six countries around the world are approaching Chinese EVs, she found an uneven landscape, she told me on a recent podcast. Costa Rica, which has long embraced climate policy, has welcomed Chinese-made EVs; Brazil opened its doors to them but has now begun to close it.

Most major countries have some form of domestic automaking industry; no country will be able to sit back and passively allow Chinese exports to drive their local automakers out of business. At the same time, China’s manufacturing primacy is already making conventional export-driven growth less attractive for countries. And that will only be the beginning of the dilemmas to come. As long as going green requires buying and integrating Chinese technologies into critical infrastructure, environmental policymakers will be wagering decarbonization’s success on some of the world’s highest stakes geopolitical bets.

Environmentalists have long insisted climate change is a national security issue, but are we ready to think and act like it is? Do Western anxieties about a large and globalized war — either a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a Russian invasion of the EU, or both — reflect a reasonable response to a real and growing menace, or an elite panic driven by our declining economic primacy? If China were to invade Taiwan, what would that mean for climate and energy policy — not only in the West, but around the world? Would American or European environmentalists even get a vote on that question — and if they do, how would they balance emissions reduction against other goals? If the unthinkable happens, we will all be called to account.

A decade ago, I remember watching the live stream of the world’s diplomats applauding their own success in Paris and realizing that I would be seeing that video in documentaries and news reels for the rest of my life. How will I see it then? I wondered. Would it strike me as the naivete of a simpler time, an era when liberal internationalism still seemed possible? Or would it really reflect a turning point, the moment when the world took the climate challenge seriously, pragmatically, and began to decarbonize in earnest? A decade later, I still don’t know. Perhaps the answer is both.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjM0NTA4Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDM4OTY5OX0.eedqTiD2E1YHyRgnRHgQq28I74lf7ahVhGlpcoSeNEM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:37.545558

The new capital, approved under a Hawai‘i Public Utilities Commission order, will enable more households, nonprofits, and small businesses in the Hawaiian Electric service area to install renewable energy systems and efficiency upgrades. The commission’s order recognizes the urgency of expanding affordable financing options as federal tax credit rules evolve and national policy changes reshape the solar market.

This additional funding comes at a critical time. federal Solar for All funds are tied up in litigation, and the federal solar Investment tax credit for homeowner-owned systems is set to expire Dec. 31. Although commercial tax credits remain available through 2027, many projects face shortened timelines due to new federal legislation.

Authority Executive Director Gwen Yamamoto-Lau said the agency is moving quickly to fill that gap for local customers.

“We are thrilled with the PUC’s approval to modify Order No. 34930, allowing us to make $18 million in additional loan capital immediately available,” Yamamoto-Lau said. “With Hawai‘i’s high electricity costs, this support will help nonprofits, small businesses, and low- and moderate-income households reduce their energy burden and improve resiliency.”

Through the authority’s Green Energy Money $aver on-bill repayment program, customers can finance clean energy improvements — including solar photovoltaic systems, battery storage, solar water heaters, heat pump water heaters, and commercial energy-efficiency retrofits — without the need for traditional tax incentives. Loan eligibility and projected savings are calculated independently of federal tax credits.

The GEMS program, established by Act 211 (2013), was designed to make clean energy financing more inclusive by providing below-market rates and flexible loan terms for those who may not qualify for conventional financing. These investments are expected to advance Hawai‘i’s target of 100% clean energy by 2045 while driving job growth and innovation in the local energy economy.

The rare joint effort between the factions — factions that fought tooth-and-nail during the 2025 legislative session over labor’s attempt to make it easier for Colorado workers to unionize and take union negotiating fees directly from paychecks — was meant to call attention to the range of leaders concerned about this issue. In six panel discussions at the north Denver headquarters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union, speakers detailed rising costs linked to environmental restrictions, lost job opportunities and a declining business atmosphere in the state.

If Black Hills Energy were forced to implement Colorado’s newly approved Clean Heat Plan immediately, it would increase customers’ bills by $215 per month, said Maria Garduna, sustainability and climate senior manager for the utility. Meanwhile, the state’s focus on boosting renewable energy sources is limiting job opportunities and making it harder to attract jobs in fields like manufacturing, said Gary Arnold, business manager for the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters.

“We came together out of a simple idea — Colorado can meet the state’s climate and energy goals while balancing that with affordability. Our mission is to bring practical, real-world solutions to those goals,” said Ray Rivera, coalition director for the newly formed Colorado Energy Crossroads. “The challenges we’re facing aren’t theoretical. They’re here now. They’re real. This is happening.”

State has passed numerous laws to cut emissions

Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic legislators have worked since 2019 to reduce emissions through new mandates, pointing repeatedly to the northern Front Range’s noncompliance with federal ozone standards. Air pollution leads to increased respiratory and cardiovascular afflictions and has left leaders in some communities near industrial sites complaining they are subject to constant dirty air that triggers asthma attacks and forces residents to stay inside.

Since the Democratic governor took office six years ago, the state has enacted emissions-reduction rules on the oil-and-gas industry, manufacturing sites, large commercial buildings and even users of gas-powered lawn-and-garden equipment. Several representatives of environmental groups and Polis’ administration, as well as legislators who supported the new laws, attended Friday’s event but did not speak on any panels.

Over that time, however, it also has gotten prohibitively expensive to live and do business in Colorado and has led to the loss of numerous job-expansion opportunities that the state used to win, several business leaders on the panels said. Colorado Chamber of Commerce President/CEO Loren Furman noted Colorado has the third-highest housing costs, the fifth-highest cost of living and the 13th-highest cost of doing business. according to sources like CNBC and U.S. News & World Report — in no small part due to it having the 6th-most regulations nationally.

Limiting sources of energy a shared problem for groups

The Clean Heat Plan, a proposal approved last week by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission that calls for a 41% reduction in home-heating emissions in 10 years and 100% electrification of homes by 2050, took significant criticism from panel participants. Garduna noted natural gas cost four times less in 2024 than a similar amount of electricity, and Sara Espinoza Blackhurst, president/CEO of the Action 22 group representing union-heavy southeast Colorado, said the decision shows a “disregard for labor.”

Melissa Shatler — assistant director of labor outreach and workforce equity for Climate Jobs, an organization trying to bridge the gap between unions and environmental activists — said such decisions show the need for labor representatives on deliberative panels. Dan Hendricks, apprenticeship training director for the Joint Electrical Apprenticeship and Training Committee, decried the state’s focus on getting people trained to install solar panels or build windmills and said it should adopt an “all-of-the-above” approach to preparing Coloradans to work in fields using both traditional and renewable energy.

“If you’re going to train a wind tech, shame on you. If you’re going to train a solar tech, shame on you. We need to train electricians,” said Hendricks, a longtime labor leader. “You need an agile, well-trained workforce that can work anywhere, not just one pigeonholed job that you believe you need right now.”

Further emissions-reduction mandates under consideration

Friday’s event came two days after Polis released a report arguing that the state needs to streamline its workforce-development programs under one new state agency, in order to give students and employers easier access to a wide range of job-training programs.

And the event comes as some Democratic legislators have discussed running a bill in 2026 that would speed up by 10 years, to 2040, the deadline for utilities to get to net-zero carbon emissions. The status of the bill is uncertain, as it’s received significant pushback from utility, business and labor leaders — largely the same coalition that came together at IBEW HQ — because of its costs and potential impacts on jobs of gasline-maintenance workers and others.

A survey commissioned by the coalition and done by Searchlight Research and Impact Research, found that state residents generally backed the current goals but pulled back on support when asked about speeding up the deadline and potentially increasing utility costs. The same poll found that two-thirds of respondents support a mix of energy that involves natural gas, wind, solar, geothermal and nascent nuclear resources rather than a renewable-energy-only approach and that 54% of likely voters said they would be less likely to support a candidate wanting to speed up the 2050 deadline.

Coalition to keep raising voices on energy issues

“The primacy of economic concerns, the affordability concerns … was one of my most important takeaways,” Impact Research partner Jeff Liszt said.

Coalition members didn’t announce a next step following the Friday summit but said they are planning to continue to press the message that Colorado needs to consider affordability, as well as resiliency of its electric grid, as it considers climate actions. And they hope that by bringing together partners who don’t always see eye to eye, Polis and other leaders will consider the message as one that comes from a wide swath of people.

“What we heard today is that Coloradans have a deep focus and a bent to doing the right thing environmentally — but at the same time, a big focus on affordability,” said Dave Davia, president/CEO of business group Colorado Concern.",https://tsscolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Energy-Summit-Davia-Panel-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:45.332334

The state Legislature would need to pass another law to allow PG&E to operate the power plant past 2030.","PG&E is one step closer to keeping Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant open until 2030.

On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission voted 9-3 to give PG&E a coastal development permit that will extend the power plant’s life.

The permit requires PG&E to dedicate thousands of acres of surrounding land to conservation to offset the negative environmental impacts of plant’s seawater once-through cooling system.

The nuclear power plant still needs two more approvals to continue operating.

PG&E presented a smaller mitigation package to the commission in November, which was rejected. After pushback from state legislators and the public, the commission told PG&E to go back to the drawing board and return with a more expansive land conservation plan.

On Thursday, the majority of the commissioners accepted PG&E’s proposal.

“The increased mitigations will be of significant benefit for the state of California for years to come,” commissioner Megan Harmon said.

The commission also took a vote that’s a step toward extending the plant’s life an additional 15 years, to 2045.

Why does PG&E need to offer a land conservation package?

The power pant’s cooling system sucks in about 2.5 billion gallons of seawater per day, which could fill almost 3,800 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The system also inhales small marine organisms, which are often killed by the change in water pressure and temperature, the staff report said.

Operating the plant for another five years would kill billions of those marine organisms, which would negatively impact about 14 square miles of nearshore waters, the staff report said.

Such a significant environmental impact does not comply with the California Coastal Management Program or the California Coastal Act.

However, the commission can approve permits for coastal-dependent industrial facilities like the power plant if it can prove that the project won’t harm the public and the environmental impacts are mitigated to the “maximum extent feasible,” the staff report said.

Commission staff determined that building replacement marine habitat, like an artificial reef, was not a feasible option, because such projects have inconsistent success rates.

Instead, PG&E offered a land conservation package.

A more expansive mitigation package

After the November meeting, PG&E and commission staff revised the mitigation package.

“This collaboration has led to the chance to preserve these 14 miles of coastline,” PG&E representative Tom Jones said at the meeting.

The updated mitigation package includes the following:

A 4,500-acre conservation easement to be placed on the North Ranch property, which is 3,400 acres larger than the conservation easement PG&E originally proposed. PG&E will also attempt to dedicate the fee title of the North Ranch to a public agency, a nonprofit land conservation organization or a Native American tribe.

Conservation easements for 25 miles of trails on the property, including a trail that connects Montaña de Oro State Park to Port San Luis. Previously, PG&E only offered 10 miles of new trails in the mitigation package.

A $10 million endowment for the design, planning, construction and maintenance of those trails. This is $4.4 million larger than the original proposal.

The option to sell the fee title for the 2,400-acre Wild Cherry Canyon property to a state agency, a nonprofit conservation organization or a Native American tribe that also obtains an agreement to purchase the lease from HomeFed Corp. at fair market value.

A prohibition on the sale of the South Ranch property for purposes other than conservation until 2040. Originally, PG&E offered only a first right of refusal for the property’s purchase to state agencies and nonprofit conservation organizations.

“These six elements would provide a pathway to the permanent conservation of nearly all of the 12,000 acres of the Diablo Canyon lands in order to offset the project’s effects on marine life,” commission deputy director Cassidy Teufel said.

PG&E offered additional mitigations if the state Legislature extends the plant’s operating life beyond 2030, which include:

A deed restriction on almost 2,500 acres of the South Ranch, which would require a conservation easement as part of the purchase of the property.

An 18-month first right of refusal for government agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations and Native American tribes for the South Ranch property.

An 18-month first right of refusal for government agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations and Native American tribes for the underlying fee title of Wild Cherry Canyon. Starting on Oct. 31, 2030, the buyer of the fee title would not need to have an agreement to purchase the lease from HomeFed.

State Sen. John Laird led lobbying efforts to expand the mitigation package. While he would have preferred direct, immediate conservation of the South Ranch, he was pleased with the rest of the proposal, calling it “a monumental victory.”

“This is remarkable progress, and I think generations of people will thank us,” he said at the meeting.

State Assemblymember Dawn Addis, however, urged the commission to require PG&E to preserve the entirety of the South Ranch immediately.

“I think today is a real opportunity to restore accountability and to restore trust when it comes to potential continued operations of the nuclear power plant,” she said.

Still, both legislators celebrated the expansion of the proposal.

Tribal co-management of the land

Multiple leaders from Indigenous tribes urged the commission to include tribal co-management of the land as part of the mitigation package, but they suggested different approaches.

Mona Olivas Tucker, the tribal chair of the yak titʸu titʸu yak tiłhini Northern Chumash Tribe of San Luis Obispo County, said her tribe is the only nation that has been “definitively established as the indigenous people of this territory.”

“We have family stories, archaeological, genealogical and anthropological evidence to substantiate our claim,” she said.

She said the mitigation package should offer the first right of refusal for the South Ranch to the ytt Tribe.

“The proposed mitigation fails to prioritize tribal land-back efforts and instead places barriers between ytt and Diablo lands,” she said.

Michael Khus-Zarate, the vice chair of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, said his tribe also claims lineage to the Diablo lands.

The Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation stayed on-site to protect their ancestors while they were removed from their graves during construction of the power plant, he said.

“Later, over a four-year period, I led solstice ceremonies with our people in the shadow of the nuclear containment structures, praying that there would be no nuclear accidents and that someday the place would be returned to its natural state of peace and beauty once the plant was gone,” he said.

He advised the commission to consult with all tribes associated with the land.

“You must be as inclusive and expansive as possible,” he said.

Northern Chumash Tribal Council Chairwoman Violet Sage Walker also said that all tribes affiliated with the land should be consulted and have an opportunity to manage the property.

“While we support the preservation of the lands around Diablo Canyon, we do not support the inclusion of public access without having developed a robust tribal co-management plan, tribal stewardship program, which includes all tribes culturally affiliated with the lands, including North Ranch, South Ranch, Wild Cherry Canyon,” she said.

What is the vision for Wild Cherry Canyon?

Wild Cherry Canyon is about 2,400 acres of idyllic, undeveloped land behind Avila Beach.

PG&E’s subsidiary, Eureka Energy, owns the underlying fee title to the property, while the development company HomeFed Corp. owns a 141-year lease on the land. Multiple rounds of litigation determined that HomeFed’s lease is valid.

The mitigation package will give a state agency, nonprofit conservation organization or Native American tribe the chance to purchase the underlying fee title to the property if they can strike a deal to purchase the lease from HomeFed.

At the meeting, HomeFed’s attorney Robert Shoecraft said the corporation is willing to sell the lease for fair market value.

An Oct. 26, 2020, appraisal showed that the lease was worth $39 million, though that number could have changed over the past five years, he said.

Meanwhile, the state Legislature allocated $40 million to the purchase of Wild Cherry Canyon. That money just needs to get into the hands of an organization that wishes to manage the property.

During public comment, The Wildlands Conservancy executive director Frazier Haney said his organization would be interested in the property. The Wildlands Conservancy is a nonprofit that protects land in California, managing it for conservation, habitat restoration and public access.

“I’m really excited that we can now see a clear path forward,” commissioner Caryl Hart said of Wild Cherry Canyon at the meeting.

What’s next on the Diablo Canyon permit?

On Thursday, the commission also voted 9-3 to certify that extending the power plant’s operating life another 20 years complies with the California Coastal Management Program.

This allows the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to approve PG&E’s application for a 20-year license to operate the power plant.

However, even if the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves a 20-year license, PG&E can only run the power plant for five years under current state law. The state Legislature would need to pass another law to allow PG&E to operate the power plant past 2030.

The commission reviewed two timelines because PG&E applied for a five-year permit at the state level and a 20-year license at the federal level. The NRC license would allow Diablo to operate until 2044 and 2045 — but only with the state Legislature’s permission and an amendment to the five-year coastal development permit.

After securing a coastal development permit from the California Coastal Commission, PG&E must get a permit to operate the once-through cooling system in February from the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board and a license next year from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

If PG&E is successful in all of those steps, Unit 1 can operate until Oct. 31, 2029, and Unit 2 can operate until Oct. 31, 2030.",https://www.sanluisobispo.com/public/latest-news/t5udi6/picture251849773/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/BIZ-ENV-NUKES-CALIF-1-LA.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 23:58:05.167271

Our evidence suggests that, at least for congressional leaders, political power and private portfolios are uncomfortably intertwined.
Hill, M L (2025), “Anna Paulina Luna pushes for vote on congressional stock trading ban”, Politico, 2 December.","The debate over whether US members of Congress should be allowed to trade individual stocks has moved from a niche ethics topic to a mainstream policy concern. Media investigations have documented pandemic-era sell-offs following closed-door COVID-19 briefings, widespread trading in industries overseen by members’ own committees, and dozens of apparent violations of the 2012 Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act. Against this backdrop, proposals to ban stock trading by lawmakers are gaining traction in Washington. In the latest development, on 2 December 2025, Representative Anna Paulina Luna filed a discharge petition to force a House vote on banning individual stock trading by members of Congress (Hill 2025).

Economists have been trying to assess whether legislators’ portfolios actually earn abnormal returns, and if so, why. Early work by Ziobrowski et al. (2004, 2011) suggested that House and Senate members outperformed the market. Later studies reversed the verdict: Eggers and Hainmueller (2013) and Belmont et al. (2022) find that, on average, members would have been better off in index funds. Cherry et al. (2017) highlight that some senators earned significant sell-side gains around key legislative events, while Huang and Xuan (2023) show that abnormal performance largely disappeared after the STOCK Act. Related work on investors documents that access to policymakers can confer an informational advantage in capital markets, as evidenced by Fons-Rosen et al. (2020) on trading related to the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program.

Taken together, this literature paints a mixed picture: there are pockets of advantage, but not a simple story in which ‘Congress always beats the market’. Our contribution is to zoom in on a small but crucial group: congressional leaders. Rather than treating all lawmakers as alike, we ask whether gaining formal leadership power – Speaker, floor leader, whip, or caucus chair – changes how well a member’s personal investments perform.

Leadership and trading performance

Our study uses transaction-level data on every US congressional stock trade from 1995 to 2021 and links them to firm characteristics, regulatory actions, procurement contracts, and corporate news. We identify all individuals who ever held a leadership position and match each of them to a ‘regular’ member with similar tenure, party, chamber, age, and gender. We then follow both groups over time and compare their risk-adjusted buy-and-hold returns before and after leadership ascension.

Before entering leadership, future leaders and their matched peers underperform the market by similar amounts. After ascension, however, their trajectories diverge sharply: leaders’ trades outperform those of their matched peers by up to roughly 40–50 percentage points per year. The control group shows no comparable improvement. Calendar-time portfolio regressions using standard factor models confirm that leaders’ daily alphas rise markedly post-ascension, while non-leaders’ alphas remain flat.

Leadership positions are few – only 20 lawmakers in our sample trade both before and after ascension – so the results are not about ‘typical’ members of Congress. But leadership roles are exactly where agenda-setting power, regulatory influence, and corporate attention are concentrated. If one wants to know whether public power can be monetised in financial markets, this is where one should look.

We then ask: how do leaders manage to earn such outsized returns?

Channel 1: Political information and influence

The first mechanism is what we call the political information and influence channel. Leaders have privileged information about what legislation will be scheduled, which regulatory priorities are advancing, and which industries are likely to come under pressure. In majority leadership roles, they often help decide those outcomes. We implement several tests related to this channel.

Partisan control. When leaders’ own party controls the chamber they sit in, their trades are significantly more profitable than when they are in the minority. Returns rise with control over the legislative agenda.

Regulatory actions. We track regulatory events – investigations, enforcement actions, and congressional hearings – affecting firms whose stocks are traded. Leaders’ stock sales are followed by a marked increase in adverse regulatory events over the subsequent 3–12 months, while their purchases are not followed by a corresponding decline. This suggests that leaders sell ahead of bad political or regulatory news.

These tests show that leaders benefit from anticipatory trades around political developments. But are they merely informed observers, or do they also help shape outcomes in ways that enrich their portfolios?

Legislative voting. Using bill-level data on all measures reaching the floor, we identify those with meaningful implications for the economy or businesses. For each leader trade, we look at relevant bills introduced in the following months and classify whether each bill is likely to benefit or harm the traded firm. We find that, following stock purchases, the leader’s party is significantly more likely to vote for bills deemed beneficial to the firm and against bills deemed harmful. The number of such ‘aligned’ bills rises substantially relative to matched non-leaders over medium-term windows.

Procurement contracts. Drawing on the Federal Procurement Data System, we examine whether firms whose shares leaders buy subsequently receive more government contracts. They do: purchases are followed by significant increases in contract value and in the share of sole-source contracts. Given that the federal government awards millions of contracts each year but leaders only invest in a narrow subset of firms, it is hard to attribute this pattern solely to passive foresight. It is more consistent with selective influence over the allocation of public business. These procurement-related findings resonate with broader evidence that discretion in public procurement can foster favouritism and rent extraction (Bosio et al. 2020), and that close ties between politicians and firms can raise the cost of public contracts (Baránek and Titl 2024).

Taken together, these tests point to a political channel in which leaders both foresee and shape the policy and regulatory environment in ways that overlap with their personal portfolios.

Channel 2: Corporate access

The second mechanism is a corporate access channel. Firms have strong incentives to cultivate influential lawmakers, particularly those who control legislative calendars or command committee agendas. Sharing sensitive information is risky. If firms must choose which politicians to trust, giving an informational edge to leaders is a natural, if troubling, strategy. We again bring two pieces of evidence to bear.

Connections pay. After ascension, leaders earn significantly higher abnormal returns when trading in firms that either have contributed to their recent campaigns or are headquartered in their home states. The same patterns do not appear for otherwise similar non-leaders.

Predicting corporate news. Leaders’ purchases are followed by more positive news; their sales are followed by more negative news. This predictive power is concentrated in executive-controlled events (e.g. dividend changes, guidance revisions, or earnings delays). Leaders do not anticipate outside shocks better than others (e.g. lawsuits). Moreover, the same individuals did not display this ability before becoming leaders. This pattern strongly suggests that corporate insiders appear to selectively share material non-public information with lawmakers whose political clout makes them valuable allies.

Did the STOCK Act fix the problem?

The 2012 STOCK Act was passed amid bipartisan promises to ‘stop trading on congressional knowledge’. Subsequent work has found that, on average, members’ abnormal returns declined after its passage, and politically connected hedge funds also lost some of their edge (Gao and Huang 2016, Huang and Xuan 2023). For the median legislator, the law may indeed have narrowed opportunities for exploiting inside information.

For leaders, the story is less reassuring. In our data, their trade frequency falls after 2012 – consistent with greater scrutiny – but their average trade size and risk-adjusted returns remain largely intact. Calendar-time portfolio regressions show that post-ascension alphas stay positive and economically meaningful even when portfolios are constructed using public disclosure dates rather than actual execution dates.

Policy implications: Focusing on the top of the pyramid

Our findings concern a narrow but highly consequential slice of Congress: the small group of leaders at the top of the political hierarchy. We do not imply that every lawmaker is quietly beating the market – if anything, the broader literature points to underperformance for rank-and-file members. But they do show that when political power is highly concentrated, so too is the capacity to turn public office into a trading advantage.

This concentration makes enforcement difficult. Traditional insider-trading laws and transparency rules are poorly suited to a world in which decision-makers both receive and generate price-sensitive information, and where conflicted actions may be legal yet still corrosive to trust. So, what can be done?

One response, increasingly advocated by reformers, is a blanket ban on individual stock ownership for sitting members, with assets limited to broad index funds or genuinely blind trusts. Short of that, lawmakers could tighten disclosure windows, raise penalties, and create independent oversight for trades by those in leadership roles, alongside stricter rules on procurement conflicts and legislative recusal.

Ultimately, the question is not whether some members of Congress are ‘smart investors’, but whether a healthy democracy should allow its most powerful officials to hold concentrated positions in the companies whose fortunes they help shape. Our evidence suggests that, at least for congressional leaders, political power and private portfolios are uncomfortably intertwined.

The power station is important to Yorkshire’s economy, supporting local businesses through our operations and supply chains and giving multiple generations the opportunity to build their skills and develop their careers in the county.

The new agreement we have made with the UK Government provides certainty that Drax can continue to support UK energy security as well as helping drive economic growth into the 2030s. It is also underpinned by strengthened sustainability criteria, which has been updated in line with the latest science and best practice.

Under the agreement, when the UK does not have enough electricity Drax can step in to increase generation, avoiding the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity Drax can turn down and help to balance the system.

Baringa’s analysis of the new deal says it will result in a net saving for consumers of up to £3.1bn over its term. This is because the deal avoids the need to produce additional capacity and reduces the country’s reliance on fossil fuels and interconnectors.

In line with the policies of successive Governments, we invested hundreds of millions in converting Drax Power Station to sustainable biomass generation as well as maintaining it so that it is available when the country needs it – particularly when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

This investment has meant, unlike every single other former coal fired power station in Yorkshire, Drax Power Station remains operational and continues to play its vital role.

Critically the new deal also provides us with a foundation to progress options for the power station so it can remain operational well into the future.

One long-standing opportunity is to install the carbon removals and renewable power technology, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), at the power station which we continue to consider. But this project requires the right support from UK Government, including the development of a business model and importantly a regional carbon transport and storage network to connect to.

We are also exploring the options of hosting a data centre at Drax Power Station, which could be complementary to our BECCS plans and potentially attract billions in investment into the region.

With a grid connection, 24/7 power availability, significant amounts of development land, cooling infrastructure and a high-skilled and dedicated workforce the site has all the key requirements a large hyperscale data centre would need to be developed.

As part of this, we are proud to be participating in York & North Yorkshire’s AI Growth Zone bid, and we continue to have conversations with developers on how a data centre could be deployed at the power station.

With projections that data centres could account for up to 14 per cent of the UKs power demand by 2035, ensuring there is sufficient generation capacity for them is a critical security of supply question.

In the future, once we have fulfilled our obligations to the UK Government, we could provide power to a data centre generated at Drax and paid for by data centre users.

This would help the site move away from a bill payer supported model while continuing to help meet national energy demand.",https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Will-Gardiner_Sept25_terrace-14.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:59.416167

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments in response to the administration’s Request for Information for a National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

1. a. Which emerging science and technology areas (e.g., artificial intelligence) will be key to the next generation of innovative advanced manufacturing technologies, and how will they impact advanced manufacturing?

A wide suite of digital manufacturing technologies—including artificial intelligence (AI) (and individual AI applications such as AR/VR, computer vision, expert systems, digital twins, and robotic process automation), big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, sensors, robots/cobots, advanced wireless communications, and computer-aided design (CAD) and engineering (CAE) software—tools are poised to transform modern manufacturing. In fact, digital services now account for 25 percent of manufacturing inputs.[1] And electronic inputs account for 40 percent of the value of a modern vehicle.[2]

The application of digital manufacturing technologies will be significant. Analysts expect manufacturing digitalization to boost overall global factory productivity up to 25 percent.[3] One assessment finds manufacturing digitalization could produce a 10 percent improvement in overall operating efficiency; 25 percent improvement in energy efficiency; 25 percent reduction in consumer packaging; 25 percent reduction in safety accidents; 40 percent reduction in cycle times; and 40 percent reduction in water usage.[4] Overall, economists estimate manufacturing digitalization could boost annual U.S. productivity growth by 1 to 1.5 percentage points and add $10 to $15 trillion to global GDP over the next 20 years.[5]

Manufacturers stand at differing levels of implementing smart manufacturing solutions. One March 2025 study of over 800 large multinational manufacturers found that 98 percent have at least initiated digital transformation efforts seeking to improve their customer experience and operational efficiency, optimize costs, or enhance products.[6] However, implementation of digital manufacturing solutions is decidedly lower among small- to medium-sized (SME) manufacturers. A 2024 survey conducted by the Interdisciplinary Center for Advanced Manufacturing Systems (ICAMS) at Auburn University found that 56 percent of U.S. SME manufacturers were either currently using or now implementing automation tools and 49 percent using additive manufacturing, but that only 38 percent were using big data, only 28 percent AI, and only 27 percent data analytics.[7]

The United States significantly trails in the deployment of robotics—a cross-cutting automation tool that will be vital to the competitiveness of myriad U.S. manufacturing industries. In fact, China has installed more industrial robots than the rest of the world combined in each of the past five years. When nations are assessed by their deployment of industrial robots per 10,000 workers, the United States ranks tenth, while China ranks third.[8] The United States needs to significantly scale up its deployment of industrial robots, and ITIF laid out a strategy to do so in its recent report “A Time to Act: Policies to Strengthen the US Robotics Industry.” Several recommendations which stood out from the report include that the United States should develop a national strategy for robotics, the Department of Commerce should convene a robotics industry advisory group to advise the U.S. government on robotics industry needs and how to increase adoption and procurement, and the United States should expand its investments in commercially oriented robotics research and development (R&D).[9] Further, president Trump should issue an annual award at the White House to firms that have done the best job of installing robots, and use his bully pulpit to shame other executives who have gone capital-light and failed to invest in automation.[10]

1. b. What are the primary challenges and barriers that need to be addressed to ensure the successful integration and widespread adoption of emerging technology in manufacturing?

A litany of supply and demand challenges continue to inhibit the wider adoption of emerging technologies in U.S. manufacturing. One challenge is that the technologies are still evolving and not yet fully mature. As Industry Week’s Jessica Davis notes, “Implementing an Internet of Things program isn’t exactly like flipping a switch. There’s a lot involved, from sensors where the data is initially collected to the network the data travels, to the analytics systems that figure out what it all means.”[11] A lack of interoperable standards between vendor solutions represents another significant challenge. As the report “Industrie 4.0 in a Global Context: Strategies for Cooperating with International Partners” explains, “individual modules, components, devices, production lines, robots, machines, sensors, catalogues, directories, systems, databases, and applications will need common standards for the connections among them and for the overall semantics, or how data gets seamlessly passed from one device to another.”[12] Thus, standardization of architectures, data-exchange formats, vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies, and interfaces will be key to creating interoperability between different digital manufacturing solutions, and the U.S. National Institute of Standards (NIST) can play an important role in facilitating this.

Recent research from the Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey has found that 70 percent of digital transformation initiatives fail to meet their objectives.[13] A significant reason why pertains to lagging employee skills and competencies to effectively implement digital solutions and to a lack of clarity regarding the value proposition behind digital implementations. This is why many countries inventory and describe discrete, specific manufacturing digitalization use cases and processes. For example, Germany has documented over 300 specific use cases/sample instantiations of SME manufacturing digitalization.[14] Further, as the subsequent section on small manufacturers will document, they often lack the capital to invest in modernized plant and equipment.

A second challenge is that too many U.S. companies seek to go “asset light,” limiting investment in capital assets to make their balance sheets more favorable to investors. It is beyond the scope of this submission to address this issue, but a task force led by Treasury and including other major financial agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and banking regulators, should seek solutions to this.

2. a. Which disruptive manufacturing technologies (e.g., additive, nanotechnology, biotechnology) hold the potential to eliminate reliance on foreign sources for critical minerals and materials, and how will they do that?

b. What are the technical challenges and barriers associated with implementing these technologies at an industrial scale, and how can they be addressed?

The United States must make it a national imperative to decrease dependence on China for key critical minerals. For instance, for rare earths used in magnets—notably neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium—China accounted for about 60 percent of their global mining and 90 percent of their refining and processing in 2024.[15] Overall, China accounts for around 60 percent of the global supply of battery-grade lithium, 65 percent of nickel, 70 percent of cobalt, and 90 percent of rare-earth elements such as neodymium.[16] China is also the primary global supplier for many key active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). For instance, approximately 70 percent of the world’s paracetamol (acetaminophen) originates from Chinese firms and over 80 percent of key antibiotic actives (e.g., doxycycline and amoxicillin) are produced in China.[17]

The only way the United States can restore its capacities in critical mineral/rare earths processing and refining in a manner that’s cost-competitive with Chinese production while still being environmentally friendly is through innovation. This will require novel, innovative, new-to-the-world refining processes to address China’s lead in this field. This will require ample R&D funding from both the public and private sectors and also the funding of Ph.D. researchers to develop these new processes. As such, the United States should establish a new National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERC) for critical minerals refining and processing.

4. a. What are examples of U.S. manufacturing-related technological, market, or business challenges that may best be addressed by public-private partnerships and are likely to attract both participation and primary funding from industry?

b. How can public-private partnerships be structured to overcome potential hurdles and foster successful collaboration?

The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft represents Europe’s largest application-oriented research organization, comprised of 67 institutes. One of the historically great strengths of Germany’s Fraunhofer system is that it brings German industry and academia together in a structured manner to develop new technologies with specific industrial relevance.[18] Each Fraunhofer is co-led by a representative from industry and academia. The Fraunhofers work with specific German industrial sectors to develop 10-year technology roadmaps for industry, identifying specific technical hurdles or challenges that need to be addressed, and then through the associated universities they fund Ph.D.s to solve those technological problems and then diffuse that knowledge back throughout Germany’s industrial ecosystem. The German government at the federal and state levels co-invest in the effort, covering about 30 percent of program costs.

America’s Manufacturing USA network is somewhat modeled after this approach. But what it really points to is that the United States should be developing manufacturing-sector-specific competitiveness and innovation strategies. The semiconductor industry has long done this well, and even now the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) has articulated a Decadal Plan for Semiconductors, which has defined specific research challenges such as energy management, storage density, security-on-chip, etc.[19] Similarly, ITIF has called for the Trump administration to encourage the creation of the biopharma equivalent of the SRC.[20] Here, industry could collaborate on such a production technology innovation roadmap, and the federal government could match their funding to research institutes and universities on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For example, some life-sciences firms have their own roadmaps (e.g., GlaxoSmithKline’s manufacturing technology roadmap is focused on the use of continuous techniques).[21]

Beyond biotechnology and semiconductors, the United States should be developing similar decadal competitiveness strategies/technology roadmaps for key manufacturing industries including aerospace, automotive, chemicals, robotics, machine tools, shipbuilding, etc. The U.S. government should be a partner with American academia and industry in helping develop these strategies, but unfortunately it lacks not just the resources but also the key data to undertake the analytics necessary. For this reason, ITIF has laid out a comprehensive assessment of what are the federal statistical needs that would underpin a comprehensive “National Advanced Industry and Technology Strategy.”[22]

Ensuring that small manufacturers can tap into the technological expertise being developed by the Manufacturing USA Institutes is important. A following section discussed improving Manufacturing USA/Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) coordination. While each of the Manufacturing USA Institutes have different business models/value propositions, some have created unique pathways for SMEs to engage with them, such as how MxD (focused on digital manufacturing) offered $500 subscriptions for a low-tier set of outputs. Each Manufacturing USA Institute should have an SME engagement strategy.

5. a. How can Federal agencies and federally funded R&D centers supporting advanced manufacturing R&D facilitate the transfer of research results, intellectual property, and technology scale-up into commercialization and manufacturing.

5.b. What are the key challenges in translating research findings into commercially viable manufacturing processes and products, and how can they be overcome?

First and foremost, America needs to adopt and maintain a supportive, and non-disruptive, approach to the effective technology and intellectual property (IP) transfer system the United States has already developed, and to the extent it reforms this approach it should focus on value-adding improvements on the margins. The administration should also recognize that the process of IP/technology commercialization is already risky, difficult, expensive, and fraught with many valleys of death.

The Trump administration should further recognize that the United States has already built the world’s most effective system for technology commercialization, especially when it pertains to IP/technologies derived from federally funded R&D conducted at U.S. universities and research institutions. However, as late as 1978, the federal government had licensed less than 5 percent of the as many as 30,000 patents it owned.[23] Most of them languished on the shelves of government offices or labs. Congress transformed the situation by passing the bipartisan 1980 Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, better known as the “Bayh-Dole Act.” The legislation both created a uniform patent policy among the many federal agencies funding research and allowed universities to retain ownership of the IP and inventions made as a result of federally funded research.[24] The Bayh-Dole Act has transformed U.S. universities into engines of innovation, spawning robust academic technology transfer and commercialization capabilities and activities at hundreds of universities across the United States that have led to the launch of over 18,000 start-up companies.[25]

The Trump administration should focus first on preserving the effective operation of the Bayh-Dole framework. When Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act it included so-called “march-in right” provisions, which permit the government, in specified circumstances, to require patent holders to grant a “nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license” to a “responsible applicant or applicants.”[26]

The Bayh-Dole Act specifies only four instances in which the government is permitted to exercise march-in rights, and reasonable prices isn’t one. Yet some have called for the government to use Bayh-Dole march-in rights to control the price of resulting products, such as pharmaceutical drugs. This despite the fact that lower prices are not one of the rationales laid out in the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, as senators Bayh and Dole have themselves noted, the Bayh-Dole Act’s march-in rights were never intended to control or ensure “reasonable prices.”[27] As the senators wrote in a 2002 Washington Post op-ed titled, “Our Law Helps Patients Get New Drugs Sooner,” the Bayh-Dole Act: “Did not intend that government set prices on resulting products. The law makes no reference to a reasonable price that should be dictated by the government. This omission was intentional.”[28]

The Trump administration should return to an initiative undertaken in its first iteration, when it had directed NIST to undertake a review of federal policies that could bolster the return of federal investments in R&D. The final 2018 report NIST produced, the “Return on Investment Initiative: Draft Green Paper,” concluded, “The use of march-in is typically regarded as a last resort, and has never been exercised since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980.”[29] The report further noted, “NIH determined that that use of march-in to control drug prices was not within the scope and intent of the authority.”[30] The Trump administration should build upon the findings of the 2018 NIST Green Paper and affirmatively declare that price is not a legitimate basis for the exercise of Bayh-Dole march-in rights.

As ITIF has argued, the biggest difficulty for Bayh-Dole licensees to manufacture in the United States has been the evisceration of America’s manufacturing base has denuded their ability to find manufacturing options in the United States—and so the best way to deal with this challenge is by thoroughly revitalizing American manufacturing, as this RFI helps seek to accomplish. The legislation does include some useful proposals, including directing NIST to identify and maintain a database of domestic manufacturers that commercialize products and services developed from federally funded research. The bill would also require NIST to report to Congress on the commercialization of federal research by domestic manufacturers within 18 months (of the bill’s passage).[31] One improvement ITIF has called for the legislation to make (and for NIST to implement) is for the U.S. government to develop a similar database of manufacturers in key allied nations; which could make it easier for licensees to identify alternative-to-China manufacturers when options are unavailable in the United States.

As noted, a significant strength of the U.S. innovation system is that it has turned America’s universities into engines of innovation, thanks in large part to the Bayh-Dole Act. In fact, the impact of academic technology transfer from U.S. universities has been so extensive that, from 1996 to 2020, it resulted in 554,000 inventions disclosed, 141,000 U.S. patents granted, and 18,000 start-ups formed.[32] Moreover, academic technology transfer has bolstered U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by up to $1 trillion, contributed to $1.9 trillion in gross U.S. industrial output, and supported 6.5 million jobs over that time.[33]

In September 2025, in an Axios interview, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for the federal government to claim half the patent earnings from university inventions derived in part from federal R&D, erroneously asserting that “the U.S. government is getting no return on the money it invests in federal research.”[34] Yet the reality is the U.S. taxpayer—and the government—benefits greatly from this R&D funding. They benefit first from the extensive innovations produced from the academic tech transfer process, which alone has produced hundreds of life-saving drugs and vaccines, including treatments for breast, ovarian, prostate, and skin cancer, not to mention other breakthroughs in everything from Honeycrisp apples and neoprene to cloud and quantum computing. Second, university IP licensing revenues help fund key innovation-enabling infrastructure at U.S. universities, such as labs, incubators, or innovation accelerators that keep the innovation flywheel churning. Third, the government benefits from the taxes produced by the trillions in industrial output and millions of jobs created as a result of university tech transfer.[35] For instance, university research parks alone generated $33 billion in federal tax revenue in 2024.[36] The administration should refrain from imposing a claim or a tax on IP licensing revenues earned by U.S. universities.

6.a. What are the main challenges in attracting, training, and retraining a skilled workforce for advanced manufacturing, and how can they be addressed?

If the United States is to achieve its ambition to significantly revitalize American manufacturing, it needs to take further steps to ensure that it possesses the manufacturing workforce to support expanded U.S. manufacturing output. That’s especially the case as analysts expect the demand for tech talent to grow to 7.1 million tech jobs by 2034 in the United States, from an estimated six million in 2023.[37] Another report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) finds that, by the end of 2030, an estimated 3.85 million additional jobs requiring proficiency in technical fields will be created in the United States, but that, “Of those, 1.4 million jobs risk going unfilled unless we can expand the pipeline for such workers in fields such as skilled technicians, engineering, and computer science.”[38] For the semiconductor industry, the report estimates that roughly 67,000—or 58 percent of projected new jobs (and 80 percent of projected new technical jobs)—risk going unfilled at current degree completion rates.[39] The administration should lead in several efforts to enhance U.S. manufacturing workforce skilling, including:

Expand Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program funding. Skilled technicians are a key component of the traded sector workforce. One highly successful program designed to build technician skills is NSF’s Advanced Technological Education program, which supports community colleges working in partnership with industry, economic development agencies, workforce investment boards, and secondary and other higher education institutions.[40] ATE projects and centers are educating technicians in a range of fields, including nanotechnologies and microtechnologies, rapid prototyping, biomanufacturing, logistics, and alternative fuel automobiles. Notwithstanding this, ATE funding is quite small, at approximately $74 million in FY 2025.[41] The Trump administration should work with Congress to double ATE funding to at least $150 million per year.

Expand the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program (MEEP). The engineering curricula at too many American universities is overly academic as opposed to industry focused. Indeed, university engineering programs have evolved in two troubling directions over the past several decades. First, the focus on “engineering as a science” has increasingly moved university engineering education away from a focus on real problem solving toward more abstract engineering science. Second, this focus on “engineering as a science” has left university engineering departments more concerned with producing pure knowledge than working with industry to help them solve real problems.

That’s why ITIF has argued that the United States needs more “manufacturing universities,” which would revamp their engineering programs and focus much more on manufacturing engineering and in particular work that is more relevant to industry. This would include more joint industry-university research projects, more student training that incorporates manufacturing experiences through co-ops or other programs, and a Ph.D. education program focused on turning out more engineering graduates who work in industry. These universities would view Ph.D.s as akin to high-level apprenticeships (as they often are in Germany), where industry experience is required as part of the degree. Likewise, criteria for faculty tenure would consider professors’ work with and/or in industry as much as their number of scholarly publications. In addition, these universities’ business schools would integrate closely with engineering and focus on manufacturing issues, including management of production.

One model for these manufacturing universities is the Olin College of Engineering in Massachusetts, which reimagined engineering education and curriculum to prepare students “to become exemplary engineering innovators who recognize needs, design solutions, and engage in creative enterprises for the good of the world.”[42]

Congress implemented a form of these proposals when it passed the Manufacturing Engineering Education Program into law in December 2016 as part of the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), authorizing the Department of Defense to support industry-relevant, manufacturing-focused, engineering training at U.S. institutions of higher education, universities, industry, and not-for-profit institutions. With its $48 million in initial funding, MEEP made awards to 13 educational and industry partners to bring educational opportunities to Americans interested in learning manufacturing skills critical to sustaining the U.S. defense innovation base.[43] In 2023, MEEP issued additional three-year funding grants “that establish programs or enhance existing programs to better position the manufacturing workforce to produce military systems and components that assure technological superiority for DoD.”[44]

MEEP can be a powerful initiative, but it is underfunded and has become too solely focused on engineering in the national defense context. Therefore, the Administration should work with Congress to broaden the MEEP remit to refocus it more on supporting industry-relevant, applied engineering programs at leading universities. Congress should allocate $150 million annually to a revitalized MEEP program that would make grants to 20 engineering programs at leading U.S. universities to redirect them toward more hands-on, industrially relevant engineering activities.

6.b. How can Federal agencies and federally funded R&D centers develop, align, and strengthen all levels of advanced manufacturing training, certification, registered apprenticeships, and credentialing programs.

Each Manufacturing USA Institute should develop workforce training workstreams associated with their focal technology area. For instance, MxD’s “Digital Manufacturing and Design Roles Taxonomy” identified 165 distinct digital manufacturing and design roles, describing the responsibilities of each of those roles and the skills individuals needed to accrue to fulfill them.[45] Beyond identifying new roles and occupations, each of the Manufacturing USA Institutes should work with their affiliated academic partners to build and deliver educational curricula for these positions.

The National Skill Standards Act of 1994 created a National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) responsible for supporting voluntary partnerships in each economic sector that would establish industry-defined national standards leading to industry-recognized, nationally portable certifications. But this vision has yet to be fulfilled. Therefore, Congress and the Administration should work to increase credentialing for the manufacturing and the closely related logistics industry workforce members by expanding the use of standards-based, nationally portable, industry-recognized certifications specifically designed for specific manufacturing and logistics sectors.[46]

The United States significantly underinvests in workforce training programs, dedicating just 0.1 percent of GDP in active labor market programs compared with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of 0.6 percent of GDP, meaning America’s OECD peers such as Austria and Germany invest six or more times more in their workforce training and support programs.[47] Moreover, the United States now invests less than half of what it did in such programs 30 years ago, as a share of GDP.[48]

One way the Trump administration and Congress could address this challenge would be by expanding Section 127 tax benefits for employer-provided tuition assistance. Section 127 of the federal tax code allows employers to provide employees up to $5,250 per year in tuition assistance; the employer deducts the cost of the benefit but the employee doesn’t have to report it as income.[49] Congress should increase Section 127 to at least $8,700 (per the rate of inflation since 1996) and index the amount to the annual rate of inflation going forward.[50]

7. a. In what ways can the federal government assist in the development of advanced manufacturing clusters and technology hubs nationwide, beyond funding needs?

b. Is there a need for new or expanded advanced manufacturing clusters or technology hubs for the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers, and if so, in what sectors or technologies?

c. Should Federal incentives prioritize industry-specific advanced manufacturing clusters or instead focus on technology hubs centered on advanced technologies, critical components, and materials? If so, why?

In a 2019 report, “The Case for Growth Centers” ITIF examined where innovation jobs are found in the U.S. economy, defining these as jobs that in industries that have a specified level of R&D intensity and that employ a certain share of STEM workers. ITIF found that fully one-third of U.S. innovation jobs are concentrated in just 14 U.S. counties, and one-half in 40 counties.[51] This insight was part of the inspiration behind Congressional creation of the Economic Development Adminsitration’s (EDA) Regional Tech Hubs program. EDA has designated 31 Tech Hubs and in July 2024 released $504 million in Implementation awards for 12 of the 31 designated Tech Hubs.[52]

Besides Congress not appropriating enough money, the program was poorly implemented. The Biden administration allowed NSF and the Department of Commerce (along with the Department of War and the Small Business Administration) to develop their own regional hub programs with no coordination, essentially spreading limited reasou4ces far too wide and thin. Moreover, many of the EDA awards are weak and likely to never become self-sufficient hubs once federal funding ends. The Trump administration should redo the competition, but this time fund fewer centers, make NSF and EDA develop a joint program, and ensure that winners could be self-sufficient and targeted on what ITIF calls “national power” industries (as subsequently explained).

9a. What are the biggest obstacles faced by small and medium-sized manufacturing companies in adopting advanced technologies to increase efficiency and productivity?

SMEs lag in adopting new technologies that would make them more productive, especially with regard to incorporating digital technologies.[53] SME manufacturers often lack the knowhow to implement advanced technologies or are uncertain about the value proposition behind doing so. As noted previously, this is why it’s important to describe discrete, specific manufacturing digitalization use cases and processes and to provide benchmark assessment tools so SMEs can understand where they are in their digital manufacturing journey. Another significant challenge pertains to the lack of digital workforce skills to implement digital manufacturing solutions.

SMEs often lack the capital to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies. This challenge is amplified by pressure from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to cut costs, which further limits their ability to invest in modernized capital equipment. In fact, studies estimate that the inability of small firms to invest in equipment and plant upgrades contributes to a stark 40 percent productivity gap with large manufacturers.[54] SMEs often lack the available capital to invest in modernized plant and equipment; for instance, McKinsey research found that fully one-quarter of SMEs in the mid-Atlantic region lack the capital even to meet their weekly working-capital needs.[55] The OECD finds that access to capital has generally been tighter for SMEs in the United States than in other OECD countries ever since the Great Recession.[56]

Regarding this challenge, federal capital support (such as through upfront grants or repayable loans) could help them meet upfront investment costs (with the upgraded equipment delivering significant return on investment subsequently). This was the insight behind Congress allocating $50 million to the Department of Energy’s Office of Manufacturing and Supply Chain Resilience (MSRC) to be distributed to states for smart manufacturing pilot implementation programs.

In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed bipartisan Congressional legislation in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, which, among other initiatives, launched the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program. Congress originally envisioned the program—which is managed by the Department of Commerce’s NIST and which operates in all 50 U.S. states as well as Puerto Rico—as delivering expertise on quality manufacturing practices to America’s SMEs, but since then the remit of the program has broadened to be about enhancing the productivity and technological performance of U.S. manufacturing. The MEP network consists of approximately 475 service locations across its 51 centers. NIST asserts that, in FY 2024, the MEP National Network helped manufacturers achieve $15 billion in new and retained sales, $5 billion in new client investments, $2.6 billion in cost savings and over 108,000 jobs created or retained.[57] Since 2000, the MEP National Network has worked with 77,409 manufacturers, leading to $60 billion in new sales and $26.2 billion in cost savings, and has helped create and retain 1,456,889 jobs, according to NIST.[58] Elsewhere, a report from Summit Consulting and the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research found that the program generated a financial return of more than 17:1 on the $175 million in federal funds it received in fiscal year 2023.[59]

Unfortunately, the MEP program has been targeted for zeroing-out since the first Trump administration and was one of the programs designated for elimination in the Project 2025 initiative.[60] Yet the MEP program plays an important role in America’s SME manufacturer support ecosystem, and while it may merit significant reforms, the program should not be wholesale terminated.

When MEP was established in 1982, it made sense to have a network of state-focused centers working with manufacturers in each state. But a state-by-state focus presents difficulties when modern manufacturing challenges are increasingly horizontal in nature—e.g., artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, manufacturing digitalization, supply chain integration, etc.—and it makes less sense for each MEP center to develop its own capabilities in these areas independently. MEP should develop a centralized “Center of Excellence” to develop education/training/implementation modules regarding these cross-cutting manufacturing challenges and distribute them through the regional MEP delivery system.

Here, it’s imperative that the MEP program works closely with the Manufacturing USA network. America’s 18 Institutes of Manufacturing Innovation—spanning manufacturing domains from bio-manufacturing, digital/automation, electronics, and energy/environment to materials—should be viewed as “the tip of the spear” for developing advanced manufacturing product and process technologies in the United States. But MEP should be the channel through which these novel manufacturing product/process technologies get diffused to America’s SME manufacturer base. As such, each Manufacturing USA Institute should have an ongoing MEP “embedded representative” attached to it, with a mandate to develop a strategy for diffusing technologies being developed out of the Institutes across the MEP network.

Another avenue of MEP reform should be recognizing that, because supply chains cross state boundaries, MEP needs many more cross-state, sector-based MEP initiatives (e.g., autos in the U.S. Midwest and South, semiconductors in the Southwest). In other words, MEP should take on more of a supply-chain and sector-based focus. One can envision other regional/sectoral MEPs focused on wood/paper products in the Northwest, semiconductors in the Southwest, medical devices in the upper Midwest, maritime/shipbuilding in the Northeast, defense manufacturing in California or Texas, etc. If MEP departs from a predominantly state-based delivery model, it should reorient its approach to a regional/industrial delivery of SME services with a greater supply chain orientation.

A significant challenge for the MEP program has been that MEP centers often undertake small projects (average project size is about $15,000), so the engagements often don’t prove truly transformative for the customer (in part because MEP engagements often aren’t at the CEO level), and tend to engage line managers or a business unit. MEP needs to focus on transformation projects with customers, something it could better accomplish if it had longer-term, more stable funding that permitted centers to hire and retain more sophisticated staff that can build longer-term expertise.

Another way to strengthen MEP would be to emphasize assignments not just with the SME, but also their OEM customers, such as by defining joint grants (matched by the larger firm) for customers and suppliers that apply together. The larger firm’s support would demonstrate that it is committed to these suppliers and believes these suppliers are viable and strategic. It would also ease a key problem that small firms face: providing them with crucial demand-side certainty would greatly reduce the danger they face in making investments in new products or processes since they don’t have the profits to place bets that might not pay off.

For instance, ITIF has long argued the United States needs to introduce mechanisms to encourage OEMs to take more ownership of manufacturing supply chain digitalization. Large U.S. manufacturers have tended to keep their suppliers at arm’s length, too often treating them on a transactional basis with cost as the principal concern. But as the McKinsey Global Institute notes, “this approach can affect the bottom line. One McKinsey study found that inefficiencies in OEM-supplier interactions add up to roughly 5 percent of development, tooling, and product costs in the auto industry.”[61] Put simply, U.S. OEMs need to take more ownership for driving digital transformation within their supply chains. To this end, ITIF has previously argued that the U.S. government should provide incentives for U.S. OEMs to help 10,000 SMEs to become smart-manufacturing enabled within 10 years.[62]

Another potential OEM-SME partnership opportunity pertains to accumulating shared data that could help AI-based systems such as digital twins operate more effectively. Manufacturing generates more data than any other sector of the economy, yet few companies are harnessing it.[63] Yet AI systems become more effective when they have more data to train on, such as if they have data about the operating performance of production equipment or machine tools that they can learn from to predict failure modes in advance (i.e., predictive maintenance). Many companies own similar or the same machines or tools, yet the data is siloed internally and others can’t learn from it. NIST could lead a voluntary initiative where companies would share anonymized data into a shared data lake that could create new data sets against which novel AI algorithms could be developed.

10. What are examples of public-private partnership models (at the international, national, state, and/or local level) that could be expanded to facilitate manufacturing technology development, technology transition to market, and workforce development?

Two programs are here worth highlighting and targeting for expansion. The Trump administration should work with Congress to expand manufacturing-focused Engineering Research Center (ERC) programs. The U.S. National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Engineering Research Center program supports a network of 17 strategic university-industry partnerships that pursue high-risk, high-payoff research across almost the entire spectrum of technology fields—including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, clean energy and sustainability, microelectronics and information technology.[64] Since 1985, NSF has funded 83 ERCs that have led to more than 1,400 invention licenses, 920 patents, and 250 spinoff companies.[65]

Unfortunately, NSF currently only supports three ERCs explicitly focused on advanced manufacturing activities: the NSF ERC for Cell Manufacturing Technologies (CMaT), the NSF ERC for Hybrid Autonomous Manufacturing Moving from Evolution to Revolution (ERC-HAMMER), and the NSF Engineering Research Center for Transformation of American Rubber through Domestic Innovation for Supply Security (NSF TARDISS ERC).[66] In August 2024, NSF announced a five-year investment of $104 million, with a potential 10-year investment of up to $208 million, in four new ERCs, including a new one focused on biomanufacturing-empowered decarbonization.[67] This represents progress, but it’s not enough; the administration should work with Congress to ensure at least $150 million in annual funding for the NSF ERC program, supporting both existing and new manufacturing-focused ERCs. Further, the ERCs should be required to have their federal funding matched at least half by industry in cash.

NSF should have more of its budget allocated to its Technology, Innovation, and Partnership (TIP) program, which focuses on translating use-inspired research into societal impact. An essential aspect of the TIP program is that it requires every project it funds to have an industry partner. Despite minimal appropriated resources, in just two years TIP has launched regional innovation programs, funded workforce development, improved U.S. competitiveness in two key technologies, and established partnerships with federal agencies and allies like India and Japan. Yet the program’s workforce has shrunk 45 percent since the start of the year due to cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency and a hiring freeze. The Trump administration should work with Congress to boost TIP appropriations to at least $1 billion annually.[68]

The Industry University Cooperative Research (IUCRC) program forges partnerships between universities and industry, featuring industrially relevant fundamental research, industrial support of and collaboration in research and education, and direct transfer of university-developed ideas, research results, and technology to U.S. industry to improve its competitive posture in global markets.[69] NSF currently operates nine IUCRCs focused on advanced manufacturing innovation, with the newest one, the Center for Integrated Material Science and Engineering of Pharmaceutical Products (CIMSEPP) launched in 2022.[70] As with the ERC program, the United States could get more out of the IUCRC program to support U.S. advanced manufacturing. The Trump administration should work with Congress to provide annual funding for the IUCRC program that supports at least 15 ongoing advanced-manufacturing focused IUCRCs.

Innovation vouchers can serve as effective instruments to bring small businesses closer to local universities to collaborate on proof of concept testing or technology development. For the past several years, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have provided technical assistance to the recipients of Department of Energy (DOE) -funded voucher programs, namely American-Made Challenges (AMC), the Incubator Program, and the Small Business Vouchers Program. This effort should be fully built out into a national program across the clean energy focused federal labs to drive strong relationships between entrepreneurs and the national labs to accelerate the roll-out of new technologies in U.S. clean energy sectors such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries and solar cells.[71]And, here, given that the United States is trailing so badly in EV battery technology to China, the Trump administration should launch such a “BatteryShot Initiative” with the goal of producing a battery with a total system cost of less than $200/kWh and a range of at least 1,000 miles per charge.[72]

11. The current 2022–2026 National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing has three top-level goals, each with objectives and priorities: (1) Develop and implement advanced manufacturing technologies; (2) Grow the advanced manufacturing workforce; and (3) Build resilience into manufacturing supply chains and ecosystems.

11a. Are these goals appropriate for the next 4–5 years? Why or why not?

These are appropriate starting goals, but the foremost goal of the National Advanced Manufacturing Strategy over the upcoming five-year period should be documented improvements in the health of what ITIF calls America’s “national power” industries.

The stark reality is that the kind of reforms and adjustments proposed above will help, but we shouldn’t fool ourselves that they will stop China from dominating advanced manufacturing. To stop that America needs much more and that will cost money and political capital. Congress needs to at least triple the R&D tax credit, something from which manufacturers are the principal beneficiary. We need a new and large source of patient capital to allow manufacturers to invest in machinery. We need to block Chinese imports of advanced manufacturing goods when they are unfairly produced and traded. We need the DOW to significantly expand its efforts beyond defense firms per se to a broad array of dual use firms and industries.

In short, U.S. manufacturing strategy should concern itself not with non-strategic industries (i.e., baseball gloves and ballpoint pens) but on enabling industries, dual-use industries, and defense industries, which collectively constitute national power industries.[73] (See figure 1.)

At one end of the continuum are defense industries. Clearly industries such as ammunition, guided missiles, military aircraft and ships, tanks, drones, defense satellites, and others are strategic. Not having world class innovation and production capabilities in these industries means a weakened military capability. Policymakers across the aisle generally agree that these industries are strategic and that market forces alone will not produce the needed results.

At the other end of the spectrum are industries in which the United States has no real strategic interests. These include furniture, coffee and tea manufacturing, bicycles, carpet and rug mills, window and door production, plastic bottle manufacturing, wind turbine production, lawn and garden equipment, sporting goods, jewelry, caskets, toys, toiletries, running shoes, etc. If worst came to worst and our adversaries (e.g., China) gained dominance in any of these industries and decided to cut America off, America would survive—in part, because none of these are critical to the running of the U.S. economy, as many are final goods that might inconvenience consumers but wouldn’t cripple any industries, and also because, in most cases, domestic production could be started or expanded relatively easily because none of these products are all that technological complex from either a product or process concern and the barriers to entry are relatively low.

Next to defense industries dual-use industries are critical to American strength. Losing aerospace, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, semiconductors, displays, advanced software, fiber optic cable, telecom equipment, machine tools, motors, measuring devices, and other dual-use sectors would give our adversaries incredible leverage over America. Just the threat to cut these off (assuming that they have also deindustrialized our allies in these sectors) would immediately bring U.S. policymakers to the bargaining table. National power industries tend to also need global scale in order to complete. Moreover, many are intermediate goods such as semiconductors and chemicals, where a cutoff would cripple many other industries. Finally, these industries are hard to stand up once they’re lost because of the complexity of the production process, product knowledge, and the importance of the industrial commons that support them. In other words, barriers to entry are high and, if lost, would be very difficult and expensive to reconstitute.

Finally, there are enabling industries. These are industries wherein, if the United States were cut off, the immediate effects on military readiness would be small. And the U.S. economy could survive for at least a while without production. America could survive for many years without an auto sector, as we would all just drive cars longer. But because of the nature of these industries—including technology development, process innovation, skills, and supporting institutions—their loss would harm both dual-use and defense industries. That is because enabling industries contribute to the industrial commons that support dual-use defense industries. A severely weakened motor vehicle sector would weaken the tank and military vehicle ecosystem. Similarly, a weakened commercial shipbuilding sector has weakened military shipbuilding. A weakened consumer electronics sector weakens military electronics.

The industries that ITIF defines as national power industries represent about 22 percent of the total 970 industries delineated by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Of these 22 percent, 13 percent are dual-use industries, 8 percent are enabling, and just 0.5 percent are defense industries. (See figure 2.) In terms of employment, just 9.5 percent of workers were employed in power industries, with 6.4 percent employed in dual-use industries, 2.9 percent in enabling industries, and the remaining 0.2 percent employed in defense industries.[74]

An analysis of several quantitative indicators of manufacturing inputs and outputs indicates that dual-use and enabling manufacturing industries have declined more than nonstrategic and defense industries over the past several years, from 2007 to 2022.

Dual-use and enabling industries have seen the steepest declines in employment among the four classifications, with declines of 17 percent and 19 percent, respectively, compared to a 10 percent decline in nonstrategic and defense industries. Additionally, capital investment in productivity-enhancing capital, such as machinery and equipment, fell by 34 percent in enabling industries, while dual-use industries saw no change, and nonstrategic and defense industries increased investment by 7 percent and 32 percent, respectively.[75]

Nominal value added grew across all classifications, yet growth was weakest among the core manufacturing base of enabling and dual-use industries. Nonstrategic industries saw the highest growth of 26 percent, followed by defense industries (16 percent), then enabling and dual-use industries, which grew by just 11 percent and 4 percent, respectively.[76] When considering inflation, which has grown approximately 41 percent economy-wide, value added in enabling and dual-use industries declined significantly.[77]

The decline in enabling and dual-use industry output indicates a hollowing out of the U.S. industrial base, and the consequences of this are severe. These industries are most critical to U.S. national security and support domestic supply chains and national power, and they are losing ground to international competitors, namely China. China has followed a predictable playbook across industry after industry, with significant state financial backing, forced technology transfer, and IP theft, leaving American firms unable to compete and contributing to the decline of U.S. advanced manufacturing. To combat this decline and push back against Chinese economic mercantilism, the United States must implement a national power industry strategy in which the most critical industries for national power are prioritized in policymaking. As noted previously, the first step in achieving this is the crafting of industry-specific strategies.[78]

While general industrial support, such as R&D credits and full expensing for capital equipment, are valuable tools in industrial development, their impacts are limited. All national power industries differ in their structure, key players, competitive forces, and technological needs, meaning each requires curated, individualized strategic support to help firms in the United States compete in global markets. Critical industries should be highlighted and strategies developed, including a national semiconductor strategy, a national aerospace strategy, a national robotics strategy, and more. Creating these strategies will require in-depth industry research, identifying unique strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in each industry, and analyzing how federal, state, and local policy support will impact global power and competitiveness.[79]

Conclusion

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation commends the Trump administration for working to develop an up-to-date, coherent National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing. The success of this effort will be vital to enhancing the global competitiveness of U.S. advanced manufacturing over the coming decade.

Thank you for your consideration.

By Ruth Liao, Liam Vaughan, and Jim Wyss

For 20 minutes, Wes Edens barely pauses as he talks about the sunny prospects for his beleaguered liquefied natural gas company, New Fortress Energy. Dressed in an open-collar blue shirt, his once-blond hair down to his neck, the effervescent 64-year-old billionaire from Montana appears relaxed, flicking through a printout of a PowerPoint presentation he says he prepared himself. It outlines NFE’s operations in Brazil, Mexico and Nicaragua, as well as the global growth potential of liquefied natural gas, or LNG.

It’s a cloudless November morning in Puerto Rico, where NFE supplies more than a third of the island’s natural gas and operates a handful of power plants. Edens, who made his fortune in private equity and co-owns both the Premier League team Aston Villa and the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks, has invited Bloomberg Businessweek to his company’s facility at the Port of San Juan to explain why, in spite of evidence to the contrary, NFE’s future is bright. “This is an amazing constellation of assets,” he says, waving the presentation. “We’ve invested $7 billion, millions of hours. But public markets aren’t always the most patient.”

Seven years ago, when NFE listed on the Nasdaq, it promised to shake up the staid market for LNG, a cheaper, cleaner alternative to the oil and diesel that are still in widespread use to generate electricity in poorer countries. LNG is made by cooling natural gas to -260F (-162C), which compresses it to a 600th of its original volume. Edens and his colleagues had come up with a new method for building the hulking terminals where the liquefaction and export take place, which they pledged would be quicker and cheaper than how everyone else did it. They gave their process the snappy moniker “Fast LNG.” Investors and lenders lapped it up, pouring billions of dollars into the business. By 2022, NFE had a market cap of $9.5 billion.

Since then the stock price has plummeted from $60 to around $1 as the company has lurched from one problem to the next. The first Fast LNG export site, off the coast of Altamira, Mexico, was beset by construction issues, leading to long delays and ballooning costs. It’s now operational, but last year investors sued NFE and its executives for allegedly misleading them over how much progress they were making, claims the defendants have denied. The case is ongoing.

Meanwhile, NFE’s Nicaragua import terminal, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2021, has yet to be switched on; the company just sold its facility in Jamaica to pay down debt; one of its new import facilities in Brazil doesn’t have any customers lined up; and in Puerto Rico, even after securing a new deal to supply the island with LNG, Edens is still scrambling to patch up his relationship with the government.

In Edens’ telling, the difficult part—building the export and import terminals and power plants underpinning NFE’s business—is largely complete, paving the way for cash to finally start flooding in. He acknowledges it all took longer and cost more than anticipated, but he says the market is seriously undervaluing the company. Edens attributes many of NFE’s difficulties to the decision to go public too early, leading to unnecessary external pressure. Markets “often struggle to properly value projects until they’re turned on and generating revenue,” he says.

Some former employees (there’s no shortage: Two-thirds of NFE’s staff have left or been laid off in the past year), however, describe a company in perpetual crisis, run by a gifted salesman who’s proved more adept at attracting capital and winning contracts than at delivering on those commitments. Holders of NFE’s $9 billion of distressed debt are certainly running out of patience—some have taken to calling the company No F—ing Exit. With some NFE bonds currently trading at roughly 30¢ on the dollar, Edens is talking to creditors about the possibility of restructuring the company through a UK process known as a scheme of arrangement, which would involve converting some of the debt into equity and slashing the interest on what remains. That would allow NFE to continue as a going concern, though bondholders could decide they no longer want Edens at the helm. Another alternative would be declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy and selling off the assets.

“It’s a very important time for the company,” Edens says, before donning a hard hat and leading a tour of the facility. If he manages to turn NFE’s fortunes around, it will be up there with the Bucks’ 2021 NBA championship, its first in 50 years, in terms of professional achievements. If he doesn’t, it will go down as one of the biggest corporate failures in recent history.

Natural gas provides about a third of the world’s energy. ​​Once extracted from underground or beneath a seabed, the gas is delivered to consumers via high-pressure steel pipelines. But the pipe network doesn’t cover everywhere, and there are limits to how far the fuel can be pumped. Liquefying it allows it to be transported on massive ships equipped with specially built cryogenic tanks. The US is the world’s largest LNG exporter (a result of the fracking and shale explosion of the 2000s), followed by Australia, Qatar and Russia. When it reaches its destination, LNG is heated up and brought back to a gaseous state—“regasified.” The gas is given an odor to make it detectable in case of leaks and pumped into the local transmission system.

The industry’s biggest challenge is building the facilities that convert gas into LNG. These vast export plants, which in the US dot the coast of Texas and Louisiana, are constructed by armies of specialist workers over a period of years and can cost tens of billions of dollars. The cooling takes place in what’s known as a cold box, which relies on a heat exchanger system not dissimilar to that found in a home’s HVAC unit, at thousands of times the size. Once liquefied, the fuel is stored in tanks as tall as a 15-story building at a constant -260F, requiring around-the-clock monitoring. Shutdowns and accidents aren’t uncommon; many facilities have their own fire department. All this helps explain why the market has traditionally been dominated by nation-states and oil majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell Plc. Companies that build LNG plants tend to sell the fuel via generationally long contracts—as long as 20 years—to persuade financiers to commit the capital required. Barriers to entry, in economics parlance, are high.

The idea for NFE struck Edens after Fortress Investment Group LLC, the private equity firm he co-founded, bought a train line in Florida in 2007. (The current iteration of the train, which runs between Orlando and Miami, is called Brightline.) When the firm settled on LNG as the train’s fuel source—briefly; it now runs on biodiesel—he saw the potential for a new business. “We’ve had lots of success in managing money, making investments,” Edens says. “I wanted to do something that had a meaningful and tangible impact on the world.”

NFE built a micro liquefaction facility in 2015 and the next year started exporting surplus fuel not used by the railway to Caribbean markets. Then it built import terminals—where LNG is heated and turned back into gas—in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Jamaica, and also acquired an existing facility in Brazil. It hired traders in London to buy cargoes of LNG in the market and leased tankers to ship it. LNG tankers can be almost a thousand feet long, and shipments are typically worth tens of millions of dollars. In the early stages of the war in Ukraine, when Europe was looking to rapidly replace Russian natural gas, a shipment could fetch as much as $100 million.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, when demand plummeted for energy of all kinds, NFE announced an investment in a green hydrogen business. Later the company pivoted to data centers. Edens can be demanding and mercurial, say former NFE employees, who requested anonymity owing to the company’s difficulties. They recount executives being dispatched at short notice to Sri Lanka, Mauritania and Ireland to win business, then berated when nothing came of it. One former executive recalls dreading being summoned to the boss’s Manhattan office—a situation not helped by the large painting of a wolf devouring its prey hanging on the wall.

“The media loves to elevate the voices of former employees,” Edens wrote in an email response to questions. “But those who quit and walked away should not drive the narrative or define our story.”

It was during the pandemic that Edens and his team struck upon the Fast LNG concept that would propel NFE to the status of investor darling. At the time, a large majority of LNG terminals were based on land, but some forward-looking companies had started putting them offshore, on huge vessels, removing the hassle and cost of acquiring real estate. NFE proposed to slot liquefaction terminals onto disused oil rigs, which could be picked up for next to nothing. Terminals would be identical, essentially interchangeable; cost efficiencies would follow.

Some in the LNG world were skeptical. Edens insisted Fast LNG would change the industry and made it the company’s primary focus, saying he hoped to get the first facility operational by 2022. The plan was to locate the maiden plant off the coast of Louisiana. When no permit was forthcoming after a year, Edens changed tack. In July 2022, NFE announced it had struck a deal with Mexico’s state utility to locate its first export facility off Altamira, with gas arriving through a 500-mile-long undersea pipeline from Texas. The terminal, spread over three separate rigs, would be built at a shipyard in Corpus Christi, Texas, then towed down the Gulf of Mexico.

In September, NFE issued a press release saying it hoped to complete the project by the next March. The plan was to follow that with four additional Fast LNG units in quick succession. “Utilizing a highly skilled workforce,” NFE had “developed an efficient and repeatable construction process—essentially an FLNG factory—that substantially reduces the cost and time to build incremental liquefaction capacity,” the company wrote. Two months later, NFE held an investor day at the shipyard, where two dozen or so finance types were given hard hats and shown around industrial-scale machinery by a long-haired engineer in coveralls. It was a hit, as was NFE’s announcement the same week that progress was so good the company was increasing its earnings guidance for 2023 to $2.5 billion, from $1.5 billion.

“We urge investors (who may have been waiting on the sidelines before) to take a serious look at NFE now because Fast LNG, we believe, is coming soon and the broader market doesn’t likely fully appreciate the potential upside,” one analyst wrote. Another said he’d come away from the site visit with “increased confidence” in NFE’s ability to meet its construction targets. He increased his target price for the stock by $10.

By the following week, NFE’s shares had risen 7%, almost to their historical peak. NFE then borrowed an additional $700 million and announced a bonus dividend worth $630 million. “Our business is now generating significant, stable, and growing cash, which we believe affords us the ability to both retain capital necessary to grow and return excess capital to shareholders,” Edens said in a December 2022 press release. As the biggest shareholders, he and his family received $217 million, more than the company’s profit for the previous year.

Behind the scenes, though, NFE was starting to flounder. Construction of the Altamira export terminal was taking longer and costing more than anticipated. (The final cost was about $3.5 billion, more than three times the original estimate.) NFE pushed the expected completion date from March to May 2023, then October, then early 2024. Similar delays were occurring at the import terminals in Nicaragua and Brazil. As for developments in Angola and Mauritania that were announced enthusiastically in press releases, they never got going.

Former executives say Edens had a habit of telling investors and prospective customers what they wanted to hear without consulting engineers and project managers on the ground. On earnings calls he’d talk about how he had “tremendous visibility,” and how his estimates of future income were “not really forward-looking” because they were based on “the business flows and the transactions that we have in hand.” Then, the following quarter, he’d move the goalposts, and the share price would tumble.

“There’s a saying we live by—it’s literally on our office wall: nothing exceptional comes from reasonable expectations,” Edens wrote in an email by way of explanation. “It’s simply a way to motivate others to suspend disbelief and get big things built.”

With pressure mounting, Edens and his team took the decision in the summer of 2023 to transport the Fast LNG plant from Corpus Christi to Altamira before it had undergone commissioning, the rigorous final testing of systems and equipment. NFE marked the milestone with a video showing a rig as tall as an office block, complete with living quarters and a helipad, being pulled across the ocean by five tugboats that looked minuscule by comparison. It was an arresting image, but commissioning on the water rather than onshore created logistical headaches and ended up adding to the delays. In February 2024, after another disappointing set of earnings, Edens pushed the timetable back once more. “While it’s been a little bit delayed,” he said on an earnings call, “it’s important to note that it still would be the fastest LNG installation in the history of the planet.”

Around midday on April 26, an aluminum pipe inside the cold box exploded during a pressure test. The site was evacuated, and several workers were hospitalized. Repairs dragged on. Finally the first LNG cargo ship set sail from Altamira on Aug. 12. It should have been a moment of celebration for Edens and his team. But earlier that week the company had put out a press release slashing its earnings guidance in half, leading NFE’s shares to fall 24%. There was more bad news to come.

On Sept. 17, 2024, investors filed the class-action lawsuit in New York, alleging that New Fortress and its executives intentionally and repeatedly misled the market about progress at Altamira and other locations, a form of securities fraud. The suit contrasted Edens’ and his executives’ upbeat public statements with a damning picture of what was happening on the ground, drawn from interviews with a dozen unnamed former NFE employees who’d worked on the project. Pipeworkers, project managers and engineers reported “endemic” delays, hazardous working conditions, “poor planning” and “chaotic” mismanagement. One described Edens’ decision to commission the facility on the water as “insane.”

The most shocking allegation related to the November 2022 investor day in Texas. According to the manager responsible for commissioning at the time, NFE had “pulled the main turbines from the manufacturer’s (Siemens) factory early—three months before they were done—just to make it look like Defendants were further along to attendees at the investor day presentation.” The whole event was “staged to create an illusion of progress,” the former manager said. (Edens denies this happened, describing the allegation as “ridiculous.”)

NFE rejected the allegations in the lawsuit, writing in a filing that Edens and his colleagues “expressly and continuously disclosed that its projected milestones were simply estimates.” (Corporate officials who make forward-looking statements in good faith are protected from prosecution by so-called safe harbor provisions.) NFE added that the Altamira facility was “successfully built and continues to drive value for the Company’s stockholders.” A motion by NFE’s lawyers to dismiss the case is being considered by the judge. “I’ve never sold a share!” adds Edens, refuting the suggestion that he profited from his overoptimism. As for the decision to pay a large dividend when most of the assets were unbuilt, he says that was consistent with his understanding of the business’s prospects at the time.

Earlier this month, after some to-ing and fro-ing, NFE announced it had secured a seven-year contract worth $3.2 billion to supply Puerto Rico with gas from Altamira. It was a welcome development but smaller than the 20-year deal originally mooted, and the news barely made a ripple in the markets. Next up, there’s the matter of finding long-term buyers for the power produced by the Brazilian terminal in Santa Catarina and getting Nicaragua operational. Both of those efforts, Edens says, are “nearly complete.” Soon, he says, gas will finally start flowing, along with NFE’s profits.

As for the plan to build more Fast LNG export terminals, that’s been shelved, at least for now. According to Edens, that’s a natural consequence of changes in market fundamentals: LNG prices are now so low that it’s just as cheap to buy cargoes in the markets as it is to produce it at export terminals like Altamira. Others see it as more of a capitulation. “The fact is that NFE’s ambition was not matched with technical and execution capabilities,” says Richard Pratt of the consulting firm Precision LNG. Pratt describes the whole Fast LNG concept as a “white elephant.”

If the business is to have any kind of future, Edens and his bankers must first reach an agreement with NFE’s various creditor groups. On Nov. 15 bondholders agreed to hold off receiving their latest interest payments for a month, buying Edens a little more time to build consensus around a restructuring plan and save the company. Adding to his stress, Brightline, the Florida train operation, is undergoing its own restructuring after failing to service its debts. Considering the stakes, Edens seems relaxed about it. “Obviously it’s not ideal, but this is a circumstance that many companies have been through before in one way or the other,” he says of NFE’s predicament. “There’s a tremendous amount of asset value. The company is literally on the 1-yard line.”

“Kudos to the Town of Huntington for installing public EV charging stations around the town and replacing some gas-powered fleet vehicles with money- and energy-saving electric vehicles,” said Paul DiBenedetto, PSEG Long Island’s Electric Vehicle Program manager.","Town officials say the grant-funded initiative will reduce emissions, lower costs, and expand access to EV charging across Huntington.

HUNTINGTON, NY — Huntington Supervisor Ed Smyth and the Huntington Town Board unveiled a new electric vehicle (EV) initiative Friday that expands the town’s municipal EV fleet and installs multiple charging stations across the community.

The initiative, launched in partnership with several EV technology providers and utility partners, is aimed at reducing emissions, lowering operating costs, and increasing public access to EV charging throughout Huntington.

“Giving environmentally sound options to drivers throughout Huntington is critically important for the entire town and the communities we serve,” Smyth said. “We are already experiencing significant benefits by introducing EVs to our fleet and providing strategically located charging stations for town vehicles and the community at large. Overall, this project will be a win for the town, a win for the community, and a win for the environment.”

Over the past several months, the town has begun deploying new electric vehicles in departments that require frequent daily travel, including Public Safety, General Services, Information Technology, and Parks and Recreation.

To date, the town’s EV fleet includes three Ford F-150 Lightning trucks and four Chevrolet Equinox electric SUVs. Fleet charging stations have been installed at Town Hall and the General Services Facility on Boxer Court to support the new vehicles. The Raymond T. Cavanagh Maintenance Facility on Pulaski Road will also feature charging stations accessible to both municipal vehicles and the general public.

Town officials said the initiative is also designed to ease “range anxiety” for EV drivers while providing convenient charging options for apartment residents, shoppers, park visitors, and commuters.

New public EV charging stations are located at: General Services Facility, Boxer Court (6 ports), Pulaski Road facility (4 ports), Town Hall (4 ports), Veterans Park (4 ports), Otsego Park (4 ports)

These additions supplement existing charging ports already installed at the Huntington LIRR station and Town Hall.

The EV rollout was fast-tracked through a combination of state, federal, and utility grants and rebates totaling $730,500, town officials said.

Funding sources included: $250,000 — NYSERDA Clean Energy Community Grant, $233,500 — Energy Efficiency & Conservation Block Grant (EECBG), $137,750 — PSEG Long Island EV Make Ready Rebates, $27,500 — State and Municipal (SAM) Facilities Grants, $62,000 — Environmental Open Space and Parks (EOSPA) Fund, and an Additional $63,000 from EOSPA funding

A key partner in the initiative was PSEG Long Island, whose EV Make Ready Program provides infrastructure incentives of up to $65,000 per port for DC fast chargers and up to $6,500 per port for Level 2 chargers.

“Kudos to the Town of Huntington for installing public EV charging stations around the town and replacing some gas-powered fleet vehicles with money- and energy-saving electric vehicles,” said Paul DiBenedetto, PSEG Long Island’s Electric Vehicle Program manager. “The chargers will help reduce range anxiety and encourage drivers to choose EVs.”

Growing EV Use in Huntington

Electric vehicle ownership continues to rise statewide. According to NYSERDA, there were 320,362 registered EVs in New York as of November 2025. Suffolk County accounted for 41,154 of those vehicles, with 8,657 registered in the Town of Huntington — representing roughly 21 percent of the county’s total EVs.

Town officials said the initiative also supports Huntington’s effort to become a Climate Smart Silver Community while reducing fuel and maintenance costs, lowering carbon emissions, and improving employee and customer satisfaction.

Future EV Projects Planned

The Town Board has already approved additional EV infrastructure projects supported by grant funding, including:

What's happening?

Reuters reported on a successful challenge to the European Union's 2035 ban on internal combustion engines led by German automakers and stakeholders. That campaign cited increased competition by Chinese EV automakers, like BYD, and U.S. tariffs as factors in the push.

""Next Tuesday, the European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,"" declared Manfred Weber, a prominent EU politician, at a press conference in Heidelberg, Germany.

Instead of the 2035 ban, a new measure will tentatively set a target of 90% reduction in carbon pollution over automakers' fleets beginning in 2035. Weber defended the about-face by calling it a push for market-driven solutions and consumer choice in achieving climate targets.

At the press conference, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz emphasized EVs' importance to hitting decarbonization goals. He stated that those goals must be met while advocating for alternatives like synthetic fuels as part of ""technological openness.""

Why is Europe's backpedaling on EV adoption important?

This decision could slow progress toward a cleaner future, maintaining reliance on gas-powered vehicles that contribute significantly to carbon pollution. It also doesn't exist in a vacuum.

Moves in the U.S. led by the Trump administration are discouraging EV adoption. Those include the end of EV tax credits for consumers and, more recently, lowered targets for fuel efficiency for U.S. automakers' fleets.

Overall, the rate of EV adoption around the world is slowing down compared to just a few years ago. While lawmakers should take into account how domestic automakers are faring in the increasingly competitive landscape, they should also balance the environmental consequences.

The world is facing increasingly devastating weather events. There is more variability in the production of farming and other industries due to record-setting temperatures and unpredictable weather. It remains vital to assess how such decisions affect progress toward a sustainable future and a healthier environment.

What's being done about EV adoption in Europe?

In spite of this gloomy piece of news for EVs, it's necessary to look at the greater context. After all, a huge justification for the move is the assortment of competitive options that China is bringing to the market.

That's bad news for German auto brands trying to keep up. Consumers, however, benefit from the price pressure brought along by a competitive market. It's also clear that EVs are in demand in Europe with Tesla finding large success there and BYD overtaking them recently.

As long as European consumers continue to demand EVs, decarbonization will continue in the continent no matter the flip-flopping of politicians.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EV-adoptionimage-recnIg4xrzOctMfen.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:00:41.668442

According to a press release, Air products is working on the Louisiana Clean Energy Complex to become the world’s largest low-carbon energy complex. The complex is designed to produce around 750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95% of the carbon dioxide generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25% of the total project cost, which is estimated between $8 billion and $9 billion.

Yara would then assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tons of low-carbon ammonia per year.

The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products’ customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products’ 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tons per year of high purity CO₂ captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

The effort will also include the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia, which is more than 90% complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tons per year of renewable ammonia.

On December 5, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA) issued a Memorandum emphasizing a “compliance first” policy in all existing and future compliance and enforcement matters. A summary of the Memorandum follows our analysis.

What Does the Memorandum Do?

The Memorandum directs EPA civil enforcement staff to prioritize compliance over prolonged negotiations, with early compliance emphasized while leaving the Superfund early action approach unchanged. The Memorandum outlines six guiding factors: (1) use of a compliance assistance toolkit (outreach, training, “find and fix” self-audits) to encourage voluntary compliance; (2) coordination with state partners to ensure consistency and allow states to join civil judicial actions; (3) open communication to avoid duplication and build trust with regulated entities; (4) clear, nationally consistent findings of violation based on the “best reading” of law and regulation; (5) efficient, economical compliance requirements and injunctive relief tied directly to governing statutes, with OECA approval required for SEPs and other remedies; and (6) reasoned decision-making under the “LEAPS” model (law, evidence, analysis, programmatic impact, stakeholder impact) to ensure sound enforcement outcomes.

Who Is Impacted

The Memorandum impacts any regulated entity engaging with EPA or DOJ in its representation of EPA in compliance or enforcement activities, especially for those defending some of EPA’s most novel or aggressive interpretations to form the basis for their alleged violations.

What Industry Should Do

The objectives of the Memorandum are to compel more streamlined enforcement, findings of violation based on the best reading of a regulation, less burdensome injunctive provisions, and fewer unexpected compliance assurance activities. Below are several steps companies should take to align with this Administration’s “compliance-first” orientation:

Compliance Programs: Because this Administration encourages proactive compliance, continue to ensure environmental compliance programs and related protocols are up to date, diligently implemented, and have the appropriate resources. In that regard, see recent U.S. Department of Justice Corporate Compliance Guidelines.

Find and Fix: The concept of “compliance first” refers not only to prioritization, but also to the timeline of when a company should come into compliance. Therefore, employ a “find and fix” approach by conducting confidential riskassessment audits and reviewing them to evaluate potential avenues for self-reporting and other voluntary compliance options, while protecting attorney-client privilege.

Be Communicative: Because this framework emphasizes open communication, consider staying in touch more regularly with relevant agencies at both the federal and state levels to maintain strong, trusting relationships with regulators. The Administration will expect to see the “no surprises” policy going both ways.

Finding of Violation: If your company receives a finding of violation that is uncertain or ambiguous, consult with counsel about raising and possibly elevating concerns with EPA. Under this framework, EPA must elevate such concerns to regional counsel or the Office of General Counsel.

Settlements: If enforcement settlements involve third-party audits, monitoring, or any other mitigation or stipulated remedy, ensure EPA personnel have obtained appropriate approval from the OECA Assistant Administrator, as is required under this framework. Also, do not expect settlements to involve SEPs until additional guidance is issued.

Analysis

Craig Pritzlaff, Acting Assistant Administrator of EPA’s OECA, issued the Memorandum, entitled “Reinforcing a ‘Compliance First’ Orientation for Compliance Assurance and Civil Enforcement Activities,” to OECA personnel. Pritzlaff advanced a similar “compliance first” policy during his tenure as Director of the Office of Compliance and Enforcement at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Beveridge & Diamond’s Texas office has direct experience with the policy’s implementation in Texas and anticipated the roll out of a “compliance first” orientation nationwide.

While “compliance first” has long been EPA’s stated approach, the Memorandum calls for more frequent national elevation of regional violations and emphasizes open communication with regulated entities and coordination with state partners. The Memorandum could have significant impacts, potentially limiting the scope of EPA enforcement actions and reducing the agency’s utilization of novel theories or overbroad interpretations of the law in lieu of creating new rules.

The Memorandum should not be interpreted as a directive to reduce inspections or reduce enforcement generally. If implemented as it was at TCEQ, “compliance first” is not simply an Agency enforcement policy, but a view that the Agency intends for industry to embrace as well and well ahead of an inspection and enforcement. Companies should continue to prepare for inspections and regularly evaluate compliance status.

The Memorandum does not guarantee widespread change in environmental enforcement as a whole, and holding the Agency accountable to similar fair-play and best-reading-of-law concepts espoused in multiple Executive Orders has proved to be slow and often unsuccessful. However, the Memorandum will undoubtedly impact some cases and overall, and may shift emphasis to compliance actions and resolutions over more formal enforcement actions – that could mean more emphasis on administrative resolutions, more no-penalty Administrative Orders on Consent, and fewer judicial referrals. This may be especially true for regulated entities defending alleged violations based on novel or overreaching EPA legal interpretations that deviate substantially from years of past interpretive positions.

The Memorandum also elevates legal interpretations to Agency leadership, emphasizing that inspectors and enforcement staff, including attorneys, are not responsible for resolving ambiguity in federal environmental laws, but only for identifying and elevating such ambiguity when raised by a regulated entity. While this may expedite some resolution in some cases, in other instances, it may result in longer delays while leadership considers arguments and positions.

How much impact the Memorandum can have remains to be seen. The “find-it-fix-it” approach at TCEQ had strong legal support in the Texas Audit Act, which incentivizes industry self-audits and disclosures in ways that EPA’s own Audit Policy has failed to achieve. TCEQ also has an administrative Penalty Policy that, under Pritzlaff’s leadership, was updated regularly to make penalty calculations more transparent and more consistently applied. This is in contrast to EPA’s current discrete and inconsistent programmatic penalty policies, many of which are decades old and can result in enormous swings in penalty ranges.

And while the focus on administrative enforcement has benefits, industry should keep in mind that administrative orders often do not satisfy the diligent prosecution bars in defending citizen suits that civil judicial enforcement does. And, how Jarkesy (see B&D’s July 2024 alert here) will play out for EPA administrative actions is an issue to watch. All this means, of course, is that embracing “compliance first” cultures is the best first course of action.

Summary of the Memorandum

The Memorandum states that, effective immediately, all EPA personnel responsible for civil enforcement and compliance assurance activities must prioritize ensuring compliance when addressing ongoing and future potential non-compliance with federal environmental laws. This framework intends to streamline early compliance, rather than divert unnecessary resources into prolonged negotiations. The Memorandum also notes that it will not impact the established early action approach to Superfund enforcement. Below is a summary of the six factors relied upon in the Memorandum.

1. Compliance Assistance Toolkit

The first factor—the compliance assistance toolkit—is driven by OECA’s assertion that enforcement should not be the only means for achieving compliance. Instead, the Memorandum urges EPA personnel to use compliance assistance tools such as outreach, technical assistance, and training, including employing a “find and fix” approach to voluntary compliance through self-reporting and self-audits, to proactively encourage regulated entities to comply, rather than retroactively addressing compliance issues in enforcement. This approach is consistent with the first Trump administration’s efforts to prioritize compliance assistance rather than a standard “nail and hammer” enforcement approach that can occur once EPA identifies potential violations.

2. State Partner Coordination

Because most federal environmental laws delegate state authority for environmental compliance and enforcement, the Memorandum re-emphasizes the Trump administration’s priority of having OECA and EPA enforcement personnel work with states to ensure consistency and state input in compliance assurance and enforcement activities.

It should be noted that if a state is a co-plaintiff in a civil judicial action, then those actions may continue even during this push for “compliance first.” There is an incentive for states to join these actions to share in the penalty and coordinate on the implementation of injunctive relief. Additionally, at least in the RCRA context, states cannot join as a party in administrative actions.

3. Open Communication

Building on further coordination with state partners, the Memorandum also emphasizes open communication between all interested parties to ensure further clarity regarding required compliance. By strengthening communication, OECA seeks to avoid unnecessary or duplicative compliance assurance activities, which waste time and money. EPA emphasizes that more open communication will also help ensure there are “no surprises” for regulated entities and build trust between the parties, including encouraging voluntary compliance through self-reporting.

4. Finding of Violation

To avoid uncertainty, findings of violation must be “clear and unambiguous, well-tailored, and based on the ‘best reading’ of the relevant statute and regulation.” The “best reading” of a statute or regulation must consider statutory construction canons, past practice, and current litigation. The Memorandum contemplates regulated entities raising concerns about how EPA has applied a statute or regulation to their case, such as asserting potentially controversial or novel enforcement theories. When a regulated entity raises a concern, inspectors and enforcement staff, including attorneys, are expected to elevate it, including to OECA as needed. Any decision is to be made at the national level to ensure national consistency. Lastly, OECA plans to create consolidated criteria to more clearly define specific categories of violations, which will allow for more consistent findings of violations across all EPA programs and regions.

5. Compliance Requirements and Injunctive Relief

Recognizing that rapid compliance may not always be possible and that formal enforcement will be necessary, the Memorandum emphasizes, in such cases, that EPA must take the most efficient, economical, and swift strategy possible in its negotiations and litigation (if needed). An important addition is their requirement that any injunctive relief provisions shall be based on “the best, most defensible interpretation of the law” to quickly achieve compliance. Furthermore, settlements and orders must reflect a “clear nexus to the governing statute and implementing regulations.”

Additionally, the Memorandum rescinds EPA’s April 2021 memorandum, which set forth expansive injunctive relief tools for civil enforcement settlements, such as third-party audits or monitoring. The OECA Assistant Administrator must now approve the use of these tools prior to negotiation. This includes supplemental environmental projects (SEPs), a historically controversial remedy, which are not to be included in any settlement until EPA issues additional guidance (see B&D’s 2024 alert on SEPs here). Lastly, the OECA Assistant Administrator must approve the use of any other mitigation or stipulated remedy before negotiation. The Memorandum defines stipulated remedies as a settlement term that requires the implementation of a specified project in the event of any future violation of the settlement agreement but does not include stipulated penalties in this definition.

6. Reasoned Decision Making

The last factor requires OECA to use reasoned decision-making when determining non-compliance and enforcement remedies. This may be self-evident, but the Memorandum clarifies that decision-making must now follow the “LEAPS” model, using law, evidence, analysis, programmatic impact, and stakeholder impact to reach a sound, logical conclusion in compliance and enforcement actions.

Ionic Minerals Technology, or Ionic MT, found its Silicon Ridge mine is chock-full of critical minerals and rare earth elements. According to Andre Zeitoun, Ionic MT’s CEO and founder, the newly discovered supply could support initiatives to electrify transportation and bolster defense, all while reducing dependence on foreign markets.

Silicon Ridge’s deposit of critical and rare earth minerals is suspended in clay, not hard rock, making it easier to extract. The clay holds 16 critical minerals, Zeitoun said, including gallium and germanium, used in electronics, fiber-optic cables, and lasers. The mine holds a large supply of halloysite, a mineral used to build better batteries. China by far produces the lion’s share of critical minerals, and when it recently restricted exports on them, U.S. companies were sent scrambling for new supplies.

“Over the last 20 years, [we’ve] kind of put ourselves in a situation,” Zeitoun said, “where we’ve allowed ourselves to be solely reliant on imports of these metals that power our lives.”

The discovery at Silicon Ridge could open the door to finding more rare earths throughout Utah, said Katie Potter, a professional geologist and professor of practice at Utah State University.

“It may kick off a halloysite gold rush,” Potter said.

Zeitoun said his company can extract the materials with virtually zero waste and that it will use no explosives or chemicals at the site. “We really view ourselves as kind of a next generation of mining,” he said, “and of responsible mining.”

The Silicon Ridge mine lies west of Utah Lake, the heart of Utah County, about an hour’s drive south of Salt Lake City. Ionic MT leases the site from the State Trust Lands Administration. The company also holds a permit with the Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining, the terms of which remain confidential, state officials confirmed.

“We are excited about the ongoing progress on the project,” the agency’s director Mick Thomas said in a statement, “and the potential it represents.”

Rare earths are crucial for green technologies like wind turbines and solar panels, along with batteries and motors. Ionic MT launched in 2020 by mining halloysite from clay deposits in Juab County, near the town of Eureka. Halloysite is an aluminum-silicon mineral that electric vehicle manufacturers are tapping to help batteries charge faster and last longer.

“You can charge a vehicle as quickly as it takes to fill up a tank of gas,” Zeitoun said, “which is considered one of the key enablers of EV mass adoption.”

The company processes the mineral through a patented procedure at its 74,000 square-foot manufacturing plant in Provo. In search of more supplies, Ionic MT began exploring Silicon Ridge, but was surprised to find much more than halloysite.

“Our machine came back showing, in every single sample that we looked at, the same distribution of these metals,” Zeitoun said. “We first thought … maybe there’s a mistake.”

Third-party testing, however, revealed an abundance of metals, the CEO said. The Silicon Ridge deposit came from the same type of ancient volcanic formation that created rich deposits in China. That country currently produces around 60 percent of the planet’s supply of rare earths, and commands 90 percent of processing.

Similar deposits lie in Brazil and Australia, Zeitoun said, but Silicon Ridge is the only known analogue in the United States.

Utah’s halloysite formed from a volcanic flare up around 30 million years ago, Potter said. The ash settled near hot springs that created unique clays with tube structures.

“Those tubes can suck in rare earth elements and other critical metals, like lithium,” she said, “and prevent it from being leached or weathered away.”

Silicon Ridge’s proximity to roads, power lines, and a workforce make it favorable for mineral development as well, Potter said. “We also have climate change and a need to shift away from carbon-emitting energy resources,” she said. “If it’s not extracted here, where we have stronger environmental regulations … it’s going to be done by offloading those effects” to other countries.

Ionic MT initially leased 4,053 acres on Silicon Ridge from the Trust Lands Administration in 2023. They returned to that agency’s board in August seeking another 3,700 acres after more than 100 boreholes and trenches revealed ample rare earth and critical mineral concentrations in the clay.

The state will earn $13 per acre per year as part of the lease, and $1.60 per ton, or 10 percent of the gross value of the mined clay, whichever is greater, Trust Land documents show. All the revenue will go to Utah schools.

With state permits and a processing facility already in place, Zeitoun said his company is ready to move rapidly to begin harvesting the minerals. The mine could create hundreds of local jobs, he said.

The federal government has expressed interest in supporting the mine as well, according to Zeitoun, but he declined to disclose any details. The Trump administration has moved to secure more diverse supplies of rare earths in recent weeks after trade disputes with China.

State leaders, meanwhile, are having their own eureka moment over Ionic MT’s discovery. State Senate President Stuart Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz, both Republicans, cited Silicon Ridge as a sign that Utah could be a powerhouse for clean energy. “Our state is uniquely positioned to lead the transition to cleaner energy,” Adams said in a news release Thursday, “by developing next-generation resources right in our own backyard.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Silicon-Ridge-Aerial-View.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-12-12 19:59:54.934253

Today marks 10 years since the ParisAgreement, when for the first time world leaders agreed to limit global warming to 1.5°C and to drive a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. And it feels like the world is turning a page, with some of it finally being in the right direction.

Exactly a month ago, world leaders gathered in Belém, Brazil for #COP30 the annual UN climate summit where governments make important decisions on climate action While the talks were far from perfect, something major happened. People powers shone through. From organizers, Indigenous and Traditional Peoples to youth and workers, everyday people showed up to put pressure on leaders and this led to some pretty historic progress:

In Colombia, the government declared its entire Amazon a fossil-free zone, a monumental step for Indigenous rights, forest protection, and global climate justice. The country will also host the world’s first International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels next year – a space that simply didn’t exist until climate movements and frontline communities demanded it.

COP30 host, Brazil, too took its first official step a few days ago, towards developing a national roadmap to phase out fossil fuels and open the door for communities to finally shape the country’s energy future.

You’ll read more about the impact people and our movement had inside and outside the COP30 negotiations, in the next section. But for now, I want to say this: These are not small shifts. They’re signs that the world is finally beginning to move in the direction people have been pushing for decades: a future where forests are protected, polluters are held accountable, and clean energy becomes a right, not a privilege.

So as 2025 ends, we’re feeling something rare: momentum. Real, global momentum led by everyday people who refuse to give up.

And for 2026? We have big, exciting work ahead and we’re glad you’re in this with us.

Movement Updates Discover our latest actions demanding climate solutions & energy justice

People power set the climate agenda at COP30

At this COP, it was the people, not politicians, who shaped the talks. For two weeks, Belém, pulsed with marches, music, and creativity as civil society turned this host city into a living call for climate justice. More than 70,000 people joined the People’s March for Climate Justice, carrying a symbolic funeral for fossil fuels, while over 200 boats transformed the Amazon River into a moving protest. Inside the UN “Blue Zone,” banner drops and our capybara action kept pressure high, reminding leaders of a simple truth: communities want rivers, not pipelines and a transition that serves people, not polluters.

Indigenous voices, stories, and solidarity took center stage

For the first time in years, COP felt rooted in land, culture, and lived experience with one of the largest Indigenous delegations in history of 3,000 representatives. We helped lift frontline leadership through powerful marches and story-driven actions like Amazon Free of Oil and Gas ritual and the premiere of the documentary Dear Ancestors from the Amazon, the Pacific, and so-called Canada — reminding leaders that climate action is about memory, identity, and protection of home. This surge of movement power helped secure the demarcation of ten Indigenous territories, a historic step for land rights and forest protection, strengthening the push for community-led renewable energy and Indigenous participation in every climate decision.

We pushed governments toward real and inclusive climate action

We worked tirelessly with partners to shift negotiations toward justice: demanding climate finance that protects people, not polluters and exposing the harm of fossil fuels. We drove momentum for the Transition Away From Fossil Fuels roadmap (TAFF), laying out how countries can wind down coal, oil, and gas in line with climate science, which gained support from almost 90 countries, although did not make it to the final text. Our advocacy did secure a major win: the Belém Action Mechanism (BAM)—a new just-transition framework centering workers, Indigenous Peoples, and frontline communities, now sits in the final CO30 text.

People’s power also met the G20 in South Africa

Alongside COP, the G20, a forum where the world’s biggest economies set global priorities, gathered in South Africa, meeting for the first time on African soil. So under We The 99%, we united workers, students, activists, and artists (the 99%) to demand climate justice, debt relief, and a fast, fair shift to renewables. Through town halls, workshops, open letters, a People’s Summit, and a mass uprising festival, we put civil society at the centre of this moment. While leaders launched the Africa Engagement Framework, a plan to deepen cooperation between the G20 and African governments on development and finance, they failed to commit to a fossil fuel phase-out, meaningful debt cancellation, or real climate finance. But we stand unwavering in our demands: Africa needs resources and justice to shape its own renewable future.

BAM! (Belém Action Mechanism)

BAM is a new UN climate framework that makes sure the shift away from fossil fuels is fair by protecting workers, Indigenous Peoples, and frontline communities as the world transitions to clean energy.

Everyone at COP30 was talking about it. From badges to banners, “BAM!” became the rallying cry across the UN climate talks, a demand led by workers, Indigenous leaders, and climate justice groups who insisted that the energy transition must be fair, not harmful. Halfway through COP, countries representing about 80% of the world’s population signaled support for a just transition mechanism, building huge momentum.

The win: COP30 delivered and BAM was officially included in the final text. It means the UN now recognizes that climate action must center fairness, decent jobs, community protection, and Indigenous rights, alongside emissions numbers.

Why it matters: Until now, a “just transition” was mostly a promise on paper. Everyone agreed it was important, but no one was required to track progress or support communities through the shift. BAM changes that. It creates a formal space within the UN climate system to:

coordinate global action on just transition,

share best practices,

track whether countries are keeping their promises, and

help ensure support goes to those who need it most.

BAM turns justice from a slogan into a system. It’s a major step toward a transition that is fast and fair, and one of the biggest victories won by people at COP30.

No fossil fuel growth in 2025

For the first time in history, the world is on track for zero growth in fossil fuel generated electricity this year. Not because demand for electricity is falling, but because renewable energy is growing fast enough to meet all new electricity needs.

Two new, major reports explain this shift. The first, from Ember, a global energy think tank, shows solar grew an astonishing 31%, with wind close behind. Together, they covered the world’s soaring power demand, leaving no space for fossil expansion. Even in China and India, usually the biggest fossil users, fossil generation fell, replaced by record clean energy growth.

The second comes from the International Energy Agency (IEA), one of the world’s most influential energy bodies. Its latest outlook shows solar and wind rapidly outpacing fossil fuels, with clean power now cheaper, more reliable, and expanding fastest in emerging economies.

The message is clear: the fossil fuel era has peaked, and the renewable era is accelerating.

“EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback.","The Environmental Protection Agency is following through on its commitment to tear down regulatory barriers in the name of artificial intelligence, unveiling a new webpage Thursday aimed at guiding industry on Clean Air Act rules to more quickly build data centers.

The Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centers page provides infrastructure developers with a host of information about the 1970 federal law. “Looking exclusively through the lens of the CAA, EPA’s specific new resources provide state and private sector partners with regulatory information, guidance and technical tools that can assist with modeling, air quality permitting, and regulatory interpretations relevant for data centers and AI facility development,” the agency’s press office said in response to a FedScoop request for comment Friday.

The page also shares information on how to “legally avoid requirements” of a Clean Air Act provision known as Limiting the Potential to Emit. The press office said the agency “is committed to following its statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act and helping our state partners do the same.”

The regulatory maneuvering is part of a broader Trump administration push under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to cut red tape and speed up permitting.

“The global race to harness the power of artificial intelligence and build data centers is underway,” Zeldin said in a press release Thursday. “EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback. Developers, local communities and Tribes will now have easy access to the tools they need to build big, beautiful data centers and AI facilities.”

Zeldin’s statement and the webpage itself referenced President Donald Trump’s AI Action Plan and his January AI executive order as reasons for launching the resource, which also details how the agency has previously handled permitting and previews for data-center developers “what permitting requirements they may face.”

The energy agenda for Trump’s AI Action Plan leaned heavily on pared-down clean air and water regulations as a means to expedite permitting. The document specifically called for reduced regulations under the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as well as any “related laws.”

Proponents of the plan argued that the “environmental tradeoffs” for accelerating AI and data center construction were worth it, a point that Zeldin also attempted to make in a July op-ed for Fox News. The former Republican congressman from New York wrote that many of the Clean Air Act requirements for building data centers traced back to the 1990s, “when technology was practically prehistoric compared to modern advancements.”

“These rules require companies to install pollution control equipment when they build new facilities or make a change that increases emissions significantly,” Zeldin continued. “The digital revolution has ushered in new needs and new industries which demand new permitting rules that help, not hamper development.”

The new webpage claims that by speeding up the ability to build data centers “and the necessary backup generation,” the cost of new facilities will go down along with electricity rates. “This ultimately will reduce the cost-of-living for Americans who rely on data centers and AI for their daily lives — from ensuring food at the grocery store to photos on their phones,” the website states.

Whether those assertions pan out remains to be seen, but there’s been a bubbling public rejection of the nationwide data-center buildout amid spiking energy demand and skyrocketing utility costs. On Capitol Hill, bipartisan groups of lawmakers have introduced legislation tiptoeing around the issues, including one bill on liquid cooling technologies to potentially address high facility costs and another to study the impact data centers are having on rural America.

Nevertheless, the EPA’s new website signals that the administration intends to move full steam ahead with its plans to streamline permitting and quicken data-center construction. Aaron Szabo, the EPA’s assistant administrator for air, said in the press release that the webpage demonstrates the agency’s commitment to “following the law and helping Americans do the same.”

“Good rulemaking and policies must be coupled with sound public knowledge regarding regulations,” Szabo said. “As EPA works to enact policy that helps make America the AI capital of the world, our new webpage provides an essential resource to those looking to understand the current regulations,” adding that his office “is pleased to be able to respond directly to the request from developers, local communities and Tribes who have been asking for these resources since day one.”",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/12/GettyImages-2216114246.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 19:01:10.272331

The EPA published the draft formaldehyde risk assessment on December 3 and is asking for feedback on it through February 2.","WASHINGTON – The Environmental Protection Agency is again putting public health at risk: almost doubling the amount of formaldehyde, the cancer-causing chemical, it considers safe to inhale.

It’s the latest in a string of EPA actions that clash with the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, movement. Instead of pursuing MAHA’s goal of tackling health harms from toxic chemicals, the agency is opening the door to more exposure.

The EPA’s revised assessment of formaldehyde’s risks(link is external), released last week, would overturn a Biden EPA finding(link is external) that effectively states there is no safe level of exposure to the chemical. At the time, some critics said even that finding did not go far enough in acknowledging formaldehyde’s risks.

The chemical is widely used in building materials and many consumer goods, such as clothing, bedding, furniture and toys, among others. Science links the chemical to cancer, leukemia, respiratory illness, reproductive damage and other serious health harms.

Several federal agencies and international governing bodies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(link is external), the National Institutes of Health(link is external) and the World Health Organization(link is external), classify formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen.

Scientists agree carcinogens like formaldehyde pose health risks, even at very low doses.

Risking more pollution

“This new EPA action opens the door to more pollution and may fundamentally change the agency’s framework for chemical risk assessment, said David Andrews, Ph.D., the Environmental Working Group’s acting chief science officer.

“This change will enable chemical companies to profit further at the expense of public health.”

Not surprisingly, the revised risk assessment was heavily influenced by former chemical industry officials now leading the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, according to reports by the New York Times(link is external) and ProPublica(link is external).

Those officials, Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva, are both former senior directors at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry’s main trade group. They played a key role in pushing the agency’s new industry-backed stance, which abandons the long-standing EPA scientific principle (link is external)that even low-level exposure to known carcinogens poses risks.

""This decision shows just how far the Trump EPA is willing to go to put industry interests above public health,” said EWG Vice President for Government Affairs Melanie Benesh.

“Doubling the so-called ‘safe’ level of formaldehyde isn’t science – it’s a gift to industry. The public deserves an EPA that protects them, not one that treats exposure of dangerous chemicals as an acceptable risk,” she added.

Undermining MAHA

This regulatory rollback is part of a broader effort by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, Beck and Dekleva to weaken chemical safety standards.

That effort directly undermines the goals of the MAHA movement by exposing workers, families and communities to a well-documented carcinogen at levels the EPA’s own scientists have warned are unsafe.

It’s the latest in a string of EPA and other federal agency actions that conflict with MAHA’s goals of reducing exposure to harmful chemicals, including pesticides.

The EPA published the draft formaldehyde risk assessment on December 3 and is asking for feedback on it through February 2.

In cities, in particular, their work is vital to mitigating environmental challenges like the urban heat island effect, stormwater management and ecological restoration. As cities strive to become climate resilient, landscape architecture faculty and students at SEAS are laser-focused on finding sustainable solutions that benefit the public.

Cooling Urban Heat Islands

People don’t realize it, but on average, cities are 14 to 20 degrees hotter than rural areas. This is due in large part to the urban heat island effect caused by building materials, asphalt, dark surfaces and perhaps most notably, a lack of trees. Keenan Gibbons, a lecturer at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) and a landscape architect with SmithGroup, is using infrared drones to find hot spots in cities and cool them down, which is crucial for public health, energy conservation and sustainability.

This nationwide work, which began in 2018, started in Ann Arbor on Huron Street, where Gibbons was hired to redesign the landscape, including the planting of 130 shade trees.

“It was a pretty big transformation from that barren sidewalk,” says Gibbons. “We established a baseline temperature and have measured it in the years since, and by year five, we measured a reduction in surface temperatures by about 12 degrees.”

Gibbons, whose work is mostly based in Detroit, where he’s currently working on the Corktown Greenway, a community-centered project that will span multiple streets and integrate green spaces and bike lanes, says that reducing surface temperatures is essential as we learn to live on a warming planet.

“While some of my work is mitigating the issues working with what’s already there, adding green spaces, water, shade and brightly colored materials, the ultimate goal is to help inform better design decisions in the future,” says Gibbons.

Green Stormwater Solutions

Following her groundbreaking work in Minnesota in the mid-1990s, which included design and implementation of rainwater gardens, now commonly seen in cities throughout the U.S., SEAS Professor Joan Nassauer says that her interest in green stormwater infrastructure, a method of managing stormwater runoff using systems that mimic natural processes to absorb, filter and store water, is part of the reason she came to U-M.

“It was obvious to me that there were enormous opportunities for green stormwater infrastructure in Detroit. Even when I started working with community partners there in 1999, there were 10,000 vacant properties in the city, and it was clear they could be selectively employed as part of neighborhood green stormwater infrastructure,” says Nassauer.

With a focus on urban design that incorporates the stormwater management potentials of vacant property, Nassauer has built partnerships in Detroit that have allowed her and her students to contribute to a shift from skepticism about green infrastructure to understanding its importance for limiting downstream pollution and climate-induced localized flooding, with profound impacts on people and ecosystems.

Nassauer says that the landscape characteristics of different cities, with varying local community aesthetics, are essential to the successful implementation of green infrastructure.

“Detroit is a relatively flat landscape with clayey soils and many vacant lots and existing green spaces, so green infrastructure should be designed differently than in Seattle or Los Angeles,” says Nassauer. “For every city, local community aesthetics matter. People are more likely to want it in their own neighborhood if it looks attractive to their eye rather than neglected.”

Mapping for Ecological Restoration

Making decisions about land use, ecological restoration and climate resilience in cities means having clear and up-to-date information. This can be harder than it seems, which is why Lisa DuRussel (BS ’02, MLA ’06), SEAS associate professor of practice and engagement, and her students recently worked on affordable and accessible ways to gather the visual and spatial context needed to ensure the successful restoration and future planning for Eliza Howell Park in Detroit, a capstone project supported by the Detroit Sustainability Clinic.

“Last spring, we collaborated with Sidewalk Detroit, a nonprofit that engages with residents to improve public spaces, and the City of Detroit, to connect our ecological and design expertise with geographic information systems mapping to offer a low-cost way to map out lots and properties at the park rather than hiring a costly surveyor,” says DuRussel.

Using a drone, the project team was able to evaluate landscape-scale ecological conditions that are often difficult to assess quickly and affordably, such as canopy cover, drainage analysis, vegetation health and erosion, and provide high-resolution data to inform restoration, design and planning.

The project resulted in ecological management recommendations for the 250-acre mostly undeveloped park, and a strategy for climate-resilient and biodiverse landscapes that can be replicated across all of Detroit’s parks.

“The impact of this work can reach multiple communities throughout Detroit as the city strives for holistic management, ecological resilience and accessibility of its parks for years to come,” says DuRussel",https://seas.umich.edu/sites/default/files/styles/hero/public/2025-12/urban-heat-island%202.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 21:59:51.639468

Many climate experts believe that new technologies are needed to achieve deep electric sector decarbonization, whether carbon capture and storage, new nuclear, advanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage or other emerging sources.

In particular, CCS-equipped power plants may be an appealing decarbonization option, given their dispatchable nature, support from federal incentives like the 45Q tax credit and ability to scale. The recently announced Broadwing project in Decatur, Illinois, as well as those in Baytown, Texas, and southeastern Wyoming are among those that could usher in a wave of new CCS generation. Given projections for AI-related demand growth, this would be a welcome development.

In the absence of regulatory mandates, CCS projects will only advance if they are able to secure additional funding for their low emissions output to offset the cost of carbon capture and disposal. While federal 45Q tax credits provide significant contributions toward CCS project economics, to date this has not proven sufficient to spur widespread adoption of CCS. Clean energy buyers who are willing to pay a premium for low-carbon, firm electricity may be a key force in enabling the viability of CCS projects, but these buyers will need a way to claim the low-carbon attributes of this electric supply.

Clean energy buyers use renewable energy credits and zero-emissions credits to claim that their energy use is associated with an emissions-free resource. A similar energy attribute certificate could be issued for CCS-backed generation, although not necessarily conveying a zero-emissions attribute. EACs are commonly used in Scope 2 emissions accounting under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard.

When CCS applications at power plants intersect with greenhouse gas accounting, two fundamental questions arise: What greenhouse gas emissions reductions should be attributed to these projects, and how should these be claimed by consumers of their electricity?

Behind these questions are many more:

What components of the capture and storage process should be measured and tracked?

How should different fuels and different CO2 end uses be treated?

How should projects that achieve different levels of capture be differentiated?

What verification methods are needed to ensure a credible emissions claim?

Establishing a consistent answer to all these questions, and more, will help ensure there is a uniform attribute for CCS generation and promote market confidence on the integrity of emissions claims. NorthBridge Group conducted broad outreach to climate-focused nongovernmental organizations, attribute registries, clean energy buyers, CCS project developers and other emissions accounting experts. We used that input in developing a standards document that proposes how registries can issue, track and retire energy attribute certificates for electricity generated with CCS. In it, we define a methodology for calculating emissions from CCS-backed electricity generators, set requirements for data reporting and verification, and propose required and recommended features. Energy tracking registries that currently issue and track RECs or other EACs can use this document for guidance.

Several key issues we address include:

Attribute structure. An EAC is issued for each megawatt-hour of generation. The EAC is minted with an associated emission rate measured in pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent per MWh. When retired, the attribute holder may claim the pounds of CO2e listed on the attribute in its market-based Scope 2 inventory. The emission rate will reflect the performance of the project during the period the EAC covers.

Eligibility. The calculation methodology applies to multiple fuel types, generation technologies and post-capture CO2 pathways. Registries may elect to issue EACs only to certain fuel types or post-capture pathways. To aid buyers, the EAC may designate the fuel source and CO2 pathway.

Processes considered. The emission rate calculation methodology includes emissions from electricity generation, CO2 capture, transportation and storage so that the EAC represents emissions from all activities required to ensure permanent CO2 storage. Emissions from on-site activities as well as purchased energy are included. Though the standard acknowledges the potential for the EAC to reflect the carbon intensity of the upstream fuel supply, it does not propose how to do so or recommend doing so at this time.

Monitoring and verification. All project data is subject to independent third-party verification. There is a requirement to submit monitoring and reporting plans, which can be met through other regulatory documentation.

Leakage. To protect an attribute holder’s emissions claims against the potential impact of post-injection leakage, all projects will be required to hold some form of self-insurance. The standard recommends a menu of options that registries may offer and from which projects can choose, such as private insurance, credit reserves or holdbacks, and issuing EACs with built-in leakage estimates.

We acknowledge that the work is not done. An EAC that bears an emission rate may represent a new frontier for many energy-tracking registries that will undoubtedly take work and time to implement. More revisions may be necessary, especially if technical working groups in the GHG Protocol standards update process offer new guidance. And some questions, such as how or if upstream fuel considerations should be folded into the attribute, are acknowledged but not answered.

Nonetheless, a standardized attribute for CCS-equipped electricity generation will allow clean energy buyers to engage with new forms of low-carbon, dispatchable electricity, and developers can monetize these attributes in support of project economics. We are hopeful that this work can meaningfully advance the viability of projects that contribute to the deep decarbonization of an electric grid.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xeDhr5lxGJaRE_xF6sx3i2U0nYJYU-Gkg4NYmKBzogk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTc2MTM5NzlfaUdWNURJdC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-12 20:00:07.694538

While the year is rapidly coming to a close, my Senate Democratic colleagues and I are using every moment we have to deliver solutions to the issues facing our state. From passing legislation on budget transparency and permanently expanding the bipartisan Michigan Reconnect program to holding committee hearings on human trafficking and suicide prevention, we’re laser-focused on getting things done for the people of Michigan.

In the past week, we’ve sent several letters advocating for Michiganders facing deportation and expressing concern about inhumane conditions in ICE facilities across the nation.

Read on to learn more about those actions, the progress we’ve achieved in 2025, and our continued efforts to keep moving Michigan forward in the new year. Also, we hope you can join us tomorrow at my coffee hour in Detroit!

No-Fee PPO Service Bills Pass Senate Unanimously

This week, I was pleased that Senate Bills 611 and 612 passed the Senate unanimously. Sponsored by myself and Senator Ruth Johnson, these bills will make a big difference for victims of stalking and domestic violence who are seeking a Personal Protection Order. These bills now await hearings and a vote in the House. If enacted, Michigan would join 43 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories that already require PPO services to be provided free of charge.

Currently, the cost to serve a PPO can include a service fee plus mileage traveled, which can easily cost almost $100 — an amount that could be especially tough for someone fleeing domestic violence to afford. This legislation would not only make it less financially burdensome for victims but also safer by ensuring the PPO is served by a member of law enforcement rather than a friend or family member of the victim, which is allowed under current law. When someone has gathered the courage to share what has happened to them and secure a PPO, our state should not put up financial barriers to their safety.

Senate Acts to Deliver Relief for Michiganders Facing UIA Benefit Recovery

During the chaos of the pandemic, thousands of Michiganders turned to their government for help, tapping into the unemployment system to put food on the table, pay their bills, and ensure their families could weather a once-in-a-lifetime global health crisis. Since then, the Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) has been attempting to claw back overpayments it mistakenly made to these same individuals — causing stress for many across the state at an already financially tough time.

Let’s be clear: these families did nothing wrong. That’s why, earlier this week, alongside every single Senator, both Democratic and Republican, I voted to pass legislation that would provide a clean slate for these folks by waiving any overpayments the UIA is currently attempting to collect from this pandemic-era timeframe. Senate Bill 700 now heads to the Michigan House, where I’m hopeful they will act quickly, so we can deliver relief to those who need it most.

Expanding Opportunity, Lowering Costs, & Protecting Michigan: Senate Democrats Reflect on Progress From 2025

As we approach the end of 2025 and wrap up our legislative work for the year, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on the progress we’ve delivered for the people of Michigan. Together, my Senate Democratic colleagues and I:

Saved Medicaid in Michigan, protecting access to accessible, affordable health care;

Expanded the widely successful Rx Kids program to improve maternal and infant health outcomes;

Delivered another bipartisan budget that continues the universal free school meals program, implements a long-term road solution, and lowers costs for seniors and families;

Advanced commonsense gun safety policies to keep our communities safe;

Fought back against federal chaos and safeguarded our state from the worst effects of Trump’s disastrous budget plan;

Strengthened protections and benefits for Michigan veterans and their families;

Championed legislation to improve government accountability, tackle racial and ethnic maternal health disparities, lower prescription drug costs, expand transparency in the state budget process, and so much more.

I’m proud of the work we’ve accomplished this year, despite the many obstacles and unprecedented setbacks we faced at both the state and federal levels of government. While we’ll be working in Lansing until the end of the month, I’m already planning ahead for 2026 and looking forward to another productive year advocating for our communities and our state. I also encourage you to stay informed about the legislation moving through the Senate in the coming weeks. Feel free to track the legislation we’re working on here.

Fighting Food Insecurity This Holiday Season and Beyond

Everyone deserves access to quality, nutritious food, full stop — but this year, the demand for food assistance is higher than ever as grocery costs soar and federal Republicans have disrupted Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and restricted eligibility. Approximately 1.5 million Michiganders face food insecurity, including over 402,000 children.

My Senate Democratic colleagues and I have worked hard to ensure that every Michigan family has access to food not only during the holidays, but year-round. From proposing $71 million in relief funding to support food banks and continue SNAP benefits during the federal shutdown to delivering another year of free school meals for every Michigan student, we’ve made significant progress in combating food insecurity here in our state. Learn more about our efforts to tackle food insecurity here, and explore food assistance resources below.

I joined residents and lawmakers at a press conference hosted by the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments on December 1 to advocate for the shutdown of US Ecology Detroit South due to environmental harm and harm to residents. Neighbors discussed the negative impact the facility has on their bodies and home lives, citing a constant smell and taste of chemicals. The lawmakers who spoke at the press conference included Rep. Tonya Myers Phillips (D-7) and Rep. Donavan McKinny (D-11), both of whom emphasized the right to breathe clean air and quality of life. Rev. Sharon Buttry, community leader of the DHCAHE, called on the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (BSEED) to shut down the hazardous waste treatment plant and not renew its permit. Earlier this year, I submitted public comment to EGLE expressing my strong concern about the facility’s proposed renewal permit and the related odor and air quality violations.

Standing up for Communities

This week, I, along with several other Michigan elected officials, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) urging the immediate release of Ernesto Cuevas Enciso on bond pending his upcoming immigration hearing. Ernesto is the husband of a United States citizen and the father of a one-year-old child. He is a former DACA recipient with legal work authorization and a pending application for legal permanent residency. We are advocating for his release home to his family, not held at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin. Here is a link to the letter.

We also joined a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field directors in Michigan and Texas, urging them to release four Western International High School students and their families: Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and her father, Gleiner Jose Sosa Mujica; Antony Janier Peña Sosa and his mother, Maryeli Antonieta Sosa Marquina; Mor Ba; and Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez and his mother, Evelin Josefina Perez. These young people and their parents arrived in the United States from Venezuela or Senegal, and all have pending asylum cases. The students are all following the immigration process and are not considered a risk to public safety. Here is a link to the letter.

In a letter sent last week, several Michigan legislators and I called on ICE to address the concerning living conditions for people held in custody in its facilities. We would like to ensure that Alee Vang and others receive the proper required medication and are asking ICE to reduce overcrowding, implement emergency improvements to sanitation and nutrition, ensure adequate on-site medical staffing, and increase oversight and transparency.

Filing smart lawsuits remains the first and best way to counter assaults on the environment and preserve essential protections.

A deliberate barrage of federal attacks requires us to be equally relentless in our response. We are growing our bench of expert litigators, policy experts, and communicators so that we can challenge our opponents in Washington at every turn. The fights ahead are not new, but their volume and intensity are unprecedented. Taking the government to court — along with their allies in polluting industries — has never been more important or more labor-intensive.

Shape the Law

If left unchecked, this Supreme Court could eviscerate the authority of any future president or Congress to address environmental crises.

It took polluters and their allies 40 years to elect politicians and seat judges friendly to their interests. Now, they are pursuing the most aggressive agenda in modern history to dismantle environmental laws and regulations.

In the face of disruptive Supreme Court rulings, such as the Sackett v. EPA decision gutting federal protections for clean water and wetlands, Earthjustice is investing heavily in our Strategic Legal Advocacy team to navigate the changing legal landscape and secure wins in other legal venues, such as lower and state courts.

Force Progress

We know that defense will not be enough.

States and cities have the ability to advance environmental progress on their own, and when they do, they can raise the bar for everyone. We are growing our work with clients and partners to create legal and political pressure to keep moving forward, accelerating clean energy, climate resilience, and toxics regulation at the state and local level.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/stu-gillespie_spenser-heaps.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:02:56.782263

“New York is leading the clean energy revolution, and NYPA is powering that progress with bold investments in workforce development,” Hochul said.
Since 2024, NYPA has obligated more than $41 million for clean energy training programs, supporting more than 1,700 trainees and more than 30 workforce training organizations statewide.
NYPA’s collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills to ensure statewide reach of the awards.
In September, Governor Hochul announced the convening of an advanced nuclear energy workforce roundtable in New York City.","New York Gov. Kathy Hochul recently announced $40 million in new annual workforce development funding over the next four years from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop the workforce needed to support advanced nuclear energy in Upstate New York.

The funding, approved today by the NYPA Board of Trustees, will directly support the Governor’s call in June for the Power Authority to develop at least one gigawatt of advanced nuclear power in Upstate New York.

The Power Authority board also awarded a total of $4 million to universities and organizations to develop and expand programs that prepare New Yorkers for high-demand careers in artificial intelligence, electromechanical trades, and advanced power systems to meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

“New York is leading the clean energy revolution, and NYPA is powering that progress with bold investments in workforce development,” Hochul said. “By investing in the advanced nuclear workforce and expanding access to affordable, hands-on training in AI and advanced energy systems, we’re preparing New Yorkers for the high-quality, high-demand jobs of tomorrow — and ensuring every community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more equitable energy future.”

Beginning next year, NYPA will partner with qualified workforce development providers, including technical high schools, community colleges, universities, labor unions, and others to utilize the $40 million over a four-year period to develop nuclear energy technical training, retraining, coursework and apprenticeship programs to prepare workers for employment in the advanced nuclear energy field.

NYPA President and CEO Justin Driscoll said, “New York’s clean-energy transition only works if it comes with real career opportunities for the people who live in our communities. Building on the success of our annual investment of up to $25 million for clean energy training to support the renewable energy sector, the Power Authority will add up to $40 million over four years to develop and retrain the workforce necessary to support advanced nuclear power, providing more opportunities for New Yorkers to pursue careers in this high-demand industry.”

The Power Authority’s approval of $4 million for clean energy workforce training stems from a commitment of up to $25 million annually, as outlined in the 2023-24 Enacted State Budget.

The budget legislation also directed NYPA to advance renewable energy projects that will strengthen New York’s electric grid with a portfolio of diversified energy resources. Since 2024, NYPA has obligated more than $41 million for clean energy training programs, supporting more than 1,700 trainees and more than 30 workforce training organizations statewide.

The NYPA Board of Trustees approved the awards to the following organizations and institutions:

The Healthy Home Academy – Brewster, NY - $911,000

Resources will be directed to support classroom and hands-on learning experiences in home performance, high efficiency heating, ventilation, air conditioning and heat pumps.

The State University of New York at Buffalo - $832,000

The funding will be used to establish an AI fellowship program with the New York Power Authority and UB’s Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (IAD) to build a workforce pipeline and allow students to work alongside NYPA experts to address key challenges for the state in the clean energy industry.

The Green Launchpad – Statewide - $734,000

The funding award will expand a comprehensive program that includes clean energy building fundamentals, hands-on labs, advanced technical training, and career services.

Genesee Valley BOCES – Mount Morris, NY - $677,000

The funding will create an electro-mechanical trades program at the Charles G. May Center and to expand an existing program at its Batavia campus.

The State University of New York at Stony Brook – $644,000

The award will be leveraged to launch the University’s inaugural Power Pathways Workforce Readiness program, which will train students in both trade-based and advanced technology disciplines. The program will provide certification and training in areas including solar, drone inspections, geothermal heat pumps, and HVDC power systems.

The State University of New York at Binghamton – $203,000

The funds will be used to support the development and instruction of two new courses- Systems Dynamics and Simulation and Fundamentals of Power Systems as well as expand experiential learning opportunities and paid industry internships.

NYPA Chairman and Western New York Resident John R. Koelmel said, “Building on NYPA’s long history of strengthening the Western New York workforce and advancing statewide training programs, the Board's action today will prepare New Yorkers to thrive in the clean energy economy. The new AI fellowship pairs University at Buffalo students with NYPA's technical experts to advance clean energy solutions while equipping students to succeed in the classroom, on the job, and throughout their careers.”

The NYPA clean energy workforce development funding awards largely support the efforts of the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to connect workers to job opportunities in the clean energy economy. Many of the upskilling and training initiatives have a focus on serving those who are traditionally underrepresented, especially within disadvantaged communities. This fall, Hochul announced the NYPA Board of Trustees’ approval of $12 million for electric vehicle training programs and support for trainees’ childcare, transportation, student fees and books through the NYSDOL Support Services Fund.

NYPA actively engages with each community training organization to ensure skills training is matched with needed positions and participant success through supportive wraparound services. NYPA’s collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills to ensure statewide reach of the awards.

In September, Governor Hochul announced the convening of an advanced nuclear energy workforce roundtable in New York City.

The event, hosted by the Power Authority, brought together leaders from across New York, the U.S. and Canada, including NYPA, the New York State Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the Department of Labor (DOL), the Building and Construction Trades Council, State University of New York (SUNY), Department of Public Service (DPS), Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), Ontario Power Generation (OPG), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), and the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA).",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-12 18:00:46.614440

Utah-headquartered startup Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals announced last week it had used artificial intelligence to locate a 250-degree Fahrenheit geothermal reservoir under this stretch of land.
Geothermal energy is a potential gamechanger.
Big Blind is the company’s first blind site discovery, but it’s the third site it has drilled and hit commercial resources.
The US leads the world in geothermal energy, accounting for about 24% of global installed capacity, but geothermal accounts for only 0.4% of the country’s electricity mix.","Nothing on the surface of this scrubby expanse of western Nevada desert, overlooked by towering, craggy mountains, gives even a hint of what lies beneath. But a few thousand feet underground is a hidden source of abundant clean energy — and it was discovered in an unusual way.

Utah-headquartered startup Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals announced last week it had used artificial intelligence to locate a 250-degree Fahrenheit geothermal reservoir under this stretch of land. They named it “Big Blind,” because this kind of site — which has no visual indication of its existence, no hot springs or geysers above ground, and no history of geothermal exploration — is known as a “blind” system.

It’s the first industry-discovered blind site in more than three decades, said Carl Hoiland, co-founder and CEO of Zanskar. “The idea that geothermal is tapped out has been the narrative for decades,” but that’s far from the case, he told CNN. He believes there are many more hidden sites across the Western US.

Geothermal energy is a potential gamechanger. It offers the tantalizing prospect of a huge source of clean energy to meet burgeoning demand. It’s near limitless, produces scarcely any climate pollution, and is constantly available, unlike wind and solar, which are cheap but rely on the sun shining and the wind blowing.

The problem, however, has been how to find and scale it.

It requires a specific geology: underground reservoirs of hot water or steam, along with porous rocks that allow the water to move through them, heat up, and be brought to the surface where it can power turbines.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were high levels of excitement around geothermal, with oil and gas giants spending huge amounts drilling to find hidden systems, Hoiland said. By the mid-80s, however, many had started to give up, put off by high costs and low success rates.

It’s a “classic needle in the haystack problem,” said Joel Edwards, co-founder and CTO of Zanskar. “There’s no one type of data that tells you that a system is below you, even if you’re right on top of it.” Instead, there are multiple indicators which are really hard for humans to put together to figure out if a system exists.

That’s where AI comes in.

The AI models Zanskar uses are fed information on where blind systems already exist. This data is plentiful as, over the last century and more, humans have accidentally stumbled on many around the world while drilling for other resources such as oil and gas.

The models then scour huge amounts of data — everything from rock composition to magnetic fields — to find patterns that point to the existence of geothermal reserves. AI models have “gotten really good over the last 10 years at being able to pull those types of signals out of noise,” Hoiland said.

Once a potential location has been found, the next step for the company is to drill down to confirm the reserve exists and is hot enough to produce utility-scale power.

That’s exactly what they did at Big Blind over the summer, drilling wells to depths of around 2,700 feet where they found porous rock at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. They know the site is at least the minimum size needed to support a power plant, but don’t yet have a sense of how big it could be.

There is also work to be done to navigate permitting processes and grid interconnection, but the company estimates the first electricity could be produced here in three to five years’ time.

Zanskar’s discovery “is very significant,” said James Faulds, a professor of geosciences at Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology. (Faulds does not work with the company, but two of his former graduate students do.)

Estimates suggest over three-quarters of US geothermal resources are blind, Faulds told CNN. “Refining methods to find such systems has the potential to unleash many tens and perhaps hundreds of gigawatts in the western US alone,” he said.

An oft-cited government analysis from 2008 estimated undiscovered geothermal reserves in the US could provide around 30 gigawatts of power, enough to power around 25 million homes. Hoiland thinks the real figure could be at least 10 times higher.

Over the last three years of scouring the Western US, Zanskar has identified many “hotspots” with the same characteristics as Big Blind, Hoiland said.

Big Blind is the company’s first blind site discovery, but it’s the third site it has drilled and hit commercial resources. “We expect dozens, to eventually hundreds, of new sites to be coming to market,” Hoiland said.

If Zanskar can keep its costs down, “that will go a long way in attracting investment,” said Sophia Bauer, geothermal project manager at Global Energy Monitor, a non-profit. Geothermal has a big advantage because it can harness drilling techniques already fine-tuned by the oil and gas industry, she told CNN.

Another advantage is political. “In the United States right now, the atmosphere is quite friendly to geothermal,” Bauer said. While the Trump administration has taken an ax to solar and wind, geothermal has gone under the radar and is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, according to a March report from Global Energy Monitor, authored by Bauer.

There’s plenty of scope to grow. The US leads the world in geothermal energy, accounting for about 24% of global installed capacity, but geothermal accounts for only 0.4% of the country’s electricity mix.

Some experts hope geothermal will help fulfill the soaring electricity demand from data centers, many of which are used for AI. “Perhaps we have a close future of AI powered by geothermal discovering more geothermal!” Bauer said.

Zanskar’s discovery is the latest development in what some are calling a geothermal renaissance. Much of the recent buzz has been around next-gen geothermal techniques, which use advanced tools of the oil and gas industry — including fracking — to drill very deep wells and artificially create the conditions needed to harness geothermal energy.

But Hoiland says Zanskar’s work shows conventional geothermal still has huge untapped potential.

Joseph Moore, a University of Utah geologist, said AI could be a “gamechanger” for the industry, provided its success at finding hidden geothermal systems can be replicated multiple times.

“It’s the latest advancement for this benign, renewable energy source,” he told CNN. “Frankly, it’s all very exciting to see.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/pmc-5520.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-12 18:01:37.903363

Alexander Skorokhodov, director of technology at CETY, stated, “Anaerobic digestion is a proven pathway for renewable gas, but digestibility limits and digestate handling costs restrict its full potential.” HTAP unlocks the remaining energy in hard-to-digest biomass and converts digestate into clean energy and biochar.","Clean Energy Technologies Inc.

The solution enables AD operators to convert hard-to-digest biomass and AD digestate into additional renewable energy and carbon-rich biochar, improving the overall efficiency and economics of RNG production.

Many AD plants face biogas-output limitations due to the low biodegradability of certain organic feedstocks. CETY’s High Temperature Ablative Pyrolysis (HTAP) technology thermochemically converts forestry residues, agricultural waste, and other non-food biomass inputs into clean syngas. When paired with anaerobic or catalytic methanation systems, this syngas can be upgraded to pipeline-quality RNG.

A single HTAP unit producing 1,500 Nm³/hour of syngas can support production equivalent to approximately 13 MMBtu/hour of additional RNG, placing one HTAP system between a medium- and large-scale AD facility in terms of incremental RNG output.

The platform also addresses a growing industry challenge: digestate management. Digestate can contain more than 55% of unprocessed volatile solids, requiring long composting periods and incurring handling costs. HTAP thermochemically converts digestate into syngas—supporting up to 1.3–1.6 MW of onsite power or up to 8 MMBtu/hour of supplementary RNG—and into biochar that can be tested and certified for agricultural or industrial applications. Biochar can offer carbon stability, pathogen elimination, improved soil conditioning characteristics, and eligibility for carbon sequestration credits, subject to certification.

Alexander Skorokhodov, director of technology at CETY, stated, “Anaerobic digestion is a proven pathway for renewable gas, but digestibility limits and digestate handling costs restrict its full potential.” HTAP unlocks the remaining energy in hard-to-digest biomass and converts digestate into clean energy and biochar.

Iron–sodium batteries, a high-temperature sodium metal chloride chemistry that incorporates iron to reduce cost and reliance on constrained metals, are among the most promising contenders. The question isn’t whether they will replace lithium-ion in every market, but where they can take the lead.

Market momentum for non‑lithium chemistries

Lithium-ion remains the workhorse for electric vehicles (EVs), portable devices, and short- to medium-duration grid applications thanks to its energy density, fast response, and mature manufacturing. Yet the industry’s rapid growth and the need to diversify supply chains have increased interest in chemistries based on abundant elements such as sodium and iron. These systems avoid flammable liquid electrolytes, offer robust safety characteristics, and aim to deliver utility‑scale capacity without the cost volatility tied to lithium, nickel, and cobalt. As market volumes rise, portfolio thinking—matching technology to task—becomes a commercial imperative, not just a technical preference.

Bridging the long-duration gap

Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is where iron–sodium can credibly shift the balance. The U.S. Department of Energy projects the future U.S. grid will need more than 225 gigawatts of LDES by 2050. Lithium-ion batteries perform well for one to four hours, often up to six, but their economic viability and temperature control become more difficult as the duration extends to eight, twelve, or twenty-four hours.

Iron–sodium batteries are engineered for multi-hour to multi-day output, leveraging a solid electrolyte and elevated operating temperatures to deliver steady performance with strong safety margins. They’re designed to firm variable renewables, improve resilience during extreme weather, and help defer costly transmission and distribution upgrades—exactly the roles LDES must play to make a clean grid reliable and affordable.

Utility‑observed progress: Inlyte’s Milestone

The transition from lab promise to grid reality depends on utility-grade validation, and Inlyte Energy’s recent advance is a clear example. The company completed a factory acceptance test of its first field-ready iron–sodium battery system at its facility near Derby, UK, witnessed by representatives from Southern Company, one of the largest U.S. energy providers.

According to the company, the integrated systems (cells, inverter, and controls) achieved 83% round-trip efficiency, including auxiliaries, competitive with high-performance lithium-ion and notably above the 40–70% typical for other LDES approaches. Inlyte claims that the tested system represents the world's largest sodium metal chloride battery cells and modules ever constructed, capable of storing over 300 kilowatt-hours of energy each.

Inlyte’s CEO, Antonio Baclig, states: “To win the future, we need abundant and secure supplies of energy in the U.S., and at the same time, we need to make costs go down, not up. We can’t do that by building the same thing as China. We need to make better technologies, with batteries that are fundamentally lower cost, safer, and longer lasting. By leveraging a breakthrough in the use of iron in the proven sodium metal chloride battery, Inlyte can scale rapidly.”

Iron–sodium isn’t a universal replacement for lithium-ion. Instead, it can improve grid performance by allowing lithium-ion to lead in mobility and short peaks, while iron–sodium covers longer durations.

Clients come to him with their problems: a high electric bill, cold floors, a broken water heater. Then, he walks around their homes looking for clues that may not be apparent to the naked eye, like an incandescent lightbulb or a gap in the insulation. To crack a case, he has to figure out where energy is escaping.

“You try to make recommendations based on what they want to do,” Richter said. “And we might discover things that they didn't know they could do, which is the fun part.”

Richter volunteers as a coach with the Monadnock Sustainability Hub, helping people figure out how to save money and cut fossil fuel emissions with home upgrades.

With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest federal climate policy in American history, suddenly there was a lot more money behind those recommendations. Households could use thousands of dollars in expanded tax credits to pay for things like solar panels and heat pumps.

Those tax credits were supposed to last for seven more years. Now, they’re going away at the end of this month, as a result of provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law over the summer.

In response, the Monadnock Sustainability Hub hatched a new plan. If the group was going to meet its goal — to transition their 800-square-mile corner of New Hampshire off fossil fuels — it needed to raise money to help people get electric appliances and switch to renewable energy. The hub started a program called Electrify Monadnock.

“We want to keep the momentum going. People have this bottled up interest in doing all this stuff. They just need to fund it and finance it,” Richter said.

Rachel Ranelli, the hub’s sole employee and a recent college graduate, is the main person responsible for creating this DIY local version of federal climate policy. Since incentives were rolled back, she says there has been less interest in the coaching program.

“We can't rely on the federal government to be making progress towards that goal of reducing our emissions, so we really look at, how can we make change on a local level,” she said.

Scaling down to meet climate goals

The hub has raised more than $350,000 dollars from private donors to create a program that could replace the federal tax credits people had been expecting.

Ranelli has been working on a structure for the program, including how to divvy up the funds, how to process applications, and how to funnel the benefits towards low-income residents. Households will be able to get up to $7,000 in rebates for all kinds of home projects, such as installing solar panels or switching to heat pumps.

Raising money from local donors to address climate change house-by-house might seem like the opposite of efficiency. But Ranelli says even though the hub cannot offer as much money as the federal government did, she’s hoping the fund will make a difference.

“That's, you know, 40 or 50 more houses who are not burning fossil fuels,” she said.

Dori Drachman, the chair of the hub’s board, says one reason she thinks a fund like this will work is because she saw how federal incentives encouraged people to make climate-friendly home upgrades.

The efforts of small communities add up, Drachman says, and can serve as models for other parts of the country.

“We don't have time to wait. We really don't. We have to do something now, which is why we're doing this fund,” she said. “The climate is changing.”

About 30% of the nation’s total greenhouse gas emissions come from heating, cooling, cooking, and keeping the lights on in homes and businesses. Another roughly 30% comes from transportation, including gas-powered cars.

There are some other incentives for homeowners to cut their emissions that aren’t disappearing, like the federally funded rebate programs New Hampshire state officials are still working to stand up. New Hampshire Saves, a program run by the state’s utility companies, also offers incentives for energy-saving upgrades.

But the Trump administration is turning support away from renewable energy and other programs aimed at cutting emissions, in favor of supporting fossil fuel resources like gas, coal, and oil.

“Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation,” the administration said in a July executive order.

Research shows transitioning to energy efficient electric systems can both cut costs for households and reduce the emissions driving human-caused climate change. According to the International Monetary Fund, subsidies for fossil fuels can have harmful effects on economic growth by inefficiently allocating resources and encouraging pollution.

'A toasty treat'

For Janet Altobello, a client of the hub’s coaching program, having financial and logistical assistance helped her kick-start a transition off fossil fuels she’d been thinking about for a long time.

“We were really excited about the Inflation Reduction Act, of course, and then kind of had to rush to take advantage of the incentives there,” she said. “We have really modest incomes, and we just really have to look at the cash incentives for all these different programs and kind of pace it out gradually.”

Altobello has been working to keep the heat in since the 1970s, when insulation meant wrapping the foundation of a house in black tar paper and piling evergreens on top to keep the wind out. Now, her home exemplifies the many electrification upgrades a house can get.

She added insulation, upgraded the electric panel, and replaced her gas stove with an induction range, which only works with magnetic pots and pans.

“I had this name tag with a magnet on it. And so, I would go to rummage sales and just test pots to see if they were magnetic on the bottom. So, I got some great pots for like $2 each,” she said.

She bought a plug-in hybrid car, and Frank Richter helped her figure out how to charge it — even taking her on a field trip to a public charging station. And she installed heat pumps.

“That is a toasty treat. It's like about a seven minute experience of warming it up and then feeling like, ‘Oh, this is really a luxury,’” she said.

Now, she’s become the go-to person for many of her neighbors who are looking to make changes to their own homes.

Altobello says the whole process of slowly transitioning her home has been relatively painless, but it has been a stretch. She took out a six-year, zero percent interest loan from New Hampshire Saves for part of the work.

“I just feel lucky to be able to do it. I feel like, wow, I have help. I can do this,” she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b086a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+545/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F7a%2F0c25b6e2444ea59780f77ea0b450%2Fimg-7540.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:13.379164

And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.
“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.
Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts.
“This report is a warning,” said Jennifer Walling, chief executive officer for the Illinois Environmental Council.","Massive cuts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have hampered state-level regulators’ ability to rein in pollution, according to a new report. And now, with the Trump administration pushing for even deeper cuts at the agency in 2026, many states across the country may be in a dire position.

“If EPA’s capacity to do its job is further diminished, how prepared are our states to shoulder more responsibility for protecting us from these threats? Unfortunately, not well,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), the nonprofit behind the report, said in a Wednesday press conference on the findings.

The report found that 27 state governments have cut environmental agency funding over the past 15 years, including seven states — Texas, Wyoming, Iowa, Alabama, Connecticut, South Dakota, and Mississippi — that have cut budgets by a third or more. And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.

That leaves them vulnerable to Trump administration changes at the EPA, which has already seen its budget cut 40 percent between 2010 and 2025. In 2025 alone, EPA staffers have left in droves, thanks to mass firings, layoffs, and resignations — as much as 33 percent of its total staff, according to some estimates. Meanwhile, the White House has proposed cutting the agency’s budget by 55 percent in 2026 to $4.2 billion, its lowest level of funding in four decades.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has suggested that states will be able to pick up the slack, describing a vision for the agency that involves giving “power back to states to make their own decisions.” In a March press conference announcing a major deregulation initiative — what he called “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen” — Zeldin fundamentally recast EPA’s mission, outlining a new mandate to “unleash American energy” and “revitalize the American auto industry.”

Protecting Americans from the impacts of industry pollution, he suggested, would instead fall to state agencies, which are “best positioned to work with unique communities and implement laws.”

“In too many instances and across too many administrations, EPA has retained control of implementing many laws from its perch in the nation’s capital,” he said, in an address to the Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit organization representing environmental agency leaders, later that month. “It’s this kind of common sense reform I want to partner with states to achieve.”

In its report, EIP argues that this stance ignores EPA’s statutorily defined mission to protect the health and well-being of Americans, while downplaying the crucial role it plays in outlining national standards and coordinating efforts related to complex, multi-state problems. Even more significantly, though, according to the report, many states are simply not equipped to address their challenges without a strong federal partner.

“This kind of handoff — from federal to state — can only work if the teammate receiving the baton has not been hobbled, as many state environmental agencies have been, by budget cuts,” the report’s authors write.

Twenty three states have in fact worked to increase environmental funding since 2010 — with California (364 percent increase), Colorado (111 percent increase), and Vermont (109 percent increase) leading the way. Which means future cuts to the EPA would likely have a disproportionate impact on states like Mississippi and South Dakota, which have cut agency funding by 71 percent and 61 percent, respectively.

In the Wednesday press conference convened by EIP, environmental advocates painted a broad picture of state-level regulatory dysfunction that would only be made worse by further federal cuts.

The proposed cuts are “a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin,” Drew Ball, southeast campaigns director for the National Resources Defense Council of North Carolina, where environmental agency funding had already declined 32 percent since 2010, said at EIP’s news conference.

“It’s like dismantling the fire department while the house is already burning.”

States depend on a variety of EPA grants to help fund their compliance efforts, ensuring that standards under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other laws are met. The Trump administration has proposed cutting EPA “categorical grants” by approximately $1 billion, eliminating nearly all federal funding for a range of issues, from air quality management and pollution control to brownfield management and lead abatement.

That recommendation would “devastate economic development, critical infrastructure, and environmental protections across the nation,” representatives from the Environmental Council of the States wrote in an open letter to Zeldin in May.

In the Wednesday press conference, Kathryn Guerra of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, said her state of Texas already suffers from widespread regulatory noncompliance. According to its own enforcement reports, she said, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) never investigates many of the environmental complaints it receives, while its backlog of unresolved enforcement cases has grown to over 1,400.

“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.

Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended cutting the agency’s budget by 23 percent in 2026, while its counterpart in the Senate has voted for just a 5 percent reduction. But the advocates convened by EIP argued that current levels of funding are already critically low.

As of Dec. 1, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. has secured company commitments to add 10,600 new jobs, leaders said.

Those roles are expected to pay an average of $40.59 hourly, up from last year’s $36.09. Incentive spending per job, meanwhile, dropped to $15,485 from the $46,850 expended last year, according to the IEDC.

“Our strategic focus on increasing wages and jobs in Indiana is working,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release. “By supporting Indiana companies and the Main Street economy, we’re helping businesses to grow, encouraging more high-wage career opportunities, and creating the next generation of entrepreneurs. All in all, these results will deliver a more robust economy.”

Braun leads the quasi-public agency’s board of directors, which convened Thursday afternoon for its first meeting since releasing the results of a forensic analysis into the activities of IEDC and several partners.

It was also new Chief Administration Officer Alison Grand’s first meeting. She’ll have general counsel duties and serve as one of IEDC’s two ethics officers.

Her role is among changes prompted by the findings, which included lackluster oversight and questionable spending.

IEDC’s nonprofit arm, which previously funneled largely anonymous donations into economic development travel, hasn’t accepted contributions in months. The $1.9 million left in the account will be used to support the agency’s initiatives, said David Fagan, the board’s audit and finance committee chair.

The board has also revamped its conflict of interest policies — with screened members exiting the room for certain projects — and investment policies. Only the full board makes binding votes now, with committees offering recommendations.

“The foundation is firmly in place; 2026 is all going to be about execution,” Commerce Secretary and CEO David Adams said.

That includes a renewed focus on regional economic development.

IEDC has contracted McKinsey & Company to create the guidelines for regional strategic plans. That’s expected to be done this year, Adams said.

The 15 regions will create and submit their plans in the first quarter of next year, and then execute them with state support, according to a slide deck for the meeting.

The agenda also included the approval of changes to investment policies and loans with the Indiana Angel Network Fund. It’s part of Elevate Ventures, one of the “entities of interest” examined in the forensic analysis.

One loan amendment lets IEDC convert the remaining outstanding balance into ownership of the Indiana Angel Network Fund since the loan’s maturity date has passed. The board also approved a new, $5 million loan for the group.

New IEDC President Josh Richardson also made his board meeting debut.",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/g76wdsiwkaa0egd-1536x1025.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:51.554385

Consumers Energy argues that large customers will actually help reduce costs for everyone by spreading the utility's fixed expenses across more users.","LANSING, Mich. — A dispute is brewing over how much protection Michigan residents need as the state attracts large data centers and other energy-intensive businesses.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a petition Monday asking state regulators to reconsider rules they approved last month for serving data centers. She argues the terms are too weak and could stick ordinary customers with the bill if these massive energy users don't cover their costs.

Consumers Energy responded Thursday, calling Nessel's challenge baseless and accusing her of opposing economic growth that would bring jobs and tax revenue to Michigan.

The clash stems from a November order from the Michigan Public Service Commission that set guidelines for businesses using at least 100 megawatts of electricity, roughly enough to power 80,000 homes. Currently, Consumers Energy only serves one customer of that magnitude. However, with a boom in data centers across the country as artificial intelligence (AI) grows, many officials are hoping to bring them here.

What Nessel Wants Changed

Nessel is asking regulators to require stricter terms for the businesses:

Longer contracts: 20 years instead of 15 years

Higher guaranteed payments: 90% minimum billing instead of 80%

Lower size threshold: 50 megawatts instead of 100 megawatts

Public review process: Contested hearings instead of private applications

In her 17-page petition, Nessel argues the commission ignored her cost analysis showing that under current terms, a 100-megawatt customer could leave other ratepayers with an $80 million shortfall.

""The Commission's Order presents arbitrary and capricious analysis,"" Nessel wrote, adding that the approved terms set ""unnecessarily less-protective"" standards that other utilities are already copying.

She also wants explicit requirements that large customers cover their share of Michigan's renewable energy mandates, which currently require utilities to get 60% of their power from clean sources by 2035.

Consumers Energy's Response

The utility fired back Wednesday, saying the commission's order already protects customers while allowing Michigan to compete for business investment.

""The attorney general's challenge has no merit,"" said Kelly Hall, Consumers Energy's senior vice president of regulatory and legal affairs. ""The MPSC's order last month creates a useful framework as Michigan grows and attracts new jobs and tax revenue for local communities.""

Lauren Snyder, the company's senior vice president and chief customer officer, went further, calling Nessel's position ""anti-investment.""

""When businesses grow, families have more choices — better jobs, stronger schools, and thriving communities where people want to live and stay,"" Snyder said.

Consumers Energy argues that large customers will actually help reduce costs for everyone by spreading the utility's fixed expenses across more users. The company said these customers will ""pay their full cost of service.""

What the Current Rules Require

Under the commission's November order, large energy users must:

Sign 15-year contracts with automatic five-year extensions

Pay for at least 80% of their contracted energy regardless of actual use

Pay exit fees if they leave early

Post collateral equal to half their potential exit fee

The commission also said it would review applications for new large customers individually to ensure they don't shift costs to other ratepayers.

What Happens Next

The Michigan Public Service Commission will decide whether to grant Nessel's request for a rehearing. The dispute comes as Michigan competes with other states to attract data centers, which require massive amounts of electricity to power servers that store and process digital information.

Nessel is also currently opposing the speed at which a proposed data center project in Saline Township is being moved forward. In early December, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced her support of the proposed data center, saying ""time is of the essence."" Nessel responded to the proposal as well, urging the MPSC to slow down and hold full, contested hearings on the project.",https://media.wzzm13.com/assets/WZZM/images/c743c916-6394-40f8-baa6-dbfcda98aa89/20251211T221944/c743c916-6394-40f8-baa6-dbfcda98aa89_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:02:46.335559

To hope that if you stand still enough, maybe the world won’t notice you.
Under the previous Trump administration, my mother lived undocumented in rural North Carolina, and every knock at the door felt like a threat that could change our lives forever.
And across North Carolina, that power is growing.
I see that same fire burning across North Carolina right now.","(Raleigh, NC – December 12, 2025) For many advocates across North Carolina, this year, and especially these last few weeks, has been emotionally shattering. ICE raids have returned to communities that have already lived through a decade of fear. Families are once again creating emergency plans for the worst-case scenario. Communities are canceling medical appointments, skipping work, and not taking their children to school. The fear is loud. And the silence is even louder.

As the daughter of immigrants, the scapegoating we are witnessing is not new. History is repeating itself, again, and the familiar narrative has returned: blame immigrants for every systemic failure in this country. I have spent these weeks supporting families who remind me so much of my own, and the weight of memory sits heavy. I know too well what it means to live in the shadows. To move in silence. To hope that if you stand still enough, maybe the world won’t notice you.

My own family’s journey is a reminder of how fragile safety can be. Under the previous Trump administration, my mother lived undocumented in rural North Carolina, and every knock at the door felt like a threat that could change our lives forever. Today, she is a U.S. citizen. That transformation should feel like a triumph. But the truth is, even citizenship does not erase the trauma, exhaustion, and vigilance that immigrant families carry. Right now, the fear persists for one painful, clear reason: it does not matter if you are a U.S. citizen. ICE has shown, repeatedly, that citizenship does not protect you from racial profiling. We’ve seen them target anyone with brown skin, arresting first and asking questions later.

But, in the past three weeks, I have seen something extraordinary, something beautiful rising out of the chaos. The raids have awakened a sleeping giant. People who once felt untouched by policy decisions are realizing that no one is far beyond reach. From public education to Medicaid access to the rising cost of living, people across North Carolina are feeling the consequences of policy choices they were told would “restore order.” But instead of shrinking back, people, especially young people, are standing up.

What gives me hope?

It’s the walkouts spreading across the country. It’s the teenagers in Wilson County who are making protest signs on a Tuesday afternoon. It’s the look on their faces when they realize they are fighting for something bigger than themselves. As I watched them, one of them asked me, “Are you okay? You look uncomfortable.” And, at that moment, I understood why.

When I was their age, I held my first protest sign begging this country to see my undocumented mother as a human being. I begged for safety. For acceptance. For the right to exist in the only home I had ever known. I never imagined I would see young people, almost a decade later, fighting a different version of the same battle.

It was like watching a circle close, one I never wanted them to inherit. And yet… they are lifting their voices. They are demanding change. They are refusing to disappear.

Their courage gives me hope because they are not just protesting; they are organizing. They understand something powerful: real safety is not created by fear-based policies. It is built by community power. And across North Carolina, that power is growing.

From rural towns to urban centers, we are seeing neighbors step up to learn their rights, volunteers joining rapid response networks, families challenging unjust detentions, and local leaders pushing back on policies that make our communities less safe. We are also watching coalitions deepen between immigrant communities, Black-led organizations, educators, and faith leaders. These relationships, these bridges, are the true infrastructure of collective safety.

The work ahead is hard. The gaps exposed by the raids: legal support, language access, transportation, mutual aid, childcare, accurate information, crisis response, trauma-informed care, among many others require more resources, deeper coordination, and political courage from those in power. We need policies that invest in community well-being rather than criminalization: expanded funding for legal defense, true sanctuary policies at the local level, higher wages so people can afford the basics, stronger protections for tenants, and access to healthcare regardless of immigration status. These are not radical ideas. They are necessary ones.

But despite the uncertainty, I remain hopeful, not because things are easy, but because I’m watching the next generation rise with clarity and conviction.

They remind me of the fire I once carried before too many defeats dimmed it.

I see that same fire burning across North Carolina right now. In Wilson, where history is shifting as we elect our first Latine leader to public office. In rural towns, where local leaders are mobilizing to build the infrastructure their communities need, not just for this moment, but for the future they deserve. In the coalitions of solidarity forming across counties and cultures. In the families who refuse to disappear. And in the young people who refuse to inherit silence.

Hope lives there.

And as long as we keep building power, across communities, across languages, across counties, the shadows will never be able to swallow us again.",https://www.ncjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7193.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 20:00:30.978573

Strong federal-provincial collaboration is the hallmark of the Atlantic Growth Strategy as it continues to help create stable, good-paying jobs for Atlantic Canadians.
Atlantic employers have made nearly 1,800 job offers to applicants under the Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program, the Atlantic High-Skilled Program, and the Atlantic International Graduate Program to fill job vacancies.
Led by the Council of Atlantic Premiers' Atlantic Workforce Partnership and supported by Employment and Social Development Canada, the Atlantic Apprenticeship Harmonization Project (AAHP) is helping increase apprenticeship completion rates and keeping apprentices in Atlantic Canada.
Complementing the Atlantic Growth Strategy, entrepreneurs in Atlantic Canada received more than $140 million in financing in the first year of a two-year $280 million financing package.","Executive Summary of year 2 accomplishments

Between July 2017 and April 2018, the Atlantic economy created more than 16,000 jobs. Employment grew 1.5 per cent, better than the national average of 0.9 per cent. During this period, almost 11,000 jobs were created in services producing sectors, mainly in accommodation and food services, and over 5,000 in goods-producing sectors, mainly in the construction sector. Jobs created in Atlantic Canada during this period were full-time jobs, which grew by 2.4 per cent in the region, compared to 1.7 per cent nationally. Part-time jobs in the region have decreased by 2.9 per cent since July 2017. The region has also welcomed over 9,000 permanent residents and their families in 2017 under economic programs. With new dedicated support for businesses offered by the Atlantic Immigration Pilot, regional employers made nearly 1,800 job offers since 2017 to fill job vacancies using the Pilot Program, compared to over 250 job offers in the previous year. Through the Student Work Placement Program, a partnership between Venture for Canada, governments, post-secondary institutions and employers was created to provide more than 500 Canadian students across Atlantic Canada with valuable work experience and work-ready skills in business and entrepreneurial fields.

A new Ocean Supercluster, under development, will support growth of the ocean economy in Atlantic Canada and across the country. This initiative is projected to create more than 3,000 jobs and add more than $14 billion to Canada's economy over 10 years. Enrolment in the Accelerated Growth Service nearly doubled in the past year, with 29 new Atlantic Canadian high-growth companies signing up to receive customized support to grow their market potential - increasing total enrolment in the service to 68 companies. Through the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), more than $140 million has been invested in innovative companies working in information and communication technology, agri-food, ocean technology and tourism. With new training tools developed by not-for-profits and governments, Atlantic Canadian companies can access more market intelligence and resources to better use data, as well as participate in workshops to create healthy business cultures.

The Atlantic Growth Strategy's initiatives are making companies and communities more sustainable and able to mitigate climate change. Initiatives under the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change support efforts to meet emissions reduction targets, grow the economy, and build resilience to a changing climate. These initiatives include $185 million allocated to Atlantic Canadian provinces through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund and the creation of the new Clean Growth Hub, launched in January 2018, which has already helped 30 Atlantic Canadian companies to access federal clean technology programs, funding and services. Innovative projects such as smart electricity grids in the City of Summerside and the University of New Brunswick are demonstrating new ways to improve energy efficiency, reduce costs and improve reliability of energy sources.

Trade and tourism are a vital part of the Atlantic Canadian economy and both have experienced growth over the past few years. There were nearly 70 more exporters in our region in 2017 compared to 2016Footnote 1. Exports from Atlantic Canada were valued at $30 billion in 2017, an increase of 16 per cent between 2016 and 2017Footnote 2. Since the launch of the Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy in July 2017, partners have been organizing pan-Atlantic initiatives dedicated to international market engagement, including 17 trade missions involving more than 300 participants to countries like China, Europe and the United States. Tourism, meanwhile, is estimated to contribute more than $5 billion annually to the Atlantic Canadian economy. A new pan-Atlantic tourism approach, also announced in July 2017, provides new tools for hundreds of exporters in the tourism industry and promotes the region as a world-class tourism destination. This approach includes the region's largest ever media campaign in China, which builds on the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism. Indigenous tourism experiences offer a unique opportunity to showcase and share the rich history, culture and tradition of communities across the East Coast. An Atlantic chapter of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada was created, which creates a framework for future development in the region.

The federal government, along with the four provincial governments, is supporting the region's infrastructure in an effort to foster long-term economic growth and make communities more inclusive. In July 2017, the Government of Canada announced that over $2.4 billion would be allocated through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to the Atlantic provinces over the next decade for infrastructure projects, a record level of investment. Funding will be provided through integrated bilateral agreements between Infrastructure Canada and each province. This funding builds on $339 million for short-term investments to maintain and repair local infrastructure through Phase 1 of the Investing in Canada Plan, outlined in last year's report.

More than 130 communities across two Atlantic provinces will benefit from upwards of $66 million invested through the federal Connect to Innovate and provincial funding programs, with further investments expected throughout 2018. In addition, the Connecting Canadians Program completed eight of 13 projects across Atlantic Canada. These projects will help Atlantic Canadians take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the digital age.

The Atlantic Growth Strategy's accomplishments have required a high level of collaboration from all partners, coordinated and targeted investments and a clear vision for Atlantic Canada. Through the Strategy, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are committed to keep working collaboratively to advance common priorities for the long-term benefit of the Atlantic economy, including on broadband, skills and immigration in the near-term.

What have we done so far?

Strong federal-provincial collaboration is the hallmark of the Atlantic Growth Strategy as it continues to help create stable, good-paying jobs for Atlantic Canadians. The Strategy helps provide businesses with the tools they need to increase exports, innovate in traditional industries vital to the region's communities, as well as attract and retain skilled workers.

Thanks to the Atlantic Growth Strategy's initiatives to date, a strong foundation has been laid to enable established industries like agriculture, agri-food, fisheries, aquaculture and tourism – as well as emerging industries like clean technology – to innovate and successfully compete in global markets. At the same time, small- and medium-sized businesses are getting the support they need to capitalize on new technologies, attract skilled workers, scale up operations and pursue new export opportunities.

We are also deepening our understanding of the issues facing the region through consultations, best practices and research, including the final report from the Atlantic Growth Advisory Group. The Advisory Group provided their strategic advice and recommendations to help guide the region's collaborative approaches and actions moving forward. New collaborative work has been identified in important areas such as broadband, Indigenous tourism and the development of an export accelerator to help small and medium enterprises access the essential skills, competencies and connections they need to compete on the global stage. Using these tools, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are tailoring their approaches to maximize benefits for the region.

Together these actions have helped the Strategy's longer-term outcomes for each of the five strategic priorities for the region.

Since the July 2017 report on results, the Atlantic Growth Strategy has made progress on the following priorities:

Skilled Workforce and Immigration

Longer-Term Outcome: Admit up to 7,000 additional newcomers to the region by 2020

We are seeing positive results under the three-year Atlantic Immigration Pilot.

This federal and provincial pilot program is helping to attract and retain skilled workers and international graduates in Atlantic Canada. All partners have worked diligently to promote the pilot across the region with more than 700 outreach activities completed, targeting a variety of audiences.

Since the Pilot began accepting applications in March 2017, more Atlantic employers are seeing the potential of immigration to fill labour market needs that cannot be met locally. Atlantic employers have made nearly 1,800 job offers to applicants under the Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program, the Atlantic High-Skilled Program, and the Atlantic International Graduate Program to fill job vacancies. That's a considerable increase from the 250 job offers made at this time last year.

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada launched the Dedicated Service Channel.

Since July 2017, designated employers under the Atlantic Immigration Pilot are receiving personalized support from the Dedicated Service Channel in navigating the process of hiring foreign talent as well as receiving tips and associated guidance on strategies for success following recruitment. More than 200 employers are currently benefitting from these services.

We increased support to Settlement Service Provider Organizations.

Settlement Service Provider Organizations have provided more than 2,100 needs assessments and settlement plans to the Atlantic Immigration Pilot's principal applicants and their accompanying family members in an effort to help families settle in communities across the Atlantic region.

We are promoting the region as a destination of choice for international students and graduates.

The Atlantic provincial governments, with support from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), are expanding the model of EduNova's Study and Stay Program throughout the region to attract and retain international students. The model is being adapted to meet the specific needs of each province and complement existing service offerings. EduNova's Study and Stay program attracted close to 50 international students from China, India and the Philippines and is helping integrate them into their communities and transition to the workforce.

We are providing youth with work integrated learning opportunities.

In Atlantic Canada, a $4.4 million partnership was announced with Venture for Canada, in collaboration with post-secondary institutions and employers, to provide 505 Canadian students across the region with valuable work experience and work-ready skills in business and entrepreneurial fields. Students who participate in these opportunities develop technical and work-ready skills sought after by employers; they are more likely to benefit from greater employment opportunities, be employed in fields more closely related to their studies, and receive higher earnings.

We are helping address skill shortages.

Led by the Council of Atlantic Premiers' Atlantic Workforce Partnership and supported by Employment and Social Development Canada, the Atlantic Apprenticeship Harmonization Project (AAHP) is helping increase apprenticeship completion rates and keeping apprentices in Atlantic Canada. To date, the AAHP has enabled the harmonization of 10 trade occupations and the development and implementation of a new common information technology (IT) system to track apprenticeship certification. By February 2019, an additional six trades will be harmonized and the IT system will be completed.

Once completed, provinces will begin to migrate information from their current IT systems to the new platform. In total, 16 Red Seal trades will be harmonized across Atlantic provinces, thanks to new federal and provincial investments. There are currently approximately 15,000 apprentices in Atlantic Canada and it is expected that all apprentices will be registered in the new IT system by 2020.

Skilled Workforce and Immigration: Real-life Results

I would absolutely recommend the AIP to other employers.

Mike Albert, Cirrus Garments, Saint John, NB

Metamaterial Technologies Inc. (NS) uses innovative technology and advanced manufacturing to develop smart protective materials. The company's Canadian workforce includes global talent representing 15 countries and speaking more than 20 different languages. Metamaterial Technologies is using the Atlantic Immigration Pilot to hire highly skilled experts from around the world. The company is also part of the Accelerated Growth Service and housed at Innovacorp, a Nova Scotia business incubator and accelerator.

Metamaterials are a relatively new scientific field and the work we are doing in laser protection has never been done before. These are exciting times for science and this funding will help us as we move to the next stage of growth, allowing us to advance our manufacturing capacity to produce these new smart material products.

Dr. George Palikaras, Founder and CEO, Metamaterial Technologies Inc.

The Association for New Canadians (NL) helps employers and newcomers and their families through the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program's designation, endorsement and post-arrival processes. Increased settlement services in rural regions will support economic growth, as well as improve retention rates and address persistent and emerging labour market needs. More than $1.2 million was invested in this initiative by the Government of Canada and the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

We have a very close relationship with the (provincial) Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism as well as with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada. We want to help both governments make Atlantic Canada a destination of choice for newcomers and immigrants, and make them comfortable by letting them know that they can set up roots here in the province, and that we will be there to help them make a go of it.

Kip Bonnell, Association for New Canadians

The New Conversations Tour (NB), organized by the New Brunswick Multicultural Council, is a series of 15 community events with two prominent New Brunswick economists. The New Conversations Tour was established to promote awareness of emerging shortages of skilled workers. It is also designed to facilitate more inclusive communities by providing the impetus for discussions on how to attract and keep workers. Events engage local stakeholders in discussions of labour force trends in New Brunswick and the critical need to address population decline through retention, repatriation, and immigration. The events have gathered more than 1,200 individuals so far.

Somru Bioscience (PEI) is a biotechnology company founded in 2012 that develops antibody technology to accelerate the drug development process. The company's vice-president and co-founder, Mohammed Moin, immigrated to PEI on a student visa in 2000. The company currently exports to more than 20 countries and is in the midst of a major expansion. A new joint venture for a diagnostic laboratory in Bangladesh is expected to generate $50 million in export sales over the next five years and add 100 new employees to the company's PEI operations. Somru is hiring two senior scientists using the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program to augment local recruiting.

A number of our employees do come through an immigration process. The AIP has been a benefit in a number of ways for us. Having the support at the provincial and the federal levels for permanent residency has been great. Diversity is something that we value here. We seek out opportunities to look at things differently, to approach things in a different way and diversity really allows us to do that.

Marcia Snow, Citco

Without the AIP, there would be no potential growth for us here. I would absolutely recommend the AIP to other employers, because finding skilled workers in many industries in Canada is getting more difficult and it is a way for our nation to grow its economic development. Without immigration it seems like a lot of industries are going to find challenges in getting new employees.

Mike Albert, Cirrus Garments

I am so pleased that I was told about IRCC's Dedicated Service Channel. My account manager has been instrumental in helping me understand the confusing aspects of hiring foreign workers. I frequently call or email him, and he's always friendly and answers my questions in a timely fashion. Knowing I can reach my account manager at any time, with any question or concern is a big relief for me and my employees.

Shaun McBride, The Learning Bar

We support newcomers by making sure that we work out a settlement plan with them based on their needs. Then we supply the employers with that settlement plan. We're also there for the follow up, so if the employer calls with questions or situations that they're not quite sure how to deal with, we can provide them with some advice and assistance.

Craig Mackie, PEI Association for Newcomers to Canada

Innovation

Longer-Term Outcome: Double the number of high-growth firms in Atlantic Canada by 2025

We are promoting innovation, technology adoption and advanced manufacturing.

With support from partners, Atlantic Canadian companies are investing in advanced equipment, in part to cope with a tightening labour supply. This trend supports productivity improvement and greater export competitiveness.

We are supporting regional clusters of innovation.

In February 2018, the Ocean Supercluster, led by the Atlantic region, was successful in its bid under ISED's Innovative Supercluster Initiative. This initiative will leverage the combined strengths of the industries operating in Canada's oceans. It is projected that this supercluster will create more than 3,000 jobs and add more than $14 billion to Canada's gross domestic product over 10 years. Governments, industries and stakeholders in Atlantic Canada continue to find ways to enhance collaboration in strategic sectors of our economy, including oceans, food and our clean technology companies.

We are enhancing the Accelerated Growth Service in Atlantic Canada.

This service provides customized support in areas such as financing, exporting, and advisory and innovation services to Atlantic companies with high-growth potential. The Atlantic provinces and the Government of Canada signed an agreement to enhance collaboration and create a more streamlined process for companies.

Between July 2017 and July 2018, 29 new Atlantic Canadian companies signed up for the service - nearly double the number that had signed up in the previous year. The total enrolment of 68 companies exceeds the region's target of 60 companies after two years. Ninety companies are expected to go through the service by 2019.

We are helping business incubators and accelerators launch and grow new start-ups.

Atlantic Canadian firms drive innovation activity in the region to promote long-term economic growth. There are more than 400 start-ups across the region, an increase of nearly 60 per cent since 2014. A number of regional incubators and accelerators are supporting this dynamic start-up culture. In an effort to grow employment and revenues, partners are developing a new strategy that builds on success factors and identifies investment priorities.

We are supporting research and innovation in areas such as biosciences, aquaculture, ocean technology, renewable energy, fisheries, agriculture and forestry.

Complementing the Atlantic Growth Strategy, entrepreneurs in Atlantic Canada received more than $140 million in financing in the first year of a two-year $280 million financing package. This package, launched by the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), aims to assist the region's small and mid-sized businesses pursuing growth in information and communication technology, agri-food, ocean technology and tourism.

BDC's $280 million financing commitment for Atlantic Canada represented a $100 million increase in the bank's normal lending volume for the targeted industries.

We are investing more than $400 million through the Atlantic Fisheries Fund to strengthen our fish and seafood sector.

Open for applications since August 2017, the Atlantic Fisheries Fund is helping advance a more sustainable and prosperous fish and seafood sector focused on innovation, infrastructure and science partnerships. This fund is driving innovation in Atlantic Canada's fish and seafood sector to better meet market demands for sustainably sourced, high quality fish and seafood products, and to address the challenges posed by changing oceanographic conditions.

We are finding new ways to support Atlantic Canada's food sector.

Through a federal-provincial working group on food, the governments of Canada and the Atlantic provinces are working with industry to identify ways to leverage strategic opportunities in our region's food sector. The region is ripe with opportunities to share its high quality and sustainable goods with the country and the rest of the world.

We are building awareness of the potential of big data analytics.

We trained 100 federal and provincial staff on big data analytics, which will help staff work with clients to identify opportunities for the use of data analytics in their businesses. These opportunities could include enhancing productivity, making better decisions and/or developing new products and markets. This training will also help staff to refer clients to the appropriate support services for their big data analytics projects.

As a result of this work, 15 Atlantic companies to date have been linked to the National Research Council Data Analytics Centre.

We are working with stakeholders to determine the cultural dimensions of success.

Our partners have conducted an in-depth analysis of business culture and organized an intensive Innovation Lab with business leaders and other key representatives from government, academia and the not-for-profit community. These insights will help tailor our support for Atlantic businesses. We explored attitudes, behaviours and perceptions that affect business growth, innovation and productivity in Atlantic Canada.

We are encouraging opportunities for youth to learn digital skills.

The CanCode Program will invest $50 million across Canada over two years to support initiatives providing opportunities for coding and digital skills development to Canadian youth from kindergarten to grade 12, including $2 million for two Atlantic-led projects. The program helps students and teachers acquire skills and knowledge through coding and digital skills experiences.

Innovation: Real-life Results

VoltaCohort competitions led by Volta Labs of Halifax, Nova Scotia, have led to $250,000 in strategic investments for 10 early-stage high-calibre Atlantic Canadian start-ups to fuel their growth and success.

VoltaCohort (NS), launched by Volta Labs in conjunction with ACOA, BDC and Innovacorp, is a two-year pilot program that was created to help early stage, high calibre companies from across Atlantic Canada find investment. The program has already awarded $250,000 to ten start-ups through its two competitions in November 2017 and May 2018, where 31 start-ups presented their companies for funding. The winners of VoltaCohort's most recent competition included Sydney's Talem Health Analytics and UAV Control Tower of St. John's.

Together with our partners, we look forward to helping these early-stage companies grow and succeed from their home base in Atlantic Canada.

Jesse Rodgers, CEO, Volta Labs

Superior Glove Works Limited (NL) manufactures more than 3,000 styles of work gloves and sleeves with applications in aerospace, agriculture, automotive, construction and other sectors. The growing demand in export markets was driving the need to increase production, which was addressed through the company's participation in the Accelerated Growth Service.

Our industry is considered commodity based. Our company competes with low-cost countries like China and India. We know we won't have the lowest price going in, so we have to add value and innovate.

Tony Geng, President, Superior Glove Works

LuminUltra (NB) is a clean tech solutions company that expanded and modernized its operations in order to accommodate recent rapid growth, along with an anticipated increase in sales volume and research and development projects. This includes the acquisition of new lab equipment as well as leasehold improvements.

Rollo Bay is still employing the same number of people but the jobs are now more technical, translating into better pay and improved retention rates. The company is part of the Accelerated Growth Service.

Clean Growth and Climate Change

Longer-Term Outcome: Reduce GHG emissions

We covered a lot of ground since launching the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change.

The Pan-Canadian Framework outlines more than 50 concrete measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, help the region adapt and become more resilient to the impacts of a changing climate, foster clean technology solutions, and create good jobs that contribute to a stronger economy.

In its first year of implementation, federal, provincial and territorial governments have made good progress in starting to put the framework into action. Work is underway to ensure that carbon pricing systems are in place across Canada by January 1, 2019. Governments are also implementing new policies, programs and regulations to reduce emissions in every sector of the economy, support communities in adapting to a changing climate, and invest in clean technologies.

We are investing more than $185 million in Atlantic Canada through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund.

Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have each leveraged at least $50 million in federal funding to support energy efficiency upgrades in buildings across their provinces. In particular, programming in both provinces is being expanded to allow homeowners who heat their homes with fuel oil to access funding for home retrofits. In Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, several significant opportunities to support clean growth and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, will be funded with support from the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund.

We are investing in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure, across Canada.

For example in 2017, the federal government provided $1.6 million for the installation of electric vehicle fast charging stations in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, through phase 1 of the Electric Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Deployment initiative.

We are serving companies and other stakeholders through the Clean Growth Hub.

The newly created Clean Growth Hub is connecting Atlantic-based companies and other stakeholders to the various supports for clean technology across government. So far, more than 500 companies and industry stakeholders have worked with the Hub, including 30 Atlantic Canadian organizations working to advance their clean technologies.

In addition to the Hub, Sustainable Development Technology Canada, which provides funding for Canadian clean technology projects, also has a presence in Atlantic Canada to provide expertise in the fields of sustainable development, finance and technology investment to help Atlantic Canadian companies move their ground-breaking technologies to market.

We are continuing to advance work on regional electricity grids and renewable power generation.

Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), working together with the Governments of the Atlantic Provinces and their electric utilities, and the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, finalized an initial study under the Regional Electricity Cooperation and Strategic Infrastructure initiative that identifies the most promising electricity infrastructure projects that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Atlantic Canada. The study identifies reinforcement of the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick transmission intertie as a promising project for transitioning Atlantic Canada to clean electricity.

NRCan is currently working with the governments of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and their electric utilities to assess the costs and benefits of the project to the two jurisdictions, with a view toward advancing this important infrastructure project.

We are protecting Atlantic Canada's forests from the damaging effects of a spruce budworm outbreak.

Through Budget 2018, the Government of Canada proposed to take action alongside the Governments of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the forest industry, by providing up to $74 million over four years and $750,000 ongoing, to prevent the spread of spruce budworm and the associated socio-economic and environmental impacts of an outbreak.

Co-sponsored by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Phase II of the Early Intervention Strategy for Spruce Budworm research program supports the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, as tree mortality caused by an outbreak will negatively affect greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts. Preventing an outbreak and protecting Atlantic Canada's forest resource will also ensure that forestry remains a vital driver of the region's economy and a source of jobs and opportunities.

Clean Growth and Climate Change: Real-Life Results

Trade and Investment

Longer-Term Outcome: Double the number of exporters in Atlantic Canada by 2025

We are implementing the multi-year, international Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy, supported by a $20 million funding agreement.

The Atlantic Trade and Investment Growth Strategy, announced in July 2017, supports joint trade and investment initiatives that are coordinated, firm-focused, and built on the region's sector capabilities and capacity.

Since 2017, pan-Atlantic initiatives (in addition to bilateral and unilateral initiatives) dedicated to international market engagements included 17 trade missions, involving more than 300 participants.

We are growing awareness of export opportunities to Europe.

The recent Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is creating significant opportunities for our region.

To prepare for these opportunities, we organized two multi-sector trade missions to the European Union with Atlantic Canadian companies in June and November 2017. These trade missions resulted in more than 139 qualified sales leads and 63 potential sales deals reported by participants.

Partners also held a Canada-Europe Trade Agreement Roadshow to generate awareness of the European market. These sessions drew in approximately 320 business participants from across all four Atlantic provinces.

We are providing the tools to support our current and future exporters.

LearnSphere's bilingual Export Market Access Program (EMAP) and E-Tools for Exporting (E for E), which saw investments of $3 million, help firms develop and expand their sales to international markets.

As of April 30, 2018, these programs provided support for nearly 130 companies and almost half of them were new exporters. LearnSphere will help more than 180 companies across Atlantic Canada reach their export goals by the end of 2018 through the EMAP and E for E programs.

We are preparing an Atlantic Growth Strategy joint trade mission to China.

China is Canada's second largest trading partner after the United States.

This multi-sectoral trade and investment mission will take place in November 2018. It will support Atlantic Canadian businesses and organizations in the food, clean growth, education and tourism sectors that are looking to create new partnerships and build business-to-business relationships in China. It will also capitalize on the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism.

We hosted Rendez-Vous Canada, Canada's premier international tourism marketplace.

Held in Halifax, Nova Scotia over four days, it brought together more than 1,900 tourism professionals to promote or discover unique Canadian experiences, particularly those showcasing national priority products such as Indigenous and culinary tourism. The event has the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for Canadian tourism businesses and was supported by the new Atlantic Canada Tourism Strategy, announced in July 2017.

We are implementing a strategic and collaborative approach to tourism.

The strategy includes $24.5 million in federal-provincial-industry investments for three initiatives aimed at positioning Atlantic Canada as a top destination in the global tourism sector, creating more jobs for Atlantic Canadians and giving a boost to small businesses. More than 120 Atlantic Canada tourism stakeholders were trained through the Atlantic Growth Strategy Travel Trade Market Readiness Program with a series of webinars and workshops on how to work with international travel trade. The Tourism International Market Expansion Program is supporting the Government of Canada's target of doubling Chinese visitation to Canada by 2021.

We are supporting Indigenous tourism in Atlantic Canada.

The Atlantic chapter of the Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada was created in June 2017 to build a framework for future development in the region.

We are also supporting the development of tourism strategies and products in communities that wish to pursue tourism as an economic driver. For example, a delegation of Nova Scotia First Nations participated in Edge of the Wedge in November 2017, Canada's premier experiential travel training program led by the Gros Morne Institute of Sustainable Tourism. The program is hosted at the Gros Morne National Park in Newfoundland and Labrador, a leading center of expertise in experiential tourism.

We continue to implement the Collaborative Procurement Initiative across all four Atlantic Provinces with over 20 Municipalities, Academic Institutions and School Boards now participating in Atlantic Canada.

The initiative enables partners, including provincial governments, municipalities, academic institutions, school boards, and hospitals, to leverage Public Services and Procurement Canada's federal instruments and buying power to procure goods and services to obtain better value for money.

With over $200 billion spent annually on public procurement in Canada, this initiative provides opportunities to save taxpayers' money, negotiate better terms and conditions, reduce administrative costs, simplify processes, make it easier for businesses to sell to multiple levels of government, and to expand their market. In addition to reducing costs, federal procurement instruments help to support the use of clean and sustainable goods and services.

So far, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have been able to save more than 30 per cent on the cost of emergency radios and environmental office paper when using federal tools, while negotiating better terms and conditions from suppliers. For example, a locally owned business (Covey Basics) is providing office supplies to the Province of Prince Edward Island, who is receiving better value.

With the introduction of a Canadian Collaborative Procurement Plan in December 2017, more of these success stories are expected.

Trade and Investment: Real-life Results

95 Atlantic Canadian tourism stakeholders took part in TIME's China Readiness initiative to help prepare a great experience for Chinese visitors during the 2018 Canada-China Year of Tourism - and beyond.

G.E. Barbours currently reports a significant increase in anticipated export sales with strong potential to break into the European market.

Infrastructure

Longer-Term Outcome: Bring rural and remote areas online by 2025

We are building better infrastructure in Atlantic Canada that will support growth, and engage and connect people.

Building on nearly $339 million from Budget 2016 for short-term investments to maintain and repair local infrastructure in the region, the Atlantic provinces will see more than $2.4 billion over the next decade for infrastructure projects.

In addition, 28 municipalities across Atlantic Canada applied to the Smart Cities Challenge.

The LEAPS project portfolio reads like a field guide to practical energy solutions.
In Arizona, the broad partnership with the Hopi Tribe is an exemplar of locally led, culturally aware electrification that is supported by LEAPS technical assistance.
“It equips people with the skills and leadership needed to deliver the energy solutions where they’re needed most.” Johnson is blunt about the scale and urgency required to meet future energy needs.
As LEAPS turns 10, its message is part technical, part civic: Clean, resilient energy is possible when universities turn ideas into solutions.","Nathan Johnson doesn't mince words when it comes to Earth's energy requirements.

“The world needs every electron it can get to match the accelerated pace of economic development and electrification,” says Johnson, a professor of engineering in The Polytechnic School, part of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University. “In the United States, meeting that surge won’t come from a single technology, business model or policy.”

That insight is both the organizing idea and the challenge facing the next decade. With data-center growth, the electrification of industry, the rise of artificial intelligence and onshoring of manufacturing, U.S. electricity demand is set to climb steeply in the next 10 years. This trend is advancing even faster in other countries.

The future will require practical, scalable solutions that knit together power generation, storage, smarter grids, workforce development and finance. That’s exactly the work ASU’s Laboratory for Energy And Power Solutions, or LEAPS, has been dedicated to for the last decade.

The LEAPS pitch is simple and urgent: translate university innovations into real infrastructure and the workforce at scale. The lab’s 10-year report shows $332 million mobilized, 161 megawatts of clean capacity-enabled and reliable power for over 100,000 people. The team also also trained thousands of workers across the energy sector and government.

Those headline numbers aren’t theory. They are evidence that the lab’s solutions and extension services model can deliver infrastructure, policy advice and trained people where it matters most.

The LEAPS project portfolio reads like a field guide to practical energy solutions. In Arizona, the broad partnership with the Hopi Tribe is an exemplar of locally led, culturally aware electrification that is supported by LEAPS technical assistance.

The Hopi face a persistent lack of access to energy. Even grid-connected homes experience a higher-than-normal number of outages due to dated infrastructure. LEAPS is working with the tribe and local partners to change that by bringing solar energy to homes and community spaces, strengthening power lines to make them more reliable, installing microgrids and training Hopi residents to maintain and manage these new systems. The project also builds lasting partnerships between the tribe, utilities, universities and local businesses to support energy independence and create long-term jobs for Hopi people.

The partnership encompasses several projects with technical and community-driven design. James Nelson, director of technology and innovation for LEAPS, notes that the work explicitly links energy access to job creation for a community hit hard by the closure of coal facilities.

“The project delivers cost-effective, reliable and locally managed power to Hopi households,” Nelson says. “By bringing electricity where no other options exist, we’re supporting energy sovereignty, economic opportunity and long-term resilience for the Hopi Tribe.”

Globally, LEAPS applies the same modular, partnership-driven playbook. In Fiji, the LEAPS team worked with the government to assess and prepare 75 sites for mini-grid power systems. Their work laid the foundation for about $40 million in upcoming construction projects and created new training opportunities to build a skilled clean energy workforce across the South Pacific.

In Madagascar, LEAPS helped produce an integrated energy plan that maps clean cooking and electrification pathways with prioritized investments that can reach universal access by 2030.

In Kenya, technical assistance and business coaching helped women-led energy firms scale, producing an estimated 14,000 new systems and a 48-fold multiplier of private follow-on capital. Across refugee relief, microgrid pilot projects, military resilience programs and municipal microgrid studies, LEAPS emphasizes deployable designs, local ownership models and measurable returns on capital.

What distinguishes LEAPS is a focus on scalable project development and a technical assistance model that amplifies finance.

“We’ve built a model where every dollar LEAPS spends attracts $10 to $50 more,” Johnson says. “That’s how you turn good ideas into large-scale impact.”

The lab’s teams do the engineering, shape business models, work with regulators and utilities, and then test systems — often using the lab’s Grid Modernization Proving Grounds and a mobile training trailer — so private and public partners can move quickly from pilot to procurement to construction.

This is how LEAPS turns pilots into programs: standardize the technical solution, reduce procurement risk, train operators and managers locally, and create financing structures that make projects investable.

One project paid for itself in just 18 months by using smart energy management to make better use of existing infrastructure instead of installing new capital assets.

LEAPS is also a campus-to-community engine. The lab has engaged over 300 students directly in projects and provided hands-on training and internships that translate classroom curiosity into career paths.

“Our microgrid proving grounds give people hands-on experience with real power assets,” Johnson says. “Most students come in with curiosity and passion. Our job is to pair that energy with opportunity and give them options to explore where they want to best fit in the energy economy.”

Alexander Mobley, associate director of technology evaluation and workforce development, explains that LEAPS runs professional courses that reach utility executives, U.S. Department of War personnel and frontline technicians, building the human capital needed to implement the technical solutions they design.

“Training isn’t an afterthought; it’s the foundation of our work,” Mobley says. “It equips people with the skills and leadership needed to deliver the energy solutions where they’re needed most.”

Johnson is blunt about the scale and urgency required to meet future energy needs.

“What the U.S. built in the last 100 years needs to be built again in the next 10. But we don’t have the people, materials or policies to do it the same way.”

The implication is not nostalgia for old infrastructure, but a call to do more with smarter designs, match demand to clean generation, tighten asset utilization and avoid the inefficiencies of overbuilding. That’s the pragmatic, all-of-the-above stance LEAPS brings to policymakers and communities.

As LEAPS turns 10, its message is part technical, part civic: Clean, resilient energy is possible when universities turn ideas into solutions.

The LEAPS portfolio — Hopi electrification, multi-island mini-grids, national energy planning, refugee clinics with solar power, women-led business support, technology transfer, technical consulting and military resilience programs — shows how a single lab can move ideas into durable projects by combining engineering, finance, policy and training.

If the next decade is defined by an intensifying energy demand curve, then institutions that can translate innovation into infrastructure and training at scale will define success.

“We want to formalize our approach to solutions and extension services and expand it beyond energy into other sectors of the economy,” Johnson says. “I think that’s emblematic of ASU’s spirit in the New American University.”

Frequently asked questions: Who is a qualified third-party?
Where do I find a qualified third-party to inspect my project or approve plans?
The Texas Solar Energy Society (TXSES) is the residential rooftop solar industry’s nonprofit statewide organization that can help identify qualified third-parties for installers.
The third-party is liable for damages resulting from their own negligent acts or omissions in conducting the review or inspection.","The adoption of solar energy in Texas is getting a major boost! Thanks to Senate Bill 1202, which passed in the 89th Texas legislative session and is now in effect, the time-consuming process of getting permits and inspections for residential solar and battery storage systems can now be streamlined. This new law gives both homeowners and solar installers a powerful new tool to bypass long delays from local authorities, making the path to clean, resilient home power much faster and more predictable.

This article breaks down how this new, optional permitting path works, what it covers, and the steps installers must follow.

What is SB 1202 and What Does It Cover?

SB 1202 creates an alternative path for the review and inspection of residential backup power systems—installations designed to provide power to a single- or two-family home and connected at 600 volts or less. This includes:

Rooftop Solar

Battery Energy Storage Systems

Generators

Other electricity generation or storage 600 volts or less

The bill allows installers to utilize qualified third-parties to perform the plan reviews and inspections that were historically done only by the local municipality, or the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ). While cities are not required to speed up their own processes, installers can now choose this third-party option to accelerate their projects.

The Third-Party Permitting Process

Step 1: Choosing the Third-Party Path

The process begins with the installer deciding whether to use the AHJ (the city) or a qualified third-party for either the plan review, the project inspection, or both.If the installer chooses the AHJ, the process remains the same as before, with no mandated deadline for the city to complete the review or inspection.

If the installer chooses a qualified third party, the third party will then need the AHJ’s applicable code and regulations. The AHJ must publish their applicable code and regulations online or provide them upon request within 2 business days. If the AHJ does not publish or provide the code and regulations within this timeframe, the third party may use the applicable section of the International Residential Code.

Step 2: Review and Inspection by the Qualified Third-Party

Once the third-party has the necessary code information, they conduct the required plan review and/or inspection. While the third-party is not required to conduct the plan review or inspection within a certain timeframe, they will be paid for this service by the installer so they are expected to be timely. It is also important to note that virtual inspections and using automated rooftop solar permitting tools like SolarAPP+ are explicitly allowed in the legislation.

Step 3: Notification and Beginning Construction

Whenever the third party has completed the plan review and/or inspection, they must submit the documents and a notice to the AHJ within 15 days of it being completed.

Once the third party has notified the AHJ that this installation is utilizing a third party under SB1202 and provides the documentation of plan review and/or inspection, the installer may begin construction of the project. The AHJ may not require a fee for the plan review or inspection that was done by the third party.

Step 4: Final Permit Issuance

Within three business days of receiving the notice and documents from the qualified third-party, the AHJ must issue the appropriate final approval, permit, or certification for the project.

Frequently asked questions:

Who is a qualified third-party?

Third parties for permit review and/or inspection include:

Master electricians

Certified electrical inspectors

Individuals employed by a Texas AHJ to review development documents

Licensed engineers

The third party may not be the homeowner or installer.

Does this apply to permits or fees for interconnection with transmission and distribution utilities (TDUs), utility co-ops, or municipally owned utilities?

This law does not apply to interactions with transmission and distribution utilities, however many TDUs do require a permit from the AHJ, which is provided in the third-party process within 3 business days of the AHJ receiving notice from the third-party that the project has been approved.

Where do I find a qualified third-party to inspect my project or approve plans?

The Texas Solar Energy Society (TXSES) is the residential rooftop solar industry’s nonprofit statewide organization that can help identify qualified third-parties for installers.

If the inspection or plan permit results in damage, who is liable?

The third-party is liable for damages resulting from their own negligent acts or omissions in conducting the review or inspection. The AHJ is not liable for damage resulting from third-party reviews or inspections.",https://environmentamerica.org/texas/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/131017-F-PB776-001.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:30.877180

An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program.","California’s last nuclear power plant overcame a regulatory hurdle on Thursday when the California Coastal Commission voted to approve keeping the plant open for at least five years.

It was one of the final obstacles the controversial Diablo Canyon Power Plant had to clear to continue operating amid renewed opposition. The decision was conditioned on a plan that would require Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the plant, to conserve about 4,000 acres of land on its property. That would prevent it from ever being developed for commercial or residential use.

The plant, located along the San Luis Obispo shoreline, now awaits federal approval for a 20-year relicensing permit.

“I don’t think, unfortunately, that anything will be happening to Diablo Canyon soon,” due to the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence, Commissioner Jaime Lee said before voting to approve the permit. Nine of the 12 voting members approved the plan.

The deliberations reignited decades-old concerns about the dangers of nuclear power and its place in the state’s portfolio of renewable energy sources. Diablo Canyon is the state’s single-largest energy source, providing nearly 10% of all California electricity.

Defeated in their earlier attempts to shut the plant, critics of Diablo Canyon used months of Coastal Commission hearings as one of their last opportunities to vocalize their disdain for the facility. Some Democratic lawmakers supported the plant but pushed for PG&E to find more ways to protect the environment.

Sen. John Laird, Democrat of San Luis Obispo County and former secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, said on Thursday he approved of the new plan but pushed the commission to require the utility to conserve even more of its total 12,000 surrounding acres.

“If what comes out of this is the path for preservation for 8,000 acres of land, that is a remarkable victory,” Laird said.

Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis, whose district encompasses the plant, had also urged the commission in a letter to approve a permit “once it contains strong mitigation measures that reflect the values and needs of the surrounding tribal and local communities who depend on our coastal regions for environmental health, biodiversity and economic vitality.”

A long history of controversy

Founded in 1985, the plant’s striking concrete domes sit along the Pacific coast 200 miles north of Los Angeles. The facility draws in 2 million gallons of water from the ocean every day to cool its systems

And it has remained shrouded in controversy since its construction 40 years ago. Environmentalists point to the damage it causes to marine life, killing what the Coastal Commission estimates are 2 billion larval fish a year.

The commissioners on Thursday were not deciding whether to allow the plant to stay open but were weighing how best to lessen the environmental impacts of its operation. A 2022 state law forced the plant to stay open for five more years past its planned 2025 closure date, which could have led to significant political blowback against the Coastal Commission if it had rejected the permit.

Gov. Gavin Newsom reversed a 2016 agreement made between environmental groups and worker unions to close the plant after the state faced a series of climate disasters that spurred energy blackouts. Popular sentiment toward nuclear energy has also continued to grow more supportive as states across the country consider revitalizing dormant and aging nuclear plants to fulfill ever-increasing energy demand needs.

The 2022 law authorized a $1.4 billion loan to be paid back with federal loans or profits.

Groups such as the Environmental Defense Center and Mothers for Peace opposed the permit outright, citing concerns about radioactive waste, which can persist for centuries, and its cost to taxpayers.

“We maintain that any extension of Diablo is unnecessary,” and that its continued operations could slow the development of solar and wind energy, Jeremy Frankel, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Center told the commission Thursday.

The California Public Utilities Commission last year approved $723 million in ratepayer funds toward Diablo Canyon’s operating costs this year. It was the first time rate hikes were spread to ratepayers of other utilities such as Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric and was authorized by lawmakers because the plant provides energy to the entire state.

How the plant will be funded has also garnered scrutiny in the years since Newsom worked to keep it open. Last year, the Legislature nearly canceled a $400 million loan to help finance it.

As much as $588 million is unlikely to come back due to insufficient federal funding and projected profits, CalMatters has reported.

Proponents of the plant pointed to its reliability, carbon-free pollution and the thousands of jobs it has created.

Business advocacy groups emphasized their support for the plant as boosting the economy.

“It is an economic lifeline that helps keep our communities strong and competitive,” Dora Westerlund, president of the Fresno Area Hispanic Foundation, said at a November meeting.

The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.

Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.

The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.

Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute will categorize cancer patients as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.

Registries currently specify whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.

President Donald Trump in January issued an executive order stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.

“In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.

Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.

Missing the Big Picture

Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.

“When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.

“The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”

For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.

Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents 97% of the U.S. population. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering nearly half the U.S. population.

The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.

For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying rising rates of colorectal cancer among people younger than 50. As a result, U.S. guidelines now recommend that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.

States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women. The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas initiated a statewide effort aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.

“Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”

The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.

For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.

The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.

In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”

‘Backwards’ Progress

NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.

According to an analysis of CDC data by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.

Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.

“Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.

A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were two to three times as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.

A Canadian study concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a 2023 study from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.

Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.

There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”

The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.

Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and stopping specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.

Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”

There is a new cost to hiring an international worker to fill a vital but otherwise vacant position in a California classroom: $100,000.

In September, the Trump administration began requiring American employers to pay a $100,000 sponsorship fee for new H-1B visas, on top of already required visa application fees that amount to $9,500 to $18,800, depending on various factors. These visas allow skilled and credentialed workers in multiple job sectors to stay in the U.S.

Most foreign workers on H-1Bs in California work in the tech sector. But California also relies on H-1B visas to address another issue: a nationwide teacher shortage and a high demand for staff in dual-language education and special education in K-12 districts.

Data from the California Department of Education shows school districts filed more than 300 visa applications for the 2023-24 school year, double the amount from just two years earlier. Educators and school officials say its overseas workers on visas are highly skilled, instrumental in multilingual education, and fill historically understaffed positions in special education.

Now education leaders are sounding the alarm that the high additional fee for overseas workers will worsen the strain on California’s public education system.

International employees fill a much-needed gap for school districts

California continues to face an ongoing teacher shortage. In 2023, California K-12 schools staffed 46,982 positions with employees whose credentials did not align with their job assignments, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Another 22,012 educator positions were left vacant that year. Of total misassignments and vacancies, around 28% were in English language development and 11.9% were in special education.

California school districts have also resorted to hiring teachers who haven’t yet obtained certain credentials, according to a study by the nonprofit Learning Policy Institute. Facing a need for teachers, school districts have found that trained professionals from other countries are willing — and qualified — to take classroom jobs that would otherwise go unfilled.

In 2023, in the Bay Area east of San Francisco, West Contra Costa Unified School District had 381 misassigned positions and 711 vacancies, according to the commission. So the district turned to foreign educators, hiring about 88 teachers on H-1B visas — a majority from the Philippines, Spain and Mexico — to teach in mostly dual-language and special education programs, said Sylvia Greenwood, the assistant superintendent for human resources at the district.

“With our shortages in special ed, they were a good fit for our district. And so, therefore, we kept that pipeline open and brought teachers here from the Philippines to support our students and our students with special needs,” Greenwood said.

The decline in the number of credentialed special education teachers continues to worsen. Between 2020 and 2024, the number of credentials earned to teach special education decreased by almost 600 across California, according to data from the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. The number of temporary permits and waivers granted by the commission increased by about 300 during the same period.

Francisco Ortiz, the president of United Teachers of Richmond and a teacher at Ford Elementary School in West Contra Costa, said the workload for teachers in the district will increase if West Contra Costa Unified is unable to bring in new international teachers.

This would create “greater instability” for students, he said, adding, “It's going to have a great impact in special education, which is already on fire.”

California school district officials say they are unsure they can pay the new fee to fill hiring gaps with international employees. West Contra Costa officials said they do not know yet who will be responsible for paying the new fee: the district, international teachers themselves or another party.

“We are a district that is dealing with a structural deficit as well, and so that cost, in a lot of ways, is going to be very difficult for our district or really any school district, to be able to take that on,” said Cheryl Cotton, the superintendent for West Contra Costa.

It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign.

— Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with L.A.-based Justice Action Center

Pasadena Unified, in Southern California, filed about a dozen applications for H-1B visa sponsorships in 2024. Now the district, facing a $27 million budget deficit, will require those applying for H-1B visas to pay for it themselves, according to district spokesperson Hilda Ramirez Horvath. She said foreign employees will also no longer receive other types of financial support, including legal or filing fees related to immigration processing.

Language programs benefit from international teachers

District officials are also worried about the cultural costs of losing international educators. Educators on H-1B visas make dual-language public schools possible, giving families in California a unique multicultural education that sticks with their children for life.

Kelleen Peckham, a mother to two children in West Contra Costa, said she chose to transfer her daughter to Washington Elementary School in Richmond because it has a dual-language immersion program that teaches students to speak and read Spanish.

Peckham also plans to send her son, who will start kindergarten next year, to the same school even though it takes the family an extra 15 minutes to drive there.

“My husband's family is from Mexico, and so [their] grandmother, on one side, only speaks Spanish,” Peckham said. “It's important for [them] to be able to communicate with [their] family and extended family.”

She said if the dual-language immersion program at Washington Elementary doesn’t survive, she would consider transferring her children back to the school in their neighborhood.

Fee spells ‘Keep Out’ to foreign workers

Within weeks of the fee’s announcement, a coalition of international worker groups, unions and religious organizations sued the Trump administration, alleging the fee would inhibit staffing in education, medicine and ministry services.

“It’s essentially a giant ‘Keep Out’ sign for prospective individuals looking to utilize the visa process to be able to come to the United States and fill these roles and provide these services,” said Laura Flores-Perilla, an attorney with the Justice Action Center, a Los Angeles-based immigration litigation group representing the coalition in its lawsuit.

“It's not just going to hurt these individuals who have this pathway to do this, but it's also going to hurt employers within the United States,” Flores-Perilla said.

Although the fee only applies to new visa applicants, many international teachers are feeling less welcomed to work and live in the states. A.F., an international elementary school teacher in the West Contra Costa Unified School District, said many teachers are still concerned the federal government will announce new policy changes that could force them to leave the U.S.

“I feel like it's a form of discrimination to impose [a] $100,000 fee for teachers,” A.F. said.

A.F., who is currently on an H-1B visa, asked to only give his initials because he fears speaking publicly will affect his ability to receive a green card in the future. He immigrated from the Philippines to California five years ago on a J-1 visa before transferring to an H-1B visa at the beginning of 2025. J-1 visas allow visitors to temporarily stay in the U.S. to participate in certain programs, including teaching, studying, conducting research and more, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

A.F. said the district previously paid for all of his immigration costs for his H-1B visa, which amounted to more than $3,700 for processing fees and an immigration attorney.

The future is uncertain for H-1B visa hopefuls

H.R., a physical education teacher in West Contra Costa who works on a short-term J-1 visa, said he moved his family from Mexico to the U.S. three years ago to work at one of the district’s high schools because he felt it would be safer to raise his daughter in the U.S. H.R. requested to use only his initials because he doesn’t want to jeopardize his ability to apply for the H-1B visa in the future.

“My biggest reason [for moving] is my daughter,” he said. “Me and my wife decided that it would be a good chance for her [and] a big opportunity to learn the language and to grow up in a different environment.”

H.R. can’t apply for the H-1B visa because he missed the deadline and West Contra Costa Unified is now unlikely to pay for his immigration fees. After his visa expires in June 2026, H.R. will move back to Mexico with his family and reapply for the J-1 visa in hopes of returning to California.

“Everybody says here that they need teachers in California … but they don't want to do anything to [help us stay] here,” H.R. said.

At the Los Angeles Unified School District, spokesperson Christy Hagen said in an email to CalMatters that the recent visa changes have not yet impacted the school’s hiring of educators on H-1B visas. Hagen said the district’s immigration experts were “still evaluating the effect of this order.”

Maria Miranda, a representative for United Teachers Los Angeles — the union for Los Angeles Unified teachers — said the district had, as of mid-November, not provided any guidance to its educators or schools on how H-1B visa hopefuls would be supported.

Flores-Perilla, the attorney bringing the lawsuit against the Trump administration, says no hearings have been set in their case yet. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has now also brought a lawsuit over the $100,000 fee, arguing that the proclamation overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and harms U.S. employers.

For now, districts will have to wait on the results of either lawsuit to potentially see some relief in immigration costs.

“It's absolutely unfeasible to be able to pay this fee [and] to be able to actually bring in prospective employees in their fields and industries, so it's going to hurt everyone,” Flores-Perilla said.

The Trump administration is proposing new rules that would further tighten its grip on who's allowed into the U.S., asking visitors from several dozen countries that benefit from visa-free travel to hand over their social media history and other personal information.

The new conditions were unveiled in a notice from the Department of Homeland Security earlier this week and are open for public comment and review for 60 days before going into effect.

The proposed measure applies to citizens from the 42 countries that belong to the visa waiver program and currently don't require visas for tourist or business visits to the U.S. Those foreign citizens would now have to submit five years' worth of their social media activity to be considered for entry.

They'd also have to provide emails they have used for the past 10 years, as well as phone numbers and home addresses of immediate family members. Officials would also be able to scrutinize IP addresses and metadata from electronically submitted photos.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the mandatory social media requirement is designed to comply with President Donald Trump's January executive order ""to protect its citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology, or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes."" However, they have not defined what type of online activity may constitute a threat.

Under the current visa waiver program, tourists can bypass the visa application process, which can take months to years. Instead, they pay $40 and submit an online application using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA. It's accessible to citizens of U.S. allied countries, including Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. But that system may also get an overhaul if the latest changes take effect. The notice proposes eliminating online applications, moving to a mobile-only platform.

This is the latest step in the Trump administration's escalation of restrictions and surveillance of international travelers, foreign students and immigrants. In June, the State Department announced it will begin reviewing the social media accounts of foreign students. Earlier this month, the department instructed its staff to reject visa applications — primarily H-1B — from people who worked on fact-checking, content moderation or other activities, citing it as ""censorship"" of Americans' speech.

These latest proposed changes are not that different from those already in place for visa applicants, Marissa Montes, a professor at Loyola Law School, and director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic, told NPR.

""It's always been something that the government can ask for and has asked for in the past,"" Montes said. ""The question is, how will [ESTA applicants] be screened by CPB? Will it be something they have to submit ahead of time or will it be an officer at a point of entry? We still don't know how the administration expects to implement this.""

In the past, she said, such screenings occurred at the point of entry and that ""it's always been discretionary if the officer wants to ask for it or not.""

What is most troubling, Montes added, is that there are no explicit guidelines defining what qualifies as harmful to the United States.

""The problem is that when it comes to immigration policy and directives like this is that it's very broad and discretionary, meaning that the agent that is receiving this order has a lot of discretion to then interpret what can be viewed as anti-American,"" she said. ""But we have seen that be interpreted as anything that goes against the Trump administration or is going against a value of the Trump administration.""

Montes said she advises her clients to be mindful of not just their own online posts, but also posts they've liked, commented on and re-posted, which can be grounds for a denial or even a permanent ban from the U.S. For example, if someone has posts regarding casual drug use, or pictures of firearms, they can be viewed as a potential threat to the government. She said agents are also on the look out for posts that can be construed as pro-socialist or communist.

She cautions people not to eliminate their social media presence entirely, saying it's ""become a red flag"" for officials.

""Our immigration laws bar certain types of conduct because of immigration bias … so you really have to be careful about what you put out there,"" she warned. ""As I always tell my clients, if I can find the information, the government certainly can.""

Chop suey was once a classic Chinese American dish enjoyed on December 25 — a day when most other restaurants were closed — by Jews and other non-Christians.

These days, we tend to think of chop suey as a mishmash of stir-fried ingredients that emerged from immigrant communities in the United States. But its roots run deep, says Miranda Brown, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She wrote a 2021 article called ""The Hidden, Magnificent History of Chop Suey"" for the website Atlas Obscura.

""It's a dish that is chopped offal,"" she says. ""Lung, liver, tripe, kidneys.""

Yes, originally chop suey was primarily made of organ meats. Brown is quick to note that offal is flavorful, rich in nutrients, and was enjoyed widely until a few generations ago, thanks, in part to industrial meat packaging processes.

""It can be chewy, it can be buttery, it can be kind of rubbery,"" Brown says of offal's distinctive textures. ""For some people, that's really kind of exciting. Bouncy!""

The origins of the dish itself bounces back hundreds of years, she says, to imperial China.

""We have references to chop suey in Ming Dynasty texts,"" she notes. ""The Journey to the West, which is a famous novel [from the 16th century], has a reference to chop suey. You will find it on fancy banquet menus. A version of the dish was even eaten at the Qing court.""

When Chinese immigrants to the U.S. in the mid-1800s wanted to impress local officials, Brown says, they held banquets similar to ones back home, with 300-course meals that would get written up in local newspapers, in articles marveling over delicacies such as Peking duck, chop suey and bird's nest soup.

""All the bling foods that were popular when you had to [build] a good relationship with a person who had a lot of say about your life,"" Brown says.

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricted immigration heavily, but Chinese restaurants still spread rapidly across the United States. By the early 1900s, chop suey had become a cultural phenomenon, a beloved ambassador dish to what had been an unfamiliar cuisine to many Americans.

Louis Armstrong recorded a song in 1926 called ""Cornet Chop Suey."" The 1958 musical Flower Drum Song dedicated an entire number to it. And in the movie A Christmas Story, set in the 1940s and based on the writings of Jean Shepherd, a white, Midwestern, working-class family celebrates Christmas at a Chinese restaurant called the Bo Ling Chop Suey Palace.

""It was exotic,"" Brown says. ""It involves a little bit of adventure, and it is a name that people can pronounce.""

But by the late 20th century, chop suey had fallen out of fashion. Brown says she never saw it on menus in her home city of San Francisco in the 1980s, when she was growing up. By then, Americans had deepened their appreciation of Chinese food, thanks in large part to popular cookbook author, PBS host and restaurateur Cecilia Chiang.

Before she died in 2020 at the age of 100, Chiang told NPR she thought it was hilarious how so many Americans had believed that the contemporary versions of chop suey were authentic. ""They think, oh, chop suey is the only thing we have in China,"" she said in a 2017 NPR interview. ""What a shame!""

""I think for her, it had just evolved to the point where it was no longer recognizable,"" says Miranda Brown, whose own mixed heritage is half white, half Chinese. ""Foods evolve. I always think, if I met my great-great-grandparents, would they recognize me? Would they see elements of their faces in mine or my daughter's? And I would guess not. Something similar happened with Chinese food in America. When a dish leaves, a hundred years later it has evolved, a lot.""

And perhaps it's about time, Brown says, for chop suey's next evolution: to make a comeback.

You can see it in the skyline, the neighborhoods and the factories reborn as tech hubs. But under that grit lies unseen problems — polluted air, contaminated water, aging infrastructure and a city still dealing with the long-term effects of its industrial history.

Wayne State University's Grand Challenges initiative directly confronts these problems, serving as a call to action for researchers committed to making actual progress.

“We wanted themes that matter to Detroiters,” said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation. “These challenges had to be connected to what communities tell us they’re living with every day — air quality, water, health and the environment.”

Among the four themes in the initiative, one stands out in a city defined by the Great Lakes, auto exhaust and environmental justice: How do we build sustainable environments that improve both quality of life and length of life?

Across Midtown, Wayne State researchers are seeking answers grounded in Detroit’s realities.

If there’s one message Dr. Carol Miller keeps coming back to, it’s this: water connects everything.

Miller, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, is a long-time leader in Great Lakes research. Her work shows how chemicals from everyday products — medicines, cleaners, cosmetics — move through wastewater systems before winding up in rivers and lakes. But when asked about the most important step toward a sustainable environment, she didn’t start with labs or technology. She started with people.

“To improve quality of life in Detroit,” she said, “the most immediate impact comes from raising people out of poverty and supporting the needs of their communities.”

When Dr. Miller focuses strictly on environmental factors, she points to issues that have haunted the Motor City for decades. “I would say the removal or mitigation of legacy environmental pollutants,” she said. “These cause a long-term impact on health and quality of life.”

That includes cleaning up chemicals left behind by old gas stations, dry cleaners and factories.

Air pollution is another priority.

“Transportation exhaust continues to be a huge concern in pockets of the city,” she said. “I’m confident that if that air pollution could be reduced, the length of life and the quality of life of people in those areas would be improved.”

Her research also includes identifying and tracking contaminants below our feet — in the soil, groundwater and the myriad of water infrastructure piping under Southeast Michigan. Dr. Miller’s group studies sustainable remediation that includes approaches to harvest energy from polluting sources. But her message never strays far: science only matters if it improves lives.

“One of the critical steps is greater use of the One Health approach,” she said. “We need to break down the silos between human health, animal health, environmental health and economic health.”

Dr. Kishore Gopalakrishnan, a research scientist in the Department of Biological Sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, sees wastewater differently than most people.

Where many see something that’s thrown away, he sees nutrients, carbon and possibilities. “Our aim is to grow microalgae in wastewater so we can remove the nitrogen and phosphorus before it reaches rivers or lakes,” he explained. Those nutrients are exactly what fuel harmful algal blooms.

Then the algae become a resource.

“We can harvest these algae, and it’s rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids,” he said. “It can be used as a feed in aquaculture instead of relying on fish oil from wild-caught fish.”

His guiding principle is simple: “We need to rethink waste as part of a circular system. What leaves one process should be the input of another.”

Dr. Gopalakrishnan’s work also tackles microplastics and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS, and how contaminants move through the food chain. He believes the most promising solutions are the ones that follow nature’s lead.

“The most promising solution would be nature-based and circular. Systems that work with biology instead of against it.”",https://news.wayne.edu/storage/files/gc1-69371b2149558.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:21.256431

Over the last few months, state officials have raised concerns about FEMA’s response time and its commitment to moving the program forward.
The North Carolina Emergency Management department has also been awarded roughly $19 million to manage and implement the Hazard Mitigation Program, but nothing can move forward without the agency’s final approval.
The agency also said it would be “factually incorrect” to report that the program has stalled.
“What I have seen and what I've heard from my colleagues is there seems to be a general hesitation, a slow down, related to hazard mitigation nationally,” Ray said.","Mary Lynn Manns’ two-bedroom home sits on a tranquil patch of land near the Swannanoa River.

When she moved in a decade ago, she expected to live the rest of her life in the house. Then, Hurricane Helene caused the river to swell nearly 30 feet high, flooding the foundation. Since then, Manns, along with many of her peers in East Asheville’s River Knolls neighborhood, have been unable to return to their homes.

“The foundations are in bad shape,” Manns said. “You can't just put up a house. And plus, we've had the discussion, should we do this? We're clearly now in a floodplain. Would it be right to rebuild that house? The idea of rebuilding in an area that's clearly a problem just doesn't seem like the proper ethical thing to do.”

When she purchased the home a decade ago, the location was not designated as a high-risk flood zone by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and her mortgage did not require flood insurance, she said. Now, the river bank has widened, encroaching further into the neighborhood.

One house just down the road from Manns now sits right on the edge of the bank. The floodwaters swept away the land, leaving a precipitous slope in place of the backyard.

“People had little gardens back here. There was land,” Manns said. “And the land's completely gone now.”

Scenarios like these are why FEMA started the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. The agency doesn’t want people to rebuild homes in a floodplain, where they're likely to flood again, so it offers homeowners the option to sell their property at pre-storm values, rebuild the home on stilts or relocate it.

But Manns, who applied for the program last November, is growing increasingly concerned about when – or even if – she’ll receive money for her property. Over the last few months, state officials have raised concerns about FEMA’s response time and its commitment to moving the program forward. The agency has not approved any buyouts yet, though the first batch of applications was submitted nearly 10 months ago. More than 500 applications, totaling more than $240 million in property value, sit stagnant, awaiting a sign-off from FEMA, according to multiple officials from the state’s emergency management office.

“We're trying to be as communicative as we can to homeowners who may be waiting,” Matt Calabria, the director of Grown NC, said at a November meeting. “The reality is we've submitted the information for so many of those folks and we don't have a whole lot of information to share other than to affirm, yes, we have submitted them.”

FEMA has awarded some of the $1.5 billion dollars it set aside as part of the Hazard Mitigation Program, but none of the money has gone towards home buyouts. The agency has awarded $466,000 to Clyde and $600,000 to Greenville. The money will support the engineering and planning costs for flood mitigation in both communities. The North Carolina Emergency Management department has also been awarded roughly $19 million to manage and implement the Hazard Mitigation Program, but nothing can move forward without the agency’s final approval.

State presses FEMA to move forward

This month, Governor Josh Stein wrote a letter to the new FEMA Administrator Karen Evans, urging the agency to “be responsive to the needs of North Carolinians.”

Stein’s letter also criticized the agency’s delays with its Public Assistance program, which provides reimbursements to local governments for Helene recovery projects like debris removal and road repair.

“Further delay of these approvals keeps communities and families in limbo, in some cases paying expenses on homes they cannot live in while they await word from FEMA,” Stein wrote, of the buyout delays. “Your efforts to begin and accelerate the program would greatly benefit the people of western North Carolina.”

FEMA declined an interview request with BPR, but wrote in an email that the majority of the applications “are currently ineligible” because they don’t meet certain program requirements. The agency also said it would be “factually incorrect” to report that the program has stalled.

William Ray, the Director of the North Carolina Department of Emergency Management, disputed some of FEMA’s claims in an interview with BPR.

“We do not have anything in hand that says that officially things are ineligible,” he said, adding that FEMA’s operations are moving slower than normal.

“What I have seen and what I've heard from my colleagues is there seems to be a general hesitation, a slow down, related to hazard mitigation nationally,” Ray said. He pointed to FEMA’s recent decision not to approve hazard mitigation funding in North Carolina’s Triangle after Tropical Storm Chantal damaged more than 200 homes and apartments as an example.

In the case of Helene funding, FEMA contends the majority of applications for buyouts are not meeting the “open space” requirement, which mandates that any property obtained through the Hazard Mitigation program remains as an open green space in perpetuity, with a “clear title, no deed restrictions, and assurances the property will stay undeveloped.”

On some applications, the state has asked for an exemption on this “open space” requirement. That’s because in the places where Helene caused roads to crumble away, the only way to rebuild the road is through additional land use, Ray said.

“That, fundamentally, is one of the challenges we're navigating right now. DOT may need a portion of a parcel of property for repair or reconstruction of a roadway that was existing due to a river change or landscape change,” Ray said. “There are areas where there's not a whole lot of options of where to put the roadway.”

Ray added that typically the state doesn’t face significant delays when trying to move projects forward.

“In past events, we have had much different interaction with our regional office and their ability to make decisions and kind of move things forward. So this has been a different experience,” he said.

Justin Graney, a spokesperson for the state's Emergency Management department, maintained that many of the pending applications are not asking for an “open space” exemption.

“Many of the applications pending approval either do not include properties caught between two Federal policies or a portion of properties that can be approved. The State continues to advocate for quick approval of these vital projects,” Graney wrote.

Meanwhile, rent and mortgage bills stack up

As this back and forth between the state government and FEMA continues, more than 500 damaged properties in Western North Carolina remain in limbo.

Chad Berginnis, the executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said he’s never seen anything like this.

“It is unfathomable to me that we're at the place where the federal government is dragging its feet so much and that we don't have any answers,” he said.

He’s worried about the impact this will have on disaster survivors.

“I fear for the homeowner that [are] waiting on these grants,” he said. “At some point, are they going to have to declare bankruptcy because they waited on the federal government?”

Mary Lynn Manns is worried, too. Right now, she’s on the hook for three monthly payments – a $900 mortgage, a $500 HOA fee and a $1,500 dollar monthly rent on an apartment.

“We're watching our savings just dwindle and dwindle and dwindle and we're going, ""Oh my God, how much longer can we do this?” she said.

The only reprieve in sight is coming from her HOA. Right now the association is in discussions about reducing the monthly by $300 a month",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/006bf74/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2Fe1%2Fd78d9b2c44b1b3060e58553b0d8f%2Fimg-4482.JPG,N,,2025-12-12 16:01:35.412510

David Stevenson stood in a circle of friends and colleagues in an Orlando, Florida, hotel lobby. Everyone but him wore a lapel pin that read ​“I ♥ Fossil Fuels.”

“You want one?” asked a conference attendee, offering me the pin with a smirk. ​“It can be a souvenir.”

Stevenson, with a soft wave, gestured to the man to leave me alone. I was the only credentialed member of a legacy news organization attending this gathering, covering it for South Carolina’s largest newspaper, The Post and Courier, where I worked at the time. One organizer of the meeting, the Heartland Institute’s 2023 International Conference on Climate Change, blamed the media’s ​“constant lies” for the ban on some members of the press.

But Stevenson, then a policy director for the conservative think tank the Caesar Rodney Institute, had personally advocated for me to cover the event. He favored transparency and had no problem talking to me for hours about his primary political cause: making sure no offshore wind farms were ever built in US waters.

The conference drew luminaries from the world of climate skepticism, from Alex Epstein, author of ​The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, to Judith Curry and Ross McKitrick, a cherry-picking duo of marginal researchers more recently known for authoring a controversial 141-page government report downplaying the effects of human-caused climate change for the Trump administration. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) gave a keynote speech, mocking Democrats’ climate concerns. She held court next to the hotel pool that night, smoking a cigar with leaders from major conservative think tanks underneath palm fronds swaying in the breeze.

Stevenson saw himself as an outlier there. He leaned over during one session to tell me, cheekily, that he might be the ​“only person here who believes in climate change.”

And yet, despite that belief, Stevenson has dedicated the better part of a decade to obstructing a source of clean energy that can help replace the fossil fuels that are baking the planet. In fact, that’s why he was at the Heartland Institute’s conference: to rail against offshore wind farms.

The following day, Stevenson laid out his case in an expansive and mostly empty ballroom. It’s too expensive, he argued from a lectern, and the United States was not effectively assessing its environmental impact. He suggested a plan to get the public to care about this issue: putting whales front and center.

Stevenson stopped short of blaming wind companies for the spate of whale carcasses that had washed up on New Jersey and New York beaches just weeks prior. He agreed with the scientific evidence that ​“vessel strikes”—not wind development—were the biggest threat in that region. Still, the potential for harm to whales could be a powerful tool in federal court, he speculated, as well as in the court of public opinion.

At the time, Biden officials were approving new offshore wind projects at ​“breakneck speed.” Republican opposition was somewhat scant; GOP lawmakers in deep-red South Carolina had just put forth a pro–offshore wind bill. However, nuclear power—the energy sector Stevenson wanted to see advance—appeared to be on the downswing, with many US facilities having recently shuttered.

We parted ways after two days together at the conference, and I ultimately decided not to write a story about Stevenson. He seemed like little more than a gadfly to an increasingly powerful, multibillion-dollar offshore wind industry. I didn’t think much of it when he told me at the time that the industry would ​“crumble” before it even reached South Carolina.

I should have believed him; Stevenson was right.

The once high-flying offshore wind industry has been brought to its knees this year by President Donald Trump. In just the past few months, the Trump administration halted a nearly finished wind farm, clawed back $679 million in offshore wind grants, and moved to cancel permits for three other massive wind farms. Multiple fully permitted projects have been shelved. New development in the US seems impossible.

The stakes are high, particularly for the Northeast, where offshore wind was meant to not only slash emissions but also lower power bills, shore up grid reliability, and revitalize down-on-their-luck port towns with well-paying jobs. Strangling the sector for four years will be a devastating blow to these hopes.

Trump himself has a deep disdain for offshore wind, sparked by his failure to block a project from being built within view of his Scotland golf course a decade ago. But there is perhaps no other single person more responsible for watering the seeds of offshore wind opposition than Stevenson.

A January 2025 study by a Brown University research group placed Stevenson at the center of the network of activists and political operators driving America’s anti–offshore wind movement. The data showed he had an outsize influence in galvanizing lawsuits and public protests against wind farms. The analysis also tied Stevenson to a larger web of ​“dark money” networks that are financially backed by the fossil-fuel industry.

“The Brown study actually was fairly accurate about writing down all the people involved.…I was probably the common denominator for those groups,” Stevenson told me earlier this year.

Stevenson doesn’t fit into the neat box of being a climate denier. He doesn’t think we should continue burning fossil fuels forever. Instead, he’s someone who seeks to block certain solutions that address climate change, for reasons of his own—namely, ​“affordable and reliable” energy sources like nuclear and solar are better options, in his view. But scholars I spoke to about this discordance weren’t surprised at all.

“Outright climate denying seems to be decreasing,” said Alaina Kinol, a PhD candidate at Northeastern University who studies resistance to climate policy. ​“What we’re seeing more is obstruction,” she added, “and tactics that delay action.”

Stevenson, now 75, describes himself as ​“a lifelong conservationist.”

In the driveway of his Lewes, Delaware, home sits the hybrid vehicle he often drives to a nearby beach. Solar panels glint atop the roof, which Stevenson custom-designed in 2013 to be at the ​“optimum angle” to soak up the sun. A framed newspaper article about one of his cross-country bike rides hangs on the wall of his home office, nestled alongside photos of his seven children and 19 grandchildren.

His career has intersected with clean energy—and even wind—at various points.

While working for DuPont in the 1980s, Stevenson helped the chemical giant develop the long-lasting coatings used to make first-generation solar panels and wind turbine blades. In 1999, after leaving the company, he started his own construction business and acquired certifications in energy efficiency and home weatherization. He said he eventually co-founded the Delaware Green Building Council to promote this kind of work.

But despite Stevenson’s environmentally minded career and interests, he’s built a reputation as someone dedicated to preventing, rather than enabling, renewable energy.

After selling his construction business to one of his sons, Stevenson became interested in shaping state policies. A self-described libertarian, he found a home around 2010 at the Caesar Rodney Institute, a Delaware affiliate of the State Policy Network, which the Brown University researchers call ​“the nation’s most prominent network of conservative state-level think tanks.”

According to the DC-based research firm Energy Policy Institute, CRI is among a half dozen ​“front groups” backed by fossil-fuel interests that regularly attack renewable energy in their local regions.

For a few years, Stevenson worked on a variety of issues at CRI, from data centers and solid-state fuel cells to pipeline infrastructure and Delaware’s carbon-emissions fee. His initial brush with offshore wind came in 2010, when he sent a measured letter to the Obama administration regarding Bluewater Wind, the first proposed wind farm off the coast of Delaware. He voiced opposition to wind tax credits but acknowledged ​“one of the benefits of windmills” is how quickly they can be built.

It wasn’t until 2017 that he focused deeply on offshore wind, and by then his stance on the energy source was more firmly negative.

Plans for Skipjack Wind Farm—a 966-megawatt Danish-led project slated for waters off Maryland’s coastline with onshore stations in Delaware—were advancing quickly. They took Stevenson by surprise. ​“My initial response was just the high cost,” he recalled, though he also worried about the turbines ruining the ​“pristine view.”

The project was led by Ørsted, the world’s largest developer of offshore wind, which had bought the lease from the developers of Bluewater Wind. Stevenson said he tried to enlist help to fight the company, turning to Washington connections he’d forged during his time serving on Trump’s first transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.

“I knew a lot of people; we had a lot of conversations,” Stevenson recalled. ​“They told me that I was nuts for taking on offshore wind.”

At the time, Trump officials were actively backing the sector. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke described himself as ​“very bullish on offshore wind” and executed key lease auctions put forth by the Obama administration—first near North Carolina, then near Massachusetts. Anti-wind policies wouldn’t emerge until the latter half of Trump 1.0, when Zinke’s successor, David Bernhardt, began slow-walking federal permits for offshore projects.

Stevenson received little response from his Washington connections. Undeterred, he simply led an anti-wind campaign on his own.

He attended town hall meetings and submitted public comments. He and fellow residents of local coastal communities organized against the wind project under the name Save Our Beach View, mailing over 35,000 letters and posting constantly to Facebook.

The messages contained several misleading statements. Independent journalist Michael Thomas reported that the letters, for example, ​“falsely claimed that the project could cause coastal residents’ property values to drop by between 20% and 30%; power costs could rise by 400%; key industries like tourism could see their revenues fall by 50%.”

Nevertheless, Stevenson’s efforts delayed the permitting process for an onshore substation, which in turn delayed wind turbine construction off the Delmarva coast from a planned 2022 start date to 2026 at the earliest. In January of this year, days after Trump took office for his second term, Ørsted moved to refinance the project, likely kicking it even further down the road.

Ultimately, Stevenson said, he ​“won the battle.”

In 2019, emboldened by his win against Skipjack Wind, Stevenson started searching on social media platforms and in news articles for the names of other residents across the Northeast who were resisting offshore wind farms. He reached out to some of them by phone—“just cold-called them,” he said with a laugh.

He found that there were plenty of individuals, as well as some small groups, protesting with little experience. For example, a handful of activists known as Protect Our Coast NJ didn’t know how to establish themselves as a nonprofit entity. Stevenson said he helped them do it.

Stevenson also started to organize monthly calls among activists from different states. His reach slowly grew from Massachusetts down to North Carolina, with the idea of spreading the tactics he honed in Delaware to other states. What Stevenson would bring them—as the Brown University researchers put it—was ​“political power.” Filings show that Stevenson’s employer, the Caesar Rodney Institute, also accepted donations from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers in both 2019 and 2020.

His network of grassroots activists evolved into the American Coalition for Ocean Protection, which made its public debut in 2021 with a press conference in front of the Massachusetts Statehouse. Four other State Policy Network think tanks had also joined by then.

There, wearing a blue sport coat and flanked by maps of planned wind farms, Stevenson announced that the Caesar Rodney Institute had set up a $75,000 legal fund to support residents along the East Coast who wanted to sue to halt offshore wind development. He publicly set a goal of raising $500,000 for the campaign.

Stevenson would later admit that while the coalition’s fundraising ​“did pretty well,” it never reached anywhere close to his financial goal. No matter. It was the coalition’s relentless messaging and coordination, not so much the money, that would become its greatest weapon.

In January 2023, right-wing media took an interest in whales. There had been a slew of marine mammal deaths along the East Coast in prior weeks, and conservative media put the blame on seismic surveys for the future offshore wind developments ramping up along the New Jersey coast. Fox News host Jesse Watters interviewed a leader of Protect Our Coasts NJ, a founding coalition member that Stevenson had helped become a nonprofit.

This wasn’t the first time the media had amplified baseless speculation about wind power killing whales. The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, had run a similar story in 2017. But in early 2023, the claims were getting attention from Fox, local news, and even the Associated Press.

Stevenson was in near disbelief when he heard Tucker Carlson, then a commentator on Fox News, mention offshore wind and whales in multiple segments.

Still, even then, Stevenson refused to repeat blatantly false claims about the sector’s impact on whales. He posted statements on CRI’s website that the exact harm to the critically endangered North Atlantic right whales by wind development was still ​“unknown” and told me that his official position was to ​“wait and see” what federal scientists find after investigating the recently washed-up whale carcasses.

I asked at the time if he thought the explosion of attention on whales and wind power would peter out. He replied that it would, adding that eventually all these newcomers would oppose wind farms because of ​“the economics.”

But if Stevenson didn’t personally amplify the message, he didn’t swear it off. Nor did he discourage the groups he collaborated with from peddling it. In fact, he nearly won an award for elevating the issue: In June 2023, his campaign against offshore wind was a finalist for the ​Best Issue Campaign award presented at State Policy Network’s annual meeting. (The nomination highlighted the fact that the campaign had prompted a US General Accountability Office report into the matter. That analysis, released earlier this year, found no evidence that the wind industry harms whales.)

Over time, the whale issue metastasized, coming to define political debate over offshore wind farms. Eventually, Stevenson himself embraced some of its more conspiratorial claims. In a statement posted to the Cesar Rodney Institute website in summer 2024, he wrote: ​“We have patiently waited for indisputable evidence that offshore wind is killing whales despite federal agencies repeatedly stating that no such evidence exists. It does now.”

The ​“evidence” was two documents posted online, neither of which had been peer-reviewed. One report, by the consultant Robert Rand, looked at the acoustic output of wind vessels in the US—during both seabed surveys and pile-driving activities—and claimed that the underwater noise levels were much higher than federal scientists had estimated and could result in hearing loss and ​“harassment” of whales. The second report, by a retired computer science professor, used correlation alone to link the timing of New Jersey whale deaths to local wind farm survey work.

Douglas Nowacek, a professor at Duke University leading a multiyear investigation of wind farm impacts on wildlife, discredited these conclusions.

As it stands, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ​“there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause whale deaths. There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”

In fact, government data overwhelmingly links whales’ deaths to other causes. For nearly a decade, agencies have carefully documented humpbacks in the North Atlantic washing ashore at an increasing rate. The species is not endangered, but in 2016, its plummeting population warranted a government-assigned designation: an ​“unusual mortality event.”

In this ongoing phenomena, 40 percent of the dead humpback whales autopsied by experts revealed injuries that only vessels or fishing gear could inflict. The rest, according to government data, were too decomposed to determine the cause of death. Scientists generally agree that climate change, which is driving up ocean temperatures and pushing whale prey farther north, could also be playing a role in the die-off. The whales are expending more energy than ever just to catch a meal. Some juveniles have washed up emaciated.

I asked Stevenson, soon after Trump’s second inauguration, if he still trusted NOAA’s ability to objectively assess the impact of turbine development on whales, and he was clear: ​“No.”

Trump wasted no time coming after offshore wind when he took office in January 2025. On day one, he issued an anti-wind executive order that paused all permitting activity, and derided the installations as ​“big” and ​“ugly” to an indoor stadium full of supporters.

For Stevenson and a dozen others in his influential cohort, the executive order was a good step—but it wasn’t enough to simply block new projects from advancing. In February, they petitioned Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to issue stop-work orders to the installations already being built, alleging that the projects posed a risk to whales. This piggybacked off legal complaints guided by Stevenson and coalition members against Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, South Fork Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.

And it wasn’t long before the Trump administration tried to give the Stevenson-led coalition what it wanted. All five of the offshore wind projects under construction in US waters either have been delayed by recent stop-work orders or are reportedly under threat of receiving one.

Some in the coalition opposed such moves, recognizing that stopping projects already underway would raise energy costs. Steve Haner, a senior fellow at the Virginia-based conservative think tank Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, refused to endorse Stevenson’s petition to pause the five projects under construction—objecting especially to halting America’s largest project, a 2.5-gigawatt wind farm being built off the Virginia coast.

Under a hypothetical cancellation, according to Haner, ​“the ratepayers are on the hook” for the billions in sunk costs.

Empire Wind, one of the two projects ordered to pause this year, has since resumed construction—but only after the developer, Norwegian energy firm Equinor, launched a monthlong lobbying blitz. According to Norway’s largest newspaper, the company mobilized ​“500 phone calls and meetings”—an effort employees dubbed ​“Operation Gandalf”—which helped secure a reversal from Trump.

Still, Stevenson pushed for more wins, advocating for a complete overhaul of the Interior Department’s approval process for wind. In May, he penned another letter with some coalition members to Burgum requesting those changes.

At the time Trump was reelected, BloombergNEF expected 39 gigawatts of offshore wind generating capacity to come online in America by 2035. The research group hedged that number to 21.5 gigawatts if Trump managed to repeal wind tax credits during his term.

Today, with tax credits already sent to an early grave and no new permits issued, that prediction has fallen off a cliff. BNEF downgraded its projection two months ago to just 6 gigawatts. In other words, Trump’s assault has been so effective that it’s likely no new offshore wind farms will be built here for the next decade—save for the five already under construction.

Opponents of the sector have won the war on wind in the near term. “They are clearly feeling emboldened by Donald Trump,” said J. Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University who led the study that placed Stevenson at the heart of America’s anti-wind movement.

It’s not just Trump: Over the past year, more Republicans have grown verbally hostile to offshore wind. Burgum has played up reliability concerns, which lack evidence, and raised alarm bells about the impact to tourism and fishing, while peddling false claims that climate change predictions were overblown. This fall, the defeated Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, Jack Ciattarelli, made banishing wind farms a core agenda item, selling anti-wind tote bags and koozies on his campaign website.

Under Trump, government officials are rolling out more eyebrow-raising narratives—ones that go beyond whales—for halting wind projects. Some defy science and logic, like Burgum’s claims that New England’s Revolution Wind, the other project paused by Trump, makes the US vulnerable to underwater drone attacks. (A federal judge has since lifted the stop work order.)

Kinol, the Northeastern University researcher, says these kinds of narratives fit under the umbrella of ​“climate obstruction.” The term, she said, describes ​“the intentional use of misleading, misinforming, or misdirecting narratives to slow or prevent climate action.”

The concept has been around since the 1990s, when scholars first investigated the American Petroleum Institute’s downplaying of climate change. But as the debate about climate change—and what to do about it—evolved, so did the opposition. Kinol said talking points that preach wind farms as bad news for whales or national security are ​“a known and studied strategy.”

“This is an example of ​‘downside emphasis.’…A wind farm opponent emphasizes the downsides of renewable energy,” said Kinol. ​“The reason why it’s a well-known tactic of obstruction is because the same emphasis on protecting species is not present for the same groups when they’re talking about fossil-fuel build-out.”

These kinds of arguments are ​“disingenuous,” said Kinol, and ultimately in service of a phenomena she and her colleagues call ​“climate delay.”

Stevenson is one example of what is now a clear trend: The denial of climate change is being steadily replaced by attacks on solutions to address it. This twist is detailed in a new book written and edited by Roberts and three colleagues titled ​Climate Obstruction: A Global Assessment. The book came out in early fall, just in time for its authors to witness their ideas play out in real life, with a decade-long delay of US offshore wind farm development now becoming reality.

Nowadays, Stevenson seems to have mixed emotions about his achievements. On two of our most recent phone calls, his tenor had changed.

“​Well, I think it was the right move,” he said in early fall, referring to the Trump administration’s stop-work order pausing the building of Revolution Wind, which was still in effect when we spoke. ​“But it is not something I’m going to dance around the table happy about, because there are people that get hurt by this, that are losing their jobs.”

All his efforts have ​“paid off,” he said. America’s elevated reliance on cheap natural gas—which, when burned, releases fewer carbon emissions than coal—was ​“better policy” for now. He views gas as an essential bridge fuel until nuclear, geothermal, and solar can be built. But he expressed some ​“disappointment” that Trump has increasingly gone after solar and wants to now expand coal production.

Republican moderates in Washington have expressed similar sentiments. Meanwhile, utility bills, which Stevenson called his ​“primary motivation” for his anti-wind work, have skyrocketed in the Northeast and are projected to only climb higher if Trump’s policies continue to strangle the offshore wind sector.

Stevenson has increasingly drifted from the direction that other coalition members are taking. Protect Our Coast NJ—which first fanned the flames of misleading claims about whales—has embarked on a different disinformation campaign: spreading the false idea that offshore wind cables cause cancer. Embracing outlandish claims, whether it’s whale-killing ​“windmills” or cancer-causing cables, is a broader trend among Republicans who buy into conspiracy theories with their party’s rise to power.

Conspiratorial sentiments are plaguing other clean energy sectors, too, from exaggerated claims of bird-killing onshore turbines to markedly false statements about toxic solar panels. Anti-renewables talking points circulate online, penetrate town hall meetings, and are taken up by groups pushing back against renewables now more than ever. A June study released by Columbia University identified 498 contested wind and solar projects across 49 states in 2024, marking a 32 percent jump in opposed projects, compared to just one year prior.

“You want a healthy amount of skepticism in a democracy…You don’t want 100 percent believers,” said Dietram Scheufele, a social scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies public perspectives on science and technology. But he warned that skepticism in the US is ​“on steroids,” pushing people from the middle into polarized political camps and toward conspiratorial thinking.

Stevenson, for his part, is stepping away from his work in the anti–offshore wind movement, and seems relieved to be doing so.

On our most recent call, in late November, he told me that he had resigned from CRI and that his anti–offshore wind coalition was, for all practical purposes, disbanded. (He remains a named plaintiff in four lawsuits opposing wind development.)

He’d rather be ​“solving the nuclear waste problem,” he told me. The energy source has long had a toxic-byproduct issue, not to mention cost overruns, which, to be sure, eclipse any expense associated with offshore wind over the long run. The Trump administration is looking to revive America’s nuclear industry, and that’s where Stevenson wants to build his legacy.

Even this work advocating for nuclear power could be seen as a form of ​“climate delay,” according to a popular research framework used by Kinol and Roberts. Nuclear plants put forth today can take a decade or more to start providing power; many of the proposed wind projects that Stevenson’s coalition targeted would have come online well before then.

Stevenson also told me that he is starting a new position. Soon, he’ll become the director for energy and environmental policy at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center for Public Policy. This think tank, like CRI, is part of the State Policy Network. ExxonMobil and the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation are among the center’s funders.

I congratulated Stevenson on his new job. He thanked me. His tone warmed as he reminded me that we’d probably had a dozen phone calls over the years.

I said it was quite possible that his legacy would be as the man who helped crush a renewable energy sector that could have done much to address the planet’s biggest problem. I asked Stevenson what he thought about that view—that readers might see it that way.

To alleviate the pressure, many nations, like Romania, are turning to the renewable energy sector to bring emissions down while still providing the essential energy that the populace needs for everyday life. Europe has been a welcome destination for the sector, and new data reveals the astonishing turbine orders for wind projects across the continent.

Romania is the latest European nation to express its wind energy generation ambitions

The former Soviet nation has been developing two new wind projects that will provide remarkable amounts of clean energy to the nation’s grid in the near future. Data has revealed that wind turbine orders are increasing in Europe, with GE Vernova, a US-based renewable energy company that produces turbines for the international wind market, reporting substantial increases in turbine orders.

Romania’s clean energy mix has been growing at a steady rate over the past few years. In 2023, the renewable energy mix accounted for approximately 25% of energy consumption, and the government hopes to increase that to around 30% by 2030. Romania’s two new wind farm projects will certainly play a role in the planned expansion of renewable energy usage.

GE Vernova secures substantial turbine orders for two new wind farms in Romania

The US-based energy company has entered into an agreement with Greenvolt International Power to construct, supply, and, most importantly, install 42 6.1 MW wind turbines at the Ialomiţa wind farm. The new deal also calls for an order of the same number of turbines for the all-new Gurbanesti wind farm in Călărași county, positioning Romania as the latest European nation to drastically boost wind energy production on the continent.

GE Vernova is set to provide the essential wind turbines to power Romania’s renewable energy ambitions

Through the agreement with Greenvolt, GE Vernova will install and maintain the wind turbines at the Gurbanesti and Ialomiţa wind farms in Romania. The Ialomiţa wind farm will be capable of generating upwards of 252 MW of clean energy, while the Gurbanesti wind farm will add a further estimated 250 MW to the national grid.

Together, the wind farms will contribute 500 MW of clean wind energy to the national grid, accelerating Romania’s clean energy targets set for 2030. Both wind farms will provide thousands of ordinary Romanians with employment during peak construction, and generate enough electricity to power up to 110,000 Romanian homes and businesses every year. Europe’s proclivity for wind power has led to several nations embracing the sector, some for the first time.

“We appreciate the confidence that Greenvolt has shown in GE Vernova’s teams and our technology. This project reinforces the value of our workhorse product strategy and demonstrates our ability to add value for customers in Romania and across Europe.” – Gilan Sabatier, Chief Commercial Officer for GE Vernova’s Onshore Wind business in International Markets

Europe is aiming to increase reliance on the wind energy market in the new year

2026 is shaping up to be the best year in recent memory for the wind power sector. Europe has been embracing the clean energy potential of the wind power sector at a remarkable pace in recent months, as evidenced by the new Dogger Bank wind project in the United Kingdom, which recently reported that the foundation work for the project has been completed. A new year brings with it a renewed sense of optimism for the international energy industry, as the vast majority of nations, particularly in Europe, have big plans to increase investments in clean energy production.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/43-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:16.793660

The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, grant program funds infrastructure projects for communities vulnerable to natural disasters.

“Our towns spent years doing everything FEMA asked them to do to qualify for this funding, and they were in the middle of building real protections against storms when FEMA suddenly broke its word,” wrote Attorney General Jeff Jackson in a press release. “Keeping water systems working and keeping homes out of floodwater isn’t politics – it’s basic safety. This ruling puts the money back where it was promised so these communities can be ready for the next storm.”

In April, FEMA abruptly canceled the program, leaving many projects in North Carolina — including sewer upgrades, river bank maintenance and wastewater projects — to an uncertain fate. In response, North Carolina, along with 19 other states, sued the agency in July.

This week, the court sided with the states and ruled that the termination of the BRIC program is “unlawful.” The reprogramming or withholding of funds already committed to projects also violates the law, it said.

“This is a case about unlawful Executive encroachment on the prerogative of Congress to appropriate funds for a specific and compelling purpose, and no more than that,” the summary judgement stated.

In North Carolina, some of the reinstated grants include:

A $22.5 million grant to relocate a sewage station out of the floodplain in Salisbury

A $5.9 million riverbank restoration in Gastonia

A $5.4 million grant for flood protection in Hickory

A $7.6 million Resilient Wastewater Treatment Infrastructure project in Forest City

A $1.1 million sewer system relocation in Leland

A $200,000 watershed vulnerability assessment in Buncombe County

Saudi Arabia has a $1.1 billion solar farm with Shanghai Electric, Morocco hosts a $5.6 billion battery plant by Gotion, and Oman produces solar cells at JA Solar’s $564 million plant.
Egypt and Nigeria are pursuing hydrogen and clean energy projects.","Since early 2023, Chinese companies have pledged more than $180 billion for clean energy projects outside China, marking a major shift in global energy investment. These firms produce most of the world’s solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles, and they are investing in complete supply chains that cover mining, manufacturing, and recycling. By helping other countries build renewable energy systems, China is not only boosting green power adoption but also shaping trade and industrial flows across the globe.

China leads this change with large factories, low costs, and careful planning. The government encourages companies to expand abroad, focusing on countries with high energy needs and supporting agreements to share technology. From 2018 to 2024, China controlled 80% of new solar, wind, battery, and hydrogen plants worldwide. Companies such as CATL and BYD dominate production, exporting billions in technology each year. Chinese firms cover entire supply chains, from mines to factories, battery plants, recycling centers, and renewable energy projects, ensuring efficiency and long-term influence. Trade agreements and political partnerships help these companies expand quickly, while technology sharing and faster approvals support large-scale projects.

The Global South is a major focus of China’s investments. Over 75% of projects are in developing countries, often aligned with the Belt and Road Initiative. China selects locations with clear policies, strict rules, and high energy demand. Many projects are joint ventures with local partners, sharing jobs, skills, and technology. Governments support these efforts with loans and incentives, while private firms lead development. These investments help lower energy costs, create thousands of jobs, upgrade grids, and promote industrial growth. China also adapts to local regulations, meeting requirements for labor, content, or training, which ensures contracts move forward smoothly.

In Southeast Asia, the growth is notable. Indonesia is seeing a $6 billion battery plant by CATL in West Java, producing 6.9 GWh annually and creating over 10,000 jobs. Malaysia has investments from EVE Energy and BYD in energy storage and EV manufacturing, while solar farms expand with GCL Technology’s support. Thailand benefits from Sunwoda’s $1 billion battery plant and Changan’s EV research partnerships. Tax breaks, fast permits, and local content rules accelerate projects, boost trade with China, and strengthen regional energy systems.

The Middle East is also transforming. Saudi Arabia has a $1.1 billion solar farm with Shanghai Electric, Morocco hosts a $5.6 billion battery plant by Gotion, and Oman produces solar cells at JA Solar’s $564 million plant. Egypt and Nigeria are pursuing hydrogen and clean energy projects. These initiatives reduce energy costs, generate employment, and advance national energy goals.

Europe is part of this expansion as well. Hungary’s Debrecen plant by CATL aims to produce 100 GWh of batteries annually, Spain hosts a $4.1 billion battery factory in Zaragoza, and France’s Douai plant targets 40 GWh by 2030. These facilities help meet EV electrification goals and provide local training and research opportunities, supporting regional industrial growth.

Latin America is seeing similar trends. Brazil’s BYD converts a Ford plant into an EV hub, producing 150,000 cars in the first phase, while Envision develops a net-zero industrial park. Chinese firms support wind, solar, and hydro projects, upgrade grids, and lower energy costs by around 20%, speeding the transition to renewable energy.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10-4.png,N,,2025-12-12 19:01:06.849896

App-based corporations have hidden behind AI algorithms and predatory take rates while drivers’ pay shrinks and executive profits soar,” said Rep. Omar.
“The Empowering App-Based Workers Act will pull back the curtain on how these companies use data, set wages, and make decisions that shape people’s livelihoods.
Gig workers should be part of a transparent system that values their labor.” App-based workers face increasingly exploitative conditions.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – DECEMBER 12, 2025 — Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12) joined Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Donald Norcross (NJ-01), and Ilhan Omar (MN-05) in introducing the Empowering App-Based Workers Act, groundbreaking legislation to bring transparency, fairness, and accountability to digital labor platforms such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Amazon Flex.

The bill establishes critical guardrails to ensure that automated decision-making systems do not result in discrimination, wage theft, or price-gouging — and that the workers who keep these companies running have the information and protections they deserve.

“App-based workers in Western Pennsylvania and across this country power our economy, yet far too many are left without basic transparency, stability, or fair pay,” said Congresswoman Summer Lee. “These companies use hidden algorithms and unpredictable pay structures that make it nearly impossible for workers to support their families. The Empowering App-Based Workers Act brings long-overdue accountability by requiring companies to be transparent about how they determine pay and assignments. Workers deserve protection from unfair and exploitative practices, and they deserve to receive their fair share of the value they create.”

Other lead sponsors emphasized the urgent need for reform.

“App-based workers work long hours, often with no consistency or predictability of how much they will make,” said Rep. Jayapal. “They are at the whim of algorithms that make automated decisions about who gets to work, and where, and when. Workers and consumers deserve a better system, where workers are protected, employment laws are followed, and where consumers have a transparent price.”

“The Empowering App-Based Workers Act is a long-overdue step toward fairness and transparency for the millions of rideshare drivers and delivery app workers who keep our economy running,” said Rep. Norcross. “By guaranteeing transparent payment information and higher wages, these workers will finally receive a fair day’s pay for a hard day’s work. App-based workers deserve a good-paying job where they are treated with dignity, compensated fairly, and protected from exploitation.”

“Gig workers like Uber and Lyft drivers in my home state of Minnesota deserve a fair share of the wealth they create. App-based corporations have hidden behind AI algorithms and predatory take rates while drivers’ pay shrinks and executive profits soar,” said Rep. Omar. “The Empowering App-Based Workers Act will pull back the curtain on how these companies use data, set wages, and make decisions that shape people’s livelihoods. Gig workers should be part of a transparent system that values their labor.”

App-based workers face increasingly exploitative conditions. In 2024, both Uber and Lyft regularly paid drivers less than minimum wage — even while raising prices for consumers. Corporate take rates frequently hover around 40 percent and can reach as high as 70 percent on individual rides.

The Empowering App-Based Workers Act will:

Require weekly pay statements and itemized receipts so workers know exactly how their earnings are calculated;

Require transparency on electronic monitoring and automated decision-making, including how algorithms determine job assignments;

Guarantee ride-hail drivers receive at least 75% of the total amount paid by the consumer;

Prohibit pay discrimination by ensuring equal pay for equal or comparable work.

In addition to Reps. Jayapal, Norcross, Omar, and Lee, the legislation is sponsored by Reps. Dan Goldman (NY-10), LaMonica McIver (NJ-10), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-AL), Mark Pocan (WI-02), Mark Takano (CA-39), and Rashida Tlaib (MI-12).",https://summerlee.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-12 15:00:58.759950

Across the center-right, a growing number of U.S. policymakers, business leaders, and investors are returning to classical principles — recognizing that markets, not government intervention, are the best way to secure America’s energy future.

That’s what makes Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s lawsuit against major asset managers so misguided. The lawsuit accuses firms like BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard of conspiring to limit investment in coal. But what’s really being challenged is the freedom of investors to make market-based decisions about risk, technology and opportunity. Paxton isn’t fighting overreach. He’s fighting capitalism itself.

For generations, conservatives have argued that free enterprise and limited government produce better outcomes than top-down control. In the 2010s, the American Tea Party movement rose by explicitly campaigning against big-government mandates — from Common Core to the Affordable Care Act to Wall Street bailouts. Whether you agree with the movement or not, Paxton’s effort flips that logic on its head, substituting the judgment of politicians for that of investors and consumers. Using the power of the state to punish private firms as Texas and other states are trying to do for assessing market realities undermines the very principles of free enterprise conservatives have long defended.

Conservatives across the country are speaking up. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, who served as President Trump’s Energy Secretary, has called Paxton’s lawsuit “misguided,” warning that it will undermine President Trump’s energy agenda. He’s right.

The reality is that investors are responding to economics, not ideology. Renewable energy, like wind and solar, have become more competitive and cost-effective. It is why investment in clean energy globally is expected to top $2.2 trillion by the end of the year. Emerging technologies are gaining traction. Markets reward efficiency and innovation, and they penalize waste and stagnation. When the government steps in to dictate how capital should be deployed, it distorts these signals and increases costs for everyone.

If the goal is to strengthen America’s energy leadership, the path forward isn’t litigation, it’s certainty. China is moving full speed ahead to dominate global clean energy manufacturing and electric vehicles. Investors, utilities, companies, and developers need stable policy and predictable rules to plan decades-long projects. Permitting reform, consistent tax policy, and clear regulatory standards will do far more to unleash American energy investment than courtroom battles waged by politicians with a vendetta.

Investment is already flowing. Across the country clean energy projects are expanding, many of them in Republican-represented districts. These projects aren’t ideological. They’re about job creation, reliable power, and economic competitiveness. As demand for electricity grows — driven by data centers, electric vehicles, and industrial production — the United States must bring more generation onto the grid. Every credible forecast shows that we will need more energy sources to meet that demand.

This is where conservatives have a clear advantage. A market-driven energy agenda doesn’t require choosing between fossil fuels and renewables. It simply requires letting competition decide which technologies deliver the most affordable, reliable, and secure energy. That approach aligns perfectly with conservative values: economic freedom, property rights, and limited government.

The language conservatives use also matters. Energy security, reliability, and economic growth are the winning arguments. Last month, I joined a group of former Republican members of Congress to push this message home: American competitiveness depends on abundant, affordable energy. If we fail to provide it, electricity prices will rise for everyone, industries will leave, and our geopolitical strength will weaken.

The choice before conservatives is straightforward. We can embrace a forward-looking, pro-market energy strategy that builds on our strengths — or we can drift toward using government power to pick winners and punish others because of politics. The former leads to innovation and growth. The latter leads to stagnation and uncertainty.

Conservatives built their legacy by trusting markets, empowering entrepreneurs, and limiting government interference. It’s time to apply those same principles to energy. The market, not the courtroom, should decide America’s energy future.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/5e/35eed9f3-41dd-4535-8ed0-eccdcc7a4bd4/68dad702605e3.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:31.342692

To sum up, Fervo Energy, backed by strong investment, is at the forefront of this boom, driving reliable, 24/7 clean energy across the U.S.","Next-generation geothermal energy is moving from the margins to the center of the clean power conversation. Analysts say technology improvements and rising demand for 24/7 clean electricity are opening the door for geothermal to scale in ways that were not possible before. Annick Adjei, senior research analyst for upstream and subsurface carbon management at Wood Mackenzie, summed it up clearly. She said next-gen geothermal was “fundamentally changing the energy landscape” by making a reliable, around-the-clock clean power source available in far more places than before.

That momentum is already showing up in the money. The geothermal sector attracted US$1.7 billion in funding in Q1 2025 alone, a signal of strong confidence from investors looking for firm clean energy solutions. Against this backdrop, Fervo Energy—the leading name in next-generation geothermal—announced the close of its oversubscribed US$462 million Series E round, led by new investor B Capital. The scale of the raise reflects the growing belief that geothermal could play a crucial role in building a fully decarbonized energy grid.

Fervo Gets Funding Boost to Scale the World’s Largest Next-Gen Geothermal Project

The new capital will speed up Fervo’s development plans, especially the buildout of Cape Station in Beaver County, Utah. Cape Station is on track to become the largest next-generation geothermal development in the world. The facility will start delivering 100 megawatts (MW) of firm clean electricity to the grid in 2026. Fervo plans to add another 400 MW by 2028, bringing total capacity to 500 MW.

Construction has been progressing rapidly, driven by significant operational improvements. Drilling times have fallen with every new well, and overall efficiency has climbed. These improvements help bring costs down and reduce development risk, which is critical as utilities and grid operators look for stable sources of clean power.

At the same time, the United States’ power sector is facing a major turning point. Electricity demand is rising rapidly due to electrification, the growth of data centers, and the expansion in advanced manufacturing. Yet supply has not kept pace. This mismatch is creating a once-in-a-generation chance for new energy resources to break in.

Investor Confidence Continues to Rise

Fervo continues to attract top-tier investors who view geothermal as the next scalable zero-carbon resource. The Series E round drew a wide mix of new and returning backers. New investors included AllianceBernstein, Atacama Ventures, Carbon Equity, Climate First, Google, Mitsui & Co., Dr. Kris Singh of Holtec International, and JB Straubel. Returning supporters such as Breakthrough Energy Ventures, CalSTRS, Capricorn Investment Group, CPP Investments, DCVC, Devon Energy, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also joined.

Centaurus Capital’s participation was notable. The firm recently made a US$75 million preferred equity commitment to support Cape Station Phase I and also joined the latest round. The ongoing interest highlights how geothermal is increasingly appealing to both climate-focused funds and traditional energy investors.

Geothermal: A Clean Energy Source With Minimal Environmental Footprint

Environmental impacts vary depending on how geothermal energy is used. Direct-use systems and geothermal heat pumps have almost no negative environmental effects and often reduce the need for more polluting energy sources. Even geothermal power plants—which do generate some emissions—produce fewer pollutants compared to fossil fuel plants.

Because geothermal plants don’t burn fuel, emissions are low.

EIA says they release 97% fewer sulfur compounds and around 99% less carbon dioxide than similarly sized coal or gas plants.

Many facilities also use scrubbers to capture hydrogen sulfide from the geothermal reservoir. Most geothermal plants inject used steam and water back underground, which helps renew the resource and keeps surface emissions close to zero.

Fervo Launches a New Standard for Responsible Geothermal Development

As geothermal development accelerates, Fervo is working to ensure that growth happens responsibly. The company introduced the Geothermal Sustainable Development Pact, a new framework outlining best-in-class standards for planning, building, and operating geothermal projects. The Pact includes 37 commitments across six key areas:

Community engagement

Workforce development

Land use

Water conservation and well integrity

Induced seismicity

Emissions

The Pact goes beyond existing regulatory rules and sets a new bar for responsible geothermal scaling. It also builds on the Principles for Responsible Geothermal Development, which Fervo co-developed with the Sierra Club and which has been endorsed by the Sierra Club and the NW Energy Coalition.

Tim Latimer, Fervo’s CEO and Co-Founder, said the Pact came from the belief that the future of energy needs “not just better technology, but better practices.” He emphasized that collaboration with environmental groups will continue as the framework evolves.

Global Capacity and Geothermal’s Path to a Larger U.S. Grid Role

As per REN21’s latest analysis, Global geothermal electricity generation reached 99 terawatt-hours in 2024. During the same year, the world added 400 MW of new capacity, bringing total installed capacity to about 15.1 gigawatts (GW). New Zealand led growth, followed by strong progress in the Philippines, Türkiye, Indonesia, the United States, and Japan.

Next-generation geothermal is attracting attention because it addresses one of the biggest barriers facing conventional geothermal: geography. Traditional geothermal depends on rare underground conditions that exist only in certain regions. But improvements in drilling, well design, and subsurface analytics are allowing developers to tap heat resources in many more places.

Moving on, according to McKinsey, falling costs, rapid scaling potential, and strong supply chains could help geothermal become a major part of the U.S. energy mix.

Their analysis suggests next-generation geothermal could supply up to 100 GW of power by 2050, including 40 GW by 2035. That would represent a meaningful share of firm, zero-carbon electricity on the U.S. grid.

Costs are also expected to drop. Analysts project next-generation geothermal could reach US$45–65 per megawatt-hour for mature, “nth-of-a-kind” facilities within the next decade. While local economic conditions will influence individual project viability, geothermal is expected to outperform other forms of clean, firm power over time.

U.S. Policy, New Wells, and Record Investments Fuel a Geothermal Boom

Under the Trump administration, many renewables face challenges, but geothermal could benefit from a “drill, baby, drill” approach, since it shares techniques with oil and gas. With careful policy support, investment in geothermal could grow significantly.

As of 2025, the U.S. holds 23% of global geothermal capacity, leading the world with 3.7 GW in operation. The latest Global Geothermal Power Tracker shows 223 units in development, adding over 15 GW—almost doubling global capacity if completed.

Furthermore, Annick Adjei also highlighted the opportunity: an 80% jump in new wells and nearly US$2 billion in investment show strong confidence in tapping the nation’s vast heat resources. With 500 GW of potential and only 4 GW installed, geothermal could rival traditional oil and gas while delivering always-on, clean power.

To sum up, Fervo Energy, backed by strong investment, is at the forefront of this boom, driving reliable, 24/7 clean energy across the U.S.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2502800743.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 15:01:02.714420

NLC’s report comes as House and Senate leaders are preparing reauthorization packages for surface transportation and water infrastructure programs before they expire in October 2026. The upcoming reauthorization serves as an opportunity to continue the investment in America’s infrastructure, and NLC has outlined key local government priorities for both transportation and water reauthorization (PDF).

Given IIJA’s significance as a source of funding for infrastructure, NLC examined the flow of funding to the municipal level to help inform Congressional reauthorization discussions.

The analysis shows that federal-to-local direct awards remain the most efficient way to ensure municipal governments, particularly large cities, receive funding to address infrastructure needs quickly and completely.

Rebuilding Together

Through a mix of direct grants from the federal government, formula funding sent to states and federal loans, federal infrastructure programs play a significant role in enabling cities, towns and villages across the country to develop and sustain assets that serve residents and businesses and grow local and national economies.

The report’s key finding is that smaller municipalities (those under 50,000 in population) come out ahead when it comes to receiving IIJA funds. However, they still need federal partners to continue funding support for infrastructure projects and efforts to reduce administrative burdens in applying and managing federal grants.

At the state level, the report examines four infrastructure programs in six states (Alaska, Connecticut, Michigan, Tennessee, Louisiana and Utah). From the state’s block grant programs funded under IIJA, just under half of funds went to municipalities.

While municipalities received $8.6 billion in direct federal funds from IIJA, cities, towns and villages received minimal funding under pass-through state transportation programs, leaving them at a disadvantage for fixing infrastructure assets. By comparison, state energy and environment offices that distributed funding for energy and water projects together allocated more than 70 percent of their funding to municipalities.

On 22 November 2025, Decree-Law No. 175 of 21 November 2025 (known as the Energy Decree) came into force. It contains “Urgent measures concerning Transition Plan 5.0 and energy production from renewable sources” (Official Gazette No. 271 of 21 November 2025).

The Energy Decree contains significant changes to the regulations concerning:

tax credits for new investments in production facilities in Italy, as part of innovation projects that result in a reduction in energy consumption pursuant to Article 38 of Decree-Law No. 19 of 2 March 2024, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 56 of 29 April 2024;

the eligible areas referred to in Legislative Decree 199/2021 (Eligible Areas) and the authorisation regimes introduced by Legislative Decree 190/2024 (TU FER) for the construction and operation of plants powered by renewable sources.

With regard to the amendments to Legislative Decree 199/2021, the provisions “rewrite”

Articles 20, 21, 22 and 23 of Legislative Decree 199/2021. They only partially confirm the previous regulations and leave it to the reader to verify which changes have been introduced.

The previous suitable areas have been partially confirmed and new areas have been classified as suitable areas. The suitable area for photovoltaic plants, which referred to the previous c-ter, no. 2) of Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021, has been modified for the worse.

Another new feature is the determination of the criteria for regions and autonomous provinces to identify additional suitable areas to those established in the Energy Decree. Regions and provinces can’t modify or eliminate these areas.

The absence of a transitional regime regarding the application of this new, more restrictive regulation to ongoing authorisation procedures is questionable, also in light of the criterion of the prevalence of the unsuitability of the area in cases where the plant only partially falls within a suitable area (see paragraph i. below).

Consider a photovoltaic plant with a capacity of less than 10 MW currently undergoing authorisation through PAS located in an agricultural area within 500 m of an industrial plant not subject to AIA. In the absence of a transitional regime, it’s debatable whether the previous regulations still apply. So whether the authorisation can be finalised under the tempus regit actionem principle.

No provision has repealed Article 15 of Legislative Decree 190/2024, which establishes the tempus regit actionem principle, which should also apply to the amendments subsequently introduced by the Energy Decree. Otherwise, the authorisation procedures currently underway would be invalidated without any safeguard for investments already made.

Repealing Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 has removed the need to adopt the ministerial decree provided for by the same provision. This means that all pending disputes concerning this ministerial decree will be deemed irrelevant, also taking into account that the criteria for identifying suitable areas by the regions/provinces identified by the Energy Decree Law incorporate the jurisprudential guidelines established on regional laws and on the Ministerial Decree on suitable areas (see below, paragraph g.). The regions/provinces have 120 days to introduce this regulation.

The Energy Decree Law, in force since 22 November 2025, must be converted into law within 60 days, ie by 20 January 2026.

The following paragraphs illustrate the new provisions introduced by the Energy Decree Law and offer preliminary comments on their implications for application.

Tax credits referred to in the transition plan 5.0

Article 1 of the Energy Decree Law concerns the tax credit referred to in Transition Plan 5.0.

A time window is provided for submitting ex ante communications before investment, with peremptory deadlines and limitations on the completion of the procedure for using the tax credit.

27 November 2025 is the final deadline for submitting communications (to be sent electronically on the basis of a standardised form provided by Gestore dei Servizi Energetici s.p.a (GSE)) concerning the description of the investment project and its cost. The submission should have certifications issued by an independent assessor attesting ex ante the reduction in energy consumption achievable through investments in eligible assets.

If communications are submitted from 7 November 2025 until 6 pm on 27 November 2025 with incorrectly uploaded data or with incomplete or illegible documentation or information, they can be supplemented, at the request of the GSE, by the applicant companies, within the deadline indicated in the communication and in any case by 6 December 2025.

If companies don’t comply with requests for additional information or rectification within these terms, the procedure for claiming the tax credit not being completed. In any case, the lack of elements relating to the certification of energy consumption reduction provided for in Article 15, paragraph 1, letter a) of the Ministerial Decree of 24 July 2024 (see The reduction in energy consumption referred to in Article 9 shall be certified by specific technical certifications issued by one or more independent assessors in the form of sworn expert reports which, with regard to the eligibility of the innovation project and the completion of the investments, certify: a) ex ante, the reduction in energy consumption achievable through investments in the assets referred to in Article 6)1.

To avoid incurring the prohibition on cumulation, companies can choose, by 27 November 2025, the tax credit referred to in Transition Plan 5.0. The company will have to submit, for the same assets covered by the subsidy, an application for access to the tax credit for investments in new capital goods referred to in Article 1, paragraphs 1051 et seq. of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020.

If the benefit isn’t recognised because the expenditure limit has been exceeded, subject to verification of the necessary requirements, the right to access the tax credit for investments in new capital goods will be unaffected, within the limits of the resources provided for by current legislation for the tax credit.

Controls and supervision are entrusted to the GSE, which, having ascertained that the conditions for benefiting from the benefit haven’t been met, will take measures to cancel the tax credit reservation and notify the Revenue Agency.

Corrections to the TU FER and suitable areas

a. Definition of ‘Agrivoltaic System’ and Exclusion from Prohibitions in Agricultural Areas

Article 2 of the Energy Decree Law introduces the definition of “agrivoltaic system” into Legislative Decree 190/2024. Specifically, letter f-bis) is added to Article 4, which refers to “agrivoltaic system: a photovoltaic system that preserves the continuity of farming and pastoral activities at the installation site. In order to ensure the continuity of farming and pastoral activities, the system may provide for the rotation of modules placed at a height above the ground and the application of digital and precision farming tools.”

The introduction of this definition entails recognising the “Agrivoltaic Plant” as a distinct and autonomous category with respect to photovoltaic plants with ground-mounted modules in agricultural areas and the inapplicability to the same of the limitations provided for this type of photovoltaic plant, as identified in paragraph 2 of Article 11-bis of the Energy Decree Law (see below, paragraph c.). The provision supplements the provisions of the TU FER, which already considered agrivoltaic systems as a separate category in terms of applicable authorisation and environmental procedures, as opposed to photovoltaic systems tout court.

The provision doesn’t refer to the CREA-GSE guidelines, which are still the benchmark for the sole purpose of agrivoltaic systems’ access to GSE incentives. With regard, in particular, to access to the support mechanism for innovative agrivoltaic systems referred to in Decree No. 436 of 22 December 2023 of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security, the objective and subjective requirements set out in the GSE Operating Regulations remain valid.

b. The ‘suitable areas’ on land immediately applicable

Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 on suitable areas is replaced by Article 11 bis of the same Legislative Decree.

The replacement means that some suitable areas already provided for in the previous Article 20, paragraph 8 are confirmed, while other suitable areas are added and others are modified for the worse.

Compared to the previous Article 20, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree 199/2021, the following areas are confirmed as “suitable”:

areas where systems from the same source are already installed, provided that the modification/renovation work doesn’t involve a change in the area occupied of more than 20%, except for photovoltaic systems on agricultural land, for which no change in area is permitted;

areas of sites subject to remediation identified pursuant to Title V of Part IV of Legislative Decree No. 152 of 3 April 2006;

quarries and mines that are no longer in operation, have not been reclaimed or have been abandoned or are in a state of environmental degradation, or portions of quarries and mines that are not suitable for further exploitation;

landfills or landfill lots that have been closed or restored2;

sites and facilities owned by companies belonging to the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane group and railway infrastructure operators, as well as motorway concession companies;

sites and facilities available to airport management companies within airport grounds, including those within the perimeter of the airports of the smaller islands referred to in Annex 1 to the Decree of the Minister of Economic Development of 14 February 2017, published in the Official Gazette No. 114 of 18 May 2017, without prejudice to the necessary technical checks by the National Civil Aviation Authority;

The following “suitable areas” have been added, which are new with respect to Article 20:

a) military property or property used for any purpose by the Ministry of Defence referred to in Article 20 of Decree-Law No. 17 of 1 March 2022, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 34 of 27 April 2022, for the purposes set out therein3;

b) property owned by the State or used for any reason by the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice and judicial offices, referred to in Article 10 of Decree-Law No. 144 of 23 September 2022, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 175 of 17 November 2022;

c) real estate identified by the State Property Agency, after consultation with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, owned by the State, not covered by development or disposal programmes under its jurisdiction, as well as State property identified by the same Agency in agreement with the user administrations, in use by the same, pursuant to Article 16 of Decree-Law No. 13 of 24 February 2023, No. 13, converted, with amendments, by Law No. 41 of 21 April 2023;

With reference to photovoltaic systems, in addition to the areas referred to in the previous points, with respect to the previous Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021:

These suitable areas have been confirmed:

d) areas adjacent to the motorway network within a distance not exceeding 300 metres;

These suitable areas have been added:

e) buildings and structures and their appurtenant external areas;

f) areas intended for industrial, administrative, craft, commercial use, or for logistics or data processing centres;

g) areas used for car parks, limited to covered structures;

h) water reservoirs, quarry lakes and disused mines or mines in a state of environmental degradation;

i) plants and related areas falling within the perimeter of the integrated water service.

These suitable areas have been modified:

j) areas within industrial plants and facilities not intended for agricultural production as referred to in Article 268, paragraph 1, letter h) and l) of Legislative Decree 152/2006, subject to integrated environmental authorisation pursuant to Title III-bis of Legislative Decree 152/2006, as well as areas classified as agricultural enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 350 metres from the same plant or facility.

The suitable areas that were in the previous Article 20, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 have been eliminated:

c-ter) point 1) exclusively for photovoltaic plants, including ground-mounted modules, in the absence of restrictions pursuant to Part II of the Code of Cultural Heritage and Landscape, referred to in Legislative Decree No. 42 of 22 January 2004, areas classified as agricultural, enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 500 metres from areas designated for industrial, craft and commercial areas, including sites of national interest, as well as quarries and mines;

and c-quater), even though c-quater constitutes a criterion on which the Regions will be called upon to identify suitable areas.

With regard to biomethane production plants, in addition to the areas referred to in points (a) to (i) above, the following areas are confirmed as suitable:

k) areas classified as agricultural enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 500 m from industrial, craft and commercial areas, including sites of national interest;

l) areas within industrial plants and facilities referred to in Article 268, paragraph 1, letter h) and l) of Legislative Decree 152/2006, subject to integrated environmental authorisation pursuant to Title III-bis of Legislative Decree 152/2006, as well as areas classified as agricultural enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 500 m from the same plant or facility;

m) areas adjacent to the motorway network within a distance of no more than 300 m.

On the basis of the above, we observe that:

the new provision in Article 11-bis of the TU FER contains the new list of areas suitable by law for the installation of RES plants, as Article 20, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 has been repealed and replaced by this provision;

with regard to areas suitable for the installation of photovoltaic plants, there has been a reduction in the number of suitable areas provided for in the previous Article 20, paragraph 8 of Legislative Decree 199/2021, given that the following are suitable (i) areas within the industrial plants and facilities referred to in Article 268, paragraph 1, letter h) and (l) of Legislative Decree 152/2006, subject to integrated environmental authorisation pursuant to Title III-bis of Legislative Decree 152/2006, and (ii) areas classified as agricultural enclosed within a perimeter whose points are no more than 350 m from the same plant or factory: Article 20, on the other hand, provided for a distance of 500 m between agricultural areas and industrial plants or establishments and didn’t contain any reference to the fact that the industrial establishments or plants to be considered for the purposes of the suitability of the area had to be subject to integrated environmental authorisation, which allowed for the inclusion – by way of interpretation – photovoltaic plants with a capacity exceeding 20 kW and wind farms to be included in the definition of industrial plants;

new areas suitable for the installation of biomethane production plants were introduced.

The absence of a transitional regime regarding the application of this new, more restrictive regulation to ongoing authorisation procedures is questionable, also in light of the criterion of the prevalence of the unsuitability of the area in cases where the plant falls only partially within a suitable area (see paragraph i. below).

Consider a photovoltaic plant with a capacity of less than 10 MW undergoing authorisation through PAS located in an agricultural area within 500 m of an industrial plant not subject to AIA. In this case, in the absence of a transitional regime, the tempus regit actionem principle expressly regulated by Article 15 of Legislative Decree 190/2024 could be invoked. It would be desirable for the conversion law to clarify the application of the tempus regit actionem principle.

c. Prohibitions on ground-mounted photovoltaic systems in agricultural areas

Article 2, paragraph 1, letter h) of the Energy Decree transcribes Article 5 of the Agriculture Decree, which introduced paragraph 1 bis into Article 20 of Legislative Decree 199/2021, and introduces paragraph 2 of Article 11-bis of the TU FER.

The provision merely confirms the prohibition on the installation of ground-mounted photovoltaic systems in areas classified as agricultural by current urban plans, with the exception of the following cases: in the areas referred to in paragraph 1, letters a), limited to interventions for the modification, renovation, upgrading or complete reconstruction of already installed systems, provided that they don’t involve an increase in the area occupied, c), d), e), f), l), numbers 1) and 2).

This provision doesn’t apply to the following cases:

projects involving ground-mounted photovoltaic systems aimed at building a renewable energy community within the meaning of Article 31 of Legislative Decree 199/2021;

projects implementing other investment measures of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), ie projects necessary for the achievement of the PNRR objectives;

projects for the construction of agrivoltaic systems, as defined by the new letter f-bis) of Article 4 of the TU FER – ie agrivoltaic plants that preserve the continuity of cultivation and pastoral activities on the installation site, including the rotation of modules placed at a height above the ground and the application of digital and precision farming tools – through the use of modules placed at a suitably high position above the ground.

This latest provision is a new development and is welcomed, as it clearly excludes both “basic” and “advanced” agrivoltaic systems from the prohibition laid down therein.

This provision also doesn’t provide for a transitional regime for authorisation procedures that are ongoing or have already been initiated, unlike the previous Article 5 of the Agriculture Decree Law.

The provision risks being unconstitutional, given that the Constitutional Court is already examining the previous (similar) a priori ban introduced by Article 5 of the Agriculture Decree Law.

d. Admissibility of RES plants in ‘free activity’ in UNESCO site protection areas

The Energy Decree also introduces Article 11-quinquies into the TU FER, according to which, within UNESCO site protection areas, installing renewable energy plants is permitted only for the interventions referred to in Annex A of the TU FER, ie interventions subject to the free building activity regime.

The use of the adverb “limitedly” in identifying the construction of renewable energy plants permitted in UNESCO sites only for projects falling within category A seems to imply a ban on installing, in these sites, of the categories of projects referred to in Annexes B and C of the TU FER and therefore of projects that can be approved with PAS and single authorisation. This interpretation is also supported by the new Article 11 bis, paragraph 4, letter d) of the TU FER which, in identifying the guiding criteria that the Regions and Autonomous Provinces must comply with when adopting their own laws on suitable areas, provides for the impossibility of establishing general and abstract prohibitions on installing renewable energy plants, “without prejudice” to the prohibition on installing photovoltaic plants in agricultural areas referred to in Article 11-bis, paragraph 2 (except for the exceptions provided for) and the provisions of Article 11-quinquies under consideration.

e. Granting concessions for suitable areas on sites and plants available to motorway concessionaires

Motorway concessionaires entrust the concession of suitable areas on sites at their disposal, subject to the determination of the relevant fees, on the basis of public procedures. This is initiated at the request of a party, with the publication of a notice, in compliance with the principles of transparency, impartiality and proportionality, ensuring conditions of effective competition.

The notices have to define, in a clear, transparent, proportionate and non-discriminatory manner, the subjective requirements for participation and the criteria for selecting applications, and the maximum duration of sub-concessions.

If the conditions set out in Article 76(2)(a) of the code referred to in Legislative Decree No 36 of 31 March 2023 are met, concession companies may award the suitable areas referred to in paragraph 1, letter e) of this article by means of sub-concession to subsidiaries or affiliates to ensure the necessary coordination of work on the network under management and the resolution of interference.

Subsidiaries or affiliates have to award works, services and supplies on the basis of public tender procedures, in accordance with the principles of transparency, impartiality and proportionality, ensuring conditions of effective competition. The duration of sub-concession agreements are determined on the basis of the useful life of the facilities and the investments necessary for their construction and management and may exceed the duration of the motorway concession, without prejudice to the possibility for the concessionaire taking over the management to terminate the sub-concession agreement by paying compensation equal to the investments made that haven’t been fully amortised.

f. ‘Suitable areas’ for offshore plants immediately enforceable

With regard to offshore plants for the production of energy from renewable sources, including the measures referred to in Annex C, Section II, letter v) of the TU FER, the regulation rewrites (by introducing Article 11-ter into the TU FER) the previous Article 23 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 and confirms that the areas identified by the maritime space management plans pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) and (5) of Legislative Decree 201/2017 and Prime Ministerial Decree No. 19/2018 are suitable.

It confirms that the following are considered suitable:

disused oil platforms and areas 2 nautical miles from each platform, without prejudice to the provisions of Ministerial Decree of 15 February 2019;

ports, for wind farms up to 100 MW, subject to any amendments to the port master plan, where necessary, to be adopted within six months of the submission of the single authorisation application.

g. ‘Suitable areas’ to be identified by the Regions or Autonomous Provinces

Within 120 days of the date of entry into force of the Energy Decree Law (ie 22 March 2026), each region and autonomous province has to identify, by means of its own law, the areas suitable for installing additional RES plants in addition to the areas suitable ex lege referred to in paragraph b. above, in accordance with the principles and criteria established by Article 11-bis, paragraph 4 of the TU FER and the objectives referred to in paragraph 5.

To identify additional areas suitable for installing renewable energy plants, the regions and provinces have to take into account the following principles and criteria:

protect cultural heritage and landscape, air and water quality, agricultural areas, with particular regard to those of high value and forest areas;

safeguard the specific characteristics of areas included in the Natura 2000 network and protected natural areas, wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, and UNESCO site protection areas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 11-quinquies of the TU FER;

the classification of an area as suitable may depend on the type of renewable energy plant or the power of a given plant;

it’s impossible to envisage general and abstract prohibitions on the installation of renewable energy plants;

priority qualification as suitable areas for surfaces and structures that are built on or characterised by soil sealing, also with a view to promoting individual and collective self-consumption;

for the purposes of classifying an agricultural area as suitable, the presence of productive activities and farms established in the area is relevant;

to preserve the agricultural use of land, agricultural areas that can be classified as suitable at regional level must not be less than 0.8% of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) nor more than 3% of the UAA itself; without prejudice to this percentage ratio, specific percentages of UAA exploitation may be defined at municipal level;

give priority to areas characterised by the presence of industrial centres, also with a view to facilitating self-consumption and decarbonisation of the productive sectors;

give priority to areas experiencing complex industrial crisis, also with a view to promoting industrial conversion and safeguarding employment levels;

to balance the needs of environmental protection with those of cultural and landscape heritage protection, the regions may not classify as suitable areas included within the perimeter of assets subject to protection pursuant to Legislative Decree 42/2004 or those included in a 3 km buffer zone, in the case of wind farms, and 500 m, in the case of photovoltaic plants, from the perimeter of the protected assets themselves, nor identify as suitable areas where the characteristics of the plants to be built are in conflict with the implementation rules provided for in the landscape plans.

On the basis of the above, we observe that:

as recently stated by the Regional Administrative Court of Rome, areas deemed suitable by law constitute a fundamental and essential core for the installation of RES plants, given that the regions and autonomous provinces can only identify additional areas suitable for RES plants beyond those already provided for in Article 11-bis, paragraph 1 of the Consolidated Law on Renewable Energy Sources (TU FER);

the regions and autonomous provinces can only identify additional areas “suitable” for the installation of RES plants by regional law and not “unsuitable” areas;

in identifying “suitable” areas, the regions and autonomous provinces can’t impose generalised bans on the construction of plants, as happened in the well-known case of the region of Sardinia through Regional Law 20/2024;

given the new definition of the principles and criteria for identifying additional areas suitable for the installation of FER plants, pursuant to the parameter set out in Article 10 of Law No. 62/1953, previous regional laws that conflict with this new principle established by the state may be considered implicitly repealed.

This measure reduces the scope for conflict between the state and the regions, because no derogations may be introduced for areas identified as suitable at national level. And because introducing general and abstract prohibitions, and therefore moratoria, is prohibited, and consistency with decarbonisation objectives has been imposed.

h. Power of the state to take action and replace the regions/provinces in the event of inaction

The Department for Regional Affairs and Autonomies of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers also exercises driving functions for the purposes of exercising substitute power.

In the event of failure to adopt this law within the deadline, or failure to comply with the principles and criteria referred to in paragraph 4 or the objectives referred to in paragraph 5, Article 41 of Law No. 234 of 24 December 2012 will apply. This provides for the adoption of substitute state measures for non-compliant regions and provinces, with effect from the expiry of the deadline set for the implementation of the relevant EU legislation, and which will in any case cease to have effect from the date of entry into force of the implementing measures of each region and autonomous province.

The state measures explicitly indicate the substitute nature of the power exercised and the flexible nature of the provisions. The legislative acts have to be submitted for prior examination to the Permanent Conference for Relations between the state, the regions and the autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano. The autonomous provinces are responsible for the planning process to identify suitable areas in accordance with the Special Statute and the relevant implementing regulations.

i. Provisions on authorisation regimes for plants in suitable areas

The Energy Decree Law introduces into Legislative Decree 190/2024 the new Article 11-quater on “Regulation of simplified administrative regimes for plants in suitable areas.” In particular:

the implementation of the measures referred to in Annexes A and B of the TU FER (ie works subject to the free building regime and the simplified authorisation procedure) in suitable areas is not subject to the acquisition of authorisation from the competent landscape authority, which issues a mandatory and non-binding opinion within the same time limits as those provided for the issue of the relevant acts of consent pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of the TU FER;

within the scope of the single authorisation procedures relating to the works referred to in Annex C of the TU FER (ie works subject to single authorisation) located in suitable areas, the landscape authority will issue a mandatory and non-binding opinion for environmental impact assessments and, if the deadline for issuing its opinion has passed without response, the proceeding authority will decide on the single authorisation application;

the terms of the single authorisation procedure for the construction and operation of the plants referred to in Annex C of the TU FER falling within suitable areas are reduced by one third, rounded down to the nearest whole number, where necessary;

the provisions referred to in the previous points also apply in the case of development or upgrading of the national transmission network.

The provision follows the previous provision of Article 22 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 but with the following change: the provisions referred to in the previous points apply only if the RES plant is located entirely in areas classified as suitable. This assessment seems to exclude the development and upgrading of the national transmission network, which could therefore be located in unsuitable areas and enjoy the benefits of the suitable areas of the plant. However, no mention is made of user-side connection works, which must also be located in a suitable area for the assessment.

If the plant is not located, or is only partially located, in a suitable area, the above provisions don’t apply. The criterion of unsuitability of the area prevails.

j. Decarbonisation targets and agreement between regions

Article 2, paragraph 1, letter p) of the Energy Decree Law confirms the decarbonisation obligations of the regions in accordance with the provisions of the Ministerial Decree of 21 June 2024.

Annex C-bis has been added to the TU FER, which contains the same table as the Ministerial Decree of 21 June 2024 and confirms the same regional allocations of the minimum annual power to be installed, for a total of 80 GW between 2021 and 2030.

The regions must significantly speed up their administrative procedures if they want to meet the 2030 targets, although it’s envisaged that each region may enter into agreements with other regions for the statistical transfer of certain amounts of power from renewable sources. A decree issued by the competent Director-General of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security defines the standard agreement for statistical transfer, and the methods for calculating the quantities of power involved in the transfer.

In the case of renewable energy plants located in the territory of several regions or autonomous provinces, or whose production is attributable to contributions from several regions or autonomous provinces, the allocation of the respective power for achieving the objectives is defined by agreements entered into between each local authority concerned.

k. The Digital Platform for Suitable Areas and Acceleration Zones

The Energy Decree also introduces the new Article 12-bis into the TU FER. Within 60 days of the Energy Decree entering into force (ie by 21 January 2026) the operating procedures of the platform established by MASE Decree of 17 September 2024 have to be regulated to include all information and tools necessary to connect and process data for the characterisation and qualification of the territory, the estimation of the potential and the classification of surfaces, areas and zones. This is to ensure adequate support to the regions and autonomous provinces in the process of identifying suitable areas and acceleration zones and in related monitoring activities. This is by Decree of the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (the MASE) and subject to agreement at the Unified Conference referred to in Article 8 of Legislative Decree 281/1997.

This platform also contains a counter of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) intended for the installation of RES plants, fed by information and data provided by the regions and autonomous provinces regarding the areas classified as agricultural in their respective territories.

l. Repeal of provisions

Articles 18, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of Legislative Decree 199/2021 are repealed.

11.Within the scope of the investments referred to in Article 4, paragraph 1, investments in the following are eligible for subsidies:

a)new tangible assets, instrumental to the business referred to in Annex A to Law No. 232 of 11 December 2016, interconnected with the company’s production management system or supply network and characterised by the additional requirements set out in the aforementioned annex;

b) new intangible assets, instrumental to the business referred to in Annex B to Law No. 232 of 11 December 20, including business management software if purchased as part of the same innovation project that includes investments in systems, platforms or applications for plant intelligence that ensure continuous monitoring and visualisation of energy consumption and self-produced and self-consumed energy, or introduce energy efficiency mechanisms through the collection and processing of data also from field IoT sensors (Energy Dashboarding).

2. For the purposes of identifying eligible investments, the provisions of Article 1, paragraph 1053, of Law No. 178 of 30 December 2020 shall apply, with particular reference to the ineligibility of investments:

a) in the assets indicated in Article 164, paragraph 1, of the TUIR;

b) in assets for which the decree of the Minister of Finance of 31 December 1988, published in the ordinary supplement to the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic No. 27 of 2 February 1989, containing the table of depreciation coefficients for tax purposes, establishes rates lower than 6.5 per cent;

c) buildings and constructions;

d) assets referred to in Annex 3 attached to Law No. 208 of 28 December 2015

2The latter, referred to in Article 20, paragraph 1 bis of Legislative Decree 199/2021, are exempt from the prohibition on the installation of ground-mounted photovoltaic systems on agricultural land.

Sean V. O’Brien is the executive director of the Energy Forward Alliance, a clean energy nonprofit subsidiary of the Tri-City Development Council (TRIDEC).","Artificial intelligence is reshaping the world’s scientific, industrial and energy landscapes – and the Tri-Cities is right at the center of this transformation. While much of Washington state is still debating the role of data centers needed to support this sea change, the Tri-Cities has taken a different path.

Communities across our area are already showing how – with the right partnerships and strategic intention – technological collaboration and data center deployment can be enablers of our state’s clean energy goals, scientific innovation and leadership, job growth, and industrial and economic development.

In a region that has powered the Pacific Northwest for 80 years, we understand that the question is not whether data centers are good or bad. The real question is whether we will utilize them as tools to build a prosperous future – or push away these opportunities that other states will happily capture.

Strategic partnerships

Across the Tri-Cities, local communities are demonstrating what a thoughtful, intentional approach to data centers can look like.

Deploying advanced nuclear clean energy has been a top priority for the Tri-Cities for years, but moving from aspiration to deployment requires partners with scale, capital and long-term load. That is exactly what Energy Northwest found through its collaboration with Amazon and X-energy on the Cascade Advanced Energy Facility.

Amazon’s prospective data center provides the anchor demand that makes it possible to deploy the Xe-100 here, advancing public power, modernizing the grid and reinforcing our community’s leadership in clean energy. This is not data center growth for its own sake; the data center partnership is what enables public-sector energy priorities to align with private-sector investment.

The Atlas Agro Pacific Green Fertilizer facility in Richland is another illustration of how data centers can be leveraged to unlock major industrial and clean energy opportunities. For Atlas, the biggest challenge has not been building a first-of-its-kind, carbon-free fertilizer manufacturing facility; rather, it has been building the transmission line to power the facility that has served as the long pole in the tent.

By pursuing a co-location partnership with a technology company that can provide upfront capital to build the line, Atlas Agro and the city of Richland can advance job growth, a strengthened agriculture sector, onshored domestic fertilizer production, and climate leadership via both the fertilizer plant and a data center campus.

Meanwhile, the city of West Richland is considering opportunities to integrate data centers into new municipal and district energy systems as the Lewis & Clark Ranch development moves forward.

And the Port of Pasco is pursuing how its work on agricultural symbiosis – a circular model where industrial byproducts become inputs for other industries – could be strengthened through data center partnerships that provide infrastructure, heat and energy services needed to scale the model.

Collectively, these examples reinforce how our region is proactively aligning technology infrastructure with local, community-centered goals.

Federal partnerships at Hanford

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued a national Request for Information on potential AI infrastructure sites. The Energy Forward Alliance led our community’s response, articulating a unified regional vision of integrating data centers with new transmission, clean energy generation, advanced manufacturing, and research assets across industrially-zoned portions of underutilized Hanford Site lands.

DOE is now actively engaging with our region to explore how Hanford can support national security, scientific and AI missions paired with local economic development. This is the Tri-Cities at our best: leading, not waiting; partnering, not prohibiting.

Tri-Cities leads nation

PNNL’s growing role in artificial intelligence further underscores the importance of data center infrastructure in our region. The Genesis Mission, launched by DOE, is a national effort to harness AI to accelerate scientific discovery and energy innovation. From grid optimization and climate modeling to advanced materials and national security, these breakthroughs require immense computing power and reliable, scalable infrastructure.

Data centers are not incidental to these missions, they are foundational. If Washington wants to continue serving as home to PNNL’s world-class scientific leadership and attract the next generation of federal investment, we must be a state that welcomes – not discourages – the infrastructure that enables it.

State’s tech legacy

The recent recommendations issued by Gov. Ferguson’s Data Center Workgroup have raised concerns for communities across Washington. While the report acknowledges benefits of data centers, several provisions – if implemented – would significantly disincentivize future investment. In effect, they send a message to hyperscalers and technology companies that Washington is skeptical at best – and hostile at worst – to their presence.

For a state with such a strong legacy of technological innovation – the state of Amazon and Expedia, Microsoft and F5, Zillow and T-Mobile – this does not reflect a forward-looking future built on prosperity and innovation. Nor does it reflect the real work being done in places like the Tri-Cities, where local governments, energy producers, researchers and industry partners are already showing how data centers can strengthen clean energy deployment, job creation and industrial development.

Labor is right

Washington’s workers see this clearly. Organizations like Climate Jobs Washington and the Washington State Building and Construction Trades Council have been unequivocal in sounding the alarm about the state’s direction and the recommendations from the Work Group: “…by blocking these projects, opponents are choking out one of the only consistent sources of family-wage union construction jobs.”

Sweeping anti-data center policies threaten jobs, delay clean energy deployment, undermine investment in our state’s communities, and cede economic opportunity to other states. These labor organizations know that major clean energy and technology projects don’t get built by accident – they get built through partnership. And unless we welcome the partners who can help build them, other states will.

Better path forward

No one is calling for data centers to blanket our state. Local communities are seeking to work with partners strategically and intentionally to align data center investments with our goals for energy generation deployment, industrial and manufacturing job growth, and other economic development.

In the Tri-Cities, that work is already underway. We are demonstrating how to plan with intention, partner with purpose, and use data centers as an asset – not an obstacle – to building the prosperous future we want. If Washington wants to lead in clean energy, in AI, and in innovation, then we must embrace the partnerships that make that leadership possible.

Counties that host data centers often see substantial boosts in local tax revenue, which can fund schools, infrastructure, and public services.
The future of data centers and the power systems that sustain them depends on multifaceted innovation, where engineering, policy, and economics intersect.","Data centers are popping up across Virginia at exponential rates. According to Business Insider, large tech companies filed permits for 54 new data centers in the commonwealth in 2025.

As energy needs associated with data centers continue to climb, so do questions about their reliability, sustainability, and economic impacts.

Virginia Tech recently hosted a workshop bringing together experts from industry, academia, and government to plan for a center-scale effort with the goal of enabling a more resilient and efficient data center ecosystem through research, workforce development, and policy. The meeting stemmed from research by an interdisciplinary team, with support from the College of Engineering’s Major Grants Initiative. Ali Mehrizi-Sani, professor of electrical engineering and director of the Power and Energy Center at Virginia Tech, and principal investigator for the research project, shared insights from the workshop and his research on power, policy, and cybersecurity issues that will shape the future of data centers in the commonwealth and beyond.

What was the goal of the recent data center workshop?

This workshop was really about bringing all the right voices together to understand what we need — scientifically, technically, and from a policy standpoint — to make Virginia’s data center ecosystem more sustainable and resilient. We wanted to identify the capability gaps we have today, the R&D questions we should be tackling, and the issues that matter most to industry and our citizens.

We framed it around a simple question for the stakeholders: What tools do you wish you had right now that would make your work easier?

Who participated in the discussion?

The workshop brought together a deliberately diverse, hand-selected group of about 35 participants representing academia, industry, utilities, environmental organizations, and state policymakers.

We had researchers from Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, Clemson, University of Alaska, and New York University, along with representatives from Dominion Energy, Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative, and Rappahannock Electric Cooperative.

The group also included representatives from the Piedmont Environmental Council, who voiced environmental and community perspectives, and state commissions such as the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation and the Joint Commission on Technology and Science, which advises the Virginia General Assembly.

What are the biggest misconceptions about data centers?

People often discuss the environmental impacts associated with data centers, but they often don’t talk about the large amounts of electric power they need. Most assume that power will always be there, but that takes a lot of generation and transmission infrastructure and many engineers. It’s the curse of a reliable system — it becomes invisible.

One of the most common misconceptions is the assumption that the existing power system can easily accommodate new and expanding data centers. While data centers have become vital for cloud computing, AI, and digital communication, their energy footprint is immense and continues to grow.

How does public perception influence data center construction?

Public perception plays a powerful role in shaping how data centers are built and managed. Many Virginians see the visible effects of large facilities, from changes in landscape, to local traffic, to construction, to worry about rising electricity costs or water consumption. Those perceptions are not unfounded, but they need to be considered alongside the factual impact that data centers bring to the commonwealth.

Each facility typically employs around 50 people, and those positions tend to be high-paying technical and maintenance roles, supported by hundreds of additional jobs during construction and through related service contracts. Counties that host data centers often see substantial boosts in local tax revenue, which can fund schools, infrastructure, and public services.

Looking ahead, what do you see as the next big opportunities for innovation?

Our research team is developing better tools to coordinate data centers with the grid. These optimization models can improve reliability and planning. They could also apply to renewables and other large-scale energy systems. And we’re keeping a close eye on new technologies like small modular reactors and next-generation batteries. We need a real breakthrough in both to make them mainstream.

The future of data centers and the power systems that sustain them depends on multifaceted innovation, where engineering, policy, and economics intersect. Our work is about creating tools and partnerships that help make those decisions intelligently. That’s how we ensure that the grid, and the technology it supports, remain strong for decades to come.",https://news.vt.edu/content/news_vt_edu/en/articles/2025/12/eng-coe-ece-powering-the-future-data-centers-ali-mehrizi-sani/_jcr_content/image.transform/l-medium/image.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:02:52.938684

Dive Brief:

Virginia ranks first, and Alabama last, in a Southeast power sector “competitiveness” dashboard launched this week by Duke University researchers.

Twelve states were scored according to indicators such as participation in wholesale power markets, net metering policies, presence of a consumer advocate, interconnection standards, procurement requirements and third-party power purchase agreements.

The top three ranked states – Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky – all participate in a regional transmission organization or an independent system operator like the PJM Interconnection or the Midcontitent Independent System Operator, researchers noted in a call with reporters and others on Thursday. However, the Southeast lacks its own ISO or RTO, posing a barrier to participation for the more southern states.

Dive Insight:

Trey Gowdy, research lead on energy and climate policy at Duke’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability, said on the call that there was “a lot of nuance” in their results, but that the findings generally grouped the 12 states into five tiers of descending competitiveness.

The first tier, which is the most competitive, Gowdy said, includes Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky, while the second tier contains Arkansas and Louisiana, the third contains Mississippi, North Carolina, Florida and South Carolina, the fourth contains Georgia and Tennessee, and the fifth contains Alabama alone.

“We kind of present those as kind of batches and possibly peer states,” he said.

Virginia ranked highest when it came to factors such as having an approved utility green tariff program, a state consumer office advocate, a requirement for limited competitive procurement for renewables and wholesale market participation.

Virginia ranked lower in variables like generation concentration and customer concentration, indicating relatively few service providers per capita.

The state’s electric utility sector, “including distribution utilities, is highly concentrated,” the dashboard says. “The state has a customer concentration (HHI) score of 4,475, which exceeds the 1,800 threshold that signals a highly concentrated market. This indicates that a small number of utilities serve customers across the state.”

The HHI, or Herfindahl-Hirschman index, “is a concept that comes from antitrust legislation” and is used by the Department of Justice to screen mergers and acquisitions, said Eric Parajon, a policy analyst for the Nicholas Institute, during the call.

He said they measured generation concentration by dividing each utility’s total nameplate capacity in a state by that state’s total nameplace capacity across generation units.

Virginia’s score “indicates a highly concentrated market,” he said. Nearly all of Virginia is covered by Dominion Energy, a monopoly utility. The state’s generation concentration was 3,540, again exceeding a 1,800 threshold set by the researchers.

Alabama, which ranked last, received positive scores for permitting municipal ownership of utilities and having a state consumer advocate office. It received negative scores for factors including its lack of statewide interconnection standards, wholesale market participation, a formal requirement for competitive solicitations and any net metering policy.

However, its HHI score for customer concentration was 3,210 and for generation concentration was 2,686 – both lower than Virginia’s respective scores.

A state’s participation in a regional transmission organization or independent system operator like PJM is “certainly a fairly significant element of competitiveness and kind of competition writ large,” and “something that we’re really focused on evaluating,” said Parajon.

Jackson Ewing, director of energy and climate policy at the Nicholas Institute, said that the rankings don’t reflect that “states that scored quite high on competitiveness metrics in aggregate scored quite low in certain indicators,” and vice versa.

“I think the heterogeneity of the results that we’ve realized here really embodies the variance that we see across the Southeast on these issues,” Ewing said.

In the future, the team that produced the dashboard is interested in measuring factors like “interconnection queue dynamics and policies,” Ewing said, or going further “into measuring levels of public support and opposition for new build, generation, transmission, distribution. We could get into permitting lag times and processes. All those are kind of outside our scope now, but are things that we’re actively considering.”

Alix Zwane, the director of research and engagement strategy at the Nicholas Institute, said another “natural next step” is to examine “the relationship between competitiveness and these other ultimate outcomes of interest — whether it’s consumer welfare or wellbeing or environmental outcomes.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nSSb2mX-b_TcZrFo234vB_X6Jnajdx3wt06w539wyXM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05MDY2MTk0MS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-12 13:02:20.345127

The E-Check program has been required since 1996 in Summit, Portage, Medina, Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain and Geauga counties to reduce air pollution.
Roemer championed the proposal that would have allowed residents in seven Northeast Ohio counties to submit an attestation form in place of a physical E-Check inspection.
“The E-Check program was created to safeguard public health, and the attestation option was a commonsense update that balanced safety, modernization, and convenience.
“Residents in Northeast Ohio deserve fair, data-driven policies,” Roemer said.","The EPA has rejected a request from Ohio lawmakers to end the E-Check vehicle emissions testing program in seven Northeast Ohio counties.

State officials had proposed replacing the physical inspection with a form where motorists attest their vehicle's emissions system is working properly.

The E-Check program has been required since 1996 in Summit, Portage, Medina, Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain and Geauga counties to reduce air pollution.

State Rep. Bill Roemer, who championed the change, expressed disappointment and plans to appeal to federal officials.

Greater Akron's E-Check program is not going away anytime soon.

The request by Ohio lawmakers to scuttle the requirement that motorists in Greater Akron and Cleveland have their vehicles inspected every two years has been rejected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in Chicago.

The request was part of a Transportation Bill passed by lawmakers earlier this year that asked the federal EPA and the Trump administration to make modifications to the state's emissions testing in northern Ohio.

Since 1996, motorists in Summit, Portage, Medina, Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain and Geauga counties have been mandated to have their vehicles tested to help meet the EPA's edict that the state cut down on lower-level ozone or pollution.

State Rep. Bill Roemer, a Republican from Richfield, said he is disappointed by the decision handed down by regulators this week.

Roemer championed the proposal that would have allowed residents in seven Northeast Ohio counties to submit an attestation form in place of a physical E-Check inspection.

“This decision is a setback for hardworking Ohio families,” Roemer said in a statement. “The attestation option offered a practical, safe alternative that would save people both time and money. Instead, (the EPA) chose to maintain an outdated process that, frankly, continues to burden families with unnecessary requirements.”

The formal request − 964 pages long − was sent to U.S. EPA's regional office in Chicago on July 9.

Roemer argues that the air is actually cleaner in parts of northern Ohio where the testing is mandated than other areas of the state.

“For too many years, the seven counties in Northeast Ohio have been unfairly burdened by a program that simply does not match the data,” Roemer said. “The E-Check program was created to safeguard public health, and the attestation option was a commonsense update that balanced safety, modernization, and convenience. By rejecting it, (the EPA) is prioritizing bureaucracy over practical solutions without delivering any measurable air-quality benefits.”

Roemer said he plans to call on federal officials and President Donald Trump to reconsider Ohio's request to modify the testing.

“Residents in Northeast Ohio deserve fair, data-driven policies,” Roemer said. “I urge (the EPA administrator) and President Trump to intervene, correct this decision, and allow the E-Check Ease Act to move forward for the benefit of families across our region.”

What changes were proposed for E-Check?

As it stands now, all gas-, diesel- and flex-fueled vehicles (including non-plug-in hybrids) that are between six and 25 years old and registered in Summit, Portage, Medina, Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain and Geauga counties are required to be tested by E-Check every two years.

The testing is done at an E-Check station or a mobile kiosk.

If the vehicle's check engine light is on, it is an automatic failure of the test, requiring repairs that must total at least $300 for a waiver.

The proposed modifications would forgo the in-person testing and simply require motorists to ""attest"" that a vehicle's emission system − including muffler and catalytic converter − are working and have not been tampered with.","https://www.beaconjournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/23/NABJ/83821562007-img-an-e-check-inspector-1-1-lp-13-hdnq-4-l-2016070874.JPG?crop=1999,1125,x0,y0&width=1999&height=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 13:01:39.535293

Hochul's direction to NYPA - the state's public electric utility - to develop at least 1 GWe of advanced nuclear capacity in Upstate New York was issued in June, and builds on her State of the State address, delivered in January, in which she outlined plans to develop a Master Plan for Responsible Advanced Nuclear Development in New York as part of a USD1 billion proposal to achieve a more sustainable and affordable future for the state. The NYPA issued its first two solicitations in relation to the initiative in November.

In addition to the USD40 million, the NYPA Board has awarded USD4 million to universities and organisations to develop and expand programmes that prepare New Yorkers for high-demand careers in artificial intelligence, electromechanical trades, and advanced power systems to meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

Plug & Charge, based on the ISO 15118-20 communication standard, simplifies charging for EV drivers.
“ChargePoint anticipates that PnC will gain traction, fueling further expansion of EV charging infrastructure, in 2026,” says the company.
Plug & Charge technology already operates on ChargePoint’s network and via roaming partners in North America and Europe.
Car manufacturers (OEMs) must enable their vehicles for Plug & Charge, and prepare their backend software for certificate management by a certification authority.","EVSE supplier and charging network operator ChargePoint has announced that its entire current hardware portfolio now supports Plug & Charge technology.

Plug & Charge, based on the ISO 15118-20 communication standard, simplifies charging for EV drivers. Instead of navigating proprietary apps or dealing with credit card readers (both common points of failure), drivers simply plug in and go about their business. Authentication and secure billing are handled automatically.

“ChargePoint anticipates that PnC will gain traction, fueling further expansion of EV charging infrastructure, in 2026,” says the company. “It will be particularly useful for the fleet sector and car-sharing businesses.”

Starting January 1, 2027, support for ISO 15118-20 will be mandatory in the EU.

Plug & Charge technology already operates on ChargePoint’s network and via roaming partners in North America and Europe. However, the company points out that scaling it up to encourage widespread adoption will require overcoming complex technical, commercial and regulatory hurdles. (There is also a semantic hurdle. Here at Charged, we say “Plug & Charge,” but some say “Plug and Charge,” and ChargePoint appears to have coined “PnC.”)

Daniel Brown, Senior Director, Product Management at ChargePoint, said: “The consumer demand for Plug & Charge is clear, but scaling access to drivers is a complex exercise in global alignment across hundreds of market players in four key areas.”

To wit:

Charge Point Operators (CPOs) need to source hardware and backend software that is Plug & Charge-compatible.

E-mobility service providers, which manage user-facing data and process payments, need to align their offerings with backend providers that manage chargers.

Car manufacturers (OEMs) must enable their vehicles for Plug & Charge, and prepare their backend software for certificate management by a certification authority.

Certificate authorities oversee the authentication and all necessary security to ensure a seamless, reliable and trustworthy process for the end user.

The very real challenges of scaling Plug & Charge seem to be the reason that ChargePoint competitor EVgo prefers Autocharge (an alternative seamless charging system based on DIN Spec 70121) for the moment. “We are committed to rolling out the Plug & Charge standard once the intricacies around certification and implementation have been addressed, [but] in the meantime, we continue to support Autocharge+ as our current solution to offer seamless session initiation,” an EVgo spokesperson told Charged.

“As awareness of the benefits of Plug & Charge continues to grow and key players collaborate to remove barriers, we anticipate new levels of alignment and significant momentum in 2026,” added ChargePoint’s Daniel Brown. “With ChargePoint’s global scale and expertise driving this innovation, we are positioned as a key enabler of a competitive, interoperable and secure EV charging ecosystem.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CP-stations-with-NACS_759x398.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 13:01:48.601645

(“LS C&S”), a global leader in power and communication cable and system solutions, announced today plans for a significant additional investment in Chesapeake, Virginia. Undertaken through three LS C&S subsidiaries, the $689 million project is expected to be the single largest capital investment in the history of the Hampton Roads region and create over 430 new jobs.

In addition to job creation, this project will create a new and growing domestic supply chain for magnetic copper wire and rare earth magnets that bypasses the monopoly of Chinese suppliers. This is a strategic investment by one of America’s most ardent allies to ensure reliable and consistent production of our national defense munitions. These products are used in America’s most advanced weapons systems like the Javelin missile, F-35 fighter jet, nuclear submarines and unmanned aerial systems (UAV). Alongside increased national security, this investment ensures Americans are able to benefit from the increased demand for these materials from the energy and manufacturing sectors. LS C&S’s new manufacturing complex, which will feature advanced manufacturing capabilities across three key business lines:

Copper rod production utilizing copper recycling and smelting,

Magnet wire manufacturing to support automotive and industrial markets, and

Rare-earth magnet production, essential for electric motors and advanced weapons systems

“Thank you to LS Cable & System for choosing Virginia again. Today’s announcement demonstrates that Virginia is leading the nation in reshoring American manufacturing and securing the critical supply chains that power and protect our country,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “LS GreenLink has already brought hundreds of millions of dollars to Hampton Roads, and these three projects from LS Cable & System will build on that momentum.

I’m proud that Virginia is partnering with LS C&S to strengthen American manufacturing, create great jobs, and build a stronger, more secure future for the Commonwealth and our nation.”

This investment builds on the previously announced first phase of LS GreenLink USA’s state-of-the-art cable manufacturing and pier facility project, which broke ground in April 2025. While separate from the LS GreenLink project, the new initiative expands the company’s overall presence in the United States and reinforces LS C&S’s long-term commitment to the Commonwealth of Virginia, the City of Chesapeake, and the Hampton Roads region. Together, these efforts strengthen U.S. energy infrastructure, enhance supply chain resilience, and support national security priorities.

“With three exciting projects in Chesapeake, LS Cable & System is poised to transform America’s tech manufacturing supply chain,” said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura. “Securing these supply chains does more than ensure smooth manufacturing timelines; it helps safeguard our national security. LS C&S’s continued investment in the Commonwealth shows that when government moves at the speed of business, big things can happen quickly.”

“This investment represents an exciting step in our continuing growth in the United States,” said LS C&S President and CEO Bon-Kyu Koo. “We’re not only expanding our manufacturing capabilities, we’re strengthening the U.S. domestic supply chains and supporting America’s leadership in energy and technology. By continuing partnerships with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the City of Chesapeake, and the Hampton Roads region, we’re creating opportunities for the local community while helping to ensure secure, reliable infrastructure that supports national security and the nation’s energy future.”

“The LS GreenLink project has been a major commitment for LS C&S, and this new investment builds directly on that foundation,” said LS C&S Regional President of North America Gisu Kim. “It strengthens domestic production of critical components such as copper rod, magnet wire, and rare-earth magnets, vital to reinforcing supply chain resilience and advancing U.S. energy independence.”

“This investment represents much more than expanding our manufacturing footprint in Chesapeake,” said LS C&S Managing Director Patrick Shim. “We are deepening our partnership with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the City of Chesapeake, and the Hampton Roads region as we build capabilities that strengthen U.S. energy leadership, secure critical supply chains, and support industries essential to the nation’s security and future.”

Founded in 1962, LS Cable & System Ltd. is a global leader in power and communication cables and systems. With over 6,500 employees and 40 subsidiaries in 17 countries, LS Cable & System continues to drive innovation in energy transmission and distribution.

“Congratulations to LS Cable & System and the entire LS Group on another major investment in Chesapeake,” said Hampton Roads Alliance President and CEO Douglas L. Smith. “The Hampton Roads Alliance is proud to support LS Group and to work alongside the City of Chesapeake as the company advances its commitment to expand U.S. power grid infrastructure. This investment aligns directly with the Hampton Roads Playbook, which prioritizes defense, energy, aerospace, and logistics. Energy security is national security, and projects like this further solidify Hampton Roads as a global energy leader.”

“Today’s announcement marks a major milestone for Chesapeake, the Commonwealth, and the nation in advancing domestic manufacturing,” said Chesapeake Mayor Rick West. “The decision by LS Cable & System to build its new facilities in our community demonstrates the confidence they have not only in Chesapeake’s talented workforce and strong business environment, but also in our commitment to helping businesses succeed here. This investment is LS Cable’s second major project in Chesapeake and elevates our city’s status as a leader in the nation’s clean energy and electrification future, bringing $689 million in new investment and more than 400 high-paying jobs. We value LS Cable’s ongoing partnership and friendship with the City of Chesapeake, and we look forward to building on that relationship in the years ahead.”

“LS Cable’s $689 million investment solidifies Chesapeake’s position as a premier destination for advanced manufacturing,” said Chesapeake Economic Development Director Steven Wright. “The establishment of new facilities for magnet wire and sintered rare-earth magnets production will provide much-needed support for U.S. supply chains for emerging mobility technologies and modern energy systems. This project will bring skilled jobs to Chesapeake and will strengthen the long-term industrial competitiveness of our region.”

“The Port of Virginia is ready to support LS Cable & System’s strategic investment in Chesapeake,” said Port of Virginia CEO and Executive Director Stephen A. Edwards. “Advanced manufacturing facilities like LS Cable not only strengthen Virginia’s role in global trade but will help accelerate innovation in the electric vehicle industry. The Port of Virginia is a 21st-century port complex that will provide LS Cable the supply chain efficiency, consistency and connectivity needed to succeed in today’s competitive marketplace.”

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked with the City of Chesapeake, the Hampton Roads Alliance, and The Port of Virginia to secure the project for Virginia. Governor Youngkin approved a $7.3 million grant from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund to assist Chesapeake with the project. The Governor also approved a performance-based grant of $1.5 million from the Virginia Investment Performance Grant, an incentive that encourages continued capital investment by existing Virginia companies. The company is eligible to receive benefits from The Port of Virginia Economic and Infrastructure Development Zone Grant Program.

Part of the Green River system, Sage Creek in Southwest Wyoming is a critical water source for local communities and native fish.","Across the country, communities are discovering that some of the most effective solutions to today’s environmental challenges come from working with nature rather than against it. From the shifting deltas of coastal Louisiana to the high-desert streams of Wyoming, restoration efforts show that when we support natural processes—rather than replace or restrain them—we can rebuild vital landscapes, strengthen community resilience and create long-term environmental and economic benefits. Two recent examples from Neptune Pass, in Louisiana, and Sage Creek, in Wyoming, illustrate how following nature’s lead can spark transformative, lasting change.

As the Mississippi River flows through Louisiana and towards the Gulf of Mexico, the mud, clay, sand and silt the water carries with it is deposited into coastal wetlands. This process helps balance coastal erosion by creating new land along the shore. But increasingly frequent, climate change-driven mega-storms, along with human-made infrastructure that disrupts the river’s natural flow, have diminished its ability to build new land. As a result, a football field's worth of the Louisiana coast now disappears into the sea every 100 minutes.

Over the last century Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of land. That is roughly the same size as the state of Delaware. The remaining land weakened by erosion is more vulnerable to damage from hurricanes and storm surges.

But at Neptune Pass, a small outlet forged by the Mississippi River 70 miles south of New Orleans, nature is showing us a path to bring back eroded coastal areas and create more resilient landscapes.

After several high-water years culminating in 2019, the Mississippi River broke free of the constraints channeling it at Neptune Pass. The water flowing through Neptune Pass is now delivering enough sediment to create sandbars in Breton Sound – helping to restore the shoreline.

Replenished coastal wetlands slow storm surge and absorb floodwaters, protecting both people and property from catastrophic damage. As sediment is deposited, vegetation takes root, which also creates habitat for fish, migrating birds and other wildlife.

What began as a small outlet at Neptune Pass has now grown to become an 850-foot-wide channel. If it were categorized as a stand-alone river, it would be the 10th largest river by volume of flowing water in North America.

In past years the Army Corps of Engineers may have responded to nature breaking free in this way by closing the pass entirely as the simplest way to protect the larger river from disruption. Instead, working in consultation with environmental groups, the Corps has recommended stabilizing the pass to keep it from expanding further, while still allowing water and sediment to flow through.

By choosing to follow nature’s lead, rather than trying to force it to fit a predetermined, human-engineered project, we have built a more sustainable, long-term strategy to protect Louisiana’s Gulf Coast.

More than 1,500 miles away in an entirely different landscape, nature is creating lasting change in the Colorado River Basin. In this case, conservationists are using human-made infrastructure to kickstart a solution that will allow nature to take over and protect local communities and wildlife habitats.

Part of the Green River system, Sage Creek in Southwest Wyoming is a critical water source for local communities and native fish. The river’s importance stretches far beyond the local region. It feeds into the Green River and ultimately into Flaming Gorge reservoir, which supplies water to Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Colorado.

Over the years, conditions along Sage Creek have deteriorated due to fire, flooding, prolonged drought and other land use issues. In an effort to improve the health of the river, Trout Unlimited is working with local landowners to find ways to restore the natural environment around Sage Creek.

Their work has included building dozens of beaver starter homes, also called Beaver Dam Analogs. Designed to mimic the dams that beavers naturally build in their habitat, these structures are porous walls of sticks, logs and leaves that slow water in one part of the stream, encouraging vegetation growth and creating wetlands. This slower-flowing water naturally filters sediment and pollutants as it runs downstream, leading to cleaner water supplies and healthier landscapes.

The wetter areas established by the dams also help protect against damage from catastrophic wildfires by generating natural firebreaks and absorbing floodwaters before they reach local communities.

Beaver dam analogs are, by nature, temporary. They’re meant to serve a purpose for a time and provide an opportunity for nature to take over and continue the natural process that has been started. If there are beaver colonies close by, the hope is that they treat the analog structures as starter homes by moving in, improving the original dams and building more structures in the area. The more dams that are built, the more their habitat improves by enabling conditions for the willow and cottonwood trees beavers depend on to survive.

The companies said the partnership will deliver a portfolio greater than 1 GWh of energy storage projects across the country, and make use of both Trina Storage’s Elementa 2.0 & 2.5 energy storage solutions.

The pair have previously demonstrated their work with four projects in Groton, Holden, and Paxton, in the Northeast state of Massachusetts in 2024. During a heatwave in the region, Trina Storage North America commissioned two sites ahead of schedule, and was able to provide capacity to utilities during periods of elevated demand.

While not declaring project locations, Trina Storage and Lightshift noted new installations will support utilities and local communities through enhanced grid stability, peak load management, and flexible capacity to handle the evolving grid. Lightshift deploys fleets of distribution-connected batteries as opposed to higher-voltage transmission-connected sites, often delivering swifter installations yet remaining at scale.

“We are pleased to continue our collaboration with Lightshift through this significant milestone,” said Doug Alderton, head of sales, Trina Storage North America. “Our earlier joint projects demonstrate what our strong partnership can accomplish under demanding conditions.”

Samsung SDI scores LFP deal as it switches from EV battery production

Samsung SDI, the battery arm of the Samsung Electronics conglomerate, said its US-based subsidiary had signed a three-year deal from 2026 to supply LFP energy storage batteries to an unnamed “American customer”, in a deal that exceeds $1.36 billion.

The LFP cells supplied by Samsung SDI will be installed in Samsung’s battery energy storage system (BESS) it calls SBB 2.0, a 20-foot containerized energy storage system. SBB 2.0 is Samsung SDI’s first energy storage system to use prismatic LFP batteries, with the previous SBB 1.7 equipped with high-nickel NCA cells.

The cells will come from modified production lines at Samsung SDI’s existing factory, originally built in partnership with Stallantis for the US EV market. As market demand for EVs has grown at slower-than-expected rates, Samsung has already converted lines to produce energy storage batteries.

A similar announcement for a Stellantis manufacturing facility in North America came in previous months, as NextStar’s Canadian battery plant shifted gears to produce stationary storage batteries as opposed to lines solely dedicated to EV cells.

BayWa r.e. secures financing for hybrid energy park: 125 MW solar, 280 MWh storage

The Jacumba Valley Ranch (JVR) Energy Park in Southeastern San Diego County has reached financial close, with $416 million in funding commitments secured. The park, rated at 90 MWac/127 MWdc of solar and 70 MWac/280 MWh, secured a construction-to-term loan facility from Société Générale, as well as a preferred equity investment from funds managed by alternative investment manager Wafra. Further, North American-based Acadia Infrastructure Capital invested preferred equity in JVR alongside Wafra.

It’s used in many industries, including the production of petrochemicals, cement, and fertilizers.

MIT chemical engineers have now discovered a simple way to make carbon capture more efficient and affordable, by adding a common chemical compound to capture solutions. The innovation could cut costs significantly and enable the technology to run on waste heat or even sunlight, instead of energy-intensive heating.

Their new approach uses a chemical called tris — short for tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane — to stabilize the pH of the solution used to capture CO2, allowing the system to absorb more of the gas at relatively low temperature. The system can release CO2 at just 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit) — a dramatic improvement over conventional methods, which require temperatures exceeding 120 C to release captured carbon.

“It’s something that could be implemented almost immediately in fairly standard types of equipment,” says T. Alan Hatton, the Ralph Landau Professor of Chemical Engineering Practice at MIT and the senior author of the study.

Youhong (Nancy) Guo, a recent MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of applied physical sciences at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Chemical Engineering.

More efficient capture

Using current technologies, around 0.1 percent of global carbon emissions is captured and either stored underground or converted into other products.

The most widely used carbon-capture method involves running waste gases through a solution that contains chemical compounds called amines. These solutions have a high pH, which allows them to absorb CO2, an acidic gas. In addition to traditional amines, basic compounds called carbonates, which are inexpensive and readily available, can also capture acidic CO2 gas. However, as CO2 is absorbed, the pH of the solution drops quickly, limiting the CO2 uptake capacity.

The most energy-intensive step comes once the CO2 is absorbed, because both amine and carbonate solutions must be heated to above 120 C to release the captured carbon. This regeneration step consumes enormous amounts of energy.

To make carbon capture by carbonates more efficient, the MIT team added tris into a potassium carbonate solution. This chemical, commonly used in lab experiments and found in some cosmetics and the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, acts as a pH buffer — a solution that helps prevent the pH from changing.

When added to a carbonate solution, positively charged tris balances the negative charge of the bicarbonate ions formed when CO2 is absorbed. This stabilizes the pH, allowing the solution to absorb triple the amount of CO2.

As another advantage, tris is highly sensitive to temperature changes. When the solution full of CO2 is heated just slightly, to about 60 C, tris quickly releases protons, causing the pH to drop and the captured CO2 to bubble out.

“At room temperature, the solution can absorb more CO2, and with mild heating it can release the CO2. There is an instant pH change when we heat up the solution a little bit,” Guo says.

A simple swap

To demonstrate their approach, the researchers built a continuous-flow reactor for carbon capture. First, gases containing CO2 are bubbled through a reservoir containing carbonate and tris, which absorbs the CO2. That solution then is pumped into a CO2 regeneration module, which is heated to about 60 C to release a pure stream of CO2.

Once the CO2 is released, the carbonate solution is cooled and returned to the reservoir for another round of CO2 absorption and regeneration.

Because the system can operate at relatively low temperatures, there is more flexibility in where the energy could come from, such as solar panels, electricity, or waste heat already generated by industrial plants.

Swapping in carbonate-tris solutions to replace conventional amines should be straightforward for industrial facilities, the researchers say. “One of the nice things about this is its simplicity, in terms of overall design. It’s a drop-in approach that allows you to readily change over from one kind of solution to another,” Hatton says.

When carbon is captured from industrial plants, some of it can be diverted into the manufacture of other useful products, but most of it will likely end up being stored in underground geological formations, Hatton says.

“You can only use a small fraction of the captured CO2 for producing chemicals before you saturate the market,” he says.

Guo is now exploring whether other additives could make the carbon capture process even more efficient by speeding up CO2 absorption rates.

The Emmy Awards have been presented annually for the past 70 years by the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS), both at the national and regional level. “Our Blues Make Us Gold”’s nomination is in the Nashville/Midsouth Region, which includes North Carolina, Tennessee and parts of Alabama.

“This film is a story of perseverance and triumph, of challenges and achievement, told through the words of Aggies who trace their success back to the education they received and experiences they had at North Carolina A&T,” said Brandon Gerard, who co-directed the film with his production partner and wife, Ashley Shanté, through their production company, From A2B Studios.

“Our Blues Make Us Gold” is one of five nominees in the highly competitive Documentary – Historical category. Other nominees include “How to Sue the Klan,” co-produced by leading civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump; “The Dollywood Dream,” about Dolly Parton’s famous Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, theme park; “Permanent Good: A Duke Documentary,” which chronicles the history of Duke University in honor of its 100th anniversary; and “Baker for America,” about the life and legacy of the late Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., who also served as President Reagan’s chief of staff.

“Our Blues Make Us Gold”’s high-profile nomination is the latest milestone for a film that has enjoyed exceptional national success over the past three years. In production since 2019, the film earned a $100,000 completion grant in 2022 from the Black Experience on Xfinity that supported enhancement and finalization of the project.

In 2024, Comcast Xfinity chose the completed film for an eight-month run on its streaming platforms – Xfinity, X1, Flex and the Black Experience. In summer 2025, the film went on a multi-city theatrical tour, screening in Atlanta, Charlotte, Durham and Greensboro to enthusiastic audiences.

In June, the documentary was tapped by Prime Video for streaming on its massive global platform, where it continues to be available free for Amazon Prime subscribers and for rent by the general public. And in August, it screened at the star-studded Martha’s Vineyard African American Film Festival in Massachusetts.

Shanté and Gerard said one of the most memorable sentiments they heard from Aggies as they produced the film was the level of care and nurturing that accompanies the university’s academic rigor – from faculty, from staff and from alumni. That sets North Carolina A&T’s student experience apart from the thousands of other universities across America.

“It’s very much like a family. Like a mother or an auntie or something like, ‘Okay, yeah, but you still have to get this work done,’ ” Shanté told WFDD-FM earlier this year.

Our biggest win was protecting the national EV charging network from Trump’s illegal freeze of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Our lawsuit – along with national pressure and sharp communications – helped prompt the program’s restart by unlocking $2.7 billion for essential EV charging infrastructure nationwide along highways.

Senior Attorney Joe Halso put it best when he described what was at stake when Trump moved to abandon the NEVI program in Law360:

“It’s no surprise that Trump’s unlawful NEVI freeze served Big Oil, while communities are left to pay the price—with more pollution, higher energy costs, and fewer charging options. We’re glad for the opportunity to restore essential projects that communities have been waiting on and to keep the clean energy economy moving forward.”

Now, every state has submitted NEVI plans under new guidance and they all are moving ahead. This program restart—and the fact that the new guidance came without any anti-EV poison pills—is a direct result of the litigation brought by us, our case partners, and twenty states and DC.

Our lawyers continue to fight to protect NEVI from further attacks and to ensure long-delayed EV charging projects proceed expeditiously.

This year we also delivered a powerful response against the Trump EPA’s dangerous proposal to block the federal climate pollution standards for cars and trucks, which had been updated by the Biden administration in 2024. We participated in a wide range of actions to make our opposition known, such as organizing dozens of participants to testify at a 4-day EPA hearing; submitting thousands of public comments; co-leading a sign-on comment letter with over 100 partners; and hosting a press conference in Michigan. Advocates across the country collectively demanded that the EPA keep the current common-sense, life-saving standards in place. The Trump EPA is set to make a decision to roll back these standards any day now.

We’re so proud of the Sierra Club’s leadership on National Drive Electric Month. Sierra Club staff and volunteers hosted community events in September and October showcasing zero-emission cars, trucks, buses, and bikes. Showcasing EVs and sharing helpful resources on incentives was super valuable and timely given the changes to federal funding and tax credits this year.

In 2026, we will continue working to ensure all Americans have access to zero-emission, reliable, and convenient transportation options. Our playbook includes supporting clean transportation and saving families money by deploying zero-emission vehicles, building robust EV charging infrastructure, improving access to public transit, and investing in safe infrastructure for walking and biking.

With these gains, we can improve air quality, cut costs, and dismantle the status-quo fossil fuel agenda paid for by Trump and his polluter cronies. Our committed staff, volunteers, and members across the country are ready to organize and campaign to meet this vital moment – to defend what we’ve built and advance clean, affordable transportation for all.

Rivian Automotive impressed Wall Street on Thursday with its plans for artificial intelligence, automation and an internally developed silicon chip, but significant challenges involving demand and capital remain for the electric vehicle maker.

Despite Wall Street analysts expressing some optimism following Rivian's first ""Autonomy and AI Day,"" the company's stock fell 6.1% to close Thursday at $16.43 per share. But shares recovered during intraday trading Friday and were up more than 15%.

While the event didn't cause many analysts to change ratings or price targets, Needham raised its price target on Rivian by 64% to $23 per share. The firm did so on the tech announcements and potential for future licensing deals, as well as higher-than-consensus expectations on deliveries next year of the company's new midsize R2 SUV.

""RIVN signaled a shift from an [automaker] adopting autonomy to one leveraging AI to build end-to-end autonomy,"" Needham analyst Chris Pierce said in a Friday investor note.

The company's stock had ramped up heading into the AI Day, but many analysts believed the announcements from the event were already ""priced in."" Shares also fell as OpenAI made its own AI announcement Thursday, revealing its most advanced model yet.

""We attended Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day yesterday in Palo Alto and came away mostly impressed with the strategic direction outlined by management,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said Friday in an investor note. ""However, the stock's weakness seems warranted given the run-up since earnings and lack of a major AI partnership/deal announcement.""

Rivian's announcements included a proprietary chip, RAP1, designed for ""physical AI,"" namely autonomous driving; an evolved software architecture, or ""brains"" of the vehicle; a new AI assistant; and a roadmap for getting to ""personal L4,"" or fully self-driving personally owned vehicles.

The latter begins later this month with an update involving its hands-free driving system, followed by plans to continue to expand capabilities until vehicles reach full autonomy in the years ahead. Rivian did not disclose a timeframe for the full autonomy or potential robotaxi fleet autonomous vehicles.

Leading up to the event, Rivian shares were up more than 30% to $17.50. Despite those gains, shares remain well off the levels of the company's IPO of $78 per share in 2021.

Barclays analyst Dan Levy and others said while Rivian's technology announcements, including the surprise proprietary chip, were impressive, the company remains a ""show me"" story amid more challenging market conditions.

""With RIVN facing a tougher path to breakeven on core vehicle sales alone, we believe with enhanced AV/AI capabilities RIVN is further paving the path to additional software/service revenues, which would be margin accretive,"" Levy said Friday in an investor note. ""To be clear, there is certainly a 'show me' element for RIVN on its capabilities.""

Challenges include slumping EV demand following the end of up to $7,500 tax credits in September, lack of other support under the Trump administration and internal struggles at the company involving products and capital.

Several analysts noted the adoption of advanced driver assistance systems remains low across the industry, even at U.S. EV leader Tesla , and Rivian is continuing to play catch up to other companies that have offered such systems for years.

Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe and other executives argued that the company's vertical integration of in-house capabilities including software, AI, vehicle platforms and other technologies will allow the automaker to be more efficient, quicker and better than others.

""AI is enabling us to create technology and customer experiences at a rate that is completely different from what we've seen in the past,"" Scaringe said during the event.

Such arguments, as well as the automaker's prior $5.8 billion joint venture software deal with Volkswagen, have led Wall Street to price Rivian's software business higher than its core of producing and selling EVs, given market conditions.

A $12 price target for Rivian shares from Morgan Stanley, which recently downgraded the company to underweight, includes $7 for software and services and $5 for its core automotive business. Several analysts added that Rivian might be able to license or sell its newest technologies, including chips.

""RIVN is developing a suite of hardware and software offerings to remain competitive in an Auto 2.0 world. However, several risks remain around demand, potentially limiting data capture needed to reach higher levels of autonomy,"" Morgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco said in a Friday note.

Morgan Stanley raised concerns about autonomy adoption rates, lackluster EV demand ahead of Rivian's new ""R2"" vehicle next year and a prolonged path to profitability as reasoning for the rating confirmation.

Carlos Barria | Reuters

RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan agreed: ""The advancements enhance Rivian's product offering but do not address ongoing concerns around liquidity and R2/R3 profitability.""

Rivian continues to lose billions of dollars annually, despite significant cost reductions and gains in software revenue thanks to its deal with VW.

Rivian ended the third quarter with $7.7 billion in total liquidity, including nearly $7.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that Scaringe has said position the company ""really well"" for the R2 launch.

The R2 midsize SUV is crucial for Rivian — especially since it's a major market in the U.S. With expectations of a $45,000 starting price, it is anticipated to broaden Rivian's customer base and be a proof-point for the company's efforts regarding profitability and cost savings.

Rivian's current R1 pickup truck and SUV consumer models start at more than $70,000. It also builds electric delivery vans, largely for its biggest shareholder Amazon , that start around $80,000.

""Profitability pressure will likely intensify as Rivian rolls out its ~$45K R2 platform in the highly competitive mid-size SUV segment,"" Narayan said. ""While targeting a lower price point could increase market reach, the R1 platform's struggles with profitability despite being nearly double the price of the R2 raise.""

Shares of Rivian, with a $22.5 billion market cap, are rated hold with a $15.43 per share price target, according to average ratings and estimates compiled by FactSet.

Energy efficient electric upgrades—like high-performance heat pumps (that offer heating and cooling), efficient water heaters, better insulation, and induction stoves, to name a few—offer a great user experience, play a huge role in lowering energy bills, and reduce dangerous indoor and outdoor air pollution.

In 2025, we focused on local, regional and state efforts to build and grow momentum towards building decarbonization and holistic upgrades that make homes safer, healthier, and more affordable to power. We also fought hard to preserve all the ground we have gained at the state and federal levels.

Despite growing public support, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are putting plans into motion to roll back common-sense energy efficiency standards (that are legally required to be updated) and made deep cuts to funding for clean energy investments that directly benefit American households through lower utility bills, a struggle with which most Americans are currently grappling. Trump ensured a dismantling of the ground-breaking Inflation Reduction Act that would have created lots of good-paying jobs and helped more families achieve safer, cleaner homes.

Every step of the way, and at all levels of government, we stood up for safer, healthier homes for people of all income levels and better access to more affordable, cleaner appliances.

Two efforts are particularly emblematic of our work at the federal level this year:

As soon as the Trump Administration came into office, we knew the landmark Inflation Reduction Act was on the chopping block. We got started right away in educating people and Congress about the benefits the IRA had already unlocked and the future the legislation could help achieve for regular people, businesses, and American manufacturing.

We released a series of videos across our social media platforms highlighting those benefits. We also collected thousands of signatures urging Congress to protect clean energy and preserve the Inflation Reduction Act. The videos featured:

Gloria Daniels in South Carolina who cut her energy costs by upgrading to a heat pump and solar panels—made affordable through a grant from the Sustainability Institute and federal programs from the Inflation Reduction Act;

Chef Chris Galarza, who shared how restaurants can improve kitchen conditions, save money, and boost efficiency by switching to induction—without sacrificing temperature control; and

American company, Copper, that makes induction stoves. Companies like Copper support stronger job security, boost domestic manufacturing, and make products for healthier, more efficient kitchens, and would have been boosted with support from the IRA.

Our efforts to protect IRA consumer rebates for energy efficient appliances have thus far been successful, though that fight is not over. And while Republicans in Congress did end tax credits for home energy upgrades, in our efforts to preserve what we could, we also raised awareness about the harms of burning fossil fuels in homes and the benefits of energy efficiency and electrification for energy security and affordability.

We have worked to make sure that consumers know that the benefits of the IRA home energy tax credits are still accessible through the end of the year by updating our home energy guide and sharing reminders on social media.

The framework for accelerating the transition to cleaner, more efficient homes and buildings may no longer exist at the federal level, but the change is underway nonetheless. And we will continue to educate people and facilitate that transformation as best we can in the coming year to meet our goals of cleaner air and more affordable energy.

Another critical program, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, was under attack throughout the year. We worked hard to protect and preserve it, and we were successful.

LIHEAP is a program that helps low-income households afford the energy they need to keep their homes safe, powered, and habitable, especially during extreme heat and cold events. Early in the year, DOGE fired all the staff responsible for the LIHEAP program, and the president proposed zeroing out LIHEAP’s budget all-together in the administration’s draft budget.

In June, we flew volunteers and staff from eight states into DC to share powerful constituent stories about the importance of LIHEAP with more than 35 Congressional offices. Sierra Club also generated more than 10,000+ digital actions and supporters drafted more than 120 letters to the editor in support of the program. Our voices were heard. LIHEAP funding was preserved in the final budget resolution that passed Congress.

However, LIHEAP faced further threats during the government shutdown. Existing staff shortages were compounded by the closure, and LIHEAP funds were not reaching states at a critical time, just as weather was beginning to turn cold in many places. We brought attention to this problem in the press and on social media, and called on utilities to take action to protect people from power shutoffs. Now, as we reach the end of the year, all LIHEAP funds have been distributed to states to deliver to people who can not afford their energy bills.

We also found ways to make significant progress at the local and state level.

Twelve cities in California passed air conditioning to heat pump conversion building codes, accelerating the transition off of gas in homes and buildings.

The City of Ashland, Oregon passed a novel climate pollution fee on new construction, ensuring that any new homes built with fossil fuels had to pay their fair share of the social cost of carbon.

Just this month, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) issued a final written order on Clean Heat targets, directing Colorado's major investor-owned gas utilities to achieve 41% reductions in emissions by 2035, compared to 2015 levels. The PUC rejected proposals for weaker targets by state agencies and utilities, siding with the arguments of the Sierra Club and Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, which were supported by local governments, state legislators, dozens of organizations across Colorado, and more than 600 members of the public.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities published final orders in proceedings addressing utility requests to charge customers for the costs of replacing aging gas infrastructure (Gas System Enhancement Plans). The orders cited the Sierra Club’s testimony and briefing dozens of times and adopted nearly all our recommendations to disincentivize the continued expansion of the gas system and prioritize safety over utility profits.

In New York, the Atlantic Chapter generated the most public comments by far of any environmental organization on the State’s draft Energy Plan, the first plan released in a decade. Sierra Club supporters also commented in person at every hearing across the state, especially in western New York, where dozens of Sierrans effectively countered the major turnout of opposition fueled in part by the influence of the local gas utility, National Fuel, who also fracks in Pennsylvania, and who has been successfully keeping area Democrats from supporting key statewide gas transition legislation from getting passed. Another highlight was focused on legislation. The only major environmental bill passed by the legislature will end gas line allowances if the Governor signs it, and collectively Sierrans took 3,000 actions supporting the bill, in addition to having almost a hundred volunteers from across the State travel to lobby legislators in support of the bill on 3 different lobby day events.

In Illinois, our advocacy and organizing led to Illinois Commerce Commission staff recommending an industrial electrification pilot program that would support industrial heat pump and thermal battery demonstration projects -- crucial strategies industry can use to reduce pollution, improve public health, and boost clean domestic manufacturing and jobs. Commission staff also recommended two other pilot programs based in part on Sierra Club’s advocacy: one to support electrification of agricultural activities such as grain drying and dairy production, and another to advance thermal energy networks, a form of shared energy that can provide efficient and pollution-free heating and cooling to entire neighborhoods.

Our campaign also drove comments and submitted testimony to the Illinois EPA during the drafting process of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) to reach the standards set for safe air in the Clean Air Act. Our efforts led the state’s EPA to broaden the public input process and actively consider adopting boiler electrification as a path to reduce emissions and achieve attainment of air quality standards. Now that the state has been moved from moderate to serious nonattainment, our efforts to engage the public and give regulators tools to address harmful emissions effectively are becoming even more crucial.

Sierra Club is defending state and local building electrification efforts against industry attack in courts across the country.

This year, we secured preliminary victories in multiple cases and defended initial wins on appeal.

Sierra Club was part of a successful lawsuit against the unconstitutional ballot initiative 2066 in Washington, which would have rolled back electrification policies across the state and increased energy costs. A state court ruled in our favor and paused implementation of the initiative. That decision has been appealed.

Sierra Club intervened in defense of a California air district’s rule that prohibits air pollution from boilers and the federal trial court agreed with our arguments. In October, we filed a brief at the appellate court urging it to uphold the rule.

The federal trial court in Colorado partially granted a motion by Sierra Club to dismiss an industry challenge of building code standards that would phase out gas appliances.

A federal trial court in New York upheld the state’s All-Electric Buildings law, which requires most new buildings to be all-electric by 2028.

Sierra Club played a vital role in coalition efforts to develop and pass the challenged law, and submitted amicus briefs at both the trial court and on appeal detailing the public health benefits of building electrification.

As we move into next year, the challenges may grow—but so will our resolve. We will continue to defend strong energy efficiency standards, support clean home upgrades, and fight misinformation that undermines consumer choice and public health. And we will expand our work as a campaign beyond residential buildings and into industrial settings, fighting to clean up industrial boilers.

In 2026, the Building Electrification campaign will have a new name: Clean Heat. Same mission, but even broader goals.

Efforts by the Trump administration and the fossil fuel industry to roll back and block our efforts doesn’t just stall progress. These attacks risk limiting consumer choice, keeping families locked into outdated technologies, lead to more pollution in overburdened communities, and worsen the affordability crisis.

The fight for consumer choice, healthy homes, and clean industrial practices isn’t over. In fact, it’s just getting started. And Sierra Club’s Clean Heat campaign is ready to meet the moment.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-12/image-4.png.webp?itok=DiMjHxB6,N,,2025-12-12 12:01:00.796539

Ford has set a new course for its European operations by entering a deep industrial collaboration with Renault Group. The strategic deal centres on Ford developing new electric passenger vehicles based on Renault’s dedicated Ampere platform and tapping into its state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. This manufacturing agreement allows Renault to maximise its EV production capacity and advance its core Ampere strategy.

Furthermore, the partners have signed a Letter of Intent to explore the joint development and manufacture of selected light commercial vehicles (LCVs) for both brands, with the primary aim of achieving competitive industrial scale and cost efficiency in a capital-intensive region.

This latest strategic shift, announced in Cologne, sketches an industrial and political wager. The aim is to fashion a leaner, more agile European operation capable of turning a profit while consumers inch hesitantly toward electrification. For Ford, which has in recent years restructured factories, trimmed portfolios and navigated volatile EV demand, Europe remains both an opportunity and a warning as it tests the technological mettle of global carmakers.

Renault's leadership transition reaffirmed its plans for continuity and international ambition with the appointment of François Provost as CEO and director in July.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” said Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford Motor Company. “How we compete here – how we innovate, partner and invest – will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

""This partnership shows the strength of our partnership know-how and competitiveness in Europe,"" added François Provost, CEO of Renault Group. ""In the long term, combining our strengths with Ford will make us more innovative and more responsive in a fast-changing European automotive market.

The new plan reasserts three organising principles. First, to strengthen Ford Pro’s commercial dominance. Second, to rebuild passenger car desirability with distinctive, multi-energy products arriving from 2028. And third, to recalibrate Ford’s manufacturing base to secure scale, cost efficiency and flexibility in a region where margins remain elusive.

Detailing the strategic partnership

Ford's collaboration with Renault Group involves the co-development of two Ford-badged electric passenger vehicles on Renault’s Ampere platform, due in 2028. Critically, Ford will lead styling and driving dynamics to maintain its distinct identity and brand assertion, even while leveraging Renault's core technology and production assets.

Renault Group confirmed on November 3 that it has “executed definitive agreements” with China-based automotive manufacturer Geely, extending the two companies’ “strategic cooperation” in Brazil.

Ford frames the collaboration as a necessary but controlled step in an increasingly capital-hungry industry. “Our plan is about unleashing the Blue Oval,” said Jim Baumbick, president, Ford Europe. “We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product.""

This arrangement is strategically significant for both parties. For Ford, it represents an expansion of its model to offer new electric vehicles at lower capital investment, following a similar agreement that utilises Volkswagen’s MEB platform. For Renault, the deal is an important alliance separate from Nissan, whose traditional partnership has recently faced challenges. The new collaboration with Ford, alongside a separate partnership with Geely, underscores Renault’s shift toward building a robust, new network of strategic global alliances.

Collectively, the effort follows a well-established pattern. Ford’s alliances with Koç Holding and Volkswagen underpin its commercial vehicle leadership, and the new tie-up with Renault extends this logic into the passenger car domain.

Recasting the industrial footprint for multi-energy flexibility

The restructuring of Ford’s industrial base is unfolding through a mixture of modernisation and inter-company synergy. Ford Otosan, the joint venture with Koç Holding, is widely cited as one of the sector’s most effective collaborations. Its plants are supplied with electric drive units from Halewood in the UK, following a £380 million investment in the facility, equivalent to roughly $480 million today. Advanced engines continue to flow from Ford’s Dagenham plant, maintaining its strategic relevance. Volkswagen also remains a pivotal partner, with Ford’s EVs from their alliance produced at the Electric Vehicle Centre in Cologne. Meanwhile Ford’s Valencia plant is being positioned as a backbone for the next phase of passenger car development, supporting the shift toward multi-energy architectures. Collectively, these arrangements represent Ford’s attempt to offset Europe’s structurally high costs while preserving control over product character.

Ford’s evolving agenda for Europe

Ford’s next phase centres on a product offensive timed for the late 2020s. A new family of multi-energy passenger and commercial vehicles, positioned as affordable rather than aspirational, is intended to offer customers gradual electrification rather than ideological purity. These additions will join the existing portfolio in 2028 and are pitched as a counterweight to both low-cost Asian challengers and European rivals accelerating their EV ramp.

The company describes this portfolio as a pathway to “sustainably profitable” operations, a phrase that signals Ford’s intent to avoid the margin erosion currently afflicting parts of the EV market. Europe’s regulatory direction of travel may be clear, but demand patterns are not. Electric vehicles account for 16.1% of new sales across the region, well below the level required to satisfy upcoming CO2 thresholds.

Ford presses Europe for regulatory realism

As Ford refreshes its industrial and product agenda, it is also making a political one. The company argues that Europe’s regulatory trajectory risks outpacing consumer readiness. The disparity between mandated CO2 reductions and actual EV uptake has sharpened tensions between policymakers and manufacturers.

The chancellor of Germany, Friedrich Merz confirmed on November 28 that he would send a letter to Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, urging the EU to ease plans to outlaw the production of ICE vehicles from 2035.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose – whether that's fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” said Jim Baumbick. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

""When manufacturers or suppliers would prefer to export it because they get a lot more money for it overseas... that's one challenge,"" said Parag Amin, a business analyst.

The other is increased demand from AI data centers, which require vast amounts of electricity. That's in addition to the Trump administration ending tax credits for solar, wind and other renewables.

""Which is really what can be built in the next few years to meet that growing demand. All of these things are coming together to create this affordability crisis,"" said Robbie Orvis of Energy Innovation.

New Yorkers were able to notch a small victory by speaking out. Experts say that New York has bucked the trend of these requested rate increases by utilities.

Con Edison had been proposing a double-digit rate increase. That has been scaled back to a pending of about 3%.

NEW YORK – This week, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe (SRMT) signed a Performance Partnership Agreement (PPA) to memorializes the trust relationship between EPA and the Tribe while ensuring the continuation of the SRMT’s wide-reaching environmental programs. The PPA is accompanied by a Performance Partnership Grant (PPG) of over $11 million. The PPA lays out the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe’s environmental priorities and short- and long-term strategies to address them. This is the only such PPA that EPA has with any Indian Nation. The agreement is the sixth such agreement that EPA has had over the years with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. It covers 16 critical environmental and stewardship programs.

“I am proud to continue the amazing relationship between the EPA and the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and to ensure the continued success of their many impressive environmental programs,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “I was honored to stand with three Chiefs of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe as we sign this agreement that will strengthen our bonds of mutual respect and professional collaboration to help ensure a bright future for the Tribe’s future generations.”

“The SRMT Tribal Council acknowledges the many Tribal members who have led environmental initiatives at Akwesasne to get us to this moment,” said Tribal Council. “We greatly value and appreciate the continuing partnership with the EPA, which has been vitally important in helping to ensure a better tomorrow for our community.”

The PPA covers a wide range of programs, including air quality, Superfund oversight, water quality, hazardous materials spill response, solid waste management, environmental assessment, pesticide, and agriculture programs. The agreement includes a work plan that the Tribe will use to accomplish its environmental goals including improve environmental quality, enhance natural resources, and protect human health from chemical contamination exposures in air, water, soil, and cultural resources. In it are also performance measures to ensure goals are met, including regular interactions between the SRMT’s environmental experts and EPA experts. The Tribe and EPA will ensure that evaluations are performed formally during a scheduled meeting twice a year.

Background:

Performance Partnership Agreements Overview

EPA, states, and Tribes share responsibility for protecting human health and the environment. The unique relationship between EPA, states, and Tribes is the cornerstone of the nation's environmental protection system. Working together, EPA, states, and Tribes have made enormous progress protecting our air, water, and land resources. The National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS) was established in 1995 as a performance-based system of environmental protection designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of EPA partnerships with states, territories, and Tribes. By focusing resources on the most pressing environmental problems and taking advantage of the unique capacities of each partner, performance partnerships can help achieve the greatest environmental and human health protection.

Performance Partnership Agreements and Grants

One of the main ways EPA, states, and Tribes implement performance partnerships is by negotiating PPAs. These agreements set out jointly developed priorities and protection strategies and how EPA and the state or Tribe will work together to address priority needs. States and Tribes can also choose to combine funds from multiple federal environmental program grants into PPGs which allow them to direct resources where they are needed most or try innovative solutions to environmental problems.

Implication for Korean companies: Korean companies should anticipate greater opportunities as preferred partners in major regional projects.","The release of the 2025 National Security Strategy (“NSS”) provides the definitive strategic blueprint for the new administration’s foreign policy. While the NSS outlines a broad global framework, its core emphasis on geoeconomic competition and strategic reindustrialization carries profound and immediate implications for the Republic of Korea (“ROK”), its corporate sector, and the U.S.–ROK alliance. For Korean conglomerates (chaebols) that drive the nation’s economy, the NSS signals a pivot away from traditional security concerns toward a strategic architecture built on industrial alignment and supply chain integrity. Below are the key takeaways most relevant to Korean companies and the evolving U.S.–ROK alliance:

1. Geoeconomic Realignment and Strategic Supply Chain Mandates

The NSS formally embeds economic security as an indispensable component of national security. It positions the ROK, alongside the Quad partners like Japan, Australia, and India, as a critical node in a trusted network engineered to secure strategic supply chains, specifically mentioning critical minerals, emerging technologies, and energy infrastructure.

The NSS highlights U.S. dependence on concentrated mineral supply chains and calls for diversified sourcing with trusted allies. Furthermore, the NSS defines U.S.–China competition as systemic, mandating more stringent controls on the transfer of sensitive and dual-use technologies.

Importantly, the resulting compliance landscape does not present a binary choice between the United States and China; rather, Korean companies will need to structure supply chains and governance frameworks that protect U.S. market access while managing ongoing commercial exposure to China.

Implication for Korean companies: Korean companies active in EV batteries, advanced manufacturing, and strategic materials (lithium, nickel, rare earths) face a regulatory duality. They stand to benefit significantly from incentive alignment under U.S. federal programs and reshoring initiatives. However, participation is now conditioned upon rigorous compliance with increasingly strict U.S. regulatory frameworks, including Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) restrictions and proactive management of export controls and Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review risks, particularly where federal financial support is involved.

2. Increased Expectation for Defense Burden-Sharing and Dual-Use Capabilities

The NSS sets a clear and elevated standard for alliance burden-sharing. It explicitly calls for allies, including the ROK, to significantly increase defense spending and expand the industrial capacity necessary to meet collective security objectives.

It signals a focus on the rapid deployment and integration of cutting-edge dual-use technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology, and quantum computing, recognizing them as immediate drivers of both national security and economic resilience. This signals a formal sectoral convergence where technological leadership is viewed synonymously with military and economic power.

Implication for Korean companies: Korean companies with capabilities in aerospace, defense, advanced robotics, and specialized materials should prepare for increased ROK defense procurement opportunities and a mandate for greater interoperability with U.S. defense modernization programs. As a leading global defense exporter, Korea’s defense industry stands to benefit from deeper integration with U.S. modernization initiatives, even while managing pricing and procurement pressures arising from U.S. tariffs and industrial policy constraints. Companies exposed to sensitive intellectual property or technology transfers, especially those with research and manufacturing footprints intersecting with China, must immediately reinforce their internal compliance and technology screening frameworks to mitigate export control and investment review risk.

3. Strategic Opportunities in Indo-Pacific Infrastructure

The NSS emphasizes private-sector–led economic engagement in physical and digital infrastructure across the Indo-Pacific region. The ROK’s globally recognized expertise in Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC), nuclear and renewable energy, smart grid infrastructure, shipbuilding, and critical manufacturing aligns strongly with these objectives.

Implication for Korean companies: Korean companies should anticipate greater opportunities as preferred partners in major regional projects. These opportunities extend beyond core construction to include advanced solutions for grid modernization, clean energy corridors, data center build-outs, and resilient port infrastructure. Although framed within an Indo-Pacific context, aligned opportunities will also emerge in the Middle East and Europe, regions where Korean companies already maintain a strong commercial presence, particularly as China plays a reduced role in U.S.-aligned infrastructure initiatives. Additionally, Korean entities should consider exploring funding structured through multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development finance institutions (DFIs), where they are well positioned to play a key role in structuring and deploying financing vehicles that accelerate infrastructure development in strategic emerging markets.

Conclusion: The Dual Mandate of Compliance and Opportunity

The 2025 NSS reconfirms the ROK’s status as an indispensable frontline ally and critical industrial partner in U.S. strategic, economic, and technological planning.

This standing translates into a clear, dual-track operational mandate for the Korean corporate sector. Korean companies will need to (1) seize the substantial opportunities created by U.S. industrial policy and (2) manage the growing regulatory complexities around supply chains, technology controls, and U.S.–China exposure. Success in the next phase of the U.S.–ROK strategic partnership will depend on corporate governance that effectively integrates proactive strategic alignment, guided carefully by legal and compliance advisors, with the practical realities outlined in the 2025 NSS.",https://www.hunton.com/assets/images-t1765557254/204247.png,N,,2025-12-12 12:01:03.441937

The parties believe that the partnership has the potential to advance HEFA and next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF pathways

The parties intend to jointly evaluate the future development of New Rise Louisiana, a SAF facility comparable in size to XCF's New Rise Reno facility of ~40 million gallons

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESS Newswire / December 12, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX); Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""); and DevvStream Corp. (""DevvStream"") (Nasdaq:DEVS) (together ""the parties"") today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform and Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, said:

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

""Sheep are the best animal that can do grazing among these solar panels,"" said Cody Hoffman, project lead for RWE, per nola.com.","About 600 sheep will soon take over landscaping duties at Louisiana's newest solar energy facility, reported nola.com.

RWE Clean Energy just wrapped up construction on Lafitte Solar, a 550-acre installation in the Ouachita Parish area, approximately 4 miles south of Monroe. The 100-megawatt project will deliver electricity to around 17,000 households once it starts feeding into the area's power lines this year.

Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has agreed to purchase clean energy as part of its company-wide sustainability efforts.

The sheep are an eco-friendly alternative to gas-powered mowing equipment for keeping grass trimmed. Some people living nearby initially raised concerns about the project, but developers worked with the community to block views of the panels from nearby homes.

The project created around 150 jobs during the building phase and should bring in $32 million in local tax dollars during its operational years. For the environment, the facility will provide clean electricity without the pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels.

If you want to bring solar power to your own roof, adding panels is one of the smartest home energy moves you can make, potentially dropping your electricity costs to nearly nothing. TCD's Solar Explorer pairs you with trusted installers and helps you pocket up to $10,000 in savings by gathering competitive bids.

The Solar Explorer features $0 down subscription plans that can reduce your utility rates by up to 20%. Palmetto's LightReach program is one option that allows you to secure lower energy rates. EnergySage, another Solar Explorer partner, helps you access incentives and compare quotes from installers.

Adding an upgraded HVAC system alongside solar can trim your heating and cooling expenses by up to 50%, and TCD's HVAC Explorer helps you discover an affordable option that fits your needs. The free Palmetto Home app lets you earn up to $5,000 in rewards for home improvements just by completing everyday tasks.

""Sheep are the best animal that can do grazing among these solar panels,"" said Cody Hoffman, project lead for RWE, per nola.com. ""Cows can damage the panels, goats will climb on everything and chew on everything. Sheep are docile and calm, and they just like to eat grass.""

,Congress,2025-12-12 15:58:02+00:00,KPBS Public Media,Imperial Valley city sues to force environmental review of massive data center project,"Kori Suzuki, www.kpbs.org, kori-suzuki",,,,,https://www.kpbs.org/news/environment/2025/12/12/imperial-valley-city-sues-to-force-environmental-review-of-massive-data-center-project,"For two weeks, a fight has been brewing over a massive data center project proposed in the Imperial Valley that is designed to power artificial intelligence technology.
The planned data center would be located in unincorporated land in the heart of the city.
Rucci said the data center would require 750,000 gallons of water per day for facility operations.
On Tuesday, the data center debate took over the Board of Supervisors’ meeting — even though it wasn’t on the agenda.
That data center would be located along Highway 111, between the towns of Niland and Calipatria.","For two weeks, a fight has been brewing over a massive data center project proposed in the Imperial Valley that is designed to power artificial intelligence technology.

Now, the small city of Imperial is suing to bring the project to a temporary halt.

In a lawsuit filed late last week in Imperial County Superior Court, city officials are seeking an injunction that would overturn the county government’s approvals for the data center and block the developer from moving forward with construction.

The suit accuses county officials of violating California’s environmental laws, along with some of their own regulations, by prematurely greenlighting elements of the project. The city is asking the court to overturn any permits or approvals the county has granted so far.

Imperial is the county’s fourth-largest city, with a little over 22,000 residents. The planned data center would be located in unincorporated land in the heart of the city.

Imperial City Manager Dennis Morita said they ultimately decided to file a lawsuit because of the scale of the project — and because county officials appeared to be rapidly moving forward with little public input.

“The City Council also felt very strongly that its residents should have a voice in how this development happens,” Morita told KPBS Thursday.

On Thursday, representatives of the Huntington Beach-based developer behind the project, Imperial Valley Computer Manufacturing, said they had not yet had a chance to view the suit. But they argued the project is planned for land already set aside for industrial purposes.

“We will continue to engage in good faith, correct misinformation, and work with neighbors on specific, workable measures,” wrote Sebastian Rucci, a Huntington Beach-based attorney and managing member of the company, in a text Thursday afternoon.

Critics of the planned data center celebrated the city of Imperial’s decision.

Imperial resident Francisco Leal has lived next to the planned data center site for 18 years. In recent weeks, he has rallied his neighbors to oppose the project and helped organize a petition that has garnered more than 1,000 signatures.

Leal said he was inspired to push back against the project’s construction by reading about pollution the facilities can produce and the resources they consume. He said he doesn’t want his two children to grow up in the backyard of a massive technology complex.

“That gives us hope,” Leal said Thursday after learning of the city’s lawsuit. “That makes us feel like they got our back.”

Data centers are essentially massive, air-conditioned warehouses full of computer chips and other hardware and have been part of the infrastructure of the internet for a long time.

But they have become an increasing flashpoint in communities across the country as major tech companies like Google and Meta have sought to dramatically expand their footprint amid their frenzied race to develop generative AI technology.

That’s because data centers consume massive amounts of energy and water to power their computing equipment and keep it cool. Some facilities emit an audible hum. They also drive up emissions of greenhouse gasses.

In many cases, data centers are also built and run by private, third-party companies. As a result, the public has little information about how they are affecting the energy grid and environment.

On Monday, a coalition of more than 200 environmental groups demanded that Congress enact a nationwide emergency stop on data center development, calling it “one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.”

The proposed data center in the Imperial Valley has a listed electric power rating of 330 megawatts, according to planning documents published by City of Imperial officials.

A megawatt is a measurement of how much energy the facility can receive at any given moment. Around 100 megawatts of electric power could support electricity for 80,000 households in the United States, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Rucci said the data center would require 750,000 gallons of water per day for facility operations. That’s equivalent to the daily water use of about 9,000 U.S. households, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Rumblings about the project have reached a crescendo over the past two weeks.

The increasingly heated discussion was triggered by an announcement the city of Imperial released the week of Thanksgiving. In it, they said the city had recently become aware of the data center project and was unsure how close county officials were to granting it final approval.

That uncertainty, Morita said, was key to their decision to raise the alarm.

“We did not want to be put in a position where we somehow waived anything relative to the entirety of the project,” he said.

Since then, hundreds of Valley residents have demanded more information about the project. Last week, California State Sen. Steve Padilla, D-18, sent a letter to the county Board of Supervisors calling for more public input and a full environmental impact report.

On Tuesday, the data center debate took over the Board of Supervisors’ meeting — even though it wasn’t on the agenda.

Residents, environmental activists and representatives from other advocacy groups packed the county administration building and demanded the county hold a public hearing on the project.

Rucci, the developer, has pushed back forcefully against the criticism, describing the project as “ministerial” — a technical planning term for a project that automatically meets county requirements.

“The property we selected is not some hidden pocket of farmland suddenly targeted for heavy development,” he wrote over text Thursday. “It is industrially zoned land near other industrially zoned and near major infrastructure--high-voltage transmission lines and railroad tracks.”

The City of Imperial disputes some of Rucci’s claims.

In court filings, city officials said the project site has several different zoning designations, including for urban farmland and various levels of industrial activity. Some of those zones, they said, do not allow data centers or the planned battery storage facility.

The battery storage and other elements of the project, the suit alleged, should have required a conditional use permit — a special permit that would require county planners to hold a public hearing and a formal vote.

The city also accused county officials in the suit of violating the California Environmental Quality Act by evaluating individual components instead of the project as a whole.

Rucci, the suit said, actually approached the City of Imperial about building a data center months before working with the county.

City officials weighed his request. Morita said they did see potential benefits in the project for the city and the county, and acknowledged that their suit could discourage other developers.

“I'm hopeful that we can get there in a way that this development can move forward,” he said, “but in a responsible way.”

Leal is less optimistic. Although Rucci has made promises that the data center would rely primarily on recycled water and renewable energy, Leal questions whether those commitments are true and whether they would be binding.

“We want to hear from the county because they're the authority,” he said. “They're the ones that got elected by us, so they need to tell us.”

Rucci is not the only developer with plans to bring data centers to the Imperial Valley.

On the north end of the valley, the Tustin-based start-up CalETHOS is also aiming to start building a 200,000 square-foot data center next year, along with a broader technology campus.

That data center would be located along Highway 111, between the towns of Niland and Calipatria.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/87c2775/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6048x3175+0+428/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2F6a%2Fbdf635d94c6391fdaa14387d54e8%2F20251209-ksuzuki-datacenter-346.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 12:01:28.885524

This interim final rule implements the Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) provisions enacted under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4. The rule takes effect immediately while inviting public comment through Dec. 29, representing a significant transformation of the program.

What is the Energy Dominance Financing Program?

The EDF Program is the rebranded and expanded successor to the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) Program originally created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While the EIR Program focused on projects that reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants, the EDF Program shifts the focus toward energy security, grid reliability, domestic resource development, and critical mineral supply chains.

The program authorizes the secretary of energy to guarantee loans up to a total principal amount of $250 billion through Sept. 30, 2028. The OBBBA provides $1 billion in new appropriations to cover credit subsidy and administrative. According to DOE, this rebranding reflects ""the material changes to the loan program established by OBBBA, as well as the type and volume of projects DOE anticipates."" The program is positioned as ""a core pillar to the Administration's strategy to win the global AI race"" and aims to enable projects supporting clean coal and oil and gas power generation, critical mineral supply chains, and nuclear industry revitalization.

The first deal has already been made. On Oct. 16, Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the LPO's first deal under the EDF Program — a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for American Electric Power to overhaul approximately 5,000 miles of power lines across the Midwest. Notably, this project was initiated under the former President Biden administration's EIR Program but finalized under the new EDF framework.

Key Changes

The definition of ""energy infrastructure"" has been expanded to include critical minerals. Previously limited to facilities used for generation or transmission of electric energy, or production, processing, and delivery of fossil fuels, the new definition encompasses ""a facility, and associated equipment, used for enabling the identification, leasing, development, production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining, and generation needed for energy and critical minerals."" This expansion opens eligibility to projects across the entire energy and critical minerals value chain.

Eligibility criteria have shifted from a focus on emissions reduction to focusing on production capacity and reliability. The interim final rule eliminates the requirement that projects ""avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases."" Projects are now eligible if they: (1) retool, repower, repurpose, or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations; (2) enable operating energy infrastructure to increase capacity or output; or (3) support or enable the provision of known or forecastable electric supply at time intervals necessary to maintain or enhance grid reliability or other system adequacy needs.

The community engagement requirements for applications have been removed. DOE has eliminated the application requirement for ""an analysis of how the proposed project will engage with and affect associated communities."" This requirement, introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act and previously estimated to require 14 hours per response from 89 annual respondents, is no longer mandatory. The rule designates this change as an ""E.O. 14192 deregulatory action"" under Executive Order 14192, ""Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation.""

Electric utility pass-through requirements remain in place. Despite the removal of community engagement analysis, applications from electric utilities must still include ""an assurance that Applicant will pass on the financial benefit from the Guarantee to the customers of, or associated communities served by, the electric utility.""

Credit standards and repayment requirements are unchanged. DOE emphasizes that while the class of potentially eligible projects has expanded substantially, ""the criteria, rules, etc. used to determine whether a project has a 'reasonable prospect of repayment' (as determined by DOE in consultation with Treasury) has not changed."" The default rate projections remain consistent with prior program operations.

Environmental remediation eligibility continues. As under the previous EIR Program, eligible EDF Projects may ""include the remediation of environmental damage associated with Energy Infrastructure.""

Eligibility and Limitations

To qualify for EDF, projects must meet several core requirements:

Location: The project must be located in the United States or a U.S. territory.

Production and Transformation: The eligible component or infrastructure must be produced by the applicant through a process that substantially transforms materials, elements, or subcomponents into a complete and distinct product. Simple assembly or superficial modifications do not qualify.

Trade or Business Requirement: Production and sale operations must be part of the applicant's trade or business.

Meeting One of Three Criteria: Projects must either retool/repower/repurpose/replace ceased energy infrastructure, enable operating infrastructure to increase capacity or output, or support forecastable electric supply for grid reliability purposes.

The interim final rule makes clear that projects previously ineligible due to emissions-related requirements may now qualify under the expanded criteria. Examples of newly eligible projects include:

Upgrades or capacity expansions at operating natural gas or coal plants to enhance reliability or extend usable life.

Critical minerals extraction, refining, or midstream processing facilities that strengthen U.S. supply chains.

Grid-scale storage and generation projects that ensure forecastable power delivery during peak or reliability-critical intervals.

Upstream and midstream energy projects tied to domestic resource development.

Implementation Timeline and Next Steps

Effective Date: The interim final rule is effective immediately upon publication on Oct. 28.

Comment Period: DOE will accept comments, data, and information regarding this interim final rule until Dec. 29. Interested parties may submit comments through the Federal eRulemaking Portal (www.regulations.gov), email (LPO.IFR@hq.doe.gov), postal mail, or hand delivery to the DOE LPO.

Loan Authority Expiration: The $250 billion in loan guarantee authority under Section 1706 expires on Sept. 30, 2028. DOE has emphasized the need to move quickly to process applications and issue loan guarantees before this deadline.

Treatment of Existing Applications: DOE confirms that provisions of the loan guarantee regulations not amended by OBBBA remain in full force and effect. This allows DOE to continue processing existing applications already in the pipeline under prior Section 1706 guidance while expanding eligibility for new applicants under the updated framework.

Environmental Integrity Project (“EIP”) published a document titled:

State of Decline: Cuts to State Pollution Control Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA (“Report”).

The overall premise of the Report is that some state environmental agencies have seen significant budget cuts which will make it difficult for them to assume responsibility for activities that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) had traditionally undertaken.

The concern is driven by significant reductions in EPA staff and budget.

Congress provided the ability in the various federal environmental statutes for states to carry out (i.e., be delegated) the requirements of various programs for which it has charged the federal agencies with implementing. EPA can delegate to a state implementation of federal program if a number of required criteria are met. The assumption of such authority by a state from EPA is often called primacy. A state, territory, or Tribe with primacy, has primary enforcement responsibility, and can oversee the program in that state, territory, or Tribe.

Generally, the state regulates, and the federal government or/and EPA oversees the state regulatory program. In the event the state regulatory program is deemed inadequate, as determined by EPA it assumes the regulatory program or a portion of that program. Most states (including Arkansas) have obtained primacy for the various programs that can be delegated because they then become the primary authority for purposes of regulation and enforcement.

The Trump administration has argued that the states can and should have more responsibility to implement the various environmental programs. However, the EIP Report expresses concern about various states ability to undertake more responsibility for environmental oversight. The Report argues that more than half of the states have cut the budgets of their own environmental agencies over the last 15 years.

By way of summary, the Report argues that:

… These deep reductions mean that the Trump Administration’s proposed downsizing of the EPA would have an increased impact on pollution control efforts across the country. Not only will the federal pollution cop no longer be on the beat, state authorities may not show up either. Many states will not be able to shoulder more environmental oversight responsibilities because of years of their own cost-cutting, with a gradual erosion of their capacity for managing pollution often as bad or worse than the downsizing at the federal level.

The EIP Report undertook an analysis in the state of funding for the 50 state environmental agencies over the time period of 2010-2024. It also addressed the status of staffing levels over the same time period.

Examining the data for the state of Arkansas, the Report provides estimates for both funding and staffing during this time period. Arkansas’ environmental agency is stated to have recorded a 31% budget increase over the relevant time period, but a 17% drop is staffing.

Parsram was referring to the new environmental permit issued to Exxon’s 7th oil project – Hammerhead. The new permit has 14 provisions meant to address flaring offshore Guyana. There are also an additional eight provisions that speak to emergency events.

He said that the provisions are proof that the country has come a long way, in terms of improving on its permit conditions, while noting that air quality in Guyana is non-negotiable.

The EPA’s mandate is to ensure that the air citizens breathe is protected and according to Parsram, Guyana has always had a good history and record of excellent air quality. Therefore, as part of issuing permits to authorise and regulate the industry, he said the environment has to be considered and it must be protected.

“Now Guyana also has international obligations under the climate change convention for example, so our record there has been you know undoubtedly very rigid and strong. So, we have to maintain our air quality. Now any development, not just oil and gas, any emissions coming from these development activities must be regulated to ensure that they’re within standards,” Parsram explained.

The EPA head reminded that there was always prohibition on routine flaring, and from the start of the oil projects. Instead of burning the gas continuously as it came up as some countries do, Guyana told the operator and its partners that they are to re-inject the gas to assist with well pressurisation.

However recently, the option was given to bring the gas ashore therefore maximising the uses of the gas resources. Nevertheless, there are what he called “upset conditions” and one such instance was experienced with Liza One.

“They had a problem with the gas compressor and it took some time to get that fixed, and so the time taken for that we learn from it, and we ensure that in subsequent permits that there is a redundancy built in that,” he highlighted.

Parsram explained that there is often time just one gas compressor along with two or three other equipment that help with providing a quick fix situation. Notwithstanding, the key is still having preventative measures to ensure that if there is a need for flaring, it is efficiently done. In this regard, emissions will not have a number of dangerous pollutants that will be problematic as it can easily be dispersed.

“…and so those measures were put in place to make sure that flaring is prevented, and not just in terms of the efficiency, but when there’s a need for flaring there is also the aspect of how you deal with that, and there is it’s not just a carte blanch; You can’t do what you want, you have to seek approval from us and we set a stipulated timeline and date for that. So, 14 days maximum. So, if you know to address your situation, you have that time to play with it,” he further explained.

Parsram reminded that there is also a tax added on flaring, so this is now serving as a deterrent to indefinite flaring. With this cost attached developers are encouraged to fix issues right away, but still upset conditions will occur.

“There will be emergency situations. So, in those conditions we have to define clearly what those upset conditions mean. What are the circumstances around it? What’s the approval mechanism, and then we allow that excess flaring first zero routine flaring upset condition. Yes, we can allow you to fix the situation. If you exceed that time, then it’s taxed to get you to ‘hurry up’ in local language,” he added.",https://kaieteurnewsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Kemraj-Parsram-e1765415835521-150x150.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 13:01:43.701324

DevvStream, currently trading at $1.82, has experienced significant volatility with its stock price down over 14% in the past week and 73% over the past year, according to InvestingPro data.

The proposed collaboration aims to combine fuel supply, logistics, and environmental-attribute monetization into a unified commercial offering for aviation and industrial customers. As part of the potential partnership, the companies plan to evaluate developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana comparable to XCF’s existing 38-million-gallon New Rise Reno facility.

The parties intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways, including Southern’s biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology and XCF’s HEFA-based platform, while integrating DevvStream’s environmental-attribute capabilities.

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform,"" said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global.

The companies also plan to assess municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following the Louisiana Community Development Authority’s authorization of up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern’s biomass-to-fuel project. This authorization remains subject to additional approvals and does not represent committed capital.

The agreement does not commit any party to proceed with specific transactions or projects, as any arrangements remain subject to due diligence, negotiation of definitive agreements, corporate approvals, and regulatory permissions.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, with global demand expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, according to figures cited in the announcement. For investors interested in DevvStream’s potential in this growing market, InvestingPro analysis suggests the company is currently undervalued, with additional ProTips and financial metrics available to help assess investment opportunities in the sustainable aviation fuel sector.

In other recent news, DevvStream Corp. reported a net loss of $11.8 million for its fiscal year ending July 31, 2025, compared to a $9.9 million loss in the previous year. The company completed its Nasdaq listing and secured an initial $10 million tranche under a $300 million convertible-note facility with Helena. DevvStream also disclosed that its crypto treasury program now holds approximately $5.4 million in digital assets, including 22.229 Bitcoin and 12,127.64 Solana tokens, valued at about $2.72 million each.

Also on the menu today: Ford and battery maker SK On break up their joint venture to make EV batteries in the U.S., and automakers warn against Chinese government-backed automakers and battery investments from entering the U.S., fearing American vulnerability if a confrontation breaks out. Let's begin.

30%: Why Tesla's Cheaper Models Are Getting A Cold Reception

2026 Tesla Model 3 Standard

Both the Model Y Standard and Model 3 Standard come in roughly $5,000 below the Premium trims. The Model 3 Standard starts at around $38,630 with destination and order fees, whereas the Model Y Standard is priced around $41,630. Tesla has aggressively decontented them, shaving off features in the name of affordability.

But more than two months after hitting U.S. showrooms, these budget Teslas haven’t delivered the sales boost the company hoped for. In fact, November turned out to be Tesla’s worst U.S. sales month in four years, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing Cox Automotive data.

Here’s more from that report:

“Demand for Standard versions was expected to support sales in November, but the company's total sales fell nearly 23% to 39,800 vehicles from 51,513 a year earlier and were the lowest since January 2022, according to the data from Cox, which tracks sales across the industry.”

""The drop certainly shows there is not enough demand for the Standard variants that were supposed to boost sales after the tax credit expiry,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, said in an interview with Reuters. ""What’s also happening is Standard sales are cannibalizing into sales of Premium versions, especially the Model 3.""

To be fair, Tesla isn’t the only automaker fighting EV headwinds right now. The $7,500 tax credit has vanished. Fuel-economy rules have been weakened, nudging automakers back toward combustion models. With the EPA under a Trump administration moving to loosen emissions standards, the policies don’t appear to favor EVs anytime soon.

Unsurprisingly, overall EV sales fell 41% in November. Tesla’s market share, however, jumped to 56.7% from 43.1%. But even that comes with an asterisk: the third quarter effectively stole sales from the final months of the year as buyers rushed to snag the dying tax credit.

Industry leaders and auto execs say the real picture of post-credit EV demand won’t come into focus until the second quarter of next year. Against that backdrop, it’s no shock that Tesla’s half-assed Standard versions aren’t setting the market on fire.

The Model 3 Standard still feels like a decent proposition, starting late $30,000s. The nearly $42,000 Model Y Standard, though, is another story. It comes without lane centering (or Autosteer in Tesla speak), loses the horizontal light bars at both ends and skips FM/AM radio entirely.

It also swaps out the nicer frequency-selective dampers for basic passive ones. And the strangest change of all, Tesla has covered the glass roof with a fabric liner. According to Tesla engineers, adding an actual metal roof would’ve been more expensive.

Here’s more from that report:

""Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,"" Cox's Streaty said. ""So the answer is that Tesla needs a completely new vehicle in its fleet. Period.”

She’s not wrong. A new and fresh model, preferably on the affordable end of the market, could help Tesla bring in critical revenue. That or a radical leap forward with its Full-Self Driving (FSD) tech to deliver robotaxi revenue or meaningfully higher FSD subscriptions.

Until that happens, it’s unclear how the brand will continue to fuel its AI and robotaxi ambitions. Because don’t forget, Tesla’s bread and butter still comes from the old-fashioned business of selling cars.

60%: Why Automakers Fear Chinese Battery Investment In America

CATL Shenxing Plus LFP battery

The Alliance For Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing major U.S. automakers such as General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Stellantis, asked the Trump administration to further prevent Chinese-government-backed automakers and battery companies from setting shop stateside.

Here’s more from Reuters:

""China poses a clear and present threat to the auto industry in the U.S.,"" the group wrote in a statement for a U.S. House hearing on Chinese vehicles.

""No amount of investment by automakers and battery manufacturers operating inside the U.S. can counter a China that is enabled by subsidies to chronically oversupply around the world. This is a recipe for dumping that Congress and the Trump Administration must prevent from happening inside the U.S.,"" the auto industry group said.

The group went on to cite national security concerns, claiming that the Chinese government could disable vehicles with Chinese-made software or components in case a major war were to break out between China and the West.

China has leapfrogged the U.S. in producing competitive EVs with cutting-edge software. Last year, the Biden administration proposed severe restrictions on Chinese automotive software and hardware in the U.S. to prevent misuse of the technology. And Chinese-made EVs are also effectively walled off from the U.S. with heavy tariffs.

90%: Ford And SK On Part Ways

SK On Battery Plant In The U.S.

In 2022, Ford and Korean battery giant SK ON, the subsidiary of SK Innovation, decided to invest over $11 billion in two U.S. battery plants for electric vehicles, one in Tennessee and the other in Kentucky.

The companies have now decided to end this joint venture amid slowing EV sales as battery makers now pivot towards stationary energy storage systems, which are still growing much faster than EVs.

As the two companies break up, SK ON will take full ownership of the battery plant in Tennessee, whereas Ford will assume full ownership of the Kentucky plant. SK will continue to grow its focus on ESS batteries, following in the footsteps of other battery makers such as LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, which have also been pivoting to ESS as EVs continue riding down a bumpy road.

Shareholders and users can also make their voice heard by expressing their disillusionment with Uber's broken promises, and their moves that hurt EV drivers.","Uber is under fire from both drivers and activists after rolling back monthly bonuses that incentivized the movement to electric vehicles.

What's happening?

The ride-hailing company recently rolled back the incentives that had been pivotal in encouraging drivers to switch to cleaner vehicles, per Bloomberg. Levi Spires, a driver from Syracuse, revealed the promotion had netted him around $3,500 in less than two years.

He and other drivers are disillusioned by the change that previously served as a way to cover the costs of paying a higher upfront price for an EV — though EVs at least carry significant annual savings over gas-powered cars through cheaper fueling and lower maintenance, such as no oil changes.

""My goal is for Uber to not be my main profession anymore,"" Spires said.

It is true that Uber still promotes EV usage through other means, such as discounts on new vehicles and charging costs. A newly announced $4,000 bonus to switch from gas cars covers only a subset of states and a maximum of 2,500 drivers.

The company, meanwhile, is trying to incentivize EV adoption through customer choice. What was once Uber Green and is now Uber Electric is a feature that allows customers with a preference for EVs to hail a ride from one.

""It creates demand,"" claimed Uber executive Rebecca Tinucci. ""That means extra rides that our EV drivers get.""

Whether that happens at a meaningful level in practice is unclear.

Why is Uber's pullback of EV incentives important?

Bloomberg pointed out that in the last three years, Uber's pollution has nearly doubled, according to internal documents. That has occurred as the company has made bold climate pledges like going 100% EVs by the end of the decade.

This move confirms that the company isn't going to come close to those goals, and while the intention may have been genuine at the time of the declaration, giving itself the ability to back out can be considered a form of greenwashing — in that the commitment was never fully sincere beyond any marketing value it may have had.

The more companies that don't live up to their climate pledges on pollution, the more daunting trends like record-setting temperatures and extreme weather will be.

Uber's support of the Big Beautiful Bill also drew fierce criticism. The bill took away many incentives for buying EVs, but for Uber it came with separate benefits.

One might've been altruistic in the partial no-tax-on-tips measure that could help drivers. Critics identified the bill's business-friendly tax cuts as the real driver behind their support, though.

""When they had a chance to get a big tax break and screw over the climate, they showed us who they really are,"" said Holly Burke, vice president of communications at climate advocacy nonprofit Evergreen Action.

It's worth noting, though, that Uber has partnered with one of America's leading EV-only automakers, Lucid, to develop its own autonomous ride-hailing platform to compete with Google parent Alphabet's Waymo and Tesla's Robotaxi services.

As that endeavor plays out with Lucid, Uber may be able to make a big leap in its percentage of electric rides, though it could still be paying its promised incentives to drivers in the meantime.

What's being done about Uber's about-face?

For drivers, there's not much they can do if the EV bonuses were making an important difference on their bottom line. Switching over to Lyft, likewise, isn't a perfect fix for users. Bloomberg recently revealed that Uber's top rival similarly withdrew its pledge to go all-electric by 2030.

Customers can still play a small part in a low-effort way by seeking out Uber Electric when hailing rides to support drivers of EVs. Better yet, exploring public transit options is a more planet-friendly way to get places.

Shareholders and users can also make their voice heard by expressing their disillusionment with Uber's broken promises, and their moves that hurt EV drivers.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uber-car.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 18:01:34.063788

The award represents a significant milestone for the project and for Imperial County, one of California’s most economically challenged regions.

The Jobs First Grant will support critical activities, including geotechnical engineering, foundation design, agricultural preparation, and procurement of key components for SVE’s integrated clean-energy system. These steps are essential to advancing construction readiness and securing full project financing for the $1.28 billion renewable infrastructure development, which will create 250 direct full-time living wage jobs and 15,000 jobs from planning through construction and plant start-up. The project will work in tandem with Imperial Valley College and the Imperial County Workforce Development Office to maximize local training and hiring opportunities.

“The Jobs First Grant accelerates the final steps needed to bring one of California’s most important clean-energy and agricultural revitalization projects across the finish line,” said Dave Rubenstein, president & CEO of California Ethanol + Power. “Sugar Valley Energy will deliver long-term climate benefits, stable employment, and a transformative new industry for Imperial County.”

The Catalyst Last Mile Proposal was submitted by IVEDC in partnership with CE+P, which has already invested $27 million to advance SVE from concept to shovel ready. The grant will immediately support jobs for key local project partners, including Landmark Consultants, Duggins Construction, Benson Farms, and Dubose Design Group and enable the project to begin construction on foundational elements of the ethanol plant.

“This award represents a major step forward, not only for the Sugar Valley Energy project, but for thousands of Imperial Valley families who deserve access to high-quality jobs and long-term economic opportunity,” said Timothy Kelley, president & CEO, Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation. “The Jobs First Collaborative is helping remove barriers that have historically held this region back.”

Developed by CE+P, Sugar Valley Energy will be the first-of-its-kind project in North America. Once operational, the integrated biorefinery campus in Brawley, California will produce more than 73 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol, 771 million standard cubic feet of renewable natural gas (RNG), and 41 megawatts of renewable electricity each year from sustainably grown sugarcane.

Sugarcane cultivated on more than 48,000 acres of Imperial County farmland will serve as feedstock for the project, creating new revenue streams for more than 50 farming entities and supporting 2,000+ local agricultural jobs. The crop replaces less profitable forage crops and will help fill the void left by the 2025 closure of the Spreckels Sugar Company plant, which eliminates hundreds of jobs and dismantled California’s last sugar-beet processing industry.

Imperial County continues to face persistent underinvestment and the highest unemployment rate in the nation, notably 20.2% as of July 2025. The Jobs First Grant helps remove barriers to economic mobility by:

Strengthening workforce development and local hiring pathways

Expanding clean-energy and wastewater infrastructure

Supporting agricultural diversification and resilience

Creating jobs in a future-facing, low-carbon industry

Catalyzing regional investment tied to more than $200 million in federal investment tax credits.

A recent impact analysis found that construction and startup operations for SVE will generate more than $928 million in direct economic activity, creating 15,000+ construction and startup jobs and 250 long-term, family-sustaining operations jobs.

As California implements AB 30 and prepares for statewide E15 adoption, Sugar Valley Energy is positioned to become a major producer of ultra-low-carbon renewable fuel that supports the state’s climate goals and Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

Luxury FBO Million Air Austin (KAUS) and leading fuel supplier Avfuel Corp. came together to boost sustainable aviation operations at Austin Bergstrom International Airport with the addition of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The SAF—which went into service on Nov. 20, 2025—provides a meaningful solution for operators seeking to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from flight operations. This marks the first SAF location in Texas for both companies, offering a consistent supply of SAF specifically for the airport’s business and general aviation traffic.

“Austin is a thriving, business-centric city that also deeply values environmental responsibility,” said Roger Woolsey, CEO of Million Air Interlink. “Bringing SAF to Million Air Austin is about giving our customers meaningful options that align with both their travel needs and their sustainability goals. At Million Air, we believe sophistication and responsibility go hand-in-hand, and this step in our Beyond Green initiative reflects our commitment to making choices that support both our customers and our planet.”

“The Million Air team has been an exceptional partner to work with in expanding sustainable fuel solutions,” said Mark Haynes, Avfuel’s vice president of sales. “We’re proud to collaborate with them to establish our first consistent SAF-supplied location in Texas and help further their corporate initiatives on sustainability.”

The SAF, originating in Texas, has a targeted blend percentage of 30% neat SAF to 70% traditional jet fuel. For every 8,000-gallon truckload of fuel, the SAF provides a 19 metric ton reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 19.1 acres of U.S. forests per year. In its neat (pre-blended) form, SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

This initiative is part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program—a company-wide commitment to responsible aviation practices. The Beyond Green platform focuses on integrating more sustainable solutions across Million Air’s network, from renewable energy investments and facility efficiencies to greener fuel options, like SAF. Million Air Austin joins Million Air Albany (KALB), which partnered with Avfuel to bring SAF online this summer.

SAF is made from renewable and sustainably sourced waste materials, like used cooking oil. Once blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF is a drop-in solution that meets ASTM D1655 specifications and performs to the same standards as traditional jet fuel—requiring no changes to aircraft, fuel infrastructure or handling procedures.

“Our current budget situation requires us to reconsider bills that create expensive and labor intensive studies,” Moore wrote in a veto letter about the climate study.
“Maryland suffered devastating losses this summer due to climate change.
From extreme flooding to heat deaths, the impacts of climate change are costing Marylanders now,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund.
Prior studies have endeavored to tabulate bits and pieces of Maryland’s costs from climate change.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) will announce Friday that he is allocating nearly $500,000 to study the costs of climate change in the state — just months after he cited cost concerns as he vetoed a bill to spend almost the same amount of money for the same study.

Friday’s expected announcement comes just days before a special legislative session Tuesday, when lawmakers are expected to consider overriding Moore’s veto of the RENEW Act — for Responding to Emergency Needs From Extreme Weather — which included the climate study.

“While the federal government has spent the past year rolling back climate protections and driving up energy costs, Maryland is taking a responsible step toward understanding the true price tag of climate damage,” Moore wrote in a news release Friday.

The bill was part of a larger effort by climate activists in Maryland and across the country to eventually require large fossil fuel companies to compensate states for the effects of climate change, including flooding and extreme heat.

The study Moore is funding, which will be administered by the comptroller’s office, will also evaluate any potential impact to taxpayers if fossil fuel companies are compelled to make compensatory payments to the state. A final report is due by Dec. 1, 2026 — the same deadline as in the vetoed legislation.

It is not clear whether legislators will still pursue an override of the RENEW Act veto, bill sponsor David Fraser-Hidalgo (D-Montgomery) said.

Report: Climate change imperils toxic sites across Chesapeake Bay region

“At the end of the day, I’m just excited to get going on the study,” Fraser-Hidalgo said. “I’ve been working on a version of this bill for five, going on six, years so I’m just excited to move the ball forward.”

Maryland isn’t alone in considering so-called “Make Polluters Pay,” or “climate Superfund” legislation. New York and Vermont have already passed legislation that will ultimately charge fossil fuel firms for a portion of climate damages. In New York, the tab is $75 billion over the next 25 years. Earlier this year, the Trump administration sued both states, challenging the laws, and those cases are ongoing.

In May, Moore shocked lawmakers when he vetoed a variety of studies, including one evaluating slavery reparations for African American Marylanders and another looking into the potential impacts of large-scale data centers in the state.

“Our current budget situation requires us to reconsider bills that create expensive and labor intensive studies,” Moore wrote in a veto letter about the climate study. “While such bills can be a first step to addressing complex issues and allow the signaling of support for an issue, the practice has become so commonplace that it is now a significant financial and staff burden on the state government.”

Since May, when the bill was vetoed, the administration has been able to secure a $30,000 grant from the Rockefeller Family Fund for the climate study. The remaining $470,000 will come from the state’s Strategic Energy Investment Fund over the next two fiscal years, according to the governor’s office. The vetoed bill would have pulled all $500,000 from the SEIF in fiscal 2026.

“Governor Moore has maintained that Maryland doesn’t have to choose between a green economy and a growing economy,” said Moore spokesperson Rhyan Lake. “By leveraging both philanthropic funding and existing state funding sources over two fiscal years to fully fund this study at no expense to Maryland taxpayers, Governor Moore is continuing to take action on climate and build a more sustainable Maryland.”

When Moore vetoed the RENEW bill, climate advocates were shocked, noting that the administration had not previously voiced opposition to the bill. Mike Tidwell, founder of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, called the move “unforgivable.”

But it’s possible that Moore’s about-face will help him to make amends, as Annapolis gears up for its next full legislative session on Jan. 14.

“Maryland suffered devastating losses this summer due to climate change. From extreme flooding to heat deaths, the impacts of climate change are costing Marylanders now,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund. “We appreciate Governor Moore’s commitment to moving the climate costs study forward.”

Rockefeller Family Fund Director Lee Wasserman said the charity — which focuses on climate change, democracy and economic justice for women — supported the RENEW bill and others like it around the country, and was stunned by Moore’s veto.

“These costs are going to be landing on states including Maryland whether they figure out what they look like ahead of time or not, so it’s hard for me to imagine how achieving a greater understanding of the parameters of those costs could possibly be seen as negative,” Wasserman said. “To the contrary, it seems like good governance 101.”

“I’m less surprised that the governor has decided to backtrack, appropriately so, and give the state the opportunity to really practice good governance,” Wasserman said.

Prior studies have endeavored to tabulate bits and pieces of Maryland’s costs from climate change.

In 2024, the Maryland Department of the Environment estimated that it would take $1 billion per year to meet the state’s emissions reduction goals and transition to 100% clean energy. Amid historic budget shortfalls, the state has not allocated that amount to the effort, even though some programs are underway. Under state law, Maryland must reduce the state’s greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels, by 2031.

An April report from the comptroller’s office indicated that Maryland experienced 85 natural disasters between 1980 and 2024, at a cost to the state of $10 billion to $20 billion.

Moore calls lawmakers back for long-anticipated special session next week

“Although extreme weather events have always occurred, scientists can now quantify how much more intense and frequent they have become due to climate change,” read the report. “Maryland can use this emerging science to assess the additional expenditures the state is spending due to anthropogenic climate change.”

That report also cited research from the Center for Climate Integrity, which supports climate Superfund bills, that said trying to build a seawall to protect Maryland’s coastlines from rising seas would cost the state $27.4 billion by 2040.

The RENEW study will be done under a memorandum of understanding between the Maryland Energy Administration and the comptroller’s office, the governor’s news release said. Comptroller Brooke Lierman said the report “will build a roadmap for financial resilience in Maryland amid the challenges of climate change.”

Lawmakers raided the SEIF fund for other uses during this year’s legislative session. The fund — which is supposed to be used on energy projects such as solar panels, EV chargers and energy efficiency upgrades for low-income households — was used to fund a roughly $80 energy bill refund for all of the state’s residential customers, and to help correct a massive state budget deficit.

The SEIF is funded in part by “alternative compliance payments” from electricity suppliers who do not meet the state’s renewable energy mandates. It had ballooned in recent years because it was cheaper for suppliers to make the alternative compliance payments than to buy the required renewable energy credits from clean energy generators.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dsc_4543-1024x6811765554980.jpeg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=tKAwVEx8,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:55.923021

That's a sign that the energy transition is still happening, but the language being used is different.

Today, the energy transition is about security, resilience and technologies. Here's how that plays out in 2026.

If 2025 felt confusing on energy, that’s because it was. Governments talked less about “saving the planet” and more about keeping the lights on, taming bills and managing the AI data-centre boom. Yet in the middle of geopolitical tension and economic jitters, clean energy spending quietly hit new records.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy investment in 2025 was likely to pass $3.3 trillion, with $2.2 trillion flowing into clean energy technologies – everything from renewables and EVs to grids, storage, efficiency and clean fuels. In other words, two-thirds of every dollar spent on energy is already going to cleaner options, even as climate rhetoric often takes a back seat to security and affordability.

Welcome to 2026: a year that is shaping up less as a grand climate “pledge moment” and more as a high-stakes execution test shaped around three themes: growth, resilience and competition.

Strategic competition in energy

The first motive for 2026 is growth through industrial competition. Industrial and economic policy are now the main levers for energy transition policies. Instead of classic “energy policy”, governments focus on industrial policy – local-content rules, tax credits, subsidies and trade measures – to achieve economic and strategic goals. In other words, it is a race to build factories, not just solar and wind farms.

This race has so far been dominated by China, which spends nearly as much on clean energy as the US and EU combined and leads manufacturing across most clean and advanced energy supply chains, cementing its status as the world’s clean energy powerhouse.

India also demonstrates great ambitions and progress in this race. The government introduced a number of policies, including incentives for domestic manufacturing and mandates for clean energy deployment. It not only drives massive deployment of solar and storage capacity, but also drives investment in manufacturing. The Dhirubhai Energy Complex, for example, is scheduled to start operations in 2026 and aims to host gigafactories of solar panels, batteries and electrolyzers under one roof.

Europe is rethinking its industrial model to regain competitiveness. The Net-Zero Industry Act aims to ensure that by 2030 at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs for key net zero technologies are manufactured at home. The EU is also moving to recycle more critical materials and restrict permanent magnet and metal scrap exports in order to cut dependence on external supply chains.

Securing the energy backbone

Geopolitical tensions put energy security back at the top of the agenda, making resilience the second big theme for 2026. China continues its efforts to bolster the resilience of its energy infrastructure and grow its dominance in new technologies. Europe is pivoting away from Russian fuels, aiming to eventually phase out Russian gas, oil and nuclear entirely. The US is diversifying and onshoring sources of lithium, cobalt, nickel and rare earths.

At the same time, resilience now means economic and social stability too, from safeguarding against traditional risks to oil and gas supplies to affordable access and system resilience in the face of new threats – cyber, climate, supply-chain shocks.

Public focus has shifted to here and now impacts. This looks like foregrounding transparent benefits – jobs, community funds, lower local tariffs – in exchange for accepting wind farms, transmission lines, manufacturing sites or data centres.

AI and energy in 2026

The artificial intelligence energy surge is turning power into the new data-centre bottleneck. That surge is already changing corporate priorities. Bloom Energy’s 2025 Data Center Power Report found that access to power is the leading factor in data centre site selection, ahead of traditional concerns like connectivity.

In practice, that means competition for grid connections and flexible, low-carbon power options will intensify in 2026. Locations able to offer cheap, reliable and clean electricity at scale will have a structural advantage in attracting AI-driven investment.

Outlook: a more competitive, realistic energy transition

All of this sets up 2026 as a year less about new promises and more about competing for advantage in a messy, politicized energy landscape. In 2026, the projects that move fastest will be those that combine resilience with a compelling local story: cleaner air, stable bills, visible economic benefits.

All of this points to a different kind of energy transition in 2026, one that prioritizes:

Execution over ambition. Less focus on headline-grabbing net-zero declarations; more on whether grids, factories and ports actually get built on time.

Competitive advantage over moral positioning. Governments are less interested in being “climate champions” and more in securing the industries and jobs of the future – batteries, hydrogen, data centres, clean-tech manufacturing.

Near-term impact over distant targets. Air quality, bill stability and local economic benefits are now as important to the political calculus as temperature goals.

The energy transition is no longer a niche climate project. By 2026, it will be one of the main arenas in which countries compete, companies differentiate and societies negotiate what “prosperity” looks like in a hotter, more volatile world.

The Advanced Energy Solutions community

The World Economic Forum supports an integrated approach to energy solutions, including energy storage, advanced nuclear, clean fuels, hydrogen and carbon removal. No single technology will solve the energy transition alone; a mix of solutions will be needed.

Different regions, industries and companies will have their strategies, but they must work together.

Platforms, such as the Forum’s Advanced Energy Solutions community, can help speed up this cooperation and accelerate the deployment of new technologies, such as energy storage, clean fuels, hydrogen, advanced nuclear and carbon removal, from decades to years.

The community engages industry leaders who drive frontier segments of the energy system to shape the advanced energy solutions industry vision and narrative. It supports partnerships among innovators, large energy companies, energy users and investors and informs policy-making.",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/VO9aFcIDu7N8cDTdAZq9k9wTEumo7wOHGHzyWuo3n_o.png,N,,2025-12-12 11:02:52.541222

The gas company filed an application last year to be sold for nearly $1.3 billion to private equity firm Bernhard Capital Partners.
If approved, Bernhard subsidiary Saturn Utilities Holdco would take over New Mexico Gas Company, which serves more than 500,000 customers in 27 of New Mexico’s 33 counties.
“The proposed acquisition raises real risks of higher rates, reduced transparency, and long-term financial instability for customers across the state,” Torrez said in a statement.

If approved, Bernhard subsidiary Saturn Utilities Holdco would take over New Mexico Gas Company, which serves more than 500,000 customers in 27 of New Mexico’s 33 counties.

In his PRC filing, Torrez argues that Bernhard’s reliance on short-term investments and private debt could lead to rate hikes; that its “layered corporate structure” poses a threat to transparency; and that its “complex web” of holding companies could thwart regulators’ oversight.

“The proposed acquisition raises real risks of higher rates, reduced transparency, and long-term financial instability for customers across the state,” Torrez said in a statement. “We are urging regulators to deny this application unless there are significant changes made to safeguard ratepayers from unnecessary costs and hidden liabilities.”

If the deal proceeds, Torrez contends that PRC members must enact restrictions on selling utility assets without PRC approval; offer rate credits for low-income customers; require competitive cost analyses before implementing new IT systems; and require funding for a “severe weather reliability fund” to protect ratepayers during hazardous weather.

A spokesperson for Bernhard Capital Partners in an email to Source NM said the firm has been “committed to active participation throughout the regulatory process.”

“Our application includes nearly $87 million in direct benefits to local communities, employees, and organizations. These commitments have been informed by feedback from these same stakeholders throughout the regulatory process,” the spokesperson wrote. “This includes $22 million in rate credits for customers, $7 million to assist families who need help paying their utility bills, and more than $2 million in charitable giving to local nonprofits. We’ve also committed $15 million to advancing community priorities, like economic development, workforce training, and renewable energy projects.”

Torrez is the latest public official to oppose the proposed sale. In November, state Sen. Harold Pope Jr. (D-Albuquerque) and Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) spoke before the commission and took exception to the exclusion of information relating to other companies previously owned by Bernhard Capital Partners’ founder.

New Mexico lawmakers Pope, McQueen raise questions about New Mexico Gas Company sale

Specifically, a 2008 U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General report said FEMA wasted millions by awarding no-bid contracts to the Shaw Group — a firm previously run by Bernhard’s founder — and others. A 2011 report commissioned by state leaders in Louisiana alleged that Shaw appeared to overbill the state by nearly $500,000 for building sand berms along the coastline to prevent oil from the infamous BP spill from washing onto the land.

“Right now, central evidence about Bernhard Capital Partners’ regulatory compliance history including violations, fines, audits and settlements involving their affiliates and formerly owned companies has been withheld from the record,” Pope told commissioners in November. “You cannot reliably weigh benefits against risk when the most relevant facts are kept from the public.”

Nio

Nio is a major producer of EVs in China. It differentiates itself from its competitors with swappable batteries, which can be quickly swapped out at its Power Swap stations as a faster alternative to traditional chargers. Its namesake banner sells a wide range of sedans and SUVs. Its newer Onvo and Firefly sub-brands sell cheaper SUVs and compact cars, respectively.

From 2020 to 2024, its annual deliveries increased more than fivefold, rising from 43,728 vehicles to 221,970 vehicles, while its annual revenue more than quadrupled. It achieved that explosive growth even as the pandemic, macro headwinds, and a pricing war rattled China's EV market.

Nio's vehicle margin declined to the single digits in 2023 as it navigated those challenges. Still, it rebounded to double-digit levels over the past two years as it sold a higher mix of Nio's premium sedans, reduced its production costs, and streamlined its other expenses.

From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Nio's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 31% as it significantly narrows its net losses. That growth should be driven by its rising sales of Onvo and Firefly vehicles, its gains in domestic market share, and its ongoing expansion into Europe. It could also spin off its capital-intensive battery manufacturing division to streamline its spending.

That's a bright outlook for a company that trades at less than one times this year's sales. Its valuation is still being squeezed by the tariffs and trade conflicts between the U.S. and China, but it could attract a stampede of bulls once those headwinds dissipate.

QuantumScape

QuantumScape is a leading developer of solid-state lithium-metal batteries, which generate electricity from solid electrolytes instead of the flammable liquid electrolytes used in traditional lithium-ion batteries. That difference grants solid-state batteries better thermal resistance, faster charging times, and higher charging capacities than their lithium-ion counterparts.

However, solid-state batteries are also more challenging and expensive to manufacture. That's why they've only been mass-produced for smaller devices like pacemakers instead of EVs.

QuantumScape aims to break that bottleneck with its QSE-5 batteries for EVs, which boast an energy density of 844 Wh/L (watt-hours per liter) and can be quickly charged from 10% to 80% in 12 minutes. Most lithium-ion batteries for EVs have an average energy density of 300-700 Wh/L with an average fast charging time of 20 minutes to an hour.

QuantumScape's batteries could make EVs significantly more energy-efficient, but the company has not yet commercialized any of its designs.

This week, a study by Cornell University and NPJ Clean Air revealed that in the first six months of implementation of New York’s Congestion Pricing program, toxic air pollution dropped a significant 22% in the Congestion Relief . The benefits of the policy extend far beyond its boundaries, with the study showing that air pollution declined across the five boroughs and surrounding suburbs as well.

The magnitude of this reduction exceeds what has been achieved in other cities that have implemented the policy, like London and Stockholm.

In January 2025, NYC implemented the first-in-the-nation Congestion Pricing Program, designed to reduce traffic and improve air quality while raising funds for public transportation improvements. Early data showed major reductions in traffic and rush hour delays, fewer crashes and noise complaints, and increased economic activity.

As Gov. Hochul stated in July, the program is on track to raise the targeted $500 million this year, allowing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to advance critical capital improvements to mass transit on its subway, bus, Long Island Rail Road, and Metro-North Railroad systems. These capital improvements include investments in zero emission transit buses, further improving air quality.

This year, the NYS Senate passed an equally important air quality improvement policy, the Clean Deliveries Act (S1180B), which would reduce toxic air pollution associated with the increase in mega-warehouses and e-commerce deliveries by requiring warehouse operators to gradually reduce emissions from their operations. The policy offers flexibility to invest in zero emission vehicles or take other steps to reduce air pollution from warehouse operations. According to a report by the Environmental Defense Fund, nearly five times more warehouse-generated diesel truck trips are estimated to have occurred over the last decade, compared to the prior decade, due to the warehouse boom. Impacts of air pollution from these facilities disproportionately impact state-defined disadvantaged communities, which cover 8% of New York but contain 50% of the mega-warehouses.

The following statement is attributable to Kevin Garcia, Senior Transportation Planner w, on behalf of the Electrify NY coalition:

“As the federal government denies science and rolls back basic public health protections, New Yorkers can breathe easier thanks to the success of our groundbreaking Congestion Pricing Program. But the work is not over and more must be done to finally deliver clean air to New Yorkers. The Clean Deliveries Act, passed by NYS Senate, would reign in toxic air pollution from increased diesel truck traffic due to the boom of e-commerce mega-warehouse operations, provide relief for disadvantaged communities, and help us meet our climate mandates. We urge lawmakers to build on the success of congestion pricing by prioritizing the passage of this critical bill in the upcoming 2026 session.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dsc_8337-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:02:55.955122

The report marked the culmination of a multi-year investigation that involved hearings and subpoenas and revealed numerous internal company documents.
Another category of oil company ads the report identifies as deceptive is one in which responsibility for reducing emissions is shifted onto individual consumers.
BP, through its advertising and PR, for example, popularized the concept of the individual’s carbon footprint, the report says.
The report comes as the industry faces dozens of climate accountability lawsuits aiming to hold companies accountable for deceptive conduct, including ongoing greenwashing and false or misleading advertising.","Four of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies have spent the last 25 years deceptively portraying themselves as leaders in addressing climate change while simultaneously expanding fossil fuel production and failing to meaningfully rein in their planet-heating emissions, according to a report released Thursday that examined over 300 of the companies’ climate-related advertisements from 2000 to 2025.

These ads collectively serve to mask the harmful impacts of the companies’ operations and to perpetuate a false narrative that the oil industry is an essential partner in the fight against climate change, the Center for Climate Integrity found.

CCI, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy organization supporting efforts to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for climate harms, said its analysis is the first of its kind scrutinizing hundreds of climate-relevant ads from BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell across the first quarter of the 21st century.

It was around the turn of the century, when outright denial of the reality of climate change had become untenable, that the fossil fuel industry pivoted in its messaging and advertising strategy toward promoting false promises and solutions for tackling the problem, CCI says in “Big Oil’s Deceptive Climate Ads.”

The report identifies and discusses seven categories of deceptive advertising during this time period, including overstating actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; exaggerating investments in renewable energy; deflecting responsibility by shifting it onto consumers; and falsely promoting natural gas, carbon capture, hydrogen and algae biofuels as viable climate solutions.

“Big Oil’s climate deception has evolved from lying about the problem to lying about solutions,” Richard Wiles, CCI’s president, said in a statement. “For two and half decades now, these companies have sold the public a false and misleading image of their industry as working to solve the climate crisis, all while doubling down on fossil fuels and making the problem worse.”

The analysis draws upon publicly accessible sources such as digital advertising libraries and archives, congressional investigations and reports, and corporate and public relations documents. It adds to a growing body of evidence of a decades-long and ongoing campaign of deception by the industry to deny or downplay its climate impacts, to delay the transition to clean energy and to obstruct climate action.

A joint staff report from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Budget Committee released last year documents how major oil companies use what the Democrats described as deceptive messaging and tactics to promote false promises of new technologies and to mislead about their commitments to reducing emissions and about the climate safety of natural gas. The report marked the culmination of a multi-year investigation that involved hearings and subpoenas and revealed numerous internal company documents.

“As this joint report makes clear, the industry’s outright denial of climate change has evolved into a green-seeming cover for its ongoing covert operation—a campaign of deception, disinformation, and doublespeak waged using dark money, phony front groups, false economics, and relentless exertion of political influence—to block climate progress,” Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), then-chair of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a press release accompanying that report.

Greenwashed or deceptive advertising has also been a key part of this campaign, the CCI report says.

“In advertisements targeting the public, these four Big Oil companies repeatedly misrepresented the sustainability of their business practices, deflected responsibility for fueling climate harms, and lied about the viability of their proposed climate solutions, from carbon capture and storage to algae biofuels,” the report concludes.

Inside Climate News reached out to BP, Chevron, Shell and ExxonMobil for comment. None immediately responded. Companies such as Exxon have pushed back in court against allegations of deceptive advertising by claiming the allegations are attacks on their protected free speech rights.

Overstating Green Commitments, Promoting False Solutions

Ads touting the companies’ emission-reduction initiatives, the report found, tend to overinflate the impact of these actions and create a misleading impression that the companies have dramatically lowered their overall emissions. But in reality, the actions typically are limited to oil companies’ operational emissions, such as reducing flaring, and do not account for emissions generated by their products, which make up the vast majority of their carbon pollution.

Furthermore, ads highlighting future plans or promises to reduce emissions and transition to low-carbon business models are misleading, the report says, especially considering that the companies are now rolling back their green commitments.

“In 2024, less than four years after advertising plans to change their business plans to support a shift towards net zero emissions, BP and Shell both abandoned goals to significantly reduce emissions and lower the carbon intensity of their businesses,” the report says.

Some other ads from these companies published since 2000 depict them embracing renewable energy like wind and solar, but as the report says, this obscures the reality that oil companies’ actual investments in renewables are miniscule: “One analysis found that between 2010 and 2018, BP spent only 2.3 percent of its total capital expenditure on renewables, Shell spent 1.3 percent, Chevron spent 0.23 percent, and ExxonMobil spent 0.22 percent.”

In some cases, oil companies are also abandoning renewable energy projects and cutting back on their low carbon portfolio spending. BP and Shell, for example, are scrapping wind energy development, and earlier this year Shell announced plans to slash investments in low-carbon energy from 20 percent to 10 percent of its total capital expenditure by 2030. This week, ExxonMobil revealed its updated corporate plan that includes reducing its spending on low-carbon investments by one-third.

Another category of oil company ads the report identifies as deceptive is one in which responsibility for reducing emissions is shifted onto individual consumers. BP, through its advertising and PR, for example, popularized the concept of the individual’s carbon footprint, the report says. These types of ads deflect from the role that the oil and gas industry has played in locking society into dependency on its products, the report contends.

Big oil company advertisements touting natural gas as clean or climate-friendly or as an essential partner to renewable energy ignore the reality that gas still contributes substantially to climate change, especially considering methane venting and leakage, the report says. Natural gas is composed almost entirely of methane, which is a greenhouse gas that is 84 times more powerful than CO2 over a 20-year timeframe.

In addition to promoting what the report calls the false solution of natural gas, oil companies have used advertising to highlight and push false promises about carbon capture and storage and about hydrogen, claiming these technologies are key to a low-carbon future.

Carbon capture technologies have existed for decades and have failed to sequester more than a miniscule amount of global emissions. Most carbon capture and storage operations also end up using the captured CO2 to extract more oil—a process known as enhanced oil recovery—which critics say cancels out much of the supposed climate benefit and serves to further prolong the fossil fuel era.

Hydrogen, meanwhile, is conventionally produced using fossil fuels, and so-called green hydrogen made from water does not yet exist on any large scale. Despite company advertisements touting hydrogen’s promise, it remains decades away from wide-scale deployment, and almost all hydrogen production today is based on fossil fuels, contrary to its depictions in company ads as a clean fuel, the report says.

The report also discusses advertisements by ExxonMobil around algae biofuels, arguing the company deceptively portrayed these fuels as a climate solution when in reality it was never seriously committed to investing and scaling the technology. “While Exxon poured millions of dollars into algae advertisements, the company never built a commercial-scale algae biofuels facility—which would have cost around $5 billion—and ended its funding for algae research entirely in late-2022,” the report said.

Resource for Climate Accountability Initiatives

Hundreds of ads across these categories from BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell over the last 25 years collectively “feed a larger false narrative that oil and gas companies are part of the solution to climate change,” the report concludes, which allows them to sustain their social license to operate while they continue expanding production and fueling the climate crisis.

The report comes as the industry faces dozens of climate accountability lawsuits aiming to hold companies accountable for deceptive conduct, including ongoing greenwashing and false or misleading advertising. Some of the cases are already in pre-trial discovery and are closer than ever to getting to the stage of a public trial.

CCI says its analysis is intended to support these efforts.

The company is now said to be considering offering range-extended powertrains in sedans and crossovers for Europe and the United States. The discussions are reportedly part of a larger conversation as the automaker is preparing a new five-year investment plan.

Bloomberg reports the details of these investments will be announced in March of next year. That’s a ways off, but a spokesperson told the publication they’re “monitoring market developments and has reserved the range extender concept for its future EV platform.”

They added that consumer demand will ultimately determine when and where range-extended vehicles are offered.

While we’ve seen a few range-extended vehicles in the United States, a number of new models are on the horizon. Besides the Scout Terra and Traveler, Stellantis is gearing up to launch range-extended versions of the Jeep Grand Wagoneer and Ram 1500.

Ford CEO Jim Farley has also praised them as he said they give customers an electric experience without range anxiety. More importantly, they enable companies to offer an “electric vehicle that’s fully comparable to an ICE vehicle in terms of cost.”

This is largely due to the fact that range-extended EVs can use a significantly smaller and cheaper battery pack. This is made possible by an engine, which acts as a generator.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/VW-ID-Buzz.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 12:02:09.640798

But the impressive numbers did not signify new promises for the Palmetto State.

GE Vernova, a General Electric spinoff, has assembled massive, gas-fired turbines in South Carolina’s Upstate for nearly 60 years.

The company will ship eight of those turbines to Saudi Arabia as part of a $14.2 billion deal that it inked during President Donald Trump’s visit to the country in May.

That deal was part of a larger, $600 billion U.S. investment commitment by the Saudis.

When Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited the White House last month, he added $400 billion to the country’s commitment, with spending spanning nuclear energy, critical minerals, tanks and F-35 fighter jets. Historically, Israel was the only country in the Middle East allowed to buy the U.S.-made jets.

“You’re saying to me now that the $600 billion will be $1 trillion?” Trump said to the prince. “Good. I like that very much.”

With a room full of people in the Oval Office, Trump then called on a GE Vernova executive.

“Could you say a few words about what you’re seeing on the job front … and also how we’ve been helped by the Saudis in terms of the kind of investment they’ve made? Please,” Trump said to David Broomell, the company’s manufacturing technology manager.

“Most certainly,” Broomell said, then laid out the company’s own investments amid increased demand for energy.

Of the more than $750 million the company is investing in its United States factories, almost $300 million is specifically for gas-plant parts, he said.

He summed up the total investment as “resulting in over 500 pieces of new equipment being installed in the Greenville, South Carolina facility” and roughly 1,800 jobs companywide.

The Greenville plant is just one beneficiary. The company has 18 locations in the United States and more than 45 overseas, including Saudi Arabia.

“We’re partnering with local communities to build the skill set that’s required to meet these capacity needs. So that talent pipeline is incredibly important. So it’s real jobs in the manufacturing space,” Broomell said in conclusion, before Trump told him to “say hello to everybody” in South Carolina.

The company declined to speak in further detail with the SC Daily Gazette about the numbers.

But according to a company announcement in January, Greenville is in line for at least $160 million of the total GE investment. Plans call for the Upstate plant to triple its output of natural gas turbines to 80 units annually for use in power plants, data centers and at a growing number of terminals that liquefy natural gas for export to other countries.

As part of that announcement, GE Vernova also pledged to hire 650 new workers at the Greenville plant.

The company pledged to spend an additional $100 million collectively on plants in New York, New Jersey and Maine.

Six decades in SC

The expansion is just the company’s latest investment in the Palmetto State.

GE has been a household name in South Carolina for some time. It announced its first plant — the Greenville facility — in 1967. The original building was 300,000 square feet and employed 500 people.

Today, the factory spans 1.55 million square feet and GE Vernova is the county’s second largest manufacturing employer, behind Michelin.

The company has more than 2,500 workers in the state.

It hires a lot of students from Greenville’s technical college, according to Max Stewart, CEO of the county’s economic development organization. Employees can make upwards of $30 per hour — $5 to $6 more than the county average wage.

“It’s definitely a great opportunity for people if they’re looking to do welding and they want to work in manufacturing,” Stewart said. “It’s a great company to work for.”

In nearby Piedmont, GE Aviation makes high-pressure turbine blades for commercial aircraft engines sold to Boeing.

And GE’s health care business in Florence employs about 400 workers assembling components for medical imaging equipment.

The company once had a factory near Ladson that made steam turbine generators for the nuclear power industry. The facility once employed as many as 1,200 people. But by the early 1980s, the nuclear boom went bust in the United States, and the plant closed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ge_vernova_greenville-1-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 15:01:14.241866

Alongside gas power, SMRs are emerging as a key source for data centre energy needs.","From symbolic but disappointing shifts to dramatic trends that skyrocketed, crashed and flattened within the span of a year, 2025 delivered a cascade of twists and turns for the global power industry.

Drawing on data from Power Technology’s parent company, GlobalData, this year-end review traces a year defined by contrasts. Renewables overtook coal in power generation while gas gained renewed interest; the sector registered record transaction values through fewer deals; and jobs ricocheted under the weight of geopolitics.

The picture that emerges is of an industry reshaping itself across capacity, investment and labour.

Capacity and generation: a change in hierarchy

Winners: renewables

If 2024 was the year of cautious optimism for clean energy, 2025 was the year the numbers caught up with the narrative.

Renewables accounted for nearly half of the cumulative capacity mix this year. Annual capacity additions appeared even more skewed, with 64.1% coming from solar photovoltaic (PV) alone and wind contributing another 16.4% – together, making up a staggering 80%.

This year’s growth in solar additions, which GlobalData estimates as 5% higher than 2024’s, was “fuelled by robust demand in China, the US, India, Brazil and rapidly expanding markets across the Middle East and Africa (MEA)”, says Harminder Singh, GlobalData’s director of power research and analysis. He points to supportive policy frameworks, climate-aligned national strategies and distributed energy systems as the key drivers but, most of all, the falling costs.

The solar supply chain has experienced oversupply, with production capabilities reaching nearly twice the demand for polysilicon, wafers, cells and modules. China has been instrumental as a manufacturing powerhouse, investing more than $50bn (352.74bn yuan) in solar PV supply production between 2011 and 2022 – and now accounts for 80% of global manufacturing capacity. India has also emerged as a new manufacturing hub, boosted by initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive Scheme.

Consequently, solar module prices further decreased, accelerating utility-scale solar deployment. GlobalData reveals that average solar PV project costs have dropped by 81% since 2010 and are expected to fall another 21% over the next five years.

“This, alongside improved grid access for solar PV as many countries invest in their transmission and distribution (T&D) networks, has made solar bankable for investors,” Singh explains.

Solar’s star power is showing no signs of dimming any time soon. GlobalData anticipates global solar capacity will reach nearly 3TW by the end of 2025 and surpass 8TW within the next decade.

Meanwhile, wind power is expected to register around 1.3TW in 2025, 93% from onshore wind and the remaining from offshore.

This year was particularly challenging for offshore wind. Weighed down by unfavourable US policies and tariff pressures, the sector saw funding pulled and projects paused, postponed or sold off.

However, Singh stresses that this is only “a short-term wobble”; the project pipeline remains strong, with a select number of countries leading the market.

Currently, the top eight countries account for 97% of global offshore wind capacity. This oligopoly is expected to continue in the coming years, but new players – the US, Poland, South Korea and Japan – will take the place of Denmark, Belgium, France and the Netherlands in the top rankings.

Renewables’ most symbolic achievement this year is overtaking coal in power generation for the first time. In 2025, solar, wind and hydropower combined accounted for 34% of generation, edging out coal at 31%.

“Despite tariffs, supply chain tensions and geopolitical headwinds in 2025, renewables kept expanding because their underlying economics and policy support are now deeply entrenched,” says GlobalData senior power analyst Pavan Vyakaranam. “Wind and solar remain among the cheapest new power sources, and long-term policy frameworks like the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and EU Green Deal created durable project pipelines.”

Losers: thermal power

Despite the milestone, Singh caveats that “reliance on coal is still going strong”, the demand for thermal power overall is “easing much more slowly than what the global headlines may suggest”.

Contrary to what the numbers imply, coal decommissioning does not always equate to thermal-to-renewable substitution. Instead, it is gas that has stepped in to take its fossil fuel counterpart’s place in several markets.

GlobalData forecasts that 2033 stands as the decisive tipping point when renewable generation overtakes all thermal generation (coal, gas and oil) combined, with solar PV and onshore wind at the forefront.

But even then, Singh says coal will remain the single largest source of electricity, “showcasing how deep-rooted coal is in many power systems across the world”. In South Africa, for instance, coal is projected to contribute 85% of the power mix in 2025 and remain at 59% even by 2035, underscoring the uneven pace of the transition despite promising milestones at the global level.

Meanwhile, gas-based powerremains pertinent in the power landscape. Long seen as a cost-effective and reliable source, gas attracted renewed attention this year for a different appeal: its ability to meet data centres’ soaring power needs.

Because gas power plants can be built in one to two years – broadly aligning with data centre construction timelines – they have become an attractive solution for developers facing immediate capacity constraints. That demand has translated into a wave of new gas projects commissioned in 2025, even pushing turbine suppliers into sizeable order backlogs.

In the US, where data centre power demand is most concerning, natural gas is expected to supply 40% of power generation in 2025, compared to 28% from all renewables combined, according to GlobalData. Although gas’ share is projected to drop to 32% in the next decade, the country still has more than 45 gigawatts (GW) of gas-fired capacity slated to come online between 2025-2031.

The US serves as a reminder that gas continues to act as a key stabiliser, filling the flexibility gap left by coal until energy storage, grid modernisation and interconnection capacity catches up.

Gas and coal accounted for modest shares (8% and 5.5%, respectively) of new capacity additions in 2025. The reality is: thermal power is losing ground. Equally true, however, is that it is still far from gone. For now, gas power in particular will retain a foothold as a lower-emission fossil option that can balance power systems as they race to modernise.

Winners: nuclear

The story of nuclear is one of a slow burn. Its share in the global capacity mix this year was small – only 3.8% with around 399GW – but the pipeline and prospects tell a different tale.

GlobalData projects nuclear investments to reach $41.8bn by 2030, reflecting its growing role in the energy transition. There are 63 reactors currently under construction, set to add another 66.2GW, but the real excitement surrounds small modular reactors (SMRs).

Alongside gas power, SMRs are emerging as a key source for data centre energy needs. In addition to “the synergies of nuclear power generation and the load profile of data centres”, Singh says, their smaller size allows for on-site deployment, minimising risks of transmission loss.

With 110 SMRs totalling 15GW in development, the next decade anticipates a slew of modular deployments.

Beyond SMRs, emerging reactor designs and next-generation technologies, including molten salt reactors and nuclear fusion, are reviving global interest in the energy source.

Losers: hydrogen

2025 spelled trouble for low-carbon hydrogen due to project delays, downsizing and policy uncertainty. According to GlobalData’s project tracker, cumulative 2030 capacity projections fell 10% from last year’s forecast.

The drop is even starker when the analysis is extended to 2035, with expected capacity to come online falling 28% and 26% year on year (YoY) for high and low-case scenarios respectively. Reflecting the revisions in project scale and timelines announced this year, forecasted average capacity from projects with start years between 2031-2035 declined from 1,350 thousand tonnes per annum (ktpa) to 300ktpa.

These setbacks, combined with ongoing controversies around greenwashing and feasibility, are raising questions as to whether it will come to the fore as an emission reduction technology before 2040 – if at all.

Deals: North America takes the reign

According to GlobalData, the global power industry recorded 16% fewer deals in 2025 compared to 2024 but experienced a 15% surge in total deal value.

Deal values jumped across most deal types, with mergers and acquisitions (M&A) leading the way. With acquisitions growing 23.96% YoY (2024 compared to 2025 year-to-date, 9 December 2025), compared to the same period the year before and mergers a whopping 123.43%, the sector registered a total M&A value of $391.47bn.

Every region saw fewer transactions this year but not less value. North America dominated with 1,659 deals worth $780.5bn, surging 31.61% YoY in value. Compare this to the more modest gains seen in Asia-Pacific (9%) and MEA (1%), it is clear that the region is sustaining its momentum following the 55.9% YoY growth it registered last year.

The US alone registered $689.43bn in total power sector deals, followed by India ($93.88bn), China (85.52bn), the UK ($82.46bn), Japan ($81.94bn) and Canada ($81.53bn).

Asia Pacific had a few hundred more deals than North America that totalled only half the value at $394.7bn.

“This data reflects North America’s multiple mega-deals in 2025, such as Essential Utilities’ $30bn merger with American Water Works, which significantly lifted its aggregate deal value,” explains Vyakaranam, pointing to Constellation Energy’s $16.4bn acquisition of Calpine, NRG Energy’s £12bn purchase of LS Power’s Premier Power Portfolio, and Blackstone Infrastructure’s £11.5bn acquisition of TXNM Energy as primary examples.

Europe recorded $342.7bn, moderately behind Asia-Pacific, via a number of deals similar to that of North America. South and Central America and MEA both had under 200 deals worth less than $50bn.

In terms of sector, solar PV deals came out on top with 1,412 transactions totalling roughly $480.2bn. However, the largest share of capital ($557.3bn) flowed into T&D, which saw a fewer deals (1,223), reflecting the large-scale and capital-intensive natureof T&D projects as well as the vitalised global focus on upgrading grid infrastructure.

Deal activity in wind, fossil fuels, hydropower and energy storage remained steady, ranking above other sectors like nuclear and biopower in both numbers and value.

Looking ahead, Vyakaranam says “deal activity in 2026 will be shaped by rapid expansion of renewable energy and storage, the growing role of digital infrastructure such as AI and data centres, and focused initiatives to strengthen supply chain resilience and grid reliability”.

Jobs: peaks, troughs and expertise shifts

No part of the power sector illustrated 2025’s volatility more than employment. A rollercoaster of a year, hiring across the global power sector spiked dramatically in the first quarter (Q1), reaching record highs, only to collapse in Q2 and decline gradually throughout Q3 and Q4.

According to Vyakaranam: “Power sector employment in 2025 swung sharply due to overlapping policy, seasonal and weather-related pressures.”

He explains: “Jobs surged in Q1, benefitting from strong late‑2024 economic momentum, as companies accelerated hiring ahead of tighter clean energy tax credit rules under the IRA, front-loaded recruitment for spring and summer construction seasons, and in anticipation of rising demand from data centres and industry.

“But in Q2, hiring fell abruptly as new ‘Foreign Entity of Concern’ requirements disrupted supply chains and delayed projects, while unusually early and prolonged monsoon conditions in key markets like India slowed construction activity and dampened electricity demand.”

In the latter half of the year, he says employment stagnated as companies “focused on adapting to the new regulatory environment, reassessing demand, and prioritising efficiency and digitalisation over large-scale expansion”, resulting in more targeted, specialised recruitment over broad workforce growth.

One expertise area was singled out: tariffs. According to GlobalData, tariff-related job postings in the power sector grew 657% from last year, illustrating the impact of US trade policies on the global energy market.

Going into 2026, Vyakaranam expects the recruitment landscape to remain highly specialised, with companies prioritising expertise in “grid planning and reliability, energy storage, regulatory and tax strategy, supply‑chain risk management, and digital and analytics functions to support smart grids and asset optimisation”.",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/12/shutterstock_2712992151-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:32.360590

Hot rocks might be the next big thing in energy.

Global investment in geothermal energy is growing quickly — and it’s expected to keep climbing in the years to come, per new data from research firm Rystad Energy.

At the start of the 2020s, less than $2 billion flowed each year toward projects that harness the Earth’s natural underground heat to either produce electricity or directly warm buildings. By 2030, that figure could hit nearly $9 billion, Rystad predicts.

Geothermal systems have been around for decades in places where the Earth’s warmth sits close to the planet’s surface — think regions with lots of hot springs, for example. But decarbonization goals and rising power demand are fueling renewed enthusiasm for the always-available clean energy source, and emerging technologies mean companies can tap into it in areas with more challenging terrain.

Geothermal heating is most popular in Europe, where there’s growing interest in using the energy source for thermal networks that can warm up multiple buildings. Iceland, which has long leveraged its volcanic geology to keep homes toasty, is the famous example here.

When it comes to electricity, geothermal makes up less than 1% of the world’s supply. The U.S. is the global leader in terms of geothermal power capacity, with much of it located in California’s steamy Geysers region. It’s no surprise, then, that America is among the countries investing the most in the energy source, topping the chart this year and last.

Rystad doesn’t expect the U.S. to be No. 1 for much longer, predicting that volcano-laden Indonesia will steal the top spot for investment starting in 2027. Even so, geothermal could have a bright future in the U.S. It’s something of a unicorn: a clean energy source that has broad support among both Democrats and Republicans.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/cotw-geothermal-3.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=30aa86e577ececd42803e2273f0d8138,N,,2025-12-12 12:01:12.020740

In 2026, homeowners who install a heat pump will no longer be able to apply for federal tax credits amounting to 30 percent off installation costs or new equipment.

At the same time, a pilot program from Central Maine Power that charged a lower rate in the winter to certain customers with heat pumps is also set to expire.

This means that homeowners may see costs associated with installing and running a heat pump go up next year, particularly as electricity rates continue to climb. Maine’s average electricity prices increased at the third highest rate in the country over the last decade, a previous analysis by The Maine Monitor found.

The federal energy efficiency tax credits, established under Biden’s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, are set to expire earlier than planned because of changes made this summer in President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Federal home energy rebates for low- and moderate-income families, however, will remain in place.

Efficiency Maine Trust, the quasi-state agency responsible for energy programs, plans to continue offering several types of heat pump rebates, including up to $9,000 for low-income customers and up to $3,000 for any income level.

Efficiency Maine has no plans to modify its heat pump incentives when the federal tax credits expire, according to executive director Michael Stoddard. Funding for the heat pump rebates comes from a variety of sources, including electric utilities, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act and a grant from the federal Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Other efforts to increase heat pump adoption and make them more affordable are underway.

Maine is part of a five-state coalition called the New England Heat Pump Accelerator, a $450 million effort that launched last month to get more heat pumps installed by offering financial incentives to distributors and contractors; supporting new pilot programs and workforce development efforts; and improving educational outreach. The accelerator was funded with money from the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program created by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Maine surpassed Gov. Janet Mills’s goal to install 100,000 heat pumps by 2025 back in 2023. Now the state is working toward installing 275,000 units by 2027.

Maine Won’t Wait, the state’s climate action plan, tallied 143,000 heat pumps installed at the end of 2024. Rebates, combined with energy bill savings, have made heat pumps a popular alternative to heating systems that use oil, gas or propane.

Whereas traditional heating systems can only turn on and off, a heat pump can ramp up and down, said Shawn LaPlante, co-owner of LaPlante Home Services in Scarborough.

“It can use a little bit of electricity. It can use a lot of electricity when it needs it, and then it can go back down to a little bit of electricity. So it has the ability to vary,” LaPlante said.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions, as The Maine Monitor has previously reported, cost savings associated with heat pumps have become a key part of the sales pitch. The clean energy think tank RMI calculated that, in Maine, a household can expect an average of $700 in energy bill savings annually after switching from delivered fuel to a heat pump.

Ryan Shea is the manager of RMI’s buildings team, which focuses on research and policies related to reducing carbon emissions and boosting efficiency. Shea said the annual cost savings calculations were made using RMI’s Green Upgrade Calculator, which factors in details about a given home, such as its size and when it was built, as well as energy rates, heat pump type and climate.

“There really is a lot that goes into quantifying energy bills, especially when you're switching fuels,” said Shea. “What this tool tries to do is factor in all of those inputs and generate an output that's quite accurate.”

When stacked against the cost of installation, LaPlante said most customers can expect to make back their initial investment in five to eight years, depending on their circumstances. LaPlante said there’s been a “slight uptick” in the number of customers looking to install heat pumps since the change was announced to the federal tax credits

“This just gave them a little push to say, well, why not, because I can get the federal tax credit,” LaPlante said. “It's an extra $2,000 potentially, so I think that allowed them to push up their timeline, but they had to have already been thinking about it.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_maine_monitor_337/c8c78e0fa2584379af47b05269398226,N,,2025-12-12 17:03:26.648496

Significant Changes May Be Coming to Fuel Economy Rules

The Trump administration is preparing a rollback of increased federal automobile fuel efficiency standards enacted under President Biden. They are aiming to lower the cost of gasoline-powered vehicles and reverse federal efforts to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles (EVs).

Fuel economy standards have been in place since 1975 to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil and to push manufacturers toward more efficient vehicle technologies. Under a rule finalized in 2024, the Biden administration required automakers to reach an average of roughly 50 miles per gallon by 2031. Federal officials estimated that these standards would significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save consumers billions in fuel costs.

President Trump has long opposed federal support for EVs, and earlier this year, the Transportation Department initiated a review of the Biden-era standards, arguing they improperly relied on electric vehicle performance to set more stringent requirements. Weakening the rules would increase pollution and leave the United States less competitive in the rapidly growing global EV market.

Following the proposal’s release, the Transportation Department will hold a public comment period before finalizing the rule next year. The Environmental Protection Agency is also expected to introduce its own revisions to greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks in the months ahead.

News and Updates

Administration Proposes Opening Florida & California Waters to Oil Drilling

Trump’s administration has proposed an expansive five-year offshore oil and gas leasing plan that would reopen federal waters off the California coast to drilling for the first time in forty years, while reviving longstanding political battles in the other states. The draft schedule, extending from 2026 to 2031, considers up to 34 lease sales through auctions in California, Alaska, and the eastern Gulf. Many of them would begin after President Trump’s term ends.

However, state legislators have sharply pushed back on the proposal. California lawmakers emphasized that federal leasing would face steep regulatory and legal barriers, including the state’s authority over coastal infrastructure needed to support drilling.

The plan also reignites conflict among Florida Republicans, who have historically opposed offshore drilling out of concern for the state’s tourism economy and military training areas. Despite a long-standing moratorium on drilling off Florida’s coast, which had been extended by Trump during his first term until 2032, the proposal includes lease sales in a newly-named “South-Central Gulf of America” region adjacent to the Florida panhandle.

Beyond California and Florida, the schedule also proposes extensive leasing in Alaska. The draft plan will undergo a multi-stage public comment process, with a revised schedule expected next year before the Interior Department finalizes the program.

COP30 Struggled to Achieve Robust Climate Deal

Nearly 200 countries meeting in Belém, Brazil for COP30 acknowledged that global efforts to curb dangerous warming remain insufficient, but deep geopolitical divisions prevented a stronger agreement. The final deal urges nations to enhance climate action and provide more predictable funding for vulnerable countries, yet it omits a proposal backed by the EU to accelerate the global transition away from fossil fuels.

The talks were marked by the unprecedented absence of the United States, which withdrew after President Trump abandoned the Paris Agreement. Without U.S. engagement, emerging economies and oil states succeeded in removing explicit references to phasing out fossil fuels from the final text. EU members, initially hesitant, accepted the watered-down agreement after securing limited revisions.

Brazil notably secured a modestly stronger outcome than its earlier drafts, including aspirations for reducing fossil fuel use and deforestation. The final text, however, remains nonbinding. Still, many countries framed the agreement as an important reaffirmation of multilateral cooperation at a moment of heightened political tension.

Three years ago, I wrote a piece on Winter Storm Elliott on Substack. It was less than two years after Winter Storm Uri and the memories were still raw. People were hurting, worried, and hungry for truth. My goal, very simply, was to fill that informational void.

That piece struck a chord, and the Texas Energy & Power Newsletter was born. For three years, we’ve provided a signal through the noise surrounding energy in Texas. Many of you even pledged crucial financial support, which enabled the launch of the Energy Capital Podcast, which has become an important platform for so many brilliant energy experts and helped a broader audience navigate energy complexities in ERCOT and beyond.

Doing this work and growing these platforms have been among the highest privileges of my career. But things are about to change. I’m starting a new job (more on that in coming days), which obviously will trigger some changes at both the Texas Energy & Power Newsletter and the Energy Capital Podcast.

But again, this isn’t just a transition. It’s an expansion.

At the newsletter, a stellar group of writers will deliver the energy information that Texans continue to crave. Stay tuned for more on that soon. And at the podcast, a talented group of new hosts, along with Nathan Peavey, the talented producer responsible for the podcast’s high quality over the last year, will keep this thing rolling and growing. (Look for one later today!)

As with the electric grid itself, a network of diverse resources is more resilient than a singular, centralized one. We’re building the former. This is an opportunity for more voices to use this platform and grow it.

This publication was never about me. It was always about the critical need for independent energy coverage in the biggest energy state in the country. This new crew will continue to deliver it. In fact, I’m excited to become a paid subscriber myself. Because I need this reporting as much as you do: there’s still not enough focused energy coverage in Texas, and this platform is more critical than ever.

His roughly 300 acre farm has been in his family since 1865 and has survived crisis after crisis. Now it has another important job to do — affordably feeding families in one of the state’s most persistent food deserts. It is not an easy task in a place where climate threats like storms are expected to cause the area to lose more crops and farmlands this century than pretty much anywhere else.

Brown is a regenerative farmer. Regenerative agriculture is a way of farming where you treat the soil like a living sponge by keeping it covered with plants, minimizing plowing, and adding compost so that each year the land grows richer, holds more water, and supports more life instead of being worn out.

By caring for the land, he said, it makes it easier to care for his neighbors. His farm delivers boxes of fresh produce to local families who otherwise wouldn’t have access, through a Community Supported Agriculture program, and he teaches others how to farm sustainably.

In a majority Black, low-income community with almost no other fresh-food outlets, his CSA is one of the few direct sources of fruits and vegetables. His town, Henderson, North Carolina, has only one grocery store for its 14,000 residents, a scarcity that Brown says creates “a convenience market for processed food” to flood the area and promotes chronic illness.

Brown’s program model operates on direct subscriptions of $25 per week, eliminating middlemen and connecting consumers directly to their food source at a price well below what most North Carolina grocers are offering. This year, he has over 100 members. Virtually all of his members are Black, he said, and they receive weekly boxes of vegetables accompanied by recipes that teach which foods benefit specific health conditions.

While the exact size of the boxes vary by the season, CSA boxes are typically a better value for customers because CSA farmers tend to include higher-value and specialty and native crops that are not found in grocery stores.

“It gives the opportunity to learn and educate themselves on obesity and what non-processed foods can offer compared to processed foods they’ll get at a Dollar General or Dollar Tree,” Brown explained.

Not only do the families in his community benefit from his eco-friendly CSA, the soil does, too. Brown plants ‘cover crops’ like rye and buckwheat to blanket the soil in winter, helping it hold onto moisture for spring planting and making his fields less vulnerable to the droughts that have accompanied climate change as it heats the atmosphere and pulls more moisture out of land and plants. His focus on sustainability offers a model for other farms nationwide. Less than 5% of U.S. farms use regenerative soil practices.

“We have to bridge the gaps and create ways and opportunities for producers like myself, nonprofits, and for-profits to see what ways can help diversify opportunities to create gaps and bridge for climate resilience,” he said.

How innovation is fighting North Carolina’s food deserts

Programs like Brown’s are part of a broader push to sustainably close food gaps across North Carolina.

Research shows CSAs can improve food access in rural food deserts. These programs can boost the amount of produce families eat, offer it at prices that are as low as or lower than other local options, and cut down on long trips to distant grocery stores by providing more convenient pickup sites.

But traditional models often struggle to reach low-income households. Brown and other CSAs in North Carolina address this by focusing on affordability and education, reducing barriers through subsidized shares, offering payment plans, and accepting food assistance like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Electronic Benefits Transfer (SNAP/EBT).

At North Carolina A&T University, a multidisciplinary team recently launched the Fresh & Local Nutrition Incentive Program, which reduces barriers by offering half-priced CSA boxes to people using SNAP benefits at a weekly campus market in East Greensboro.

The project uses a ‘double-up’ model that matches SNAP dollars at a campus market, turning a $10 swipe into a box of in-season fruits and vegetables worth twice as much.

The impact extends beyond nutrition.

Brown said he’s watched community members learn where their food comes from and how to sustain themselves on the land they inhabit.

One longtime customer told him she’d never cooked some of the vegetables in the box before the recipes started arriving each week, but now her kids “ask when the farm box is coming” and help wash and prep the produce.

The plight of Black farmers

During the Biden administration, urban and small-scale farming initiatives received backing. The administration created more ways to deliver loans, and funded partnerships with community groups so food could reach those most in need.

But there have been cuts during the Trump administration. The administration rolled back federal support for minority-owned farms and cut the Regional Food Business Centers program, which provided up to $100,000 in grant funding to small and midsized farms.

Federal data shows that a majority of Black-operated farms report very low annual sales compared with all farms and are more likely to need grants.

Yet, Black farms are less likely to receive support. USDA loan programs granted loans to 72% of white applicants in 2022, but only 36% of Black applicants. The disparity extends beyond financing. North Carolina’s Black farmers owned just 3% of farms in 2017.

Climate change compounds the pressures on the remaining Black farmers. While regenerative practices build soil and land resilience, farmers “really don’t have any control” over extreme weather events, Brown said. Hurricanes and rainstorms flood fields and strip away topsoil, while the increasing number of winter storms freeze and kill crops and damage tools and equipment.

To keep his operation viable, Brown has made a strategic shift away from commodity agriculture, which is when big, single-crop farms grow things like corn and soy mainly for food corporations.

Rather than gambling on commodity prices, Brown focuses on specialty crops: organic wheat for direct retail sale and industrial hemp fiber for textile and building manufacturing. He often sells hemp to clothing companies like The North Face and Patagonia, and also directly to consumers on his website.

But Brown is candid about limitations as the Trump administration’s support for Black farmers dwindles.

Brown said he would not advise someone to start the farming journey without outside income, due to the compounding situation of declining federal support and climate threats. “I would advise them, especially during times now where there are no programs available for them to get started, to do as little as they can to get to where they want to be, but to apprentice at a farm where they can learn more over a period of time.”

Pathways to learn from farmers still exist. Organizations like WWOOF-USA connect aspiring growers with over 1,400 host farms nationwide for hands-on training.

Sustainable food access for the next generation

Brown also opens his operation to aspiring farmers, demonstrating how to create local food systems and agritourism opportunities.

Many weekends out of the year, teens gather at Brown’s farm as he pulls carrots from the soil, handing them over for tasting while explaining how the cover crops beneath their feet hold moisture through droughts. Aspiring farmers from nearby lots shadow him, watching as he packs CSA boxes with recipes and diabetes-fighting greens.

Brown is building a model for how Black farmers can reclaim both land and legacy on a farm that his family has fought hard to retain control of.

He is tilling the same soil that his ancestors worked — first as enslaved people and then as sharecroppers during the reign of Jim Crow.

And it’s the same ground his father stood on four decades ago as trucks rolled past carrying toxic waste to a nearby landfill in 1982.

Brown’s father, Arthur Brown, a preacher and farmer, joined more than 500 protesters who were arrested during six weeks of demonstrations against the dumping in 1982.

The protests failed to stop the landfill — 7,097 truckloads of contaminated soil were buried within 7 feet of groundwater. The contamination gave birth to clusters of cancer cases in the county and took decades to clean up. But they succeeded in birthing a movement. The Rev. Benjamin Chavis, who organized the demonstrations, coined the term “environmental racism” from his jail cell after being arrested with Brown’s father.

More than 40 years later, Brown’s experiment is bolstering a central belief that striving Black communities have enough power and resources to support one another. In 2021, he purchased the Oakley Grove Plantation house where his family was enslaved.

In the past decade, Brown has helped over 75 Black farmers adapt regenerative practices on their land, which in return has helped mitigate climate change impacts, made farming more profitable, and slowed land loss among Black farmers.

“We have to make sure that Warren County residents excel in growth, whether it be environmental, whether it be jobs, whether it be access to food,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/capitalbnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/491977330_1234371988691915_4324299112892745489_n.jpg?fit=2048%2C1142&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:50.078983

From home wiring and electric vehicles to renewable energy grids and telecommunications, the metal is necessary for cleaner technologies and more resilient infrastructure.

The U.S. already uses a lot of copper and will need a lot more to keep up with rising clean energy demands. Yet despite its strategic importance, U.S. copper policy is marked by fragmentation and short-term thinking rather than clear direction. This is especially notable as most analysts believe that, both globally and in the U.S., copper demand is likely to outstrip supply within a decade.

Global demand is projected to rise by 22% from around 27 million metric tons (Mt) today to roughly 33 Mt by 2035 and by 37% to 37 Mt by 2050. Meanwhile, the International Energy Association (IEA) projects that as high-grade ore becomes harder to find and aging mines close, global mined copper supply could peak around the late 2020s at a little over 24 Mt, after which output declines noticeably to less than 19 Mt by 2035.

In the U.S., recent federal efforts have sought to accelerate domestic mining, fast-tracking the permitting of projects in the name of “critical mineral independence.” Yet the combination of tariffs, agency budget cuts and uneven inter-agency coordination have undercut U.S. copper producers and processors. The result is a mixed record: an industry being encouraged to produce more to meet demand and achieve supply chain independence, and a country still lacking a long-term copper strategy to manage that demand and the forecast supply gap.

Furthermore, the vast size and diversity of the global copper market also makes it difficult for the U.S. government to significantly influence it. Unlike other metal markets — like the rare earth element market, where the U.S. provided a $400 million investment in the sole U.S. rare earth mining and processing facility, guaranteed purchase agreements and a price floor for its key product — there are no easy policy wins applicable to copper. Influencing the copper market will require a longer term and more strategic approach.

U.S. Copper Production and Demand

The U.S. produces 850,000 tons of refined copper from its own mines, plus an additional 870,000 tons in copper scrap from recycling (both post-consumer scrap and new scrap recovered from fabricating operations), but to meet the country’s needs of about 2.5 million tons, it imports an additional 810,000 tons of refined copper. That leaves a 30% gap. While these figures represent U.S. copper consumption, copper demand is likely even higher because the U.S. also imports manufactured goods containing copper that aren’t counted in consumption figures.

This domestic supply gap leaves the U.S. vulnerable to external shocks and export controls. Without significant U.S. government intervention, the 30% supply gap will likely grow as U.S. copper ore grades decline and demand from clean energy increases.

One potential bright spot is the proposed Resolution Copper Mine in Arizona, a joint venture between mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP, which could, if permitted, supply nearly a quarter of the U.S.’s current mined production. However, without associated refining capacity, the U.S. will continue to remain dependent on refined copper imports.

Forecasting U.S. Demand

The demand for copper is expected to increase rapidly from grid modernization, more electric vehicles, increased renewable energy sources needed to power everyday lives, and from the increase in artificial intelligence which is spurring the rise of high energy consuming data centers.

To support grid modernization and renewables integration, the U.S. will likely need to build an estimated 5,000 miles of new transmission line annually in the coming decades. That figure, based on an analysis from the Department of Energy’s 2024 National Transmission Planning Study, would require hundreds of thousands of additional tons of copper per year, further pressuring the supply base.

Over the last decade, electric vehicle growth in the U.S. has gone from almost negligible to a material source of copper demand. In 2024, 1.6 million electric cars were sold in the U.S., with the sales share growing to more than 10%. The increased copper in the car itself (EVs require up to four times as much copper as a gasoline-powered car), plus the associated charging infrastructure has likely added several hundred thousand tons per year to U.S. copper demand.

According to the IEA, the total amount of new power generation capacity from renewable sources, like solar and wind, in the U.S. rose 40% from 2023 to 2024, mainly reflecting rapid increases in solar PV. Solar power systems contain approximately 5.5 tons of copper per megawatt, with copper in the heat exchangers of solar units as well as in the wiring and cabling that transmits the electricity in photovoltaic cells. The IEA expects stable growth in U.S. renewable capacity in 2025, with slightly lower solar PV expansion and wind capacity from projects that qualified for tax credits before the current administration’s policy changes.

Copper demand tied to AI and data infrastructure is rising fast, too. Data centers and the power and cooling infrastructure that they use all contain substantial copper content in cables, transformers and power delivery systems. In the past two years, construction of data centers has doubled in the U.S as major U.S. tech companies try and stay ahead of the AI-driven demand.

Government Tactics Lack Strategy

The U.S. government is acting with a sense of urgency to reduce the domestic copper supply gap. It recognizes its dependence on imported refined copper coupled with falling U.S. copper ore grades could prove disastrous for a copper-hungry U.S. economy.

Government officials would no doubt argue that they are doing more to advance the interests of copper than any previous U.S. administration and they may be right. For example, copper was recently added to the U.S. Critical Minerals list, making it potentially eligible for federal grants, research funding and streamlined permitting. While it’s not unhelpful to have copper on the list, it’s among 59 other minerals including, aluminum, lead and metallurgical coal, competing for government attention and resources. Other actions have negative or mixed impacts on the U.S. copper supply:

Trade and Tariffs

The signature economic tool used by the Trump administration to date has been tariffs. In August, the administration imposed tariffs of up to 50% on several categories of semi-finished copper imports including copper pipes, wires, rods, sheets and tubes. While these tariffs are likely to increase costs for many downstream industries, the government’s broader tariff regime will also raise costs for mining equipment, spare parts and refining machinery, resulting in higher operating costs for U.S. producers that rely on imported specialized machinery.

Major U.S. copper markets — including China and the EU — have responded to U.S. tariffs with counter-tariffs. This will likely dampen U.S. exports and create uncertainty for global contracts.

Tariff threats and countermeasures have also fueled swings in copper prices, complicating planning and financing for long-term projects. On July 8, President Donald Trump announced, “I believe the tariff on copper, we’re going to make it 50%.” That caused copper futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to surge 13% as the markets widely assumed that imported refined copper would be targeted. On July 30, when the White House clarified that the tariffs would be on semi-finished copper products, and not refined copper as expected, copper futures contracts fell 19% in the biggest intraday fall on record.

Lastly, instead of shielding U.S. copper, tariffs may make it less competitive. Producers have faced squeezed margins, while downstream industries have been forced to pay more for wiring and other copper products.

Institutional Capacity and Permitting Challenges

Long‑term copper supply depends not just on mines but on the institutions that enable them. Budget cuts at agencies like the U.S. Forest Service (34%), Bureau of Land Management (36%) and Environmental Protection Agency (54%) will slow permitting and environmental review. Delays, uncertainty and regulatory risk discourage investment.

In addition, fast-tracking mine permitting, a signature mining policy from the Trump administration, has a high potential to backfire. Rushed environmental reviews are more likely to be challenged in court, which can result in years of litigation. Unstable rules also discourage the long-term investment that mining requires; a mine approved under one administration may face reversal under the next, scaring off capital.

Lastly, without reforming downstream processing, further instability in the U.S. copper market is likely. New mining alone doesn’t produce finished copper products; refining and smelting capability must keep pace. In October, Richard Holtum, CEO of the commodity trader Trafigura, caused a minor stir when he said: “Mining is not critical, refining and smelting is critical … If you don’t have it in your country, then you are at the mercy of someone that does and their ability to turn on or off that smelting capacity.”

Internal Coordination

Perhaps the most fundamental problem is the absence of a coherent U.S. copper strategy. Unlike China, which coordinates mining, refining, recycling and trade under a unified framework, the U.S. remains fragmented.

There is no lead agency, with responsibility for copper split across the departments of the Interior, Energy and Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency, and in certain circumstances, the State Department, with little coordination. The current administration has set up the National Energy Dominance Council, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, that could potentially act as a government coordinating body across all aspects of domestic energy, including critical minerals, but in practice, the council seems to be a presidential advisory body rather than a coordinating one that develops coherent and cohesive strategy.

Current U.S. policies give the impression of being reactive rather than proactive, typically driven by short-term trade disputes rather than a long-term vision for copper’s role in the energy transition. This means that with no clear roadmap, companies are hesitating to invest in new smelters, recycling facilities, or long-term exploration.

Moving Toward a Coherent U.S. Copper Strategy

To ensure that copper is available, affordable and resilient to shock, the U.S. should adopt a forward-looking, balanced approach that includes:

1) Strengthening Recycling and Circular Systems

Recycling is a central piece of any sustainable copper strategy — if properly leveraged. In the U.S., around 870,000 tons of copper scrap was collected in 2024, a figure that technically constitutes approximately one-third of the domestic copper supply. However, that figure does not show that over half of all copper scrap produced in the U.S. is exported for processing, much of it to China. This not only increases the U.S. reliance on China for arguably one of its most critical minerals, but it also forfeits an opportunity to close the copper circular economy loop.

While recycled copper is not without its sustainability challenges, compared to primary copper (mined ore), secondary copper requires up requires up to 85% less energy to produce. As a result, many consumers who are conscious of their carbon footprint are pushing to acquire the same relatively limited supply of recycled copper. The mining company BHP estimates that, as demand for primary copper begins to outstrip supply, collection and process of scrap will increase to around 40% by 2035 and reach around a half of total copper consumption by 2050.

Regions like the EU and Japan have more advanced circular copper approaches, better scrap collection systems and stronger secondary refining capacity giving them an edge in supply security. If the U.S. builds out modern recycling infrastructure, incentivizes scrap collection and processing through grants, regulatory support and procurement incentives, and retains more copper scrap onshore, it can reduce both reliance on imports and carbon footprint, while creating jobs in manufacturing and clean industry.

2) Building Domestic Refining and Smelting Capacity

The U.S. has just two operating primary smelters; and a third that hasn’t been permanently closed, but it’s not currently in operation. Both operating smelters are running at near-full capacity so, if new copper mines are developed in the U.S., new smelters will need to be built to receive their copper concentrate. Modern copper smelters not only cost billions to build but their running costs, in large part due to their energy intensity and the stringent environment regulations they must abide by, are also significant. Rather than providing incentives and public–private partnerships (e.g., subsidies, tax credits) to support the establishment of state-of-the-art, low-emission smelters and electro refineries, the Trump administration has reversed a Biden-era air pollution rule, in the name of reducing regulatory burdens, that had imposed stricter limits on emissions from the U.S.’s two copper smelters.

3) Investing in Scientific and Institutional Capacity

The funding cuts at the agencies that provide environmental baseline studies and regulatory capacity should, at the very least, be reversed, if not increased. Those agencies were already generally considered to be understaffed, a situation that contributed to permitting delays. If the current administration wants to increase domestic mining, the agencies that oversee domestic mining need to be commensurately increased.

4) Streamlining but Stabilizing Permitting

According to the National Mining Association (NMA), “a typical mining project loses more than one-third of its value, as a result of bureaucratic delays in receiving the numerous permits needed to begin production.” The NMA also states that in peer mining countries like Canada and Australia that have quicker permitting processes, the timeline for the government to respond is more clearly outlined, the permitting agency leading the process is clearly identified from the outset, and the responsibility for preparing a well-structured environmental review is given to the mining company, not the government. Reforming these areas of the permitting process would help to reduce uncertainty and delay, however, it is critical that high environmental and social safeguards remain in place, reducing the risk that new mines become litigation bottlenecks.

5) Coordinating a National Critical Minerals Framework

The National Energy Dominance Council could, if empowered to do so, align trade, research and development, industrial policy and supply chain strategy in a coherent policy approach that would boost U.S. copper production. However, the council’s focus is spread thinly between oil, gas, nuclear, the electrical grid, coal and hard rock mining. Reinstating the U.S. Bureau of Mines (closed since 1996) or developing a new, hard rock mine-focused coordinating body would bring in-house many of the functions currently carried out by a myriad of overlapping oversight agencies, would help bring certainty to investors and would incentivize further mineral exploration in the U.S.

Bridging the Copper Supply and Demand Gap

Copper sits at the heart of America’s clean energy, defense and digital economies. The challenge is not merely to extract more but to orchestrate a supply system — mining, processing, recycling and regulation — that is resilient, efficient and forward-looking. With strategic planning and investment, the U.S. can bridge the looming copper gap and ensure that this essential metal powers its economic future.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2025-12/copper-wiring_0.jpg?VersionId=RAlikbPT__0861O0Dq6P12duJAOfm1X3&h=b0dce8b1&itok=Edu-MD1Q,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:04.660533

In 2025, those forces aligned in a way that felt both grounded and forward-looking. It was a year when Detroit clarified where it has been and where it is determined to go.

If the past decade was about revival, 2025 was about direction — shaped by neighborhoods, artists, educators, innovators, designers, and everyday Detroiters working toward a shared future.

Here, Detroitisit takes a look back at some of the people, projects, and ideas that shaped our stories this year, and the momentum they’ve created for what comes next.

How neighborhoods, institutions, and creators defined Detroit’s direction this year.

Many of this year’s most impactful stories came from Detroit’s neighborhoods, where local leadership continues to guide change from the inside out.

In Brightmoor, community organizers addressed long-standing challenges with practical, creative solutions — from youth programs to neighborhood beautification. Eliza Howell Park, a long-cherished but often overlooked green space, experienced renewed energy through ecological restoration and community-driven programming. Both examples reinforced a central idea: Detroit’s transformation works best when it is shaped by the people who live in these spaces every day.

Even Detroit’s alleys — once ignored or underused — gained new purpose. Through art, design, and community involvement, they evolved into gathering spaces and creative corridors. These small-scale interventions made a big impact, proving that meaningful change does not always require large projects. Sometimes it starts at the edges.

On a larger scale, 2025 brought major progress to civic and infrastructure projects that will influence Detroit for generations.

The riverfront’s continued evolution, including the development of the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Centennial Park, reflected Detroit’s commitment to ecological design and public accessibility. With native plants, water features, and open green space, the riverfront is becoming one of the city’s most significant examples of sustainable public development.

Mobility innovation also gained momentum. Discussions about autonomous vehicle corridors, transportation technology, and multimodal systems signaled Detroit’s intention to link its historic role in transportation with a more modern, inclusive vision. As Tony Geara, Deputy Chief of Mobility Innovation for Detroit emphasized, mobility is not only about infrastructure — it’s about improving quality of life.

Culturally, 2025 was a dynamic and energizing year.

The revival of Detroit’s Chinatown stands out as a meaningful effort in cultural visibility and placemaking. Its resurgence is about more than restoring a physical district — it’s about reclaiming heritage and community identity.

Inside museums and creative institutions, new leadership and initiatives brought fresh energy. Cranbrook Academy of Art welcomed an interim director who introduced new ideas into the region’s artistic landscape.

Detroit also strengthened its role in the national art economy. UOVO’s acquisition of ArtPack signaled the city’s emerging position as a key center for art handling, logistics, and creative business. And the Ford Piquette Plant continued its stewardship of Detroit’s manufacturing history, reminding residents that the city’s past still informs its future.

Development stories in 2025 emphasized a shift toward intentionality.

“Building With Heart in Detroit” showcased Jonathan Hartzell’s work, who prioritizes community partnerships, local talent, and sustainable practices.

Gardner White’s return to Detroit highlighted how established companies can reinvest in the city in ways that support artists, makers, and local ecosystems.

Education and youth development were also central themes. Articles such as “Creating Opportunities for the Next Generation” and “A Foundation Championing Detroit’s Next Generation” showed how mentorship, access, and education continue to shape Detroit’s long-term future.

Throughout these stories, one idea stayed constant: successful investment happens when people are the focus.

Detroit’s commitment to sustainability grew stronger in 2025.

Climate-resilient parks, naturalized landscapes, stormwater-smart design, and efforts to rethink vacant land all contributed to a deeper conversation about the city’s environmental future. “Redefining Sustainability in Detroit” emphasized that sustainability is not simply a trend — it’s a long-term approach to building smarter, healthier, and more equitable communities.

Everything from fertilizer use to carbon emissions to green space access is becoming part of Detroit’s planning vocabulary, marking a shift toward strategies that benefit residents today and protect generations ahead.

Meawhile Detroit’s food scene continued to evolve, reflecting broader cultural shifts. “2025 Detroit Dining Trends” showed how chefs are embracing hyper-local sourcing, storytelling through cuisine, and more communal forms of dining. These trends align with Detroit’s broader pattern of creativity, connection, and sense of place.

Detroitisit also held its 4th Annual Sustainable Urban Design Summit, gathering architects, planners, policymakers, and designers at Newlab inside the Michigan Central Innovation District to explore how cities can grow more equitably and sustainably. The full-day event reflected both urgency and optimism, underscoring Detroit’s role not just as a participant in the future of urban design, but as a leader shaping it.

Across all of these stories — from neighborhood revitalization to cultural programming, from mobility innovation to environmental design — one message defined Detroit in 2025: resilience here is active. It is shared. It is intentional.

As Detroit enters 2026, it does so with the momentum of thousands of people working toward a future grounded in possibility, equity, and imagination. Reinvention remains part of Detroit’s identity — and it will be fun to see where that takes us.",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-11-at-8.47.01-AM.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 10:02:10.843614

A smart panel lets owners view what’s being used when, giving them the insight they need to make better decisions. It also allows them to remotely switch off anything left running when a guest leaves.

Powering up when the grid is down

Every year, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and homeowners are increasingly looking for solutions to keep power flowing in all conditions.

Take the story of one homeowner and solar industry expert living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with his family. He had just installed a solar array, battery storage and a smart panel system in his home when a windstorm knocked out power for days. During the power outage, smart technologies became a lifeline.

With his smart panel, the homeowner managed energy strategically: charging his solar panels when the sun was up and then using stored battery power to run selected appliances throughout the rest of the day. His foresight helped his family and his neighbors weather days of being cut off from the grid. One neighbor even came over to charge her hearing aids.

More and more, architects and builders are realizing the importance of flexible energy management, especially in emergency response.

Tiny home, mighty power

In Asheville, North Carolina, a solar-powered tiny home is a living example of how smart home technology can be a gamechanger in times of crisis – and beyond. This little home is big on power, enabling a family recovering from Hurricane Helene to live their full lives, even without a grid connection.

Thanks to the home’s smart panel and battery energy storage, the family can efficiently manage their electricity use, maximize solar energy storage and expand capacity when needed. They can get real-time insights through an intuitive app to prioritize energy use effectively.

The Asheville project shows the potential of combining solar and storage in disaster recovery housing.

A brighter future calls for smarter energy use

Every homeowner who gains visibility into their energy use, every family that weathers a storm with power to spare, every community that stays connected when the grid goes down is another building block in a more resilient future. As the world changes around us, smart energy management isn't a luxury or a nice-to-have, it's a fundamental next step in adapting to changing power demands.",https://resources.news.e.abb.com/images/2025/12/12/0/Panel-Guard-keeps-energy-demand-within-capacity_1_1-large.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 17:59:03.332134

The City of Fairfax is one of 19 Virginia localities participating in the statewide Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program. C-PACE financing helps property owners overcome financial barriers that discourage investment in energy and water conservation projects.

C-PACE enables owners of commercial, industrial, nonprofit and multifamily properties (with five or more units) to access long-term, fixed-rate financing for energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation, and resiliency improvements. Building improvements financed with C-PACE can be completed with no upfront, out-of-pocket cost and can generate positive cash flow upon completion.

C-PACE projects are financed by private lenders, including specialized C-PACE capital providers and community and regional banking institutions. The financing is repaid through a special assessment on the property tax bill, typically over a term that matches the useful life of the improvements — up to 30 years — and can be transferred to the new owner if the property is sold.

Administered by the Virginia PACE Authority in partnership with Virginia Energy, the program streamlines financing and reduces administrative burden for localities.

Benefits for Property Owners:

No money out of pocket: 100% financing includes hard and soft costs

Reduces capital expenditure budget; upgrades paid through operating savings

Eligible measures cover broad capital and facility improvement needs

Extends building lifespan while improving comfort.

Long-term, fixed interest rate financing (up to 35 years) results in lower annual payments.

Typically cash flow positive within the first year

Property owners may pass through C-PACE assessment to tenants, if allowed by lease.

In 2023, despite the reluctance of Germany, the commission announced a ban on sales of new vehicles powered by internal combustion engines from 2035.
For those against the ban, it's no longer just a question of shifting the 2035 date, but of relaxing certain provisions.
Moreover, as a majority of biofuels are imported, the EU wouldn't gain in autonomy, another objective of the shift to electric vehicles.
European carmakers -- BMW, Mercedes, Renault, Stellantis and VW -- are not always on the same page even if they all want the rules to be relaxed.","While Europe's embattled auto industry and its backers have lobbied hard for Brussels to relax the ban, they are divided on exactly what measures to take.

Why the 2035 target date?

In 2023, despite the reluctance of Germany, the commission announced a ban on sales of new vehicles powered by internal combustion engines from 2035. Hybrids that use a combination of combustion engines and battery power are also included.

The ban is a key measure to help attain the EU's target of carbon neutrality by 2050.

The date is important as vehicles spend an average of 15 years on the road in the EU and thus would be expected to have largely stopped spewing planet-warming emissions by around 2050.

The 2023 announcement included a provision for a review in 2026 but, under pressure from carmakers and governments, the commission pushed forward announcing proposed adjustments to the end of 2025.

The proposals will go to the European Parliament for review.

What adjustments are possible?

For those against the ban, it's no longer just a question of shifting the 2035 date, but of relaxing certain provisions.

Carmakers would like to see continued sales authorised for hybrids with rechargeable batteries or those equipped with range extenders (small combustion engines which recharge the battery instead of powering the wheels).

Germany supports this option as do eastern European nations where German carmakers have set up factories.

The ACEA association of European carmakers doesn't criticise the goal of electrification, but it said ""the 2035 CO2 targets for cars and vans are no longer realistic"".

Another possible means to add some flexibility would be boosting the use of alternative fuels such as those derived from agricultural crops and waste products.

Italy supports this option.

But environmental groups are opposed to any massive turn to crop-based biofuels as it would likely boost the use of pesticides and aggravate soil depletion, and they are also sceptical about what emissions reductions can actually be achieved.

Moreover, as a majority of biofuels are imported, the EU wouldn't gain in autonomy, another objective of the shift to electric vehicles.

Carmakers out of alignment?

European carmakers -- BMW, Mercedes, Renault, Stellantis and VW -- are not always on the same page even if they all want the rules to be relaxed.

This is principally due to their varying progress in shifting to electric models.

The industry that has grown up around the electric car sector -- such as battery manufacturers, recharge stations and electricity companies -- wants to keep the 2035 target with no adjustments.

""Rolling back these objectives would undermine the EU’s energy sovereignty, industrial leadership, and climate credibility,"" said the UFE, a trade group for French electricity industry firms.

France, along with Spain and the Nordic countries, has long called for keeping to the trajectory to shift to electric vehicles in order to not harm firms that have made investments in the transition.

Paris has indicated it is open to some flexibility on the condition of local content being favoured, which pleases suppliers which have also come under intense pressure from cheaper Chinese competition.

Is there a risk in backsliding?

Yes, according to experts.

""What is considered a short-term advantage may not be one in the long term,"" said Jean-Philippe Hermine at the IDDRI think tank that focuses on the transition in the transport sector.

Bernard Jullien, an economist at the University of Bordeaux, said keeping several different technologies imposes extra costs for companies.

It can also create uncertainty for them if consumers adopt a wait-and-see attitude, he added.

""Between China and its electric vehicles and the oil that Saudi Arabia and the United States wants to sell us, is the right choice to stick with our old technology?"" asked Diane Strauss, head of the French office of T&E, an advocacy group for clean transport and energy.

As Michigan Live reported, it's all thanks to a $1.84 million grant announced by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

The grant will cover 201 charging stations installed at 31 complexes in the Detroit suburbs of Taylor, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Dearborn Heights, and Southfield. Several apartments in Kalamazoo, Flint, and Lansing will also receive chargers.

The state's Clean Fuel and Charging Infrastructure Program funded the grants, which ""range from roughly $20,000 to $98,000 per site for installing two to 10 Level 2 chargers,"" per Michigan Live.

Since these chargers require around four to eight hours to fully charge an EV battery, they are reserved for overnight use.

Another $5 million in grants will become available for charging projects at apartments, with funds distributed at $300,000 per site.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer's MI Healthy Climate Plan is behind the push to install EV chargers at multifamily properties, and by 2030, the goal is to deploy 100,000 chargers and get 2 million electric vehicles on the road.

While the EV market continues to grow, sales have slowed in recent years, likely due to a combination of inflation, tariffs, and expiring federal tax credits, per Electrek.

However, many states, cities, and utilities continue to offer rebates for purchasing an EV, which you can view on the Department of Energy's website. In addition, federal tax credits for EV chargers are still available, provided you install equipment before June 30.

By switching to an electric vehicle, you'll save around 50% on maintenance and up to $1,100 on gas per year, according to Coltura.

EVs are also much better for the environment than gas-powered vehicles since they don't produce tailpipe pollution, which has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases by the World Heart Federation.

Meanwhile, fumes from conventional cars trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up global temperatures and fueling extreme weather.

Texas Pacific sees cooling the facilities’ equipment as a possible opportunity to generate sales for the treated water.","Texas is about to deploy a potential solution to the oil industry’s toxic wastewater problem — but it’s a move that carries environmental risks of its own.

State regulators are working to issue permits that would let four companies, including major landowner Texas Pacific Land Corp. and pipeline operator NGL Energy Partners LP, release treated wastewater from the Permian Basin into the Pecos River near New Mexico, regulatory filings show. At least one could be granted as soon as the first quarter of 2026, according to Texas Pacific.

Oil and gas wells in the Permian, the largest US shale basin, generate 21 million barrels per day of water laden with salt, chemicals and heavy metals. Drillers have been disposing of most of that fluid by pumping it back underground, a practice that has triggered earthquakes and leaks.

The proposed projects would be the first in a new generation of Permian treatment plants that would clean the industry’s wastewater, allowing it to be jettisoned above – rather than below – the ground. If successful, they could reduce underground disposal and provide water to irrigate crops and cool data-center equipment.

Yet cleaning up the water would raise costs for producers grappling with low crude prices, dealing a blow to a basin that’s crucial to President Donald Trump’s goal of energy dominance. And the prospect of the oil and gas industry discharging wastewater into Texas rivers, even after treatment, is alarming environmentalists. Regulators have yet to prove such releases are safe amid growing concern about their effects on human health and ecosystems.

“It’s really dangerous,” said Virginia Palacios, executive director at the Texas government watchdog Commission Shift. She doubts whether oil companies and state regulators can be trusted to fix an environmental liability they created in the first place.

“The main problem has been that the industry is always looking for shortcuts,” she said.

A Bloomberg News investigation in September found that Texas allowed oil and gas companies to increase the volume of wastewater pumped into shallow underground reservoirs, even though state regulators were warned by their own staff that the fluid could leak to the surface from old wells. Regulators placed pressure limits on wastewater disposal and are reviewing a handful of pilot projects that aim to find new outlets for treated fluid, including some run by Texas Pacific.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said in an emailed response to questions that it won’t allow treatment plants to discharge wastewater that is dangerous to aquatic life, violates state water quality standards, endangers drinking supplies or threatens human health. The agency said it’s monitoring water quality at four locations on the Upper Pecos River and two sites on the river’s Red Bluff Reservoir.

At least two of the applications for river discharge under review by the commission, known as TCEQ, are on track to move forward to a stage when the draft permits are available for public viewing and anyone with concerns can call for a hearing, filings show.

Shale producers blast water, sand and chemicals into wells to break apart rock and allow oil to flow — a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. With wastewater disposal volumes expected to grow almost 40% over the next decade, the Permian’s biggest operators want to find alternatives to pumping it underground.

One option is to reuse the wastewater for fracking. But since salt-laden water occurs naturally in shale formations, more fluid comes out of a well than goes in. That means that more water is produced than can be used again in new frack jobs, limiting the industry’s ability to use recycling as a long term solution.

Water is becoming such a serious challenge for the Permian, which produces more oil than any OPEC member aside from Saudi Arabia, that operators will spend $101.3 billion managing it through 2030, according to Bluefield Research, a data and analytics provider. Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law in June providing $20 billion for water infrastructure in the state, funds that could be used partly for treatment projects proposed by the oil and gas industry.

The biggest hurdle to scaling up water treatment is cost. Estimates for cleaning wastewater vary widely because projects are still early stage, but some are in the range of $2 or $3 per barrel of water, mainly due to the large amount of energy needed. That’s multiples higher than the 65 cents to $1.50 a barrel expense of injecting underground, according to Bluefield.

Texas Pacific, founded during the Wild West Era of the late 19th century, sees a business opportunity. It could receive a permit to release cleaned-up wastewater into rivers and streams as soon as the first quarter of next year, Robert Crain, executive vice president of the company’s water division, said in an interview.

The 10,000 barrel-a-day pilot project may only treat 0.05% of the basin’s water, but executives believe it could solve a huge environmental problem and become a new revenue source once the technology is deployed at greater scale.

Wastewater, known as produced water, is as much as five times saltier than the ocean. As such, Texas Pacific envisions a handful of intensive early steps such as freezing it and using membranes to reduce salinity. Then the fluid will be put through reverse osmosis and ultimately sanitized with a chemical agent or an ultraviolet light.

On three occasions, Texas Pacific passed a five-day test to show organisms can reproduce in its cleaned-up water and a seven-day test to demonstrate that aquatic life can grow, Crain said.

“Everybody wants to be scared of what’s in produced water. It is safe to drink,” Crain said of the treated water, adding that he has done so himself. In any case, “we’re a long way away from this water going directly back into drinking-water systems.”

Texas Pacific said that while it welcomes scrutiny of its water treatment and reuse projects, its goal is to maintain standards far above existing protocols.

“This is the complete oppositive of a shortcut — we are investing significant time and resources into research, testing and fabrication where we could have otherwise chosen to do nothing,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email.

Other companies are also pursuing wastewater treatment ventures. Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips and Coterra Energy Inc. are working with Aris Water Solutions Inc. on a project to test several new technologies to lower the salt content of wastewater, including using membranes and thermal distillation, or separating impurities from water using heat. Exxon plans to have a fully operational treatment facility by the end of next year as part of its goal to “deliver sustainable water solutions” for the Permian, according to a spokesman.

Chevron wants to turn a “waste product into a resource,” said Brittany Cheben, the company’s Permian water strategy manager. “Our aim is to preserve fresh water for human use by repurposing this water for industrial applications, non-food agriculture, or municipal uses like golf courses.”

As part of a project backed by shale giant EOG Resources Inc., Tetra Technologies Inc. is testing the limits of membranes used to remove salts from Permian wastewater at its lab near Houston. The goal is to make them more durable so they can be used for a longer time before needing to be replaced, reducing costs.

“Produced water is going to be a problem for many, many years,” Tetra Chief Executive Officer Brady Murphy said in an interview. “These types of solutions have to be brought to the market. And they will.”

Regardless of what method companies use to filter the water, they’ll still have to dispose of what’s left over. That likely means shooting it back underground using a yet-to-be-determined volume of water. Some of the waste could also be mined for valuable minerals like lithium.

Along with proposals to pump treated wastewater into rivers and streams, companies are testing out discharge onto land.

Data center developers, who are eyeing West Texas amid the artificial-intelligence boom, are potential customers for oil wastewater. Texas Pacific sees cooling the facilities’ equipment as a possible opportunity to generate sales for the treated water.

Farmers may also be buyers. A handful of pilot projects are underway to spread small amounts of cleaned-up wastewater on test plots in West Texas, where crops such as alfalfa and cotton are grown.

Jeremy Louder, a fourth-generation farmer near Midland, Texas, believes this could help revive agriculture in the water-starved region. Conditions are so dry that he grows wheat to prevent runoff and erosion, preserving what little water he has for his sorghum crop.

Holding a head of wheat as he looked out across his 13,000 acre (5,261-hectare) ranch, Louder pointed to a cluster of water tanks and wastewater disposal equipment near Exxon’s operations about a mile away. The way he sees it, cleaned-up water could allow for year-round growing.

“If there was a plant over here, we would grow one summer crop, one winter crop, and then we would have a permanent grass,” Louder said. “That water would be utilized all the time. We could push it further by double-cropping if we had to. We’ve got the land available.”

Still, farmers are unlikely to have the cash to pay for large volumes of cleaned-up water. Groundwater, though dwindling, is essentially free.

Another challenge for companies pursuing wastewater treatment is convincing the public that the fluid has been filtered and sanitized enough to be safe. Despite the industry’s insistence that technology can turn toxic waste into clean — even drinkable — water, Ira Yates has doubts.

Yates, a descendant of a prominent oil dynasty and president of the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Pecos River, supports pilot projects to test treated wastewater on land. But he thinks it’s way too early to discharge it into the state’s rivers. The Pecos River is a delicate and complex ecosystem that has been a crucial source of water in arid West Texas for hundreds of years, Yates said.

“There’s still a reasonable doubt,” he said, “that maybe there’s something in the water that we’re not seeing.”

The report released Wednesday by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found nearly two-thirds of states have cut staffing and more than half have reduced funding for environmental agencies since 2010. Wisconsin was among the top 10 states in the nation for these cuts.

The environmental watchdog group argued states were already struggling to protect against pollution before Trump proposed a nearly 55 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2026 budget, which would reduce federal funding for states.

Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said Wisconsin experienced a 29 percent cut to state funding over the period. Funding for pollution control programs at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources dropped from $121 million in 2010 to $85 million last year when adjusted for inflation, according to the report.

“That means there are fewer people and fewer resources to do the really important job of making sure that companies follow the law, that permits are protective and that communities are safe from industrial pollution,” Duggan said.

Wisconsin had the 10th largest percentage decline in state funding. The report found state funding for environmental agencies declined by the largest share in Mississippi, South Dakota and Connecticut.

The report’s findings are based on data provided by the DNR that include money spent on environmental remediation, water quality improvement and air management. The data excluded funding under the state’s clean water and safe drinking water loan programs.

As state funding has dropped, so too has funding for the EPA. Funding for the federal agency has declined 40 percent in the past 15 years when adjusted for inflation, the report said. The agency’s funding supports states as they enforce environmental laws that include the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.

Under Trump’s proposed cuts to EPA, states stand to lose around $2.5 billion for revolving loan funds for water upgrades. Trump’s budget would also cut more than $1 billion in federal grants that help states manage local air quality, prevent water pollution and clean up contaminated sites.

A DNR spokesperson said the agency would not be able to assume all the work that’s currently funded by the federal government if its funding is significantly reduced as proposed under Trump’s budget.

Republicans in the U.S.House have proposed $7 billion in funding for EPA or a 23 percent cut in the agency’s budget. The Senate Committee on Appropriations proposed $8.6 billion in funding for EPA — a 5 percent reduction. When Congress ended the government shutdown in November, lawmakers postponed a vote on 2026 funding levels for the agency and the rest of the government until the end of January.

In a Nov. 13 meeting, DNR Secretary Karen Hyun said the agency is monitoring federal funding impacts.

“We continue to work really hard to mitigate the impacts at the DNR,” Hyun said. “We’re about 30 percent federally funded, so we do have strong partnerships in terms of funding and technical assistance and science with different federal agencies.”

Amid funding cuts, the report notes EPA’s workforce also shrank by 18 percent or more than 3,100 full-time positions in the last 15 years. Those figures don’t include thousands of staff who were fired or left the agency this year. An EPA spokesperson said the agency is confident it has the resources to protect human health and the environment.

“Likewise, at the Trump EPA we understand that states know states best, and we are working alongside state, tribal, and local authorities to ensure clean land, air, and water for all residents,” an EPA spokesperson said.

As for states, the report said they eliminated 3,725 positions in pollution control or related environmental programs in the last 15 years.

Under the current state budget, the DNR is down 500 positions since the beginning of the 2003-05 biennium when it had nearly 2,975 positions, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. The DNR lost 256 positions in budgets approved by Democratic former Gov. Jim Doyle and around 230 positions in budgets approved by Republican former Gov. Scott Walker.

Duggan called on state lawmakers to reverse the trend of cutting state pollution control programs. Top GOP leaders and Republican chairs of the Legislature’s budget-writing committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

The report from the Environmental Integrity Project evaluated staffing and changes in operating budgets at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality and comparable agencies in other states. From 2010 through 2024, the numbers show the agency’s personnel count decreased 24% with 222 positions eliminated from the agency. The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department.

“These cuts increase the risk that residents will face higher levels of pollution, especially if the EPA lacks the funding and capacity to do its job,” Environmental Integrity Project executive director Jen Duggan said Wednesday during a news conference for the report’s release.

“In Louisiana, we feel them deeply,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade who also took part in the news conference.

The report focused on the Department of Environmental Quality’s operating budget, or the money it spends to handle day-to-day tasks such as paying employees, maintaining facilities, lab analysis and grants to local governments. Large loans and federal grants, which are considered as capital costs, were excluded from the analysis where possible to avoid outliers because they vary widely from year to year and “do not measure a state’s capacity” to limit pollution, according to the report’s methodology.

The staffing cuts at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality are “among the most of any state,” according to the report. Other standouts included Mississippi, which reduced its environmental agency funding 71% from 2010 to 2024.

On the other end of the spectrum is California, which increased its environmental operating budget by 364% over the same 14 years.

At the federal level, the Trump administration has said it intends to bring the EPA’s employee count down to levels last seen during the Reagan era, when the agency had between 11,000 and 14,000 people of staff, NPR reported. It began Trump’s second term with about 15,000 employees.

The majority of environmental agency staffing cuts in Louisiana happened during Bobby Jindal’s terms as governor from 2008-16. The Department of Environmental Quality has not seen significant hiring or funding boosts dating back to Edwin Edwards’ fourth term as governor from 1992-96.

The agency’s boldest policy moves came after Gov. Buddy Roemer took office in 1988. He placed environmental scientist Paul Templet in charge of Environmental Quality, and the administration tied industrial incentives to benchmarks for reducing pollution. Since Roemer lost his reelection bid in 1991, governors who have succeeded him have, to varying degrees, urged cooperation with industry.

The Environmental Integrity Project report points out cuts in Department of Environmental Quality staff and funding come as Louisiana sees a boom in industrial investment. The number of facilities seeking air pollution control permits from the state rose 29% from 2016-24, with 1,906 applications last year according to the report’s analysis of public records.

A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality responded to the report in a statement, saying the department meets all federal grant requirements and performance expectations while prioritizing “efficiency” and remaining “fully committed” to environmental protection.

The department has implemented an expedited permitting program to make up for its staffing shortages, allowing applicants to pay for agency staff members’ overtime as they work on the approval process.

Rolfes cites issues with this process in the report, saying it creates a conflict of interest.

“When you cut the resources of the agencies, you further depend on the companies themselves as the source of payment for permit writers — and that is an inherent conflict,” Rolfes wrote in the report. “When you have the company paying your overtime, you are just not going to ask the questions and scrutinize it the way you would if your salaries were being paid by the public.”

The analysis also identified Louisiana as having the highest amount of toxic air emissions per square mile of any state in the country. Staffing shortages also play a role in delayed response time to pollution issues, according to the report.

In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project report counted only 10 LDEQ employees who handled all air enforcement actions at more than 500 major industrial facilities and hundreds more smaller locations. A Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report from 2021 also found the department was understaffed and could do more to address air pollution violations.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/smokestacks1765537412.jpg?h=e7c891e8&itok=ausIXI6Q,N,,2025-12-12 06:59:54.041444

Data centers are not going away; they are the backbone of the growing digital economy.
The reality is, data centers are foundational to how we live in the world today, and more so in the future.","Colorado is in the middle of a data center boom. You may or may not notice it as you travel along the Front Range, but the world’s digital infrastructure is rapidly taking root here.

Warehouses full of hyper-efficient computers powering everything from email to artificial intelligence. Denver alone projects nearly a 200% increase in data center growth, while utilities like Xcel Energy warn they will need $22 billion in new infrastructure to meet the rising demand for electricity.

Some are calling the Interstate 25 corridor “Data Center Row.” Others see potential for jobs and an increased tax base. And many Coloradans are asking a reasonable question: What does all this development actually mean for our communities, our water, our climate, and our energy bills?

As a researcher who studies the political and environmental dimensions of emerging technologies, the reality is this: Data centers are reshaping Colorado’s environmental and economic landscape in real time, and we need smart, transparent policy to guide that growth.

The scale is new, and enormous

A single AI-oriented data center can use as much electricity as 175,000 homes. Colorado has more than 60 data centers already, most clustered along the Front Range. Dozens more facilities, some exceeding 160 megawatts of power capacity, are planned or under construction.

This growth isn’t happening in isolation. Two federal executive orders issued this year removed environmental guardrails and fast-tracked data center construction nationwide. Colorado, eager not to lose investment to competitors like Texas, Iowa and Wyoming, has responded with tax incentives and the proposed “Data Center Development and Grid Modernization Act,” which sought to trade subsidies for basic energy and water stewardship requirements.

But even with efficiency improvements, the sheer scale of AI adoption means electricity demand is rising steeply, and the 1970s-era infrastructure we have isn’t built for the capacity of demand. Xcel projects that by 2040, data centers alone could require 8.5 gigawatts of power, roughly the equivalent of adding another Denver metro area to the grid.

The environmental impact is complex

Data centers are frequently criticized for their significant water needs and potential to strain local utilities. And it’s true that some proposed facilities in Colorado could consume hundreds of thousands of gallons per day if they rely on conventional evaporative cooling, putting a significant strain on an already scarce regional water supply.

But some newer facilities are adopting lower-water or water-free cooling technologies, such as liquid cooling, adiabatic systems and air-side economization. Still, these technologies are not yet industry-wide, and the cumulative effects of rapid data center growth could place real pressure on Colorado’s limited water supplies.

Energy use is also a key concern. Data centers currently account for 4.4% of U.S. electricity demand, and with rapid AI growth, that number could triple within a few years. Utilities may pass infrastructure costs on to ratepayers. And Colorado’s grid is still far from fully decarbonized. More load without more clean energy risks prolonging fossil fuel reliance.

Social impacts

Communities across the country have pushed back on data center proposals because of noise, diesel backup generators, light pollution, and secrecy around energy and water use. Colorado is starting to see the same concerns, particularly concerning the 600,000 square-foot center under construction in Denver’s densely populated Elyria-Swansea neighborhood.

Transparency remains a major problem. Some companies claim that disclosing energy or water use gives competitors an edge, leaving neighbors and local governments in the dark. And local officials, eager for economic development, may grant tax breaks without fully understanding long-term costs: increased grid infrastructure needs, potential rate hikes and land-use tradeoffs.

Meanwhile, the jobs picture is mixed. Construction jobs are plentiful, but once built, even massive data centers often employ fewer than 100 workers.

What can Colorado do?

Data centers are not going away; they are the backbone of the growing digital economy. But without effective policy, we risk letting the industry set the terms. Colorado can lead nationally by pursuing three principles:

Require full transparency on water, energy and emissions. Every data center should publicly report annual water use, cooling methods, electricity consumption and backup generator operations. Communities deserve to know what is being built in their backyard.

Tie incentives to real climate commitments. • 100% clean electricity procurement • Water-efficient or water-free cooling technologies • Investments in grid modernization that don’t fall solely on ratepayersColorado’s recent attempt — SB-280 — moved in this direction before collapsing under pressure. It should be revived and strengthened.

Plan for regional impacts, not project-by-project approvals.A single data center is manageable. Dozens clustered together can reshape electricity demand, land use and noise levels for an entire region. Colorado needs coordinated regional planning to avoid the chaotic landscapes seen elsewhere.

The reality is, data centers are foundational to how we live in the world today, and more so in the future. We know how to build them better, with community input and more sustainable resource use. We should demand that the infrastructure powering AI and the broader digital economy operates within Colorado’s environmental limits and contributes to a livable, resilient future.

If we get this right, Colorado can be a national leader in responsible AI infrastructure. If we get it wrong, we’ll spend decades trying to retrofit the consequences.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 06:59:01.756910

While the impact on employment may be modest, data centers’ effect on the power supply is not.
The secrecy around data center recruitment is a feature, not a bug.
Legislation has been introduced to prevent utilities from passing along data center infrastructure costs to consumers.","FOMO has broken out across Arkansas, as elected officials, unelected economic developers, utility companies and their regulators fall all over themselves not to miss out on the AI-fueled data center boom, a competition characterized by hyperbole, secrecy and healthy doses of wishful thinking.

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and state legislators are fueling the campaign to turn Arkansas into a mecca for data centers, expanding a sales tax exemption for new projects and allowing Entergy Arkansas and other utilities to bill consumers for the expanded generating capacity needed to satiate data centers’ voracious appetite for electricity.

Yet, amid splashy announcements of projects, sort-of projects and maybe someday projects, and the handing out of tax breaks like a freewheeling Santa on Christmas Eve, some pesky questions are being ignored.

Do the relatively modest number of jobs generated by data centers justify the infrastructure improvements and tax breaks being offered to lure them to Arkansas? Is it fair for power customers who live far afield from data centers to foot the bill for expanding capacity?

Is it appropriate or wise for state and local governments to provide corporate welfare subsidies to some of the most profitable companies on the planet — and to negotiate those deals in secret to avoid appropriate public scrutiny? Is opening up the candy store really necessary to compete for these projects, or are state and local leaders — driven by their fear of missing out — getting played?

As we try to move away from our reliance on fossil fuels to combat climate change, should we really be encouraging environmentally unfriendly projects that undermine our renewable energy goals by driving up electricity demand beyond what renewable sources can possibly supply?

And, more basically, is indulging FOMO a responsible way to make decisions that could alter the state’s landscape, raise our electric bills and shackle state and local governments to tax incentives for decades to come?

The AI boom has led to exponential growth in the number of data centers sprouting up across the country, as high-tech behemoths such as Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft look to ramp up their server capacity. The number of U.S. data centers now tops 4,200, just nine of which are in Arkansas.

But the past year has seen a proliferation of projects across the state — a $4 billion Google data center in West Memphis and vague proposals for $1 billion data centers in Little Rock, Conway and Clarksville. Although Google is rumored to be behind all three of these projects, middlemen are being used to negotiate tax breaks, so the names remain a secret.

Of course, state and local governments offering tax breaks and infrastructure improvements to lure new businesses is nothing new — the entire economic development industry is built around the practice. The traditional justification is that the new facility will generate a large number of jobs that will provide stable long-term employment for local residents.

While that argument might hold water when it comes to a new factory or assembly plant, it falls flat with data centers — facilities with gigantic footprints that consume copious amounts of electricity and water but provide relatively few jobs.

For example, the prospective data centers in Little Rock and Conway would occupy 300,000 square feet — more than five football fields — but employ just 50 people, about as many as would be in a modest-sized high school marching band. Google’s center in West Memphis will have just 300 permanent employees, on a campus of 1,100 acres, although it’s projected to provide 5,000 temporary jobs during construction.

And companies operating data centers have also been loath to guarantee that even these modest numbers of jobs will go to locals; indeed, some of the more high-paying technical jobs are likely to go to outsiders with specialized skills.

Republicans in the legislature called their bill allowing utility infrastructure costs to be passed along to consumers the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act. But how many jobs? For whom? At what cost?

While the impact on employment may be modest, data centers’ effect on the power supply is not. Electricity demand for data centers is forecast to triple by 2028, from 4% of total U.S. demand to 12%. And an analysis from the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative found that this alliance between utilities and Big Tech will shift billions in costs onto the shoulders of consumers, a trend we’re seeing already in Arkansas.

Entergy Arkansas customers, from Texarkana to Pocahontas and points in between, are going to pay on average $2 more per month to finance increased generating capacity to serve Google’s data center in West Memphis, under an agreement approved earlier this month by the Public Service Commission. Thus, customers who won’t receive economic benefit from this project will be paying to subsidize it.

A study from the University of Michigan also found that data center owners often negotiate sweetheart deals with utility companies for discounted rates, further shifting costs to consumers — and details of those deals are often kept secret.

We’ve also seen that in Arkansas: When Entergy presented details of its contract with Google to the PSC, the public was ordered to leave the hearing room so that “confidential” information could be discussed in secret.

The secrecy around data center recruitment is a feature, not a bug. And the primary beneficiaries are the tech companies who get public subsidies and discounted utility rates without subjecting themselves to the transparency or accountability we should expect in what’s left of our democracy.

If we want to see where all of this might lead, we might look to Virginia, which has been inundated with more than 660 data centers and where FOMO is giving way to regret.

Officials there are getting an earful from voters mad about noise and environmental impacts, higher utility rates and a paucity of new jobs. Legislation has been introduced to prevent utilities from passing along data center infrastructure costs to consumers. And a Democrat recently flipped a legislative seat that had been in Republican hands for decades by stressing the effect data centers were having on electricity prices.

As a Republican state senator put it, “People are now looking at this, going, ‘What the hell is going on?’”

That’s mostly due to an expected rise in electricity demand, a surge largely driven by the rise of high-powered data centers needed to train and run artificial intelligence (AI) models. But some of the plants have been ordered to stay open by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), despite significant environmental and financial costs. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, has frequently cited “winning the AI race” as a rationale for re-investing in coal.

The fossil fuel facilities are located in regions across the country, from Maryland to Michigan and Georgia to Wyoming. Together, their two dozen coal-fired generators emitted more than 68 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2024. That’s more than the total emissions of Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. combined.

Nearly 75 percent of the coal plants were on track to shutter in the next two years.

The delays buck the overall trend in the U.S., where coal’s importance as an energy source has diminished rapidly over the past two decades. Coal’s critics say this broad-based phaseout is an urgent matter of public and environmental health. Often called the “dirtiest fossil fuel,” coal creates more climate emissions per gigawatt-hour of electricity than any other power source. And the human impacts of its pollution have been profound: A 2023 study in Science attributed 460,000 extra U.S. deaths between 1999 and 2020 to sulfur dioxide particulate pollution belched out by coal plants.

Cara Fogler, managing senior analyst for the Sierra Club, called the recent spate of delayed closures “unacceptable.”

“We know these coal plants are dirty, they’re uneconomic, they’re costing customers so much money, and they’re polluting the air,” said Fogler, who co-authored a report showing many utilities have backtracked on climate commitments, including coal phaseouts, often citing data centers as a cause. “They need to be planned for retirement, and it’s really concerning to see utilities becoming so much more hesitant to take those steps.”

DeSmog identified the 15 plants by examining changes to the planned retirement dates listed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a DOE agency that compiles data on energy providers, as well as public statements from utilities and the Trump administration. Some of the voluntary delays appear to directly contradict previous net-zero pledges made by several companies.

Neither the Department of Energy nor American Power, a trade association representing the U.S. coal fleet, responded to requests for comment.

What Led to Coal’s Decline?

Not long ago, coal really did keep the lights on. In 2005, it provided roughly half of America’s electricity, making it by far the dominant power source nationwide. But in the past two decades, coal’s market share has rapidly waned. No new coal plants have come online since 2013. These days, its footprint has dwindled, with just 16 percent of the overall energy mix.

In March 2017, President Trump appeared to blame environmental regulations for coal’s poor fortunes — a trend he promised to reverse.

“The miners told me about the attacks on their jobs and their livelihoods,” Trump said at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters. “I made them this promise … My administration is putting an end to the war on coal.”

But environmental regulations didn’t kill coal. Instead, its demise became inevitable mostly thanks to the rise of a competing fossil fuel: natural gas.

Gas has both economic and technological advantages over coal, said David Lindequist, an economist at Miami University who co-authored a recent paper on the environmental impacts of the shale gas boom.

As new fracking technologies helped to flood the U.S. market with cheap gas in the mid-2000s, utilities began a broad coal-to-gas pivot that’s still underway today. Abundant, often less expensive gas flowed into power plants that operate more efficiently and nimbly than coal plants. This combination of price, efficiency, and flexibility made ditching coal an easy calculation for many utilities.

“The fact that we were able to so successfully phase out coal in the U.S. would never have happened without the fracking boom,” Lindequist said.

Today, coal is at an even greater disadvantage, as renewable energies continue to make economic and technological inroads. The International Renewable Energy Agency found that, in 2024, solar and wind routinely delivered electricity more cheaply than fossil sources of energy. That dynamic has helped solar in particular become the fastest-growing source of power in the U.S.

Meanwhile, America’s newest coal plant — the Sandy Creek plant near Waco, Texas, built way back in 2013 — is currently sitting idle after another catastrophic failure. It isn’t set to resume operations until 2027. The average U.S. coal plant is more than 40 years old, a factor that’s contributed to their decreasing reliability.

“These [coal] plants are so old that at this point there’s very little that could really revive the fleet,” said Michelle Solomon, manager in the electricity program at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation. “I’ve been using the analogy of an old car: Nothing is going to bring my car that has 200,000 miles on it back to being a brand new, efficient car.”

During the Biden years, as technological advancements and historic subsidies made renewables even more attractive, observers broadly believed that coal’s days were numbered. The “writing was on the wall” for coal, Lindequist said.

“Coal may retain a grip in U.S. politics, but its actual role in the generation system is shrinking annually,” researchers for the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote in a 2024 report. “It is a trend we believe is irreversible.”

Yet even before Biden left office, a new dynamic began emerging: As tech companies started proposing billions in data center build-outs to feed the AI frenzy, utilities started to take a fresh look at their coal plants.

Data Centers Changed Coal’s Trajectory

In 2020, Dominion Energy, a utility that provides electricity to millions of customers across Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, announced non-binding plans to retire the Clover Power Station by 2025. Running the plant — an 877 megawatt (MW) coal-fired facility near Randolph, Virginia — would be uneconomical under any future scenario, the company found. It just didn’t make financial sense to keep it going.

It reversed course just three years later. Under its 2023 plan, Dominion projected that its energy demand from data centers would nearly quadruple by 2038. That’s an astonishing rise, considering that Virginia already leads the U.S. in data center development by a wide margin. Known as Data Center Alley, the state is home to more than one-third of the world’s largest-scale data centers. Today, Dominion says it doesn’t anticipate retiring any of its existing coal plants — including Clover — until at least 2045, the year that Virginia law stipulates its economy must be carbon-free.

Dominion wasn’t the only utility to cite data center growth as it backtracked on coal. In an August 2024 earnings call, executives of the Wisconsin-based utility Alliant Energy said that the company was “proactively working to attract” data center projects. A few months later, Alliant announced it would delay retiring the Columbia Energy Center, a coal-fired plant near Madison, from 2026 to 2029. The plant’s retirement had already been pushed back once.

The trend became notable enough to attract the attention of analysts at Frontier Group, an environmental think tank. In January 2025, Frontier analyst Quentin Good published a white paper showing that utilities had already cited data center growth as a rationale for delaying the phaseout of seven fossil fuel power plants across the U.S.

“We were concerned about the potential for all of this new electricity demand from data centers to slow down the transition to clean energy,” he told DeSmog. “In that report, we discovered it was basically happening already.”

But two other dynamics also began playing out in January: AI hype started to reach new levels of intensity, and power changed hands in Washington.

AI Hype Highs, New Coal Lows

Data centers aren’t the only reason for the recent upswing in electricity demand. Building electrification, industrial growth, and increased electric vehicle ownership all play roles, too. But nothing has quite caught utilities’ attention like data center projects, which are cropping up with highly localized impacts across the U.S. at a historic rate. Filled with stacks of high-powered computing equipment, the facilities are projected to account for about half of new electricity growth between 2025 and 2030.

On January 21, 2025 — one day after President Trump’s second inauguration — he revealed a new AI infrastructure joint venture involving ChatGPT parent company OpenAI called the Stargate Project, which would spend up to $500 billion on data center build-outs in the next four years. Tech executives announced the initiative’s details alongside Trump during the unveiling at a White House event.

Days later, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he planned to spend $65 billion on data center build-outs in 2025 alone, including one project “so large it would cover a significant portion of Manhattan.” These announcements followed a similar one from Microsoft in January: a pledge to spend $80 billion on data centers this calendar year.

As the world’s largest tech companies raced to outdo each other, a wave of delayed coal plant retirements followed.

On January 31, Southern Company, a utility serving over 9 million customers across 15 states, announced plans to delay the retirement of generators at two of the largest coal plants in the U.S., both in Georgia. The massive, coal-fired units — two at the Bowen Steam Plant outside Euharlee, and one at the Robert W. Scherer Power Plant in Juliette — had been scheduled to go offline between 2028 and 2035. Under its revised plan, the company pushed retirement back to as late as January 1, 2039(though both plants would be 40 percent co-fired with natural gas by 2030 in that scenario).

In legal documents and public statements, company spokespeople point to data centers as a key rationale for the delays. Last month, at an industry conference in Las Vegas, Southern Company CEO Chris Womack cited data center growth as a key factor keeping fossil energy online, according to the trade publication Data Center Dynamics.

“We’re going to extend coal plants as long as we can because we need those resources on the grid,” he reportedly said.

Next door in Mississippi, Southern Company also delayed the closure of a 500 MW generator at the Victor J. Daniel coal plant in Jackson County. It pushed the retirement back from 2028 until “the mid 2030s.” In documents filed with Mississippi’s Public Service Commission, the state’s utility regulator, Southern appeared to cite a 500 MW Compass Datacenters project as a reason for the change. Southern has pledged to be net-zero by 2050.

As the months passed, the same dynamic unfolded in other states. Alarmed, Good, the Frontier Group analyst, started to track the delays. By October, he published an update to Frontier’s report that found data centers had pushed back at least 12 coal plant closures in the past few years.

“The data center boom has shown no signs of abating,” he wrote. “Even more fossil fuel plants that had been scheduled to retire have been given a new lease on life.”

In its own analysis, DeSmog found that at least 15 coal plant retirements have been delayed since January 2025 alone. Together, those plants emitted nearly 1.5 percent of America’s total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions from 2024.

This comes at a time when the world’s nations need to cut their climate emissions roughly in half to avoid the worst impacts of global heating, according to a recent United Nations report.

But not all the delays can be attributed directly to data center growth. Some have stayed open for a different reason: top-down orders from the Trump administration.

The Department of Energy Steps in

The J.H. Campbell Generating Plant, a 1.5 gigawatt coal plant in Ottawa County, Michigan, was scheduled to close May 31. The plant even held public tours to give a rare, behind-the-scenes look at aging fossil infrastructure, before it shut its doors for good.

“Now we know cleaner, renewable ways to generate electricity,” a Campbell employee told members of the public on a September 2024 tour.

But just eight days before scheduled to shutter, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright ordered Campbell to stay open another 90 days, citing an “emergency” shortage of energy in the Midwest.

Keeping the plant open cost its owner, Consumers Energy, almost $30 million in just five weeks, the company said. Though the plant’s closure was projected to save ratepayers more than $650 million by 2050, Campbell was costing more than $615,000 a day as of September. Yet Wright has since extended his order twice. Campbell now is scheduled to stay open until at least February 2026.

“The costs to operate the Campbell plant will be shared by customers across the Midwest electric grid region,” including customers serviced by other utilities, Matt Johnson, a Consumers Energy spokesperson told DeSmog by email.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is challenging DOE’s order to keep Campbell open, calling the orders “arbitrary.”

“DOE is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said in a November 20 press release. “DOE must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars.”

Meanwhile, DOE is telling a very different story.

“Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the AI race,” Wright said in September, as the Department of Energy announced $350 million in funding for coal plant upgrades, along with other incentives.

Energy Innovation’s Solomon called the funding “a waste of taxpayer dollars.”

“We’ve been calling it a ‘cash for clunkers’ program where you don’t trade in the clunker,” she said. “Trying to build a modern electricity system using the most expensive and least reliable source of power is really not the answer.”

However, the Trump administration said in September that it plans to feed the AI boom — with an estimated 100 gigawatts of capacity in the next five years — by keeping more old coal plants open. “I would say the majority of that coal capacity will stay online,” Wright said.

Executives from Colorado’s Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association confirmed to DeSmog that they also expect an order to keep a 421 MW coal-fired generator at Craig Station open past its December 2025 decommissioning date.

In late October, Colorado Congressman Jeff Hurd sent a letter to the Trump administration, urging it to extend the life of a 400 MW coal generator at the Comanche Power Station near Pueblo as the owner, Xcel Energy, works to repair the plant’s chronically troubled main reactor. The smaller unit was slated to go offline in December — but, in its case, the administration never needed to act. Last month, Xcel, with the help of Colorado Governor Jared Polis, began to lobby to keep it open at least another 12 months. The state utility regulator appears to have granted that request, according to an agreement with Xcel and other stakeholders.

This delay wasn’t just due to data centers, though their numbers are growing in Colorado. Xcel spokesperson Michelle Aguayo said the delay was “due to a convergence of issues,” including rising electricity demand, “supply chain challenges,” and the continued outage at the main generator. “We continue to make significant progress towards our emission reduction goals approved by the state which would require us to retire our coal units by 2030,” she said.

Delaying the Inevitable

Whether the data center boom will play out as projected is still a matter of speculation.

Last month, power consulting firm Grid Strategies reported that utilities may be overestimating electricity demand from data centers by as much as 40 percent. That’s due in part to the many hypothetical projects, and a widespread practice of double- and triple-counting. Tech companies tend to pitch utilities in multiple regions as they shop around for incentives, creating the appearance of demand from many more data hubs than actually will be built.

Experts have a name for this growing phenomenon: “phantom data centers.”

At the same time, a growing chorus of critics are warning of an AI bubble, arguing that runaway costs can’t justify the kinds of investment being floated. Even the head of Google’s parent company has acknowledged the “irrationality” of the boom.

Critics also says contradictory actions taken by the Trump administration — citing an “energy emergency” while canceling billions in funding for renewable projects — are making the problem worse.

Yet even with all the unknowns, one thing’s certain: Coal’s role in America’s power push can be extended, but it can’t last forever.

Seth Feaster, an IEEFA analyst, says even AI hasn’t changed the big picture: Eventually, coal will die, and it will be killed by other, cheaper forms of energy.

He called the current phenomenon a “period of pause and delay.” In his view, the technological and economic rationales for quitting coal remain undeniable.

“The policy changes here may have a delaying effect on the decline of coal, but they are certainly not changing the direction of coal’s future,” he told DeSmog.

The questions for now are, how long the delays will continue — and at what cost.",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/coal-plant-delays-ai-trump-graphic-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 05:59:11.481367

The Intertubes practically erupted in flames on December 11 when word broke that the Ford Motor Company and the leading South Korean firm SK On abruptly dropped their EV battery manufacturing joint ventures in Kentucky and Tennessee. Although the breakup was reportedly mutual, Ford indicated that SK may have jumped the gun on a formal announcement. “We are aware of SK’s disclosure and we have nothing further to share at this time” was all the iconic US automaker had to say at the close of the business day on December 11.

EV Batteries From SK & Ford: How It Started …

For those of you new to the topic of EV batteries, the Kentucky connection may seem a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Kentucky is widely known as a showcase for the traditional industries that made America great: horse racing, booze, and tobacco. Nevertheless, Kentucky has also been building up its auto manufacturing profile. Ford, for example, has two longstanding operations in the state, the Louisville Assembly Plant and the Kentucky Truck Plant.

Under the EV-friendly umbrella of the Joe Biden administration, Ford added onto its footprint in both states, with the Kentucky venture being a particularly high-profile development. In 2021, Ford announced a partnership with SK to manufacture EV batteries at a new facility located in Glendale, Kentucky, under the name “BlueOval SK Battery Park,” in support of Ford’s ambitious new EV manufacturing campus in the adjacent state of Tennessee.

“With production expected to begin in 2025, the all-new $5.8 billion, 1,500-acre dedicated battery manufacturing complex – BlueOval SK Battery Park – will create approximately 5,000 new jobs and help strengthen the local community,” Ford enthused in a press statement dated September 29, 2021.

The company’s North America COO, Lisa Drake, also chipped in her two cents. “Ford is excited to make this historic investment in the commonwealth of Kentucky, a state that has been part of the Ford story since we rolled a Model T down an assembly line in Louisville in 1913,” Drake said in a press statement.

… How It’s Going …

In the same press announcement, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear complimented Ford and SK for laying down the single biggest investment in state history. “It will transform our economy, creating a better Kentucky, with more opportunities, for our families for generations,” Beshear said.

“Never again will we be thought of as a fly over state. Our time is now. Our future is now,” he emphasized.

Gov. Beshear was equally enthusiastic in August of this year, when operations at the new battery campus commenced.

“Today, Kentucky marks a historic milestone four years in the making as production officially begins at two of the largest battery plants in the world, set to deliver EV batteries that will transform the automotive industry and the future of our commonwealth,” he cheered, again thanking SK On alongside Ford for the workforce opportunity.

Yeah, about that…. Another SK–Ford battery plant in Tennessee was also impacted by the breakup. Memphis Commercial Appeal reporter Corey Davis was among those getting the lowdown from SK. “Under the agreement, a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will have full ownership and operate the battery plant in Tennessee, according to a statement SK On issued Dec. 11,” Davis observed.

“Ford said it was aware of SK On’s disclosure and had nothing further to share,” Davis added.

While Ford had nothing further to share, Kentucky Public Radio reporter Joe Tonka was among those taking note of Gov. Beshear’s take on the matter. “In his Thursday press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear said Ford is expected to give more details about the future of the Kentucky plant early next week. He also expressed optimism about Ford retaining ownership, noting its long history in Kentucky,” Tonka wrote.

… And, Who’s Gonna Pay The Piper?

As reported by KPR, Gov. Beshear also took the opportunity to point out that elections have consequences. In July, the Republican-controlled Congress passed a new tax bill endorsed by US President Donald Trump, which put an end to the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as of September 30. The end of the tax credit is widely recognized as the single most significant factor causing a steep drop in EV sales after September 30, leading Ford and other EV makers to scale back their near-term manufacturing plans.

“Beshear addressed that bill Thursday, calling out President Donald Trump and Republican US Representative Brett Guthrie, whose district includes Glendale,” Tonka reported:

“I’m still amazed that the President would push through such a job-killing bill that cut subsidies and grants that companies and people had relied upon,” Beshear said. “And it’s really disappointing that Brett Guthrie, who has three EV plants in his district, would be the one that champions it, pushes it through and doesn’t make any changes at all to protect those plants.”

“So if we have people that lose their jobs, or jobs that are not created, your own congressman did it to you, and that’s really, really wrong. Your governor is going to do his best. I’m going to do my best to make sure we have as many jobs at those facilities as possible.”

To the surprise of nobody at all, Tonka further reported that Rep. Guthrie’s office failed to issue a timely response to an email request for a comment from KPR.

One state-level Republican elected representative did respond to the news, though he refrained from throwing stones at Rep. Guthrie. “Republican state Sen. Matt Deneen, whose district includes Glendale, said in a press release that he hopes Ford assumes full operational control and ‘remains committed to the long-term success of the Glendale plant,” Tonka reported.

Over the coming months, Tomago Aluminium will work with the Federal and NSW Governments on a long-term renewable energy solution to support the smelter’s viability when its current energy contract expires in 2028.

The partnership aims to deliver a long-term, fixed-price power purchasing agreement for the smelter, along with concessional finance arrangements to accelerate renewable energy generation and storage developments in NSW.

As part of a successful agreement Tomago Aluminium will contribute at least $1 billion in capital and major maintenance investment over the next decade, which includes identifying further decarbonisation opportunities for the smelter.

This represents a significant milestone towards securing the smelter’s ongoing operations.

The Commonwealth Government, NSW Government and Tomago Aluminium are working together to secure more reliable, renewable energy supply for heavy industry in the Hunter region.

The Coalition’s “wasted decade” of energy policies saw 24 of the nation’s 28 coal‑fired power stations announce closures without a plan to replace this energy generation – scaring off investment in regional industries.

It's fitting that Toyota's North Carolina plant is located in Liberty. EVs are one of the best ways for motorists to gain independence from dirty-fuel-burning rides. Owners typically save up to $1,500 a year on gas and service costs with no more oil or some other fluid changes. And certain states still offer perks for buying and charging them.

Charging at home is the cheapest way to power your ride, maximizing savings worth potentially thousands of dollars a year when compared to gas and public fast-charging stations, according to Qmerit. The service can help you get the best deal for a Level 2 charger installation at home. Level 2 chargers typically fill a battery in four to 10 hours, which is not as fast as public stations such as Tesla Superchargers, per the Department of Transportation.

An EV also prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution each year when it replaces a gas vehicle, even in states where dirty fuels create the electricity to charge them, the Department of Energy reports. Tailpipe exhaust is a known lung troubler, and the American Lung Association says that limiting the fumes can improve breathing by clearing neighborhood air.

EV owners can add to the benefits with home solar. A rooftop system can provide free sun energy to charge the cleaner rides, removing reliance on the grid and public stations. The Cool Down's Solar Explorer can help you compare quotes, find an installer, and secure tax breaks that expire Dec. 31, saving you up to $10,000 in upfront costs. EnergySage is one of the trusted partners that can discover the best setup for your home.

On the charging front, Qmerit can gather quotes and other information to help you land the right tech, ensuring you are using the electricity as efficiently as possible when powering up your EV.

New York can more aggressively target its carbon emission reduction goals by reducing the number and scope of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative carbon allowances it issues to the power sector, according to proposed regulations announced Wednesday by state authorities.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or DEC, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, or NYSERDA, said in a release that the proposed alterations to the state’s Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative regulations would “achieve affordable and effective reductions in pollutants” while prioritizing energy affordability.

The proposed amendments would reduce the annual budget of CO2 allowances through 2037. That includes a reduction in the number of allowances set aside for long-term contracts, and in the number of voluntary renewable energy purchases, “while still maintaining enough allowances to accommodate anticipated demand.” It would also remove the option for offset projects.

“DEC’s proposed RGGI updates would reduce the regional emissions cap to approximately 69.8 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2027, then decline 89% relative to the 2024 cap through 2037,” NYSERDA said in a release. “This would result in carbon dioxide emissions decreasing by approximately 10% annually through 2033, followed by 3% annually until 2037.”

The proposed changes remove all references to CO2 offset projects. Previously, New York allowed offset projects in the form of landfill methane capture and avoided agricultural methane.

The states currently participating in RGGI are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. New York’s proposal to strengthen its RGGI regulations comes one month after Pennsylvania left the program as part of a budget deal struck between Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-PA, and state legislators.

DEC and NYSERDA characterized the RGGI ramp-up in opposition to the Trump administration’s policies seeking to limit the deployment of renewable energy projects.

“In a time when New York and other states are facing federal headwinds, these proposed updates demonstrate a collective solidarity among states,” said NYSERDA’s CEO Doreen Harris in a release.

Google DeepMind’s partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems shows how advanced artificial intelligence can help overcome some of fusion’s most challenging physics challenges.

Global developments show that fusion is becoming a strategic technology arena with massive economic potential, with trillions of dollars in future clean-energy value.

The global pursuit of fusion energy – a potentially safe, abundant, zero-carbon power source – has entered a decisive phase, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

A new fusion roadmap published by the US Department of Energy in October outlines how the technology could enter that country’s energy mix by the early 2030s.

“Fusion is real, near and ready for coordinated action,” said Jean Paul Allain, associate director of the department’s Office of Fusion Energy Sciences .

Artificial intelligence (AI) could help turn that goal into a reality.

On the same day that the US Department of Energy announced its national strategy to accelerate the development and commercialization of fusion energy, AI research company Google DeepMind and fusion energy startup Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) announced a research partnership to help accelerate the timeline to deliver fusion energy to the grid.

“The combination of our AI expertise with CFS’s cutting-edge hardware makes this the ideal partnership to advance foundational discoveries in fusion energy for the benefit of the worldwide research community and ultimately, the whole world,” wrote Google DeepMind’s fusion team in a blog post.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has underscored AI’s emerging role by noting its potential to enable breakthroughs in materials science, digital modelling of stellar fusion processes and molecular dynamics. “It’s hard to overstate the catalytic effect of artificial intelligence,” he said.

The global race to deliver fusion power

Fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, promises nearly limitless energy without carbon emissions or long-lived waste, which has excited scientists since the 1950s. While achieving net-energy gain has long been a scientific challenge, progress is accelerating across multiple fronts, putting the technology on the radar of the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Energy Technology Frontiers.

Since the 1980s, 33 nations and thousands of engineers and scientists have collaborated to build and operate a “tokamak” – a magnetic fusion device – as part of the ITER project, the world’s largest fusion experiment.

In parallel, governments, utilities and private industry are expanding the fusion ecosystem. At least 45 companies worldwide are pursuing commercial fusion and the IAEA reports that more than 160 fusion facilities are now operational, under construction or planned. Early power-purchase agreements from end users such as Google, global energy company Eni and Microsoft signal rising industry confidence.

One of the most evident signs that fusion is moving from a scientific experiment to a commercial reality is a milestone noted in the IAEA World Fusion Outlook 2025: the first-ever global modelling of fusion energy deployment.

Conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the study projects that fusion generation will rise from 2 TWh in 2035 to 375 TWh in 2050, reaching nearly 25,000 TWh by 2100. The analysis highlights fusion’s potential to add trillions of dollars to global gross domestic product as demand for clean electricity surges.

The modelling also highlights fusion’s economic value: as demand for clean electricity generation rises, fusion could add trillions of dollars to global gross domestic product, according to the IAEA.

Governments increasingly view fusion as strategic. A recent report from Swiss company EconSight, which tracks technology trends and patents, shows China leading the field, filing 67% of world-class fusion patents between 2016 and 2023, compared to 19% in the US and 5% in Europe.

How AI might help advance plasma physics

Major hurdles remain, however, before fusion becomes a staple of the energy mix. Controlling the plasma in magnetic confinement fusion is challenging, as it must remain confined and within a stable, defined volume for a prolonged period. The heat and pressure cause expansion but any contact with the reactor walls instantly cools it and halts the fusion reaction.

The DeepMind and CFS partnership builds on work using AI to successfully control plasma. With academic partners at the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne), Google showed that deep reinforcement learning can control the magnets of a tokamak to stabilize complex plasma shapes. It also developed TORAX, a fast and differentiable plasma simulator.

DeepMind will now apply these tools to CFS’s programme. Combining TORAX with reinforcement learning or evolutionary search methods such as AlphaEvolve, AI agents can explore vast numbers of operating scenarios, identifying the most efficient pathways to net-energy production.

DeepMind is also developing an AI pilot to control magnetic configurations, optimize fusion power and manage heat load for CFS’s SPARC reactor outside Boston.

CFS aims to bring its first grid-scale fusion plant online in the early 2030s and has already secured off-take agreements from Google and Eni, the latter valued at more than $1 billion. Both companies are also investors. With no materials-resource constraints, CFS says it could scale up to produce up to 1,000 plants per year by 2050.

CFS is racing against Helion, another US fusion startup backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, which plans to bring a fusion power plant online by 2028 and has signed Microsoft as its first off-take partner.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_dpKroRHnD4LCiG8YJK1LhB8GNnYG4_EWLsNX07zUzD0.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 05:59:19.739653

,Indiana and Evs,2025-12-12 07:36:23+00:00,AJU PRESS,SK On–Ford breakup signals Korea's battery pivot to ESS amid EV fog | AJU PRESS,Kim Dong-young,,,,,https://www.ajupress.com/view/20251212154728855,"The company has already set an aggressive ESS roadmap, targeting up to 10 GWh in orders next year by converting EV battery lines at its Tennessee and Georgia plants.
Korean battery makers LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK On are all accelerating the conversion of underutilized EV battery lines into ESS production amid deteriorating visibility for global EV demand.
""ESS battery demand currently stands at about 20 to 25 percent of the EV market, but ESS offers relatively stable structural growth,"" said Chung.
Korean players, however, still lag global leaders: they hold roughly 24 percent of the global EV battery market but less than 10 percent of ESS as of mid-2025.
Chinese manufacturers CATL, Hithium, and EVE Energy dominate the ESS landscape, largely thanks to low-cost LFP production.","SEOUL, December 12 (AJP) - The dissolution of the $11.4 billion battery joint venture between SK On and Ford Motor stands as a stark symbol of the shifting center of gravity in the global battery business — away from electric vehicles and toward energy storage systems (ESS), where surging power demands from AI-driven data centers are rewriting the industry's growth map.

The two companies will formally part ways in the first quarter of 2026, splitting control of three giga factories launched together in 2022. SK On will take full ownership of the 45-gigawatt-hour plant in Stanton, Tennessee, while Ford assumes the twin sites in Glendale, Kentucky, totaling 82 GWh.

The breakup, while abrupt, offers SK On a strategic reset. Freed from exclusive commitments to Ford, it can now supply a broader pool of customers — particularly utilities, hyperscale data-center operators, and ESS integrators repositioning for the grid-scale storage boom. The shift also reflects Ford's own retreat: its EV unit has lost more than $5 billion this year, prompting the automaker to delay mass production of its next-generation electric pickup to 2028.

Strategic Reset

The restructuring sharply improves SK On's balance sheet. Nearly 10 trillion won ($6.7 billion) in BlueOval SK liabilities currently sit on SK On's consolidated financials. The separation will transfer roughly half of that debt off its books, reducing annual interest expenses by about 250 billion won while giving SK On full access to U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) production tax credits.

The company has already set an aggressive ESS roadmap, targeting up to 10 GWh in orders next year by converting EV battery lines at its Tennessee and Georgia plants. Mass production of LFP-based ESS cells is slated for the second half of 2026.

Korean battery makers LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, and SK On are all accelerating the conversion of underutilized EV battery lines into ESS production amid deteriorating visibility for global EV demand. At the same time, hyperscale data centers — driven by rising AI workloads — are consuming electricity at unprecedented levels, turning grid-scale batteries into a cornerstone of power-stability infrastructure.

""EV batteries face strict weight and volume constraints that demand high energy density and output, but ESS units are stationary installations with relatively fewer space limitations,"" said Chung Won-suk, an analyst at iM Securities.

SK On is separately converting its Stellantis joint venture plant in Indiana into an ESS-dedicated facility targeting 30 GWh of annual capacity by end-2025. Utilization at the plant has dropped below 50 percent amid Stellantis' EV pullback following the phaseout of U.S. federal purchase subsidies in September.

ESS Momentum

Samsung SDI is in advanced talks to supply Tesla with about 3 trillion won in ESS batteries over three years — roughly 10 GWh annually — marking what could be the company's first large-scale alliance with the world's dominant ESS integrator.

LG Energy Solution, which already supplies Tesla with 20 GWh of LFP cells a year, is negotiating to raise that volume by 50 percent to 30 GWh. Combined, Korean suppliers would deliver 40 GWh annually to Tesla, substantially widening the EV maker's diversification away from Chinese giants CATL and BYD.

SNE Research projects the global ESS market to expand more than sixfold from 185 GWh in 2023 to 1,232 GWh by 2035. Unlike EVs — where demand is vulnerable to consumer sentiment, macro cycles, subsidies, and policy swings — ESS growth is driven by structural factors: renewable-energy penetration, grid stability requirements, and escalating data-center loads.

""ESS battery demand currently stands at about 20 to 25 percent of the EV market, but ESS offers relatively stable structural growth,"" said Chung. ""That is why its sustainability is rated more highly than EVs.""

Korean players, however, still lag global leaders: they hold roughly 24 percent of the global EV battery market but less than 10 percent of ESS as of mid-2025. Chinese manufacturers CATL, Hithium, and EVE Energy dominate the ESS landscape, largely thanks to low-cost LFP production.

U.S.–China tech rivalry is simultaneously creating an opening. The IRA grants significant tax credits for ESS made with U.S.-produced components, giving Korean manufacturers — already operating large-scale facilities across North America — an edge at a time when Chinese firms face steep trade barriers.

Korean automakers themselves are shifting more of their product portfolios toward LFP. Though LFP offers lower energy density than nickel-based NCM batteries, it is roughly 30 percent cheaper and more durable under extreme temperatures and long operating cycles — characteristics ideal for storage systems and affordable EVs alike.

LG Energy Solution began LFP production at its Michigan plant in June and plans to expand North American ESS capacity to 30 GWh by 2026. Its joint venture with Stellantis in Canada is also reallocating parts of its NCM lines toward ESS.

Separately this week, LG Energy Solution announced a $1.4 billion EV battery contract with Mercedes-Benz, believed by analysts to involve LFP cells targeting mid-priced models — another sign of Europe's pivot away from high-cost chemistries.

Samsung SDI also unveiled a multiyear, 2-trillion-won ESS contract with a U.S. energy developer, representing roughly 15 percent of its annual revenue and marking its first substantial move into the LFP segment long dominated by Chinese rivals.

While LFP appears ascendant, Korean engineers are betting that NCM technology could reclaim market share once it further reduces costs and demonstrates superior safety and energy performance.

""Provided that NCM batteries can prove technical sovereignty over LFP and cut prices, we believe the market will eventually sway back to safer and durable nickel variants in the long run,"" said Kim Sung-soo, head of smart batteries at Pai Chai University.

,EPA,2025-12-12 07:16:47+00:00,Coastal Review,Public hearing Tuesday on proposed 'WOTUS' definition | Coastal Review,Jennifer Allen,,,,,https://coastalreview.org/2025/12/public-hearing-tuesday-on-proposed-wotus-definition/,"Expanded in the 1970s, the measure is typically referred to as the Clean Water Act.
“It’s only things that meet the definition of waters of the United States, and that isn’t defined in the statute itself,” Sabath continued.
“Importantly, this analysis relies on wetland ‘wetness’ during the growing season, but the proposed rule uses the ‘wet season,’” Gold said.
“The agencies proposed ‘wet season’ dataset classifies most of the year, and in some cases the entire year, as ‘wet’ for much of coastal North Carolina.
Carey sees the proposed rule as demonstrating “that the EPA has abdicated its mandated responsibility to protect the environment and the people who depend on it.","The two federal branches that enforce the Clean Water Act last month pitched changes to the “waters of the United States” definition, which establishes the types of waterbodies that are federally protected against pollution, and if these amendments pass as written, conservation groups fear millions of acres of nontidal wetlands will be left vulnerable.

The Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers have for decades had the authority to regulate “navigable waters,” which means “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,” as written in the 1948 Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Expanded in the 1970s, the measure is typically referred to as the Clean Water Act.

The EPA explains on its website that the Clean Water Act “establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters.”

One thing the Clean Water Act doesn’t do is clearly define “waters of the United States.” The EPA calls it a “threshold term in the Clean Water Act and establishes the geographic scope of federal jurisdiction under the Act.”

EPA and Army leadership announced Nov. 17 plans to update the definition, which has been the subject of lawsuits and years’ worth of arguments.

The “Updated Definition of ‘’Waters of the United States’’’ was published Nov. 20 in the Federal Register, launching a 45-day comment period on the proposed changes that closes Jan. 5. A virtual public meeting is scheduled for 12:30 to 4 p.m. Tuesday, with a 2-2:30 p.m. break. Attendees must register online to speak by 5 p.m. Monday. To listen only, register by the start of the meeting.

This latest attempt, which would exclude isolated wetlands, is directly linked to the Supreme Court’s May 2023 Sackett v. EPA decision. The Sacketts are an Idaho couple fined in the late 2000s for backfilling a section of their property that the EPA considered wetlands.

Judges ruled in the final opinion on the case that the “(Clean Water Act)’s use of ‘waters’” only refers to geographical features described in everyday language “as ‘streams, oceans, rivers and lakes’ and to adjacent wetlands that are ‘indistinguishable’ from those bodies of water due to a continuous surface connection.”

Earlier that year, the EPA had finalized a “Revised Definition of ‘Waters of the United States'” rule that took effect March 20, 2023, and which the Sackett case invalidated. In August 2023, the EPA and Army Corps issued an amendment to align the rule with the Sackett decision.

That final conforming rule is what the EPA and Army Corps leadership are proposing to amend.

The agencies argue that the change “would fully implement” the Supreme Court’s ruling “by ensuring federal jurisdiction is focused on relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water—such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes—and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such waterbodies.”

With this proposed rule, the agencies explain in the docket, they “intend to provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency by clarifying the definition of ‘waters of the United States.’ This proposed rule is also intended to implement the overall objective of the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the quality of the Nation’s waters while respecting State and Tribal authority over their own land and water resources.”

Environmental groups argued then, when the Sackett case was ruled, and still maintain that by removing protections from the millions of acres of nontidal wetlands, there will be consequences: Water quality will be jeopardized and flooding will increase, to name just two.

Southern Environmental Law Center Senior Attorney Mark Sabath said in an interview that for 50 years, the Clean Water Act has been the strongest and best federal protection for many of the waters and wetlands around the country.

The law does that “by saying you can’t pollute, you can’t fill, you can’t destroy certain features, certain waters, without a permit,” Sabath said, and the permitting process means that there are certain protections and controls you have to apply to minimize the amount of destruction.

Sabath added that a number of features of the Clean Water Act are dependent on the type of water, and, in addressing its critics, not every puddle in the country covered by the act.

“It’s only things that meet the definition of waters of the United States, and that isn’t defined in the statute itself,” Sabath continued. “Congress didn’t define it, so EPA and the Army Corps, in a series of rules over the years, have tried to define exactly what wetlands are and aren’t covered by the Clean Water Act.”

This proposed rule is the latest revision and it is “by far the most narrow, the most extreme definition,” Sabath continued. “It includes the fewest number of streams and wetlands and other waters of any interpretation of ‘waters the United States’ that we’ve seen.”

North Carolina Wildlife Federation Conservation Policy Vice President Manley Fuller told Coastal Review that with this proposed rule, the bottom line is a massive loss of protection of waters of the United States, which are vital habitats for fish and wildlife.

“This will also negatively affect hunting and fishing, which are a significant part of our natural resource-based economy,” he continued. “Wetlands are also buffers for the built environment and help reduce downstream flooding. Protecting clean waters and wetlands is extremely popular with the public for many reasons and we need to strengthen rather than weaken these programs.”

North Carolina Sierra Club Deputy Director Erin Carey told Coastal Review the rule will effectively remove federal protections from at least 80% of wetlands and over 5 million miles of streams across the country.

“This rule will open millions of acres of wetlands to the threat of development, leaving communities already vulnerable to flooding without the frontline protection afforded by these invaluable habitats. Wetlands act as filters for floodwaters and other runoff, making them critical not only to flood mitigation, but to the preservation of clean water resources,” Carey said.

Environmental Defense Fund Coasts and Watersheds Science Senior Manager Dr. Adam Gold pointed out as well that if the proposed rule is implemented as written, nearly all nontidal wetlands and intermittent streams could be without Clean Water Act protections in North Carolina and across the United States.

While there are many changes in the proposed rule, the most notable are to the definitions of “relative permanence” of waters and a “continuous surface connection” for wetlands, Gold said, adding that the proposed language introduces the concept of a “wet season.”

“Under the proposed rule, wetlands and waters would only receive Clean Water Act protections if they have surface water throughout the ‘wet season,’ described in the rule as ‘an extended period where there is continuous surface hydrology resulting from predictable seasonal precipitation patterns year after year,’” Gold said. “This proposed rule would make it easier to drain or develop wetlands that do not meet the ‘wet season’ surface water requirement, putting our wetlands and the benefits they provide at serious risk.”

In North Carolina, the impact of the proposed rule is 3.2 million acres, or about 88%, of nontidal wetlands estimated to be without Clean Water Act protections. “Importantly, this analysis relies on wetland ‘wetness’ during the growing season, but the proposed rule uses the ‘wet season,’” Gold said.

About the wet season, Gold continued, there are “fundamental issues with the proposed rule’s ‘wet season’ dataset.”

He said the classification of the “wet season” comes from the Army Corps of Engineers Antecedent Precipitation Tool, but the underlying data this tool relies on is modeled using the average monthly temperature and precipitation between 1950 and 1999. The modeled dataset was published in 2001 and does not use the best-available methods.

“The agencies proposed ‘wet season’ dataset classifies most of the year, and in some cases the entire year, as ‘wet’ for much of coastal North Carolina. So, under this proposed rule, wetlands or streams in Jacksonville would need to have surface water year-round (the whole year is classified as ‘wet’) to have Clean Water Act protections. For New Bern, the ‘wet season’ is 11 months, and for Wilmington or Brunswick County, the ‘wet season’ is 10 months.”

Gold said the proposed rule “which could essentially remove nontidal wetland and intermittent waters from the Clean Water Act, does not align with the goal of the Clean Water Act to ‘restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters.’ Science shows us that all wetlands, regardless of how ‘wet’ they are, clean our water, provide critical wildlife habitat, and reduce downstream flooding impacts.”

The EPA and Corps also asserted the week the proposed changes were announced that the new rules would provide “the regulatory certainty needed to support our nation’s farmers who feed and fuel the world and advance EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.”

Sabath noted that the idea that this will have huge benefits for farming and for farmers is a common refrain when they’re restricting the protections of the Clean Water Act, “but the Clean Water Act actually exempts most farming activities from coverage already, so you don’t need to get a permit for doing regular farming activities, even when they would affect a wetland or stream that would otherwise be covered.”

The idea that this is a huge benefit for farmers is a nicer story, “because they don’t want to say, well, this is a huge benefit for large industrial facilities, industrial polluters, developers,” Sabath said.

Carey sees the proposed rule as demonstrating “that the EPA has abdicated its mandated responsibility to protect the environment and the people who depend on it. Even worse, the agency appears eager to sacrifice our natural resources on the altar of corporate greed.”

The public should be “very concerned that the federal agency tasked with ensuring clean water, clean air, and the protection of our natural environment seems determined to undermine that responsibility. With this proposed change, the EPA claims to seek clarity in regulation, but this rule would serve only to allow industry to profit from environmental destruction, and the ruination of our natural resources,” she added.

White Oak Waterkeeper Riley Lewis said in a statement that the EPA’s new definition of Waters of the United States ignores decades of scientific understanding and generations of Indigenous knowledge.

“By redefining wetlands using ambiguous criteria seemingly designed to maximize developable land and reduce regulatory barriers, the agency is turning a blind eye to the very real, very predictable impacts on our communities,” Lewis said. “Water will continue to move beneath our feet through groundwater and across the landscape during storms, regardless of a federal definition or a construction permit. This rule sets Americans up for flooding, damaged infrastructure, and increased pollution in the waters we rely on for our drinking supply, our food, and our way of life.”

So, why does this actually matter to the public? Sabath said it does in a few ways.

In North Carolina, people who hunt, fish and paddle use wetlands directly and those might be impacted by being destroyed or polluted without a permit.

“Anyone who is in a community that floods during extreme weather, and we all know that that’s happening more and more now, or that’s at risk of flooding,” Sabath said. By losing those wetlands, you lose their ability to protect communities from flooding, and that comes more often now from extreme weather.

“It’s a double whammy. You’re losing the benefits that they provide, and you’re probably creating more problems,” and more potential pollution or channels of pollution at the same time by replacing wetlands, natural areas with pavement or developed areas, he said.

With wetlands being a “good natural sponge” that can absorb huge amounts of water, “if anything, we should be trying to expand wetland coverage rather than take it away, Sabath said.

“In short,” Carey with the Sierra Club continued, “communities will watch rivers and streams in their communities fall victim to unchecked pollution. Without federal protections, industry will discharge and develop at will, destroying habitats, water quality, and flood protection measures as they go. The wetlands and streams of this country belong to all people, not just those who seek to exploit them.”",https://coastalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/brunswick-wetlands.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 04:58:39.290990

U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-ND, will host the session, the first sessions on WOTUS held nationally.

This public meeting is being offered virtually and in person at Bavendick Stateroom at Bismarck State College. To enter the facility, bring a valid ID issued by the federal government or a state (e.g., driver’s license). Those planning to attend are encouraged to pre-register online at the U.S. EPA website and also register to watch the livestream of the meeting. The livestream also will be available at Cramer’s YouTube page.

The first session will be from 9:30-11 a.m. with Cramer; Gov. Kelly Armstrong; U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, R-ND; Jess Kramer, U.S. EPA assistant administrator; and Lee Forsgren, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Army (Civil Works).

The second session will be from 11:15 a.m.-1 p.m. with Wes Brooks, U.S. EPA deputy assistant administrator for Water; and Forsgren.

On Nov. 17, the agencies announced a proposed rule revising the definition of WOTUS to follow the clear direction of the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA while eliminating red tape, cutting permitting costs and lowering the cost of doing business in communities across the country. The agencies based the proposal on public input gathered during nine pre-proposal listening sessions, and now EPA and Army will engage further with the public during the formal rulemaking process.

“North Dakotans know the impacts of a good WOTUS rule better than anyone,” Cramer, chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, said. “This listening session is a great opportunity for North Dakotans to help craft the final rule and bring their feedback directly to EPA and Army Corps officials.

Whether through mass layoffs, targeted office closures, including environmental justice programs, or the rejection or rollback of regulation of key pollutants, the EPA is an agency being all but wound down, critics charge.

In July, the EPA said it was cutting nearly a billion dollars in funding from its own operations, claiming a few months later that states will fill expected regulatory gaps.

Yet many states—mostly those led by Republicans—were already dramatically defunding their own environmental enforcement operations, a new report from the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) finds.

Since 2010, lawmakers in Texas have reduced the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) by 33 percent after adjusting for inflation, according to the EIP report released on Wednesday. TCEQ also now has to contend with 401 more facilities that need pollution regulation despite no increases to staff in over ten years.

“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” Kathryn Guerra, Public Citizen’s TCEQ campaign director and a former EPA and TCEQ employee, said in a press conference on Wednesday.

Mississippi has cut its own environmental regulatory agency by nearly 80 percent during that same time period.

Graphics via EIP report, “State of Decline: Cuts to State Pollution Control Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA.”

In Gulf states broadly, this abandoning of regulatory obligations to protect the environment and public health is happening against a backdrop of a massive buildout of liquefied natural gas export facilities.

In Texas, for instance, where most of the nation’s oil and gas exports now exit the nation, the TCEQ doesn’t have enough people to deal with the increasing amount of new oil and gas projects and those that are developing, report authors found. Nor can the agency regulate those that are violating their permits.

Of course, the Trump administration and Texas’s Republican leadership support the proliferation of these projects. Trump has latched onto fracked gas as a key aspect of his “unleashing American energy” agenda, which is solely directed at sustaining the oil and gas industry as renewables become more used globally.

In September 2024, the Texas Legislature approved 67 full-time positions for TCEQ’s budget for 2026 and 2027, along with $47.7 million in additional funding. But the regulator had asked for 157 positions and $60 million dollars to keep up with the state’s growth. The EIP report authors note that these increases don’t significantly change the “long term trend” of TCEQ’s budget.

“It really means that there are less people on the ground to ensure that companies are following the law,” Jen Duggan, EIP’s executive director, said on a press call rolling out the report on Wednesday. “It may take longer, once a violation is identified, to actually resolve that violation and bring that company back into compliance with the law.”

Residents near these projects find themselves filling in for missing regulators by necessity, documenting apparent violations and filing reports for investigations that frequently never follow,as seen with liquified natural gas (LNG) export plants in Louisiana. In October, EIP released a report detailing that every operating LNG plant–7 in all–in the United States had violated their air permits at least once in the last five years. Five of them had also violated their water permits.

“Proactive investigations and the oversight responsibility ultimately falls to the community and that should never be the case,” Guerra said.

LNG export plants are not the only things that are facing less regulatory attention. Last month, the Trump administration also directed the EPA to lessen its standards for soot pollution, wetland and threatened species protections.

This year the EPA announced it was cutting nearly 4,000 positions from the agency. Some of the agency’s departing researchers have gone into the private sector, creating a “brain drain” from the EPA that was critical in responding to environmental disasters like the 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.",https://d3l0i86vhnepo5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/11115507/p8IRBMTg.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:03:42.383609

(WANE) — A public forum to discuss the newly operational Google data center opened the conversation to the general public on Thursday evening to shed light on everything the data center will bring to the area.

“This is an opportunity for us to hit the reset button, quite frankly, in our relationship with the community,” Broderick Green, Public Affairs Manager for Google, said. ‘This is a long time coming, quite frankly, it’s long overdue.”

Google announced Thursday morning that the first installment of the data center is officially operational, and detailed its plans for the community ahead of the evening’s public forum.

Representatives from Google, Indiana Michigan Power, City of Fort Wayne Utilities, and Greater Fort Wayne Inc. held the forum at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne. Each entity came equipped with presentations with the intention of providing more information on the data center.

Google touched on similar topics that appeared in a press release, emphasizing community outreach and engagement. It also revealed to many that this operational data center is the first of three on its campus, with the second and third well on the way. Google detailed its objectives for its energy usage and pledged to replenish 120% of its water use as well.

In the presentation, the slide read, “Google will replenish 120% of the water we consume, on average, across our offices and data centers. We’ll focus our efforts in water scarce regions to support those who need it most. Peer reviewed water risk framework to establish responsible water use guardrails. Our approach to cooling is ‘localized’ selecting the best technology based on location specific attributes and minimizing climate impacts.”

Representatives also explained the Hatchworks Air Permit Requirements, where the initial request for a permit from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) included just 34 generators, but the current permit modification includes 179 generators. The presentation notes that these emergency backup generators “only use a fraction of the permitted emissions limit,” and that these generators are solely for emergency use, yearly maintenance, and limited other needs.

Sarah Hoffman, a representative of Google for Environmental Compliance, said, that these generators are “permitted for only emergency use. We do not run them for anything else. They are not run 24/7, as the questions been asked multiple times.”

“We run them only for maintenance that’s required. We have to run them for maintenance to ensure that they’re going to operate if we do have a power outage, and that backup power.”

Ashley Savieo, Director of Economic Development at Indiana Michigan Power, noted that although the data center operating in Fort Wayne is considered a “large load” customer, residents in the area will not feel any impacts or pay for any additional power usage. In fact, users can expect to see rates go down over time.

“Indiana Michigan Power has ample capacity to serve Google while also continuing to provide reliable service to our over 600,000 customers across Indiana and Michigan,” she said. “So large users like Google actually help stabilize costs by spreading the fixed costs of operating and maintaining our system across a larger customer base, we create downward pressure on rates over time.”

Savieo mentioned that I&M and Google have entered an agreement to protect their user base from dramatic cost shifts if Google were to halt operations in Fort Wayne. She delved into detail in her presentation on the industrial tariff rates that have been placed on Google, ensuring that residents would not be impacted.

“If Google were to leave unexpectedly, safeguards and penalties are in place that prevent those costs from being shifted onto other customers. So to be clear, Google is not receiving any rate discounts from Indiana Michigan Power. They pay the same industrial tariff rates as any industrial customer would, that is, on our system today.”

Savieo detailed that data centers do not cause blackouts in their communities, and that I&M is positive that the grid has adequate capacity.

“We hear your concerns, and they do matter to us,” said Savieo, “Many of our employees right here in Fort Wayne, they’re your neighbors.”

The City of Fort Wayne Utilities Deputy Director Matthew Wirtz echoed Savieo’s remarks, saying that the utilitarian costs of the Google data center would not negatively impact citizens. In fact, having a large utility user like Google could, over time, decrease the rates that residents pay.

“Adding large users provides downward pressure, additional revenue for our system, and thus helping us keep rates down for everybody. Just as an example, the top 10 water users or customers for Fort Wayne seated utilities, they pay 10% of our water revenue. So, 10 customers paid 10% we have 110,000 customers, 10 of them are paying for 10% of the water revenue of our system.”

Wirtz also noted that Google does not, and will not be charged a special rate, and will pay similarly to any other industrial resident.

Green explained that Google is not just operating in Fort Wayne, but wants to invest in the community.

Green said, “We now operate here. It isn’t a matter of being some sort of an outsider moving in. We want to become integrated into what’s going on on a day-to-day basis in any community that we’re operating in. Fort Wayne is no different.”

Green showed that Google plans to work with and support organizations such as Fort Wayne Early Learning Center, Amani Family Services, Fort Wayne Urban League, Ivy Tech Community College, Fort Wayne Blue Jackets, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, and many more. Green stated that Google wants to invest in schools and learning workforce programs, including East Allen County Schools (EACS) and Fort Wayne Community Schools (FWCS), as well as the Skilled Trades and Readiness (STAR) program, AI Fellowship for Community Changemakers, and partnerships with Ivy Tech.

City of Fort Wayne Community Development Director Jonathon Leist announced that millions of dollars would be reinvested into the community, saying that “all of these funds are available because of the data center.” Leist outlined that $2 million has been committed by Fort Wayne Redevelopment Commission to expand early childcare services, $4 million in land sales has been pledged to the Connected Neighborhoods Initiative, $2 million in land sales is pledged to the design of new park spaces at the former Pepsi Distribution Center on the Riverfront, and TIF revenue will support an annual grants to EACS over the next 25 years.

Despite the hours-long presentation, many citizens who attended remain apprehensive of the data center, and many disapprove of it altogether.

Debera Kuntz, a concerned citizen, said, “These platforms that they’re trying to give us. It just seems more of a method to placate everyone than to actually answer questions or try to do anything like with the diesel generators. We asked, Can you do something more sustainable?

The case, American Efficient LLC v. FERC,1 addresses whether FERC's process for assessing and enforcing penalties for alleged violations of the Federal Power Act (FPA) conflicts with the Seventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution. On a motion for preliminary injunction, the district court ruled2 that this enforcement framework likely does not violate the company's constitutional right to a jury trial, because the statute allows for de novo judicial review before any penalty can be enforced against the company, including de novo review by the court of any facts found by the agency. The district court case now proceeds toward a final ruling on the merits of American Efficient's constitutional claims.3 The administrative proceeding before FERC, which was not stayed during the district court litigation, also continues. The next step is for the Commission to issue its order deciding whether to impose civil penalties or other remedies against American Efficient.

Though not the final say on the matter, for now, the district court's ruling means that FERC enforcement proceedings under the FPA can move forward under the current procedural framework, reducing litigation risk to the agency.4 Notably, the district court rejected American Efficient's argument that its constitutional rights are effectively undermined by first having to undergo a lengthy administrative proceeding before the opportunity for a jury trial arises. While the court's ruling on this issue appears supported by analogous precedents, it is not binding on other courts. In light of recent decisions from the Supreme Court that have tended to narrow agency authority, it is possible other courts might be more receptive to similar arguments. And as discussed further below, the district court did not address American Efficient's additional constitutional challenge to FERC's structure as an independent agency, an issue that will almost certainly be impacted by litigation involving a recently terminated Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner that is currently before the Supreme Court.

Case Background

American Efficient is a distributed energy efficiency resources aggregator that participated in capacity auctions in PJM and MISO. Following a three-year investigation, in December 2024, FERC issued an Order to Show Cause, alleging that American Efficient engaged in market manipulation and violated the terms of the PJM and MISO tariffs and directing the company to show cause why it should not be liable for $722 million in civil penalties and disgorgement of over $250 million in unjust profits.

In response to the Order, American Efficient filed a complaint and concurrent motion for preliminary injunction, alleging that FERC's Order and the proceedings against American Efficient violate the Seventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution.

SEC v. Jarkesy and Jury Trial Rights in Enforcement Actions for Civil Penalties

American Efficient argued that FERC's enforcement proceedings run afoul of the U.S. Supreme Court's June 2024 ruling in SEC v. Jarkesy.5Jarkesy, which we previously discussed here,6 held that the SEC's adjudication of enforcement actions before in-house administrative law judges (ALJs) violated Jarkesy's right to a jury trial and separation-of-powers principles. Key to the reasoning in Jarkesy was that securities fraud enforcement actions resemble traditional common law claims (fraud), and that the civil penalties the SEC sought to impose were punitive in nature, a type of remedy traditionally available only in courts of law (as opposed to equity or admiralty courts). Jarkesy held that the Constitution prohibits Congress and agencies from forcing defendants to submit to adjudication of this kind of case outside of the Article III courts and without the opportunity for a trial by jury.

American Efficient argued that FERC's enforcement proceedings are substantially similar to the SEC's proceedings in Jarkesy, and that assessment of a civil penalty in proceedings before the agency would violate American Efficient's right to a jury trial.

While the district court agreed that FERC enforcement actions implicate the right to a trial by jury,7 it ruled that FERC's procedures are critically distinct from those in Jarkesy and satisfy constitutional requirements. As provided by statute,8 when FERC seeks to assess a civil penalty for alleged violations under the Federal Power Act (FPA),9 it must provide notice to the subject of that penalty, who may then choose whether to proceed to an initial adjudication before an ALJ, or instead elect an ""accelerated"" proceeding directly before the Commission. Under the latter option, if FERC ultimately imposes a penalty, the subject can force FERC to initiate litigation in federal district court to enforce the penalty. FERC's decision assessing the civil penalty is then subject to full de novo judicial review, including fact-finding by the court and a trial by jury. The court held these procedures sufficient to satisfy American Efficient's right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment.

American Efficient argued that these procedures were not constitutionally sufficient, because in order to get a jury trial, the company first had to participate in costly and time-consuming agency proceedings, wait until FERC issues a civil penalty order, and then wait further for FERC to initiate judicial proceedings to enforce that order—a process that can potentially take years. The District Court rejected that argument, citing recent precedents from the FCC context and reasoning that because no final legal rights are determined or payments awarded before the district court litigation takes place, there is no violation of the company's Seventh Amendment rights.

Lingering Question About FERC's Structure as an Independent Agency

Though not addressed by the court's ruling on the preliminary injunction, American Efficient's complaint also challenges the structure of FERC itself, arguing that statutory removal protections for FERC Commissioners violate the separation of powers and Article II of the Constitution. This claim parallels recent litigation involving the Trump administration's terminations of heads of other independent agencies without cause, and the continued vitality (or not) of the Supreme Court's 1935 decision in Humphrey's Executor, which Steptoe has previously written about here.10 In Humphrey's Executor, the Supreme Court affirmed limits on the President's power to remove Commissioners of the FTC, which Congress established as an independent agency.

Like the FTC, FERC is structured as an independent agency: by law, its Commissioners serve staggered, five-year terms, and no more than three Commissioners may belong to a single political party. The President's termination of former FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter is currently being challenged before the Supreme Court in Trump v. Slaughter. Whether Humphrey's Executor remains good law is squarely at issue in that case, as Steptoe has previously discussed here.11 Proponents of maintaining the independent structure of agencies such as FERC argue that it provides a measure of insulation from day-to-day political pressures and fosters stability and continuity.12 The scope of the Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. Slaughter could have significant implications for FERC's continued status as an independent agency. Oral argument in the case took place on December 8, 2025.

7. Like the securities fraud claim in Jarkesy, the District Court found that FERC's market manipulation claims resemble a traditional common law action for fraud, and that FERC's civil penalties are a punitive remedy traditionally available only in courts of law. The court also rejected an intervenor's argument that FERC's claim for tariff violations was a creature of the regulatory regime that had no common law analog and fell within the limited ""public rights"" exception to the jury trial right discussed in Jarkesy. Instead, the court found that the alleged tariff violations resemble traditional common law actions for breach of contract.

9. American Efficient involved alleged violations of the FPA.

Statement of Administrative Policy Regarding the Process for Assessing Civil Penalties, 117 FERC ¶ 61,317, at PP 6-7 (2006). This issue came to a head in post-Jarkesy litigation in a long-running NGA enforcement proceeding in Total Gas & Power North America, Inc., 188 FERC ¶ 61,197 at PP 5-6 (2024). There, FERC issued an order holding the proceedings in abeyance, declaring that FERC would not subject Total to any penalties on the basis of administrative proceedings before an ALJ and stating that FERC would be assessing its enforcement procedures in light of Jarkesy. (FERC subsequently settled the case for a fraction of the penalty amount in its original Order to Show Cause.) We are not aware of any pronouncement to date by the Commission regarding changes to enforcement procedures under the NGA to comply with Jarkesy, and it is possible new legislation would be required to enact any such changes.

Then Trump shifted guidance.,Chris Bowling,,,,,https://flatwaterfreepress.org/the-epa-was-considering-a-massive-lead-cleanup-in-omaha-then-trump-shifted-guidance/,"If regional EPA officials applied the administration’s guidance to the Omaha site, over 13,000 more properties in Omaha could have qualified, a Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica analysis of EPA and City of Omaha soil tests found.

Under the guidance, the EPA could issue a lower standard for the Omaha site.
When it came to the yard, her property tested for lead levels above the Biden guidance but didn’t qualify under the original cleanup threshold.

The county health worker scanned the Omaha home with an X-ray gun, searching for the poison.

It was 2022, and doctors had recently found high levels of lead in the blood of Crystalyn Prine’s 2-year-old son, prompting the Douglas County Health Department to investigate. The worker said it didn’t seem to come from the walls, where any lead would be buried under layers of smooth paint. The lead assessor swabbed the floors for dust but didn’t find answers as to how Prine’s son had been exposed.

A danger did lurk outside, the worker told her. For more than a century, a smelter and other factories had spewed lead-laced smoke across the city’s east side, leading the federal government to declare a huge swath of Omaha a Superfund site and to dig up and replace nearly 14,000 yards — including about a third of the east side’s residential properties — since 1999.

Prine looked up the soil tests for her home online and discovered her yard contained potentially harmful levels of lead. But when she called the city, officials told her that her home didn’t qualify for government-funded cleanup under the standard in place from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Prine didn’t want to move out of the home that had been in her husband’s family for generations. So she followed the county’s advice to keep her five kids safe. They washed their hands frequently and took off their shoes when they came inside.

Then, Prine heard some news at the clinic where she worked as a nurse that gave her hope: In January 2024, the EPA under President Joe Biden lowered the lead levels that could trigger cleanup. Her home was above the new threshold.

That didn’t automatically mean her yard would be cleaned up, local officials told her, but last year, the EPA began to study the possibility of cleaning up tens of thousands of more yards in Omaha, according to emails and other records obtained by the Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica. The agency was also discussing with local officials whether to expand the cleanup area to other parts of Omaha and its surrounding suburbs.

Then, this October, the Trump administration rolled back the Biden administration’s guidance. In doing so, it tripled the amount of lead that had to be in the soil to warrant a potential cleanup, meaning that Prine and other families might again be out of luck.

Prine’s son Jack, now 5, struggles to speak. He talks less than his 2-year-old brother and stumbles over five-word sentences.

“You would think that if lead is this impactful on a small child, that you would definitely want to be fixing it,” she said. “What do you do as a parent? I don’t want to keep my kid from playing outside. He loves playing outside, and I should be able to do that in my own yard.”

Scientists have long agreed about the dangers of lead. The toxic metal can get into kids’ brains and nervous systems, causing IQ loss and developmental delays. Experts say the Trump administration’s guidance runs counter to decades of research: In the 26 years since the government began to clean up east Omaha — the largest residential lead Superfund site in the country — scientists have found harm at ever lower levels of exposure.

Yet what gets cleaned up is often not just a matter of science but also money and government priorities, according to experts who have studied the Superfund program.

Prine’s block illustrates how widespread Omaha’s lead problem is and how many people who might have benefited from the Biden guidance may no longer get relief. Of the 11 homes on her block, four were cleaned up by the EPA. Six others tested below the original cleanup standard but above the levels in the Biden guidance and were never remediated.

The Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica are embarking on a yearlong project about Omaha’s lead legacy, including testing soil to find out how effective the cleanup has been. If you live in or near the affected area, you can sign up for free lead testing of your soil.

Despite the changing guidance, Omaha still follows a cleanup standard set in 2009: Properties qualify for cleanup if parts of the yard have more than 400 parts per million of lead in the soil — the equivalent of a marble in a 10-pound bucket of dirt. The Biden administration lowered the guidance for so-called removal management levels to 200 parts per million.

The Trump administration has said its new guidance, which raised them to 600 parts per million, would speed cleanups by providing clearer direction and streamlining investigations of contaminated sites. But environmental advocates said it only accelerates project completion by cleaning up fewer properties.

The EPA disputed that. “Protecting communities from lead exposure at contaminated sites is EPA’s statutory responsibility and a top priority for the Trump EPA,” the agency said in a statement. “The criticism that our Residential Soil Lead Directive will result in EPA doing less is false.”

The new guidance doesn’t necessarily scrap the hopes of Omaha homeowners or the conversations that were happening around the Biden recommendations. That’s because the Trump administration continues to allow EPA managers to study properties with lower levels of lead, depending on how widespread the contamination is and how likely people are to be harmed. What actually gets cleaned up is decided by local EPA officials, who can set remediation levels higher or lower based on the circumstances of specific sites.

Regional EPA spokesperson Kellen Ashford said the agency is continuing to assess the Omaha site and will meet with local and state leaders to “chart a path forward with how the updated residential lead directive may apply.”

Gabriel Filippelli, executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute, has studied lead and Superfund sites for decades and said he is doubtful the EPA will spend the money to clean up more yards in Omaha. The EPA doesn’t act if “you don’t have local people raising alarm bells,” he said.

Yet in Omaha, many are unaware of the debate — or even the presence of lead in their yards. Most of the cleanup happened more than a decade ago. As years passed, new people moved in, and younger residents never learned about the site. Others who did know assumed the lead problem was solved. The dustup around lead has mostly settled even if much of the toxic metal in the city’s dirt never left.

‘Mass poison’

When Prine moved into Omaha’s Field Club neighborhood in 2018, she loved the Queen Anne and Victorian-style homes that lined shady boulevards and how her neighbors decorated heavily for Halloween and Christmas.

While she had visited the home previously to see her husband’s family, Prine had no idea her neighborhood was in the middle of a massive environmental cleanup.

“The first time I heard about it was when my son had an elevated blood-lead level,” she said.

From 1870 to 1997, the American Smelting and Refining Company sat on the Missouri River in downtown Omaha, melting and refining so much lead to make batteries, cover cables and enrich gasoline that it was once the largest operation in the country, according to a 1949 newspaper article.

By the 1970s, researchers had proven lead was poisoning American children. Doctors in Omaha noticed kids with elevated blood-lead levels and published findings connecting the toxic metal in their bodies to the smoke pouring out of ASARCO and other polluters.

In the late 1990s, when city leaders wanted to demolish ASARCO and redevelop the site into a riverfront park, they had to figure out how to clean up Omaha’s lead legacy. They turned to the EPA, which declared a 27-square-mile swath of east Omaha a Superfund site, a federal designation that would allow the agency to clean up the contamination and try to hold the polluters responsible to pay for it.

The agency estimated the smelter, along with other polluters, had spewed about 400 million pounds of lead dust over an area, where 125,000 people, including 14,000 young children, lived.

The EPA won $246 million in settlements from ASARCO and others to fund the cleanup.

By 2015, most of the yards that tested above 400 parts per million had their soil replaced, and the EPA handed the remaining work to the city. The old smelter site was redeveloped into a science museum with a playground outside.

The project seemed like a success. The number of kids testing high for lead has dropped dramatically since the 1990s, though similar patterns exist nationwide and fewer than half the kids in the site are tested annually, according to data from the Douglas County Health Department.

But evidence had already been emerging that the cleanup levels the EPA had set in Omaha “may not protect children,” which the agency acknowledged in 2019, during the first Trump administration. Managers wrote in a site review that “increasing evidence supports a lower blood-lead level of concern” than the 1994 health guidance that informed the cleanup plan.

Lead, even in incredibly small amounts, can build up in the brains, bones or organs of children as well as adults, said Bruce Lanphear, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who has studied lead for decades.

“Lead represents the largest mass poison in human history,” he said.

After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered its blood-lead level standard, the EPA’s Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation began working on new lead cleanup guidance for the EPA regions in 2012, said James Woolford, director of the office from 2006 to 2020. The EPA took a “cautious, studied” approach to how much lead in dirt is acceptable.

“Zero was obviously the preference. But what could you do given what’s in the environment?” he asked. “And so we were kind of stuck there.”

Then, in 2024, Biden stepped in.

If regional EPA officials applied the administration’s guidance to the Omaha site, over 13,000 more properties in Omaha could have qualified, a Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica analysis of EPA and City of Omaha soil tests found.

The number could have been even higher, records show. Nearly 27,000 properties, including those that never received cleanup and those that received partial cleanup, would have been eligible for further evaluation, EPA manager Preston Law wrote to a state environmental official in March 2024.

The EPA had also been discussing with city and state officials whether to expand the cleanup area: A map that an EPA contractor created with a computer model to simulate the smelter’s plume shows that it likely stretched 23 miles north to south across five counties in Nebraska and Iowa.

But cleaning up all the properties to the Biden levels could cost more than $800 million, the then-interim director of the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment, Thaddeus Fineran, wrote to the EPA’s administrator in May 2024.

If cleanup costs exceeded the funds set aside from Omaha’s settlements, the EPA would have to dip into the federal Superfund trust fund, which generally requires a 10% match from the state, said Ashford, the EPA spokesperson.

That could mean a contribution of $80 million or more from Nebraska, which is already facing a $471 million budget deficit. In the letter, Fineran wrote that the state would “reserve the right to challenge the Updated Lead Soil Guidance and any actions taken in furtherance thereof.”

The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy, and Environment, as the agency is now called, declined an interview, referring questions to the EPA.

Researchers and decision-makers are likely taking a cautious approach toward what they agree to clean up in Omaha, Woolford said. Given its size, it could carry weight elsewhere.

“It will set the baseline for sites across the country,” he said.

‘Hollow’ claims

The Trump administration may upend any plans to expand the cleanup.

In March, the EPA announced what it called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.” By July, about 1 in 5 employees who worked for the EPA when Trump took office were gone. The administration proposed slashing the EPA’s budget in half.

The administration promised to prioritize Superfund cleanups. But in October, it changed the lead guidance. As a result, more people will be at risk of absorbing damaging amounts of lead into their bodies, said Tom Neltner, national director for the advocacy organization Unleaded Kids.

“It signals that the claims that lead is a priority for them are hollow,” he said.

The Trump administration said Biden’s approach had “inconsistencies and inefficiencies” that led to “analysis paralysis” and slowed projects down.

“Children can’t wait years for us to put a shovel in the dirt to clean up the areas where they live and play,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

Under the guidance, the EPA could issue a lower standard for the Omaha site. But Robert Weinstock, director of Northwestern University’s Environmental Advocacy Center, said that’s unlikely unless the state sets a lower state standard than the EPA.

Trump’s guidance has some advantages in being more clear, said Filippelli of Indiana University. The Biden guidance seemed overly ambitious: Filippelli and other researchers estimated 1 in 4 American homes could have qualified for cleanup with an estimated cost of $290 billion to $1.2 trillion.

While Omaha could be the litmus test for how low the Trump EPA is willing to set cleanup standards, the new guidelines don’t inspire confidence that the administration will do more to clean up old sites where work is nearly finished.

“I imagine the inertia would be just to say, ‘Oh, we’re done with Omaha,’” he said.

The city has received no timeline from the EPA, said Steve Zivny, program manager of Omaha’s Lead Information Office. He’s guessing money will play a big part in the decision over whether to clean up at a lower lead level, though. About $90 million of the Omaha Superfund settlement remains.

“If the data is there and the science is there and the money’s there, I think we would expect it to be lowered,” Zivny said. “But there’s just so many factors that are not really in our control.”

If cleanup levels aren’t lowered in Omaha, advocates will have more work to do, said Kiley Petersmith, an assistant professor at Nebraska Methodist College who until recently oversaw a statewide blood-lead testing program.

“I think we’re just gonna have to rally together to do more to prevent it from getting from our environment into our kids,” she said.

A buried issue

Despite the cleanup efforts, Omahans are still exposed at higher rates compared with the national average, said Dr. Egg Qin, an epidemiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who has studied the Superfund site. Yet the city seems to be moving on, he said.

“Somebody needs to take the responsibility,” Qin said, “to make sure the community knows lead poisoning still exists significantly in Omaha.”

About 40% of the 398 people who have already signed up to have their soil tested by Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica said they did not feel knowledgeable about the history of lead contamination in Omaha.

That may in part be due to disclosure rules. When a person sells a home, state and federal law requires them to share any knowledge about lead hazards. The EPA’s original cleanup plan from 2009 says that should include providing buyers with soil test results.

But in most cases, there can be very little disclosure, said Tim Reeder, a real estate agent who works in the Superfund site. Omaha’s association of real estate agents provides a map of the Superfund site to give to buyers, along with some basic information, if the home is within the boundaries.

City and local health officials spread the word about lead through neighborhood meetings, local TV interviews and billboards. But most people don’t take it seriously until someone they know tests high, Petersmith said.

“Unfortunately, once it affects them personally, like if their child or grandchild or cousin has lead exposure, then it’s too late,” she said.

When Omaha pediatrician Katie MacKrell moved into a house in the Dundee neighborhood, she thought her kids were fine to play in the yard. Her son sucked his thumb. Her daughter dropped her pacifier and put it back in.

When their kids both tested high for lead, MacKrell and her husband went to work fixing lead paint issues in the house. When it came to the yard, her property tested for lead levels above the Biden guidance but didn’t qualify under the original cleanup threshold. And without government help, it could cost the couple more than $10,000 to pay for the remediation themselves.

The lead also caught Vanessa Ballard, a high school teacher and mom of two young boys, by surprise. She had imagined growing fruit trees in her backyard until she discovered lead levels high enough to potentially clean up under the Biden guidelines. Now, no one goes in the backyard. Her oldest son splashes in soapy water after making tracks for his Hot Wheels cars in the dirt, and she mixes droplets of iron with the kids’ juice every night to help their bodies repel lead.

“I have no hand in the cause of this, but I have all the responsibility in the prevention of it harming me and my family,” she said.

Prine will never know whether lead stunted Jack’s speech development, but she worries about it every day.

Starting kindergarten helped. But her son is still behind other kids. Prine said she tries to put on a brave face, to believe one day he’ll catch up. If he doesn’t, it’s hard not to suspect the culprit could be in her soil.

It seemed the government, at least for a short while, agreed. Now she, and so many others in Omaha, don’t know when, if ever, to expect a solution.

“Why does it take so long, when they say it’s not safe, to then come in and say, ‘We’re gonna take this seriously?’” Prine asked. “‘That we’re gonna help these kids and protect them?’”",https://flatwaterfreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251116-Gratz-NE-Lead14-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 01:57:55.868104
