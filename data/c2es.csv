President Trump on Friday met with oil executives at the White House, and his administration is pressing U.S. oil companies to reenter Venezuela.
Wright said the U.S. expects change to come fast to the South American country.
But what you've got to prevent in the meantime is a collapse of the nation,"" Wright said.
I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela,"" Wright said.","Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Sunday that it's ""quite likely"" American companies will have an expanded presence in Venezuela's oil industry as the country moves on following the removal of former President Nicolás Maduro.

""That's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility,"" Wright said Sunday on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

But Wright said the U.S. has not taken over running Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA oil and gas company. President Trump on Friday met with oil executives at the White House, and his administration is pressing U.S. oil companies to reenter Venezuela.

""No, today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers. And then that crude goes out into the market,"" Wright said. ""We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans.""

U.S. forces captured and removed Maduro and his wife on Jan. 3 and brought them to New York to face federal charges alleging narco-terrorism and cocaine importation, among other charges. Maduro and his wife have pleaded not guilty. Wright said the U.S. expects change to come fast to the South American country.

""With United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think….we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela,"" said Wright. ""This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.""

Wright said that means working with officials in the current government Maduro left behind, even though many of them have been indicted in the U.S. Those officials include Diosdado Cabello, the powerful Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, a strongman who has also previously been indicted in the U.S.

""We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the meantime is a collapse of the nation,"" Wright said.

Still, Wright said, ""we don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today.""

""We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela,"" Wright said.

President Trump on Sunday in a social media post warned another U.S. adversary in the region, Cuba, that it is cut off from Venezuelan oil, writing the island nation should ""make a deal before it's too late."" But Wright told Brennan off camera Sunday that the U.S. is not currently asking Mexico — a key fuel supplier to Cuba — to cut off oil to the isolated Caribbean island nation.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/11/d5985982-0fbb-448a-bbc2-7418c1b8e3ca/thumbnail/1200x630/64c6f0aed9894030d5d5f3fdb02bd710/1768150152231.png,N,,2026-01-11 14:58:10.939207

The case addresses whether Chevron and other energy companies can move a Louisiana state lawsuit to federal court under the federal-officer removal statute, based on actions taken on behalf of the federal government during World War II. Roughly 40 lawsuits have been filed since 2013 over oil and gas companies’ alleged role in Louisiana’s coastal erosion, and the Supreme Court’s upcoming review of Chevron U.S.A. v. Plaquemines Parish decides whether those cases can be moved from state to federal court.

“At the end of the day, this is about federal supremacy… that means that those doing the work of the federal government can’t be hauled into some state or local court to face judgment for the work they’re doing for the federal government,” Mike Fragoso a partner at Torridon Law PLLC, said in a statement. (RELATED: Trump DOJ Joins Fight As Major Players Sound Alarm Over ‘Climate Lawfare’ That Could ‘Cripple’ American Energy)

Several parties filed amicus briefs in September — including the Department of Justice (DOJ), Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Republican Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox — arguing the lawsuits should be heard in federal court because some of the alleged conduct occurred during World War II when companies operated under federal contracts.

Chevron and other energy companies are urging the Supreme Court to overturn a Fifth Circuit ruling that found the oil companies failed to establish federal jurisdiction. Former U.S. Attorneys General Bill Barr and Michael Mukasey, along with numerous state attorneys general, support Chevron’s position. They argue the parishes are seeking to impose retroactive liability for conduct that the federal government previously authorized.

“The FDR administration ordered the oil companies to drill as much oil as they can in Louisiana and then refine it into aviation gasoline. … In an emergency situation like wartime, you can’t just go around suing people 80 years later for what the government told them to do,” John Shu, a constitutional law expert and legal commentator who served in the George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “If you can sue somebody 80 years later for what the government told you to do to win a war, then no one’s going to do it.”

Others like Alliance For Consumers Executive Director O.H. Skinner argue the lawsuits could harm consumers as he links them to “woke lawfare,” or in other words, lawsuits pushed by climate activists that seek to wield the courts to enact their agenda.

Skinner told the DCNF previously that “woke lawfare is one of the key fronts being pressed by left-wing activists, where they hope to obtain the policy victories in court that have been rejected at the ballot box and in the halls of Congress. … This Louisiana lawsuit is a chief example of the climate lawfare that is being pushed by these activists and trial lawyers. It would mark a major turning point for the Supreme Court to rule against the plaintiffs and provide its first decision disrupting that campaign.”

Many major climate lawsuits brought by Democrat cities and states against energy companies have been dismissed recently, though some analysts argue that if even one surviving case succeeds, it could set a precedent with far-reaching impacts for the energy sector and consumers.

The Louisiana oil and gas industry is massive, generating over $54 billion for the state in 2021, according to an analysis from the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API). The Gulf Coast accounts for 55% of American refining capacity, with Louisiana’s Gulf Coast alone accounting for a significant portion, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Legal experts, including Carrie Campbell Severin, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, have pointed out alleged close ties and aligned interests between Louisiana’s governor and a trial lawyer leading many of these cases.

Fragoso also argued that “Louisiana is probably the worst place in the country for getting hometowned. Their judges are elected… with the support of plaintiffs’ lawyers… Plaquemines Parish [has] like 23,000 people in it. So do the math of $745 million divided by 23,000 people, and you’re seeing the financial incentive for any individual resident who’s on the jury is tremendous.”

Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry moved to intervene in the local government lawsuits against the oil and gas companies and said they had “differing and competing interests” that affected Louisiana’s coastal restoration and economy in 2016, according to NOLA.com, a local New Orleans publication. Landry has since voiced support for the lawsuits.

The Baton Rouge law firm Talbot, Carmouche and Marcello, represented the local government’s lawsuit against Chevron for wetlands damages. It also donated $300,000 to the Protect Louisiana’s Children PAC, which supported Landry’s gubernatorial run in 2023, according to the Louisiana Illuminator.

A consortium of U.S. senators – including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.
), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) – is opening a probe into Big Tech practices that offload the cost of operating data centers onto the communities that host them.
The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, “data centers are responsible for 65% to more than 85% of projected load growth” for utilities.
Not only are data centers adding undue pressure to Americans’ already considerable financial burdens, they are also competing for scarce resources in rural and agricultural economies.","For months, anger has been building in the communities that are involuntarily footing the bill for the AI boom. As data center clusters pop up around the globe to feed AI’s massive and growing computational needs, nearby communities are seeing their utility bills skyrocket, even if they themselves don’t benefit from the sector at all. And now, in the United States, the backlash against data centers’ resource consumption – and its impact on consumers’ bottom line – has spilled out of the bounds of local politics and landed in the Senate.

A consortium of U.S. senators – including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) – is opening a probe into Big Tech practices that offload the cost of operating data centers onto the communities that host them. In open letters written to seven AI companies, the senators pushed for accountability and transparency, citing a study that found “electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years” in “areas located near significant data center activity.”

While the probe is being led by Democrats, there has been a rare bipartisan groundswell over the issue in the states where data centers are concentrated. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, “data centers are responsible for 65% to more than 85% of projected load growth” for utilities.

Due to this intense demand growth, major utilities in these states, plus North Carolina, project that they will collectively add 32,600 MW of electrical load over the next 15 years. And it’s consumers – of energy, not necessarily of AI – who will have to pay the price for all of that additional demand. It’s estimated that Virginians can expect average electricity prices to increase by another 25 percent by 2030.

""We are witnessing a massive transfer of wealth from residential utility customers to large corporations—data centers and large utilities and their corporate parents, which profit from building additional energy infrastructure,"" Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp told Business Insider earlier this year. ""Utility regulation is failing to protect residential customers, contributing to an energy affordability crisis.”

And the terms behind that transfer of responsibility are extremely opaque, as is typical for the AI sector. In the Senators’ letter to AI companies, they blast these firms for operating in the shadows against public interest. The letter notes that AI firms “ask public officials to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from sharing information with their constituents, operate through what appear to be shell companies to mask the real owner of the data center, and require that landowners sign NDAs as part of the land sale while telling them only that a ‘Fortune 100 company’ is planning an ‘industrial development’ seemingly in an attempt to hide the very existence of the data center,” senators wrote.

Not only are data centers adding undue pressure to Americans’ already considerable financial burdens, they are also competing for scarce resources in rural and agricultural economies. Data centers require huge amounts of land and considerable water sources, which could lead to conflict and issues of scarcity in certain hotspots such as drier climates and agricultural communities concerned about land competition and “environmental impacts, noise and lack of transparency.”

In many ways, the country – and the world – simply is not prepared for the scale of the AI boom, and all of the resources and regulations that it will require. There are serious concerns about whether ageing power grids can keep up with demand, and whether energy output can keep up with surging demand. Plus, the way that our systems are designed simply never saw this coming.

As the senators express in their letter, “the current, socialized model of electricity ratepaying” in which costs are shared by all grid users, “was not designed for an era where just one customer requires the same amount of electricity as some of the largest cities in America.”

It’s proof that when we trust in American ingenuity and unlock our own resources, we build a more prosperous future for everyone.","The number on the gas station sign says it all: $2.97 per gallon. For the first time in four years, that price will be a reality for the average American in 2026, according to GasBuddy’s report released Tuesday. This is the expected result of a clear shift in how our leaders approach energy: a return to American energy abundance.

Energy policy must be judged by one standard: does it help people live better, more prosperous lives? For too long, our leaders failed us on that front. Policies of restriction from previous administrations drove up costs, weakened our electric grid, and punished working families. President Donald Trump and the 119th Congress have reversed that course, starting on Day One with executive actions and landmark legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) to unleash our nation’s vast energy resources.

We were told that mandating solar and wind power would lead to cheaper electricity. But America’s experience over the last four years shows how wrong that was. And a recent study by the nonpartisan Institute for Energy Research found that states with the most aggressive mandates for so-called “renewable energy” sources suffer from the highest electricity rates.

In places like California and New York, families pay as much as double the national average for power and rates rise up to three times faster than the rest of the country. The reason is simple: when politicians force an electric grid to depend on sources that only work when the sun shines or the wind blows, operators must build and maintain a second, redundant system of reliable power plants. Consumers pay for both, and their electricity prices soar.

Blue-state politicians are welcome to ride these policies into the ground, but President Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s energy dominance agenda is building a “best of the above” approach that allows the most affordable, reliable power to win business.

This commitment to affordability extends beyond the electric meter. The administration has ended and is actively unwinding costly, job-killing federal mandates that were designed to force Americans into expensive electric vehicles they didn’t want and couldn’t afford, especially under the previous administration’s historic inflation rates.

These top-down rules would have dramatically increased the price of all cars and trucks while putting our automotive industry at a global disadvantage. By scrapping them through executive orders and in the One Big Beautiful Bill, President Trump has protected consumer choice by ensuring that families can buy the vehicles that best suit their needs and budgets.

Looking ahead, our nation’s energy needs are set to grow enormously. The energy demands of artificial intelligence, the reshoring of supply chains and manufacturing, and further electrification of consumer goods require a grid that is stronger and more reliable than ever before.

This is why the administration’s focus on unleashing U.S. resources such as oil, natural gas, and critical minerals is so important. It lowers prices at the pump, reduces the cost of manufacturing goods, and makes American businesses more competitive. It’s also why the administration’s focus on fostering a nuclear renaissance is so critical. Nuclear energy is the backbone of a reliable grid, providing immense amounts of dependable power around the clock. By supporting our existing nuclear fleet and paving the way for new, advanced reactors, we are ensuring that America has the power it needs to lead the world for the next century.

Gas prices are down, and it’s not because President Trump flipped a switch in the White House. It’s an expected, and now delivered, result of a purposeful agenda that puts abundance over forced scarcity and that values reliability over virtue signaling. It’s proof that when we trust in American ingenuity and unlock our own resources, we build a more prosperous future for everyone.

Certainly, when I talk to retired ICE agents, they say they’re not the slightest bit surprised they’re seeing this.
As these deployments continue, as things get further politicized, will these shootings make it harder for ICE agents to operate elsewhere?
It’s going to take ICE a long time to dig out of this.
It’s not that they’re not trained to do it; it’s just not something they are as experienced at doing.","Sandweg, who led the nation’s top immigration enforcement agency from 2013 to 2014, said ICE serves the entire public — and its politicization is doing it no good. He’s also critical of the administration’s hasty response to Good’s killing, which he argues only further undermined public trust in ICE activity.

As Sandweg sees it, ICE needs to pare back its visibility: stop taking partisan sides, mend relationships with local partners and cease publicly announcing their operations. He stresses the need to de-escalate — but worries it isn’t coming anytime soon.

“It’s going to be a long time,” Sandweg says, “before the agency recovers.”

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

Videos of the Minneapolis shooting are circulating online, and there have been lots of different reactions. The Trump administration is claiming that ICE agents were operating in self-defense. State and local officials have swiftly denounced that conclusion. Did you watch the videos, and what was your reaction?

I’ve seen a couple of the videos. To me, it highlighted why it’s so important that you withhold judgment until there is a thorough investigation, and why that’s the standard practice any time there’s an officer shooting.

I feel like each video provided a different perspective that could lend itself to a different conclusion. Of course, I think the entire thing is tragic. And if I were at ICE, what I would hope is that the investigation is not only a tool to determine, if in that moment the officer’s decision was reasonable, but also to look at this holistically. To try to inform us, how can we make sure something like this doesn’t happen again?

Anytime anyone is killed, it’s a horrific tragedy, and I think we need to do everything we can to learn from it. And I do worry that with the quick rushes to judgment and, in many ways, the politicization of this issue, it makes it harder for us to try to at least draw some good from this — which would be trying to reduce the chances of this reoccurring.

Pretty quickly after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem framed it as an act of self-defense, insisting that the agent was responding to an act of “domestic terrorism.” Other members of the Trump administration seemed to agree. But what information might the DHS actually have had, in the aftermath of the shooting?

I just can’t imagine any secretary, or the department itself, ever saying anything at that moment other than, “We’re committed to having an investigation here.” Whether that was a Republican administration or a Democratic administration.

I’ve been through five years at DHS, which included a significant portion of time as a senior advisor to a secretary. Whenever something major happens, the initial information we received almost always had severe inaccuracies. You learn very quickly in that job not to trust the initial information. Anytime there’s a major event, information is flowing and fast.

You cannot rush out and make pronouncements about what’s going on until the dust settles a bit and you have a more accurate picture of what happened. There have been a couple of incidents with [FBI Director] Kash Patel, who’s rushed out to get facts out to the public, and then later those facts proved, pretty quickly, to be wrong.

With a shooting like this, you need to look at the totality of the circumstances. Not only does each video give you a different angle and a different perspective, but there’s so much information the videos don’t capture … You have to wait for all the facts to come in.

But the other reason why that’s significant, though, is because there is going to be an investigation. The public expects an investigation. The risk you run, especially in this environment we’re in now, is that people don’t believe in the government. They’re losing faith in ICE as an institution.

What’s the point of the investigation? We’ve already announced this was a justified shooting, right? “No mistakes were made. We followed our training perfectly.” “She was a domestic terrorist trying to kill people” — I don’t know how you could possibly draw that conclusion at that stage. What was she doing that day? What were her intentions? Are there signs that she was actually trying to kill an officer, that she was in that state of mind that day? 37-year-old mothers don’t typically try to kill federal officers.

But you can’t get [evidence] unless you’re executing search warrants on her phone, getting into her email communications, interviewing people who knew her. In any event, the irresponsibility is not only rushing up to the public and giving them information that isn’t vetted, but it also undermines the investigation … I just can’t imagine anyone’s going to have confidence in that investigation anymore.

And how exactly do you investigate an incident like this?

Every case is different. Some of the protocols require, of course, getting the officer off the scene, interviewing the officer as quickly as possible about their perspective. All of this gets really complicated. The FBI has taken charge of this investigation, typically you would have some DHS entity involved in that investigation

They interview witnesses and look at all the available evidence; they get all of the available surveillance cameras, interview all the officers at the scene, try to build back what was going on that day.

The investigation itself would determine whether, under the use of force rules, the officer had a reasonable belief that he was facing imminent danger. But it would also look at everything else that happened and if mistakes were made that require administrative action.

One thing we learned recently about the officer involved in the Minneapolis shooting is that he had recently been the victim of a dragging incident with a car. What psychological supports are available for officers after an attack?

There’s certainly tools available. You don’t return to duty until you’re fit for duty. I know there’s an evaluation there. Obviously, everybody’s going to bring their own personal experiences to the job. That’s just the reality of the situation. And, by the way, the investigation will look into that, if there were fitness reports or other things.

But I certainly don’t believe just because somebody was the victim of an assault, that they can’t do their job. We probably wouldn’t have very many officers if that were the standard.

The Trump administration has floated the idea of immunity for the agent. Obviously depending on the outcome of the investigation, what could that look like? Could the officer be prosecuted?

This raises a lot of complicated issues. The state of Minnesota might make their own decision about what happened and whether any state crimes occurred. The state of Minnesota could independently charge the officer. The federal government could obviously charge the officer as well. If the state charges the officer, the officer is entitled to qualified immunity. Vice President JD Vance misspoke at the press conference when he said, “absolute immunity.” There is no absolute immunity. There’s qualified immunity.

Certainly, the state could charge the officer with murder. The officer could have to make a court appearance or two, but there is a process in place, when it is a federal official exercising their official duties, where they can seek removal of the case to federal court. If it’s deemed that they were acting in their official capacity, they were doing their federal job, then the federal court can assert jurisdiction in order to make a determination as to whether they’re entitled to qualified immunity.

As we talked about in our previous interview, it’s difficult to question use of force because we don’t know what the agents knew, what they were thinking at the moment, or what sort of threat they perceived. But with escalating violence across the country, does it seem like the DHS needs to revisit that “objectively reasonable” policy?

I don’t think the policy or the standard needs to be changed. I mean, this is a uniform use of force standard that all law enforcement agencies basically employ.

What I do think we need to do, though, is look at this holistically… Are we doing things that have made our agents more vulnerable, and are we doing things that have made the public more vulnerable? The administration should be thinking, “OK, what have we done?”

From my perspective, a couple of things have been done. We’ve shifted tactics. We have officers engaged in a lot more traffic stops now than we previously did. We have officers now confronting these protesters, something that ICE very, very rarely did before. We pulled Border Patrol agents up off the border, where they operated in a completely different environment, and put them in an urban environment … We’ve put our officers in a very difficult position.

On Thursday, Border Patrol agents shot two people in Portland. We know less about the Portland shooting than we do about Minneapolis right now. But these two incidents were nearly back-to-back. Are you concerned that these violent incidents are starting to form a pattern?

The statistics suggest that these shootings are up significantly. But I want to be really clear. Nobody at Border Patrol, nobody at ICE, wakes up and says, “I want to shoot someone today.” It’s the last thing they want to do.

But so, we have to ask ourselves, “Why is this happening?” It goes back to exactly what I said.

The administration has said, in order to make mass arrests, we’re going to pull agents out of what they’re trained to do, and out of their normal operating environment, and we’re going to put them in an urban area with a completely different type of policing. That is where I think the frustration should be.

Certainly, when I talk to retired ICE agents, they say they’re not the slightest bit surprised they’re seeing this. They say this is what you have to expect when you pull these agents out of their normal environments, having them do things that they’re not trained to do.

As these deployments continue, as things get further politicized, will these shootings make it harder for ICE agents to operate elsewhere? And will it be harder for protesters to exercise their rights?

Immigration enforcement has always been politically charged, but now it’s even more charged. And we’re turning it into a both-sides-ism. There is a middle ground here. This is what’s frustrating to me and to other people who worked at ICE. You can be pro-immigration enforcement. You can have, like during the Obama administration, extensive immigration enforcement focused on the right people, done without being so politicized.

But in any event, will it be harder? Of course, yes. It’s going to take ICE a long time to dig out of this. By becoming so political, just at a bare minimum, what it does is it makes it incredibly hard for ICE to [maintain] these relationships with state and local partners, which are so critical to a law enforcement agency like ICE. Those are incredibly damaged right now. Our relationships with these large cities are damaged.

It’s going to be a long time before the agency recovers.

I asked you this question three months ago. Maybe your answer is the same, maybe it’s changed. Where do we go from here?

I’d like to see us deescalate things. ICE serves the entire public. It doesn’t serve a political party. It doesn’t serve just red America, and it’s not the enemy of blue America.

It doesn’t mean you have to back off immigration enforcement … But try to do things in a less overt manner. Don’t try to antagonize. Don’t take sides. Lower the visibility of ICE. You can keep doing these operations but go back to some of the tactics we’ve seen before where that are lower profile, less visible. Do your job. Do your job quietly.

Stop announcing these operations. This is so bizarre to me. How high-profile [it is], we announce weeks in advance that ICE is coming to town. Candidly, that just puts the officers in greater jeopardy. You’re telling all the potential targets, “We’re coming to get you next week.” I mean, what?

I think we need to de-escalate. But unfortunately, it doesn’t look like we’re doing that.

ICE operations in Minnesota are especially large. When we last spoke, one of your biggest concerns was whether ICE could ratchet up its activity without cutting corners on training and recruitment. That doesn’t seem to be the case here; the officer who fired shots in Minnesota had experience with the agency. But just broadly speaking, could inexperience, these concerns about declining training standards, lead to more incidents like these?

Absolutely. I mean, you have a supercharged environment where things are incredibly tense. The officers are operating in a reality where the assaults on them are up. We’re having them do things that seasoned officers have been trained to do. It’s not that they’re not trained to do it; it’s just not something they are as experienced at doing. And now you’re sort of flooding the agency with these new hires.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2F22%2Fb0d1e60342c3bbdd4d8cfb61aa4f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254658829,N,,2026-01-11 12:13:16.049414

MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, President Trump vowed that Venezuela now has the military protection of the US. This comes just one week after he said the US would run that country. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is expected to travel to Washington to meet with President Trump this week. For his part, Mr. Trump and his team met with dozens of US oil executives late last week, urging them to commit $100 billion to boost oil production there. Joining us now to discuss it all is the United States Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, good to have you here in person.

SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Thanks for having me, Margaret.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I ask you about Venezuela, very quickly, these protests in Iran, not this country reliant on oil to keep its government controlled economy afloat. The President has been briefed on military options. What is the US willing to do to help?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly the President has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return. So we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into the specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Will there be more interdictions of vessels carrying Iranian oil? Any more activity on that front?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I won't reveal any change in position there.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, let me ask you about Venezuela,

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: where you have been very focused and very central to the President's policy. The President said that Venezuela now has the United States, the most powerful military in the world, to protect them. To protect them, we will. Is the United States military providing security guarantees for American companies?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We're not doing that right now, but what we, what he means, is we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons. They got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They, they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place going down the tubes. And with the United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to, we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela. This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday. That the President, excuse me, the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of US citizenship or support for the US. The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the Minister of the Interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Not that we are aware of, but we should be cautious. Look, this is, as they say, eight days into a change into a change of leadership there. The interim authorities are trying to establish power. Collectivos have been running wild over, over Venezuela for, for over a decade. So, yeah, you're not going to–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well he controls them.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So is he safe in his position? Because right now the administration seems to be working with him.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business minded President Delcy Rodriguez?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So yes, of course we're concerned about those things.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it. Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process. The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25 years in decline, oil industry back going again.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as like as an American state owned oil company essentially?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: No. Today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans. But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yeah, of course, quite likely you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So back in November, us, Judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal. The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of an intel company, do you want to own portions of oil companies?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility. The Citgo sale is part of, is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan Government. And of course, one, one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that so to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.

MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case. Absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced–

MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an over supply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. That's not- That's not good for American oil and gas companies.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability. So President Trump is no, is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And certainly there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.

MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that–

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.

MARGARET BRENNAN

Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible, to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan Government. And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So Secretary Rubio said there's a three point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite, even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership, they're already in Venezuela, we should say, said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50%. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there, it's at least a year and a half, two years.

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition. We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there, but America–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a timeline?

SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: 25 years, this country has gone in decline. President Trump out of the box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game. But, yeah, I don't know the timeline of that. It's not weeks, it's more months. Could be a year or two could be more.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Wright, thank you for your time today.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/11/d5985982-0fbb-448a-bbc2-7418c1b8e3ca/thumbnail/1200x630/64c6f0aed9894030d5d5f3fdb02bd710/1768150152231.png,N,,2026-01-11 12:59:06.901770

Toyota Motor Corp. detailed plans to invest $912 million to increase output of hybrid components and vehicles across five states, part of a broader $10 billion commitment in the US over the next five years.

Factories in West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee and Missouri will see 252 new jobs as a result of the initiative, the world’s biggest carmaker said in a statement.

The move underscores Toyota’s bet that hybrids will dominate US sales in the near term as consumers balk at high EV prices following the end of tax credits. The investment may also strengthen the Japanese carmaker’s foothold in the market as Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and other US carmakers scale back EV ambitions and revisit hybrid strategies to meet shifting demand and emissions targets.

Toyota now offers hybrid-only versions of the RAV4 compact crossover and Camry sedan in the US, thanks to robust demand for gasoline-electric powertrains with better mileage.

The Japanese manufacturer, which has long advocated for a more measured approach to sell a broad range of vehicle options for different markets, said that its “philosophy is to build where we sell,” and that its North American manufacturing sites assemble some 76% of the vehicles sold in the US.

In November, Toyota confirmed it would boost spending in the US, after President Donald Trump said in October that the carmaker planned a large-scale investment.

Even in China, the world’s top EV market, analysts are anticipating a slight slowdown in sales growth, due in part to narrowing government support for the industry.
The EU recently softened its ban on combustion vehicle sales, though, and EV sales are slowing.
“Carmakers that can cut costs and offer affordable models in the most desirable vehicle segments are likely to see sustained sales growth,” BNEF analyst Huiling Zhou said in a recent report.
The sweet spot of the U.S. auto market is the midsize SUV that costs $35,000 or less.","Growth in global sales of electric vehicles is expected to slow this year as China winds down some subsidies, Europe wavers on its phase-out of combustion engines, and U.S. producers and policymakers make a U-turn from the segment.

BloombergNEF expects drivers to buy 24.3 million passenger EVs this year, an increase of only 12% on 2025 and weaker than the 23% growth in sales last year.

In the U.S. in particular, electric vehicle makers are facing an “EV winter,” and will need to navigate bumpy months ahead before a likely revival in sales in 2027 and 2028, said Nathan Niese, Boston Consulting Group’s global lead for EVs and energy storage. Though the long-term trajectory for battery-powered vehicles remains positive, there isn’t “a 2026 story buried in there that says there’s lots to be optimistic about,” he said.

Ford Motor Co.’s decision in December to take $19.5 billion in charges related to a sweeping overhaul of its EV business — including the move to convert its flagship electric F-150 Lightning truck to an extended-range hybrid vehicle — highlighted the fragility of the sector’s short-term prospects, and capped a series of strategy rollbacks from major producers outside China.

The Trump administration’s withdrawal of up to $7,500 consumer tax credits in the U.S. after September and hollowing out of fuel-economy standards has sent the nation’s EV market tumbling. U.S. sales in November plunged 41% from a year earlier, and the nation’s annual passenger EV sales are forecast to contract 15% in 2026, according to BNEF.

Even in China, the world’s top EV market, analysts are anticipating a slight slowdown in sales growth, due in part to narrowing government support for the industry. Beijing has cut the EV tax break in half for 2026, while a cash-for-clunkers program will include new restrictions limiting eligibility. Authorities have criticized “rat-race competition” in the nation’s crowded auto sector, and are cracking down on discounts offered to counteract waning demand.

“The Chinese government is definitely trying to cool the price war,” said Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights, a California-based auto industry consulting firm.

Fierce competition saw BYD Co., China’s EV champion, post its weakest annual sales growth since 2020 last year, as rivals including Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. and technology giant Xiaomi Corp. begin to gain ground. The nation’s auto firms are also seeing growth slow as they try to expand in tougher markets, such as smaller cities and rural areas.

China’s passenger EV sales, including plug-in hybrids and extended-range hybrids, are expected to have reached 15.6 million in 2025, a 27% increase on the previous year, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence forecast. Sales for 2026 are projected to rise just 13%.

The country’s auto producers have aggressively tapped export markets as demand at home softens. In the first three quarters of 2025, Chinese companies sold nearly a million EVs overseas, a 54% increase from 2024.

Automakers have plans to continue to expand overseas sales in 2026. BYD alone is aiming to export 1.6 million vehicles, according to Citi analysts, while brands like Geely’s Zeekr, Chery Automobile Co. and SAIC Motor Corp. are all targeting offshore markets.

Despite European Union tariffs, the bloc remains the top destination for Chinese vehicles, according to BNEF. The EU recently softened its ban on combustion vehicle sales, though, and EV sales are slowing.

While EV policy is deteriorating, the sector’s economics are improving. Affordability has been among the largest barriers to EV adoption in the U.S., and battery prices — the most expensive part of any electric car or truck — fell another 8% in 2025, according to BNEF estimates. “Carmakers that can cut costs and offer affordable models in the most desirable vehicle segments are likely to see sustained sales growth,” BNEF analyst Huiling Zhou said in a recent report.

In the U.S., producers are expected to debut several models in 2026 with sticker prices far below the average price drivers pay for an internal combustion engine car. The sweet spot of the U.S. auto market is the midsize SUV that costs $35,000 or less. American drivers buy somewhere around 2.5 million midsize SUVs every year, and 40% of them fall under that price threshold.

There will be at least five all-new or substantially overhauled models that will launch in or around that price point in 2026, including the Toyota C-HR BEV, Subaru’s Uncharted, the Kia EV3 and an all-new model from the startup Slate Auto.

Nearly all of the House Republicans who voted for the extension on Thursday are seeking re-election in closely contested districts where, you can safely assume, they are hearing from angry constituents.","THE EFFORT TO RENEW those enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies has come back to life. Again.

The House on Thursday passed a “clean” three year-extension, meaning the extra subsidies that expired on December 31 would restart and remain in place through the end of 2028 with no adjustments to the formula. The aid would be retroactive to January 1, providing some belated relief for the more than 20 million Americans whose insurance got more expensive once the extra subsidies lapsed.

Democrats have been seeking something along these lines since last year, and it was their top demand during the government shutdown last October and November. They finally got a bill to the House floor by convincing four Republicans to join them in signing a discharge petition, which forced a vote despite the objections of GOP leadership. Those four GOP votes were enough to create a majority, one that got significantly larger on Thursday when seventeen House Republicans voted yes on the proposal itself.

The final count was 230 to 196, which qualifies as a big win in today’s polarized, mostly party-line congressional environment. In any other week, it would have dominated the news, although the outcome isn’t as surprising as it might seem. Nearly all of the House Republicans who voted for the extension on Thursday are seeking re-election in closely contested districts where, you can safely assume, they are hearing from angry constituents.

But it also wouldn’t have happened without the persistence of key advocacy organizations and Democratic politicians like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the veteran congressman from New York. Jeffries was as responsible as anybody for making health care a focus of the shutdown—a decision that drew plenty of skepticism—and then for keeping his caucus united around demands for a clean extension.

From this foundation, ReElement and TEP plan to strategically develop additional facilities across the United States and select international markets.
ReElement is developing large-scale critical mineral processing and refining capacity to strengthen strategic United States supply chains.
Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies stated, ""We are excited to partner with Transition Equity Partners.
Together, these advantages position ReElement to accelerate supply-chain resilience while supporting long-term industrial competitiveness, national security, and sustainable growth.","American Resources Corporation through its minority holding in Fishers-based ReElement Technologies Corporation,a leading U.S. innovator in rare earth element (REE) and critical mineral refining for the commercial and defense industries, announced the closing of a $200 million strategic equity facility from Transition Equity Partners, LLC (TEP).

This investment will accelerate the commercial deployment of ReElement's proprietary, multi-mineral refining platform, with an initial focus on the buildout of the Company's Marion, Indiana facility to meet near-term domestic demand. From this foundation, ReElement and TEP plan to strategically develop additional facilities across the United States and select international markets. Leveraging its versatile and modularly scalable refining architecture and proprietary chromatographic separation processes, the Marion site will focus on processing light rare earths, heavy rare earths and other critical defense elements. With TEP's support, the Marion facility will scale to an initial capacity greater than 10,000 metric tons per annum (MTPA) of refined critical minerals production sourced from recycled feedstocks, and mined mixed rare earth concentrates, with an ability to further scale in Marion and several other strategic locations.

ReElement is developing large-scale critical mineral processing and refining capacity to strengthen strategic United States supply chains. This includes the Company's recently announced partnership with the U.S. Department of War and Vulcan Elements to support a fully vertically integrated, domestic rare earth magnet supply chain. ReElement is also partnering with POSCO International Corporation, a global leader in steel, magnetic materials, and advanced industrial solutions, to further reinforce U.S.-based critical minerals and magnet production capabilities.

Beyond magnet supply chains, ReElement's proprietary chromatographic refining platform is uniquely capable of meeting demand for heavy rare earth elements and other critical defense materials that are not currently produced at scale in the United States. These include yttrium, gadolinium, germanium, antimony, terbium, dysprosium, and other essential minerals that underpin U.S. energy, advanced technology, and defense applications - and that remain subject to severe supply constraints and export controls from China.

Mark Jensen, CEO of ReElement Technologies stated, ""We are excited to partner with Transition Equity Partners. Throughout this process, it became clear that we are closely aligned culturally and mission-wise - an alignment we believe is essential to addressing supply-chain challenges quickly while building long-term shareholder value. The $200 million commitment will enable ReElement to expand its manufacturing base initially in the United States and, over time, globally, to process and refine critical minerals and rare earth elements through a cost-competitive, modular, and scalable platform. TEP's global reach and experienced advisory network are also supporting ReElement's international expansion across Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). TEP is more than an equity sponsor; they are a strategic partner actively supporting ReElement's global growth.""

""TEP is committed and equally excited to partner with ReElement, Mark Jensen and his leading management team to help fortify the U.S. supply chain for critical energy and strategic infrastructure"" said Pat Eilers, Managing Partner and Founder of TEP, ""ReElement's uniquely superior processing platform enables the U.S. to leverage numerous domestic and ally feedstocks to bolster a diverse set of critical mineral supply chains that are essential for a strong U.S. economy. This capability is further supported by ReElement's collaboration with the U.S. government, and ability to ensure access to critical minerals necessary for energy dominance, AI leadership, strategic defense industries, among numerous other U.S. priorities. We believe ReElement is revolutionizing U.S. critical mineral supply chains by providing reliable, low-cost and environmentally superior processing capacity in the U.S.""

Leveraging this strategic commitment, ReElement is positioned to play a critical role in securing U.S. and allied supply chains by delivering high-purity critical minerals at costs competitive with global markets. The Company's refining platform represents a new model for domestic and allied-nation processing - one that can be deployed rapidly, occupies a fraction of the footprint of traditional refineries, and produces ultra-high-purity outputs with significantly reduced environmental impact.

ReElement's modular approach enables rapid deployment across the United States and allied jurisdictions, co-location with mining or concentration assets, lower capital and operating costs, and cleaner, solvent-free processing compatible with U.S. environmental standards. Together, these advantages position ReElement to accelerate supply-chain resilience while supporting long-term industrial competitiveness, national security, and sustainable growth.",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/bin/original/20260110-115801-eb8-GettyImages-1400437847.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 11:02:07.829979

Christian Smith,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/11/aurora-considers-c-pace-loan-program/,"Aurora is considering creating a lending program, to be run by a state agency, that would offer loans towards sustainability upgrades to commercial properties.
Loans given through the program could fund certain upgrades to commercial, industrial, non-residential agricultural, nonprofit and multifamily properties, according to Lindburg’s presentation.
However, the lenders bill and collect the payment separately from the property’s tax bill, according to Brad Fletcher of the Illinois Finance Authority.
The C-PACE program was recommended for approval by the Aurora City Council’s Rules, Administration and Procedure Committee on Tuesday.
It is now set to go before the Committee of the Whole before heading to the Aurora City Council for final approval.","Aurora is considering creating a lending program, to be run by a state agency, that would offer loans towards sustainability upgrades to commercial properties.

The proposal, as heard by a committee of the Aurora City Council on Tuesday, would allow the city to participate in the Illinois Finance Authority’s Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program, commonly called C-PACE. This type of lending has been available statewide since 2017, but individual local governments still need to approve its use within their boundaries.

“This really supports both economic development and sustainability at the city of Aurora,” Alison Lindburg, the city’s director of sustainability, said of the proposed C-PACE program at the Rules, Administration and Procedure Committee meeting on Tuesday.

Loans given through the program could fund certain upgrades to commercial, industrial, non-residential agricultural, nonprofit and multifamily properties, according to Lindburg’s presentation. In total, the loans could be for up to 100% of the project’s total cost, with a maximum amount no more than 25% of the property’s total value.

Upgrades that could be funded through the program include energy efficiency improvements like lighting, HVAC or insulation upgrades; the installation of renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal; the addition of water conservation systems; upgrades to improve resiliency like flood mitigation or infrastructure improvements; and the installation of electric vehicle charging stations.

City staff were recently talking to a property owner that needed to replace a large number of a building’s windows, and this financing tool could be a good option to help them do that, Lindburg said. That’s because replacing windows can help with energy conservation, making the project eligible for this type of financing.

The funding can also be used as a “gap” financing tool to support larger projects, she said, if they include energy efficiency or related improvements. Along with renovation projects, new construction is also eligible to receive this lending.

The loans will generally have a fixed, low interest rate and have terms as long as 40 years, although most will have terms of 10 to 30 years, according to her presentation. And unlike traditional loans, it is backed by the property, not through a personal guarantee by the owner, so it can be transferred to new owners if the property is sold.

In particular, C-PACE loans are repaid through a special “assessment lien” on the property, which is sort of like an additional tax on the property. However, the lenders bill and collect the payment separately from the property’s tax bill, according to Brad Fletcher of the Illinois Finance Authority.

After a property owner applies for C-PACE lending, the Illinois Finance Authority is the one that actually issues bonds or notes through private lenders, according to Lindburg. The Authority works with a variety of these private lenders, she said, which makes the process competitive so property owners can get a very low interest rate.

The city of Aurora wouldn’t be providing funding through the program and generally wouldn’t have much involvement in it, Lindburg said. However, the Illinois Finance Authority will be providing regular updates to the city, and the city would still get final approval over the loans, according to Fletcher.

Lindburg said the proposal would bring “another tool to our tool belt” for improving buildings within Aurora. Plus, it would also help to increase property values, lower the operating costs of buildings, encourage the reuse of older buildings, create jobs for local contractors and trades, support sustainability goals, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help with long-term economic development, her presentation showed.

The C-PACE program was recommended for approval by the Aurora City Council’s Rules, Administration and Procedure Committee on Tuesday. It is now set to go before the Committee of the Whole before heading to the Aurora City Council for final approval.

According to the Illinois Finance Authority’s webpage on C-PACE, which can be found at www.il-fa.com/programs/c-pace, there are six counties and 16 cities already participating in its program.

Aurora staff in December presented early plans to bring funding programs like this one to the city. In addition to a C-PACE loan program, staff were also said to be working on a similar program for residential properties along with different financing options for small businesses and neighborhood improvements.

In it, Marko Lehtimäki said that his company's obsession is to ""make electric vehicles so good that combustion becomes irrelevant.""

Now that Norwegians have had a taste of dodging (inconvenient) fuel expenses, they should prefer extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with decent electric range, which they can charge at home.","Two pieces of recent news made me realize something I had never thought about. The first was the presentation of Donut Lab's solid-state batteries (SSBs). The second was an article I wrote about the absurd idea that, if Norway buys almost 100% of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), any other country can do the same. Both news led me to the same conclusion: for current BEVs to become mainstream, they need cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) to disappear.

The Donut Lab SSB info that made me realize this was not written by any of my colleagues. It was a more direct experience, related to watching the video that the company released on January 5. In it, Marko Lehtimäki said that his company's obsession is to ""make electric vehicles so good that combustion becomes irrelevant."" If you watch all 24 minutes of the presentation, you'll see that Lehtimäki is not a marketing guy spilling out empty jargon. The man truly believes that.

The Donut Lab co-founder and CEO even mocked the green playbook by saying that making these vehicles ""greener"" was not the point, as most BEV advocates believe that to be enough. Lehtimäki bravely addressed all shortcomings current BEVs face: ""range, charge time, cost, weight, and lifetime."" Before that, he acknowledged that ""the entire EV experience is still limited by one component: the battery"" (pack).

The Donut Lab CEO said the company's SSB ""reshapes the economics and the experience of electric mobility forever."" As they have a 400 Wh/kg energy density, cars powered by them will be lighter than current competitors with the same range or offer more range with the same weight. A different chemistry would enable these cells to be cheaper. Donut Lab said they can fully charge in 5 minutes – without having to limit it to 80%. The 100,000-cycle capacity is almost too good to be true.

I have contacted Donut Lab to understand how credible these claims are. So far, no luck. I suspect the company will just wait until Verge Motorcycles starts delivering its new TS Pro product to prove its claims. Competitors will surely test it and tear it down to discover all about what may become the first vehicle with SSBs. That's Donut Lab's chance to prove it helped make a vehicle that is ""not just as good, but better in every way"" than those powered by an ICE.

Whatever the outcome is, the deal is that combustion is still relevant, which leads us to the article I wrote about Norway. When the Norwegian government decided that the country should go electric, it was probably counting on the end of ICE vehicle production at some point. Europe tried to impose that by 2035. As a land without any mass-production car factories, Norway buys whatever other countries are willing to sell.

Several people believe the BEV transition to be complete in the Norwegian market. They want to make it an example for the world, which is ridiculous. As I mentioned in my article, such results were obtained artificially in a very rich country. They will only stand while the Norwegian government has the funds to sustain the artificial conditions that established them.

Should they disappear, and ICE cars are to compete with BEVs on a level playing field, they will win back that market. Any place that has had the time to understand that current BEVs are disposable as soon as their battery packs fail will go back to combustion. First, due to financial costs. Second, due to convenience.

Although engines also do not last forever, they may sit for years with no use and can be quickly put back to work with simple steps. Battery packs' best shot is to last around 15 years, but only if they are regularly used. If they sit idle anywhere for months, a year tops, they turn into massive paperweights. That is part of what makes depreciation hit BEVs so hard. Most of it relates to how costly these components are, which makes it prohibitively expensive to replace them if that is necessary.

The high battery pack prices also make BEVs much more expensive to purchase. That alone could explain why these vehicles do not sell as much as ICE cars. If it costs more to buy them and you end up selling them for a lot less money than you would get for a comparable ICE vehicle, is it any surprise what most car customers will prefer?

As for convenience, that's what regular fuel stations offer. While they are still around, people will prefer to fill up a tank rather than spend precious time ""fast"" charging anything. Now that Norwegians have had a taste of dodging (inconvenient) fuel expenses, they should prefer extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with decent electric range, which they can charge at home. That's perfect for saving money on daily errands without the handicaps of BEVs.

If you think it through, what Marko Lehtimäki stressed in his video was that BEVs with current lithium-ion cells are unsustainable. That's what keeps combustion relevant. When European Union (EU) politicians finally understood that, they revoked the ICE ban they had established when they thought it was all a matter of goodwill. They could not risk killing European automakers and enraging millions of European voters.

By keeping ICEs available, BEVs will still have to compete with them, and, so far, nothing in the electric field has proven to be a match. Even the best options require compromises and concessions. In other words, they are a choice based on taste and beliefs, not on rational arguments.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/for-the-bev-takeover-plan-to-work-it-needed-ice-car-production-to-stop-263890_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 07:59:02.267990

I run a solar power line from a Lesun solar panel custom-cut for the vehicle’s hood.
I was particularly interested in its Pioneer Na Sodium‑Ion Portable Power Station—the first of its kind.
I appreciate its P280 Portable Power Station’s 2,048-watt-hour capacity and 2,000-watt inverter.
On our side, it’s “drill, baby, drill.” China, meanwhile, has nearly 650 gigawatts of installed solar capacity and adds more solar energy each year than the rest of the world combined.","LAS VEGAS—Elon Musk once said that if you wake up believing the future will be better, it’s a bright day. Walking into CES in Las Vegas for the first time ever this week, I expected that brightness. What I found instead was uneven lighting, particularly in the area that concerned me the most: consumer-grade energy storage and solar generation.

My interest is personal. More frequent and intense storms in North Carolina, where I live, have been disrupting our power in the summers and winters. I’m also working from the road a lot and need power for my electronics. So I’ve researched ways of generating and storing my own power, all while watching the tech’s acceleration—especially in the East.

It was hard to ignore the pull of what was emerging from Shenzhen.

At CES, the Chinese big-brand booths felt like the kind of morning Musk was talking about: loud, confident, unapologetic. The tech they were showing off was light-years ahead of anything shipping from US borders. I couldn’t find any US companies, such as Goal Zero (recently acquired by BioLite), at CES, an absence that told its own story.

Ever since my days as a young engineer, I’ve been told to root for the US. To buy American. Unfortunately, the industry is floundering or barely there, especially in the consumer market segment for people like me who want portable power options or for those looking to go completely off-grid.

At CES, the confident visions and sense of momentum were all coming from the East. It was hard to ignore the pull of what was emerging from Shenzhen.

While the US Retreats, China Goes All-In

President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill dramatically accelerates the elimination of tax credits for renewable energy. The 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners was terminated on Dec. 31, disincentivizing American production and investment. Trump also signed an executive order to eliminate federal subsidies for “unreliable” green energy sources, including solar.

The Chinese government, on the other hand, has gone all-in on solar, battery, wind, and hydroelectric technologies. Solar panels, both residential and portable, have decreased in price by approximately 90% over the past decade, largely due to China’s large-scale manufacturing capabilities. The conversion efficiency (the percentage of harvested sunlight converted into actual electricity) averages around 25%, up from 19% last decade.

Simultaneously, LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery production has gone from a modest market share in 2010 to around 94% of global capacity. Chinese manufacturers, such as BYD and CATL, have risen to international dominance as a result.

How Portable Power Improves My Life

Two years ago, I sold my home-built battery inverter system, which I carried in my truck to harvest solar power, store it in a 12-volt DC battery bank, and convert it back to usable 120V AC power. I replaced it with a modern, integrated EcoFlow Delta 2 Max, an all-in-one portable power pack that boasts an integrated 2,400-watt AC inverter and a 2,048-watt-hour battery storage capacity. It features multiple charging options, with up to 1,000 watts of DC solar input and up to 1,800 watts of AC charging from a wall socket.

I’ve loaded the Delta 2 Max into my Land Cruiser behind the rear fold-down seat. I run a solar power line from a Lesun solar panel custom-cut for the vehicle’s hood. It produces about 65 watts during the day, which keeps the Delta 2 Max charged when I’m not using the truck regularly.

I run an AC line from the Land Cruiser’s integrated inverter to charge the battery as I’m driving. It provides juice to my Starlink Mini and my HP Dragonfly laptop. In addition, it powers the 12-volt Dometic 35-liter refrigerator, which my wife uses to transport food when we travel to the Outer Banks, where prices in the local grocery can be nearly double what they are on the mainland.

The View From the CES Floor: Dazzling Innovations

Given the importance of the Delta 2 Max in my life, my first stop at CES was the booth for EcoFlow, a China-based company. What I found simply amazed me. On display was everything from a 10,000-milliamp-hour magnetic phone charger to a modular, whole-home battery-powered inverter system with AC and solar inputs. The latter is one of the first consumer energy systems that collapses the gap between portable power, home backup, and grid-scale thinking into something a homeowner can actually buy, install, and live with.

Next, I met with the team at Jackery—a US firm owned by the Chinese tech company Shenzhen Hello Tech Energy—and found an equally expansive line of lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries and solar-generating options. I was impressed by the company’s pioneering XBC curved shingles, which are virtually indistinguishable from traditional terra cotta roof tiles. Solar tiles like these are the sort of product Musk championed many moons ago, but there has been little to no follow-through in the US.

Bluetti, a Shenzen-based company, also impressed me. I was particularly interested in its Pioneer Na Sodium‑Ion Portable Power Station—the first of its kind. The light-blue-colored battery has a 900-watt-hour capacity. Compared with lithium ions, sodium ions are larger and move more gently, causing less structural stress inside the battery’s crystal matrix. Sodium batteries consequently perform well in cold and hot environments and have many more charging cycles than lithium packs. Their only downside is the energy density—in the same-sized container, you get about half the power storage of lithium.

Bluetti representatives confirmed what the other Eastern suppliers were saying: Their fastest-growing market segment was the modular whole-home backup system. Many consumers had started with a 2-kilowatt-hour system (like my EcoFlow Delta 2 Max) and scaled up to 10-, 20-, or 40-kilowatt-hour systems, using modules that can be plugged easily into a home's existing infrastructure. As climate change worsens weather conditions, consumers want to ensure that if and when the grid goes down, they’ll still have power.

Bluetti, Jackery, and EcoFlow reps also said that customers are using whole-house versions of their systems to harness cheaper electricity during lower-cost rate times of day to help combat the rising price of power in the US.

The 'Drill, Baby, Drill' Mentality

I had one last visit on my list at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Tucked away in the Southern Hall was a newcomer to the scene: Aferiy, also out of Shenzen. The company is a self-described tier 2 manufacturer, with an emphasis on affordability. I appreciate its P280 Portable Power Station’s 2,048-watt-hour capacity and 2,000-watt inverter. It has similar specs to my Delta 2 Max, but was $400 cheaper.

Reps told me the company’s market share is growing in Europe, and it was just now beginning to get a foothold here in the States. I was impressed with their modern minimalist design and clear, easy-to-read LCDs. This was a well-thought-out product that shone bright.

I came away from CES with the impression of two countries with very different priorities. On our side, it’s “drill, baby, drill.” China, meanwhile, has nearly 650 gigawatts of installed solar capacity and adds more solar energy each year than the rest of the world combined.

I don’t think China is eating our lunch, per se. I think they made their own lunch. The nation invested in the kitchen, hired better chefs, refined its recipe year after year, and turned its offerings into something people like me genuinely crave. It really pains me to see the US fall so far behind.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/04Xr9mvEbuFE6LwHR5OkrzS-7.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1767985019.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 06:57:43.133737

,EPA,2026-01-11 10:15:01+00:00,The River Reporter,Advanced recycling could be America's next tech boom - The River Reporter,TAYLOR MILLARD for www.InsideSources.com,,,,,"https://riverreporter.com/stories/advanced-recycling-could-be-americas-next-tech-boom,240383","The technology needed for the advanced recycling revolution is here, says ACC President Ross Eisenberg.
That can’t happen at most of the 245 plastic recycling facilities nationwide, which use mechanical recycling processes that involve sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting and remolding plastic.
“The films, the pouches, the tubes, the synthetic textiles—they still end up in landfills because the existing recycling infrastructure we have here in the U.S. just can’t handle them.” That’s where advanced recycling comes in.
The private sector has embraced the concept, with billions of dollars being invested in advanced recycling technology, according to ACC.
“Developing advanced recycling technologies could promote domestic business and employment.","Welcome to the economic future of the United States: Big Tech, Big Data—and Big… Recycling?

That’s the conclusion of a new analysis from the American Chemistry Council (ACC), which says that if America dominates the coming advanced recycling industry the same way it has dominated technology, the results could be billions in economic activity and tens of thousands of jobs.

The technology needed for the advanced recycling revolution is here, says ACC President Ross Eisenberg. What’s needed is a new mindset. “Recycling is really manufacturing.”

Instead of looking at used plastics as a problem to be solved, he says, they should be seen as a resource to be monetized. That can’t happen at most of the 245 plastic recycling facilities nationwide, which use mechanical recycling processes that involve sorting, cleaning, shredding, melting and remolding plastic.

“Mechanical recycling is tried and true,” Eisenberg said, but it can’t handle many of the most common forms of plastic. “The films, the pouches, the tubes, the synthetic textiles—they still end up in landfills because the existing recycling infrastructure we have here in the U.S. just can’t handle them.”

That’s where advanced recycling comes in. Unlike mechanical recycling, advanced recycling turns plastics into a gas or liquid raw material —“reducing them back to molecules,” Eisenberg says—which can then be turned into “brand-new plastics for use in virtually any product or packaging type, including food- and pharmaceutical-grade plastics.”

Similar to the way the mining industry supplies raw materials that are turned into consumer products, recycling plastic into its raw form can supply industries with raw materials while removing massive amounts of plastic from the waste stream.

The private sector has embraced the concept, with billions of dollars being invested in advanced recycling technology, according to ACC.

A 2021 Government Accountability Office report touted the technology. “Chemical recycling can produce raw materials of virgin quality, thereby decreasing demand for fossil fuels and other natural resources,” the report states. “Developing advanced recycling technologies could promote domestic business and employment. Chemical recycling creates a market for plastic waste and a new way to reuse some plastics.”

The ACC analysis suggests that widespread use of advanced recycling would create 173,200 jobs with a total annual payroll of $12.8 billion. It could also add $48.7 billion in total economic output — the combined value of goods and services produced directly and indirectly as a result.

“Essentially the same economic contributions annually of the milk industry in the United States,” Eisenberg said.

The challenge is no longer technology, but regulation, Eisenberg says. Calling the current political landscape a “plethora of regulatory barriers,” he urged state and federal governments to consider the advanced recycling of plastics as manufacturing instead of waste incineration. Any plastic produced through this process would be subject to recycling regulations.

“We think that would really help unlock some of the private investment that has been waiting to go,” he said.

The ACC is calling for a consistent national framework with clear standards, funding, incentives, infrastructure build-up and public education. Eisenberg said those standards would help with the recycling process and recycled materials, along with waste reduction.

The plastics industry still faces plenty of skepticism from environmental groups and lawmakers. Organizations such as Greenpeace USA have claimed very little plastic is being recycled, and the World Wildlife Fund has called for a ban on single-use plastic cups and cutlery by the end of the year. More than 500 U.S. communities have banned single-use plastic bags, and a dozen states have done likewise.

According to Environmental Protection Agency data, 32 percent of disposable items are recycled annually. Raising that rate to the EPA’s goal of 50 percent by 2030 will require major changes in how plastics are processed.

Critics are stuck in the past, Eisenberg says, adding that the plastics industry has changed. Plastic products are now designed with “end of life” in mind from the outset of production. It’s an approach that, with the aid of new technology, can promote recycling and stimulate the economy.

“Obviously, there’s an environmental component to this,” Eisenberg says. “We want to clean up the environment. But there’s also a jobs component to this, and we don’t want that to be ignored.”

It hasn’t worked out that way. While the Legislature enthusiastically set climate goals, and keeps raising them, there have been more disappointments than successes.

One incontestable advance is the rapid adoption of heat pumps for homes, with Maine far ahead of most states in replacing oil furnaces – once commonplace – with efficient electric units. One key point is that Gov. Mills’s predecessor, Paul LePage, also liked heat pumps, supporting the generous subsidies Efficiency Maine uses to nudge homeowners to make the investment.

On all other energy matters, LePage’s views resemble President Trump’s, whose opposition to wind, solar and energy storage has been consistent and irrational. Trump is trying to bring back coal plants, of all things, the dirtiest and most hazardous way to generate electricity. Solar and wind have long been cheaper, even displacing natural gas.

Trump has cancelled offshore wind leases in New England and tried to prevent operation of turbines ready to go, imposing enormous costs on businesses and consumers and gaining nothing. It seems Trump’s inability to shut down turbine construction off the Scottish coast near one of his golf resorts is something the entire world now has to pay for.

At least this much is clear: Whatever energy policy Trump is espousing, Maine should do the opposite. But what can be done, in the face of massive federal hostility, for at least another year and possibly three?

First, we can acknowledge Maine’s own failures in energy policy, while building on promising initiatives that need to be expanded in the next administration.

The Mills administration’s confidence in plug-in cars was misplaced. Even with significant federal subsidies for all-electric vehicles – canceled by Trump – the response of Maine consumers was tepid, and for good reason.

It turns out vehicle range is still limited enough to deter Mainers, used to long trips, from ditching gas-powered cars, since thousands of charging stations would be needed to provide an effective network. Hybrids have proven a better bet. All-electric vehicles work best in large cities, which is exactly where transportation alternatives absent in Maine are most common.

In retrospect, Mills made a big mistake in spending at least $1 billion in additional Biden administration transportation funding entirely on the highway system, not even investigating greater use of buses, trains, ferries, pedestrian access and ride-sharing. Transportation contributes 50% of greenhouse gases produced in Maine, and there’s no effective strategy to reduce it.

Other states have pursued promising ideas through their tax systems. New York City finally instituted “congestion pricing” for private vehicles entering downtown Manhattan, despite Trump’s vow to shut it down. The additional tolls are used to repair and expand bus and train lines and, if Mayor Mamdani has his way, make buses free.

Hawaii enacted a 14% “tourist tax” on cruise ships – temporarily on hold due to a Trump administration challenge – that’s explicitly designed to combat the ravages of climate disruption. Maine, meanwhile, devotes its entire gasoline tax to highway maintenance, and has kept it at a flat 30 cents throughout the LePage and Mills administrations.

Even the project of “beneficial electrification” of housing, business and industry and transportation is in jeopardy due to rapidly rising electric rates, now reaching a painful threshold for many households. Unlike discontent over consumer prices in general, often more perceived than real, Maine residential rates have shot up more than 60% in less than a decade.

Candidates campaigning to “reduce electric rates,” as LePage did, should realize it’s going to take a lot of imagination and hard work just to prevent rates from rising further. The Public Utilities Commission’s rejection of a five-year phased rate increase from Central Maine Power was widely applauded, but does nothing to alter the underlying reality that it will take investment, and lots of it, to actually achieve our energy goals.

One welcome step at the end of the Mills administration was creating a Department of Energy Resources with Cabinet status, moving it from the Governor’s office. While there’s no immediate upgrade in staff or mission, the new department could launch a truly comprehensive energy plan in the next administration.

Face it: we can’t fight Mother Nature. The public deserves real leadership from elected officials, both executive and legislative. Instead of moving sand endlessly and building enormously expensive bridges that largely benefit out-of-state property owners, our money should be spent to improve the ferry system and to assist the local residents and business owners from Rodanthe to Ocracoke as they adjust to fewer tourists.

Trump’s flawed strategy

Like statements by other leaders with imperial ambitions, the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy, published one month ago, frames the suppression of other countries as necessary: “The United States must be preeminent in the Western Hemisphere as a condition of our security and prosperity — a condition that allows us to assert ourselves confidently where and when we need to in the region.”

Like Putin with Ukraine, Trump sees Venezuela as his backyard. Putin invaded Ukraine, and Ukrainians still fight after four years. Now America started invading Venezuela. How can the Washington masterminds think that Venezuelans, whether they like Maduro or not, will let Americans “run” their country? Don’t Iraq and Afghanistan ring some bells in their heads?

Unappreciated architecture

In response to: “Couple rescues NC modernist home,” (12/25):

As a kid in the 1960s, I often visited the residential architecture section of our Encyclopedia Britannica, which had photos of revered houses from around the world, including TWO Matsumoto gems in Raleigh, which made the City of Oaks seem urbane. The N&O story puts the lie to that perception; for years, private citizens have had to fund and forge the redemption of Modernist masterpieces here.

If a city is lucky enough to have examples from Frank Lloyd Wright or George Matsumoto, it has an obligation to the world to keep them safe and sound. NC State University and the City of Raleigh are grossly negligent in this regard. If the Matsumoto works were not designed by an Asian American, would they be treated with more respect?

Legislative priorities

I am saddened and disgusted that our legislature has the time, wherewithal, and drive to pass yet more gender identity legislation and yet is unable to pass a budget which impacts health care, education, and compensation of teachers and other dedicated state employees. It’s time to focus on that what is important to the health and welfare of our people and state.

NC lottery problems

In response to: The NC Education Lottery’s sales are up, but schools are getting less. Let’s fix that. (Dec. 30):

Andrew Dunn’s column on the lottery was exactly on the mark, rightly noting the sordid history Democrats played in passing the lottery (I remember the vote well). Had he stopped there, I would have undoubtedly been writing in complaint. However, he continued with equal accuracy and objectivity to note that Republicans have come to embrace vice as a revenue strategy (great turn of phrase!). I also appreciated that he dug deeper to find the source of the problem (more digital games = more prizes = less money for education).

Thank you for a thoughtful, critical, and fair column.

PFAS changes

North Carolina has been particularly impacted by PFAS pollutants discharged into our drinking water sources. The EPA’s new proposal to loosen reporting requirements for businesses that make or use PFAS will harm communities in NC. A foundational element of the Clean Water Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act is accountability: A polluter needs to report on the type and amount of chemicals that it discharges. The PFAS reporting rule finalized in 2024 required companies manufacturing 6 PFAS varients between 2011 and 2022 to disclose how those chemicals were used and to provide available environmental or health data.

But the EPA’s new proposed rule, by the EPA’s own estimate, would eliminate more than 97% of the information that would otherwise be generated by the 2024 rule. The proposed rule is a distortion of previous laws and privatizes the profits of the chemical industry while socializing its costs.

India sold were at 2.3 million units of electric vehicle in 2025, making up 8 per cent of all new vehicle registrations, according to a new report by the India Energy Storage Alliance, based on Vahan Portal data, cited by ANI. This boost was driven by incentives offered by the government and festive seasons. The majority portion of the sales were two-wheelers at 1.28 million units. The total registrations recorded in the overall passenger car market in the year 2025 stood at 28.2 million. Two-wheelers marked the most registrations 20 million registrations, while passenger cars were at 4.4 million and agricultural vehicles recorded 1.06 million. The recorded sales rose steadily throughout the year though slightly improved in the festival seasons due to GST benefits. Electric two-wheelers were the stars of the EV market, grabbing 57 per cent of sales. Three-wheelers came second with 0.8 million units (35 per cent), while four-wheelers logged 175,000 units. The report spotted good progress in electric delivery vehicles, especially in smaller commercial segments.Uttar Pradesh was at the forefront in this, with 400,000 units sold, taking an 18 percent market share in India's EV segment. Maharashtra followed, with 266,000 units sold, contributing 12 percent to the segment, followed by Karnataka, with 200,000 units sold, contributing 9 percent to the market. The three accounted for over 40 percent in the country's EV sales. Some smaller states recorded a very encouraging uptake of EVs. Delhi, Kerala, and Goa were able to reach an EV-to-ICE ratio of 14 percent, 12 percent, and 11 percent respectively. Meanwhile, states from the Northeast, Tripura, and Assam, achieved ratios of 18 percent and 14 percent, respectively. A major achievement was recorded in the three-wheeler segment, which attained a market penetration of 32 per cent. The government also created a record with their biggest ever order of electric buses—10,900 unit—valued at a massive Rs 10,900 crore through the PM E-DRIVE scheme. The report also stated that that while smaller vehicles led EV adoption, government efforts to electrify larger commercial vehicles and develop charging infrastructure were setting up India's EV sector for continued growth beyond 2025.

What happens next matters a lot to families and businesses across the Tennessee Valley.
That disconnect should trouble anyone who believes a public utility exists to serve the public first.
Groups like the Tennessee Utility Consumer Alliance and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy are watching closely — and so should Congress.
It will be whether families and businesses across the Tennessee Valley can rely on affordable, dependable power.","The Tennessee Valley Authority was created to serve the public, not to enrich executives or gamble with ratepayers' money. That simple truth is worth repeating right now.

After months without a quorum, TVA finally has a functioning board. The U.S. Senate has confirmed four of the five members nominated by President Donald Trump, allowing the agency to resume business that had effectively been frozen. What happens next matters a lot to families and businesses across the Tennessee Valley.

TVA is not just another utility. Since 1933, it has been a public trust, charged with delivering reliable, affordable power to a seven-state region. But in recent years, that mission has drifted. Costs have risen. Accountability has weakened. And ordinary ratepayers are being asked to shoulder the burden.

Consider this: Under former CEO Jeff Lyash, TVA paid a salary of more than $10 million a year. His successor earns less, but still an exorbitant amount. Meanwhile, TVA employees are sharing $260 million in performance bonuses this year, an average of more than $8,000 per worker, even as customers have seen base rates jump nearly 10% in just two years.

At the same time, roughly 600 employees took voluntary buyouts, including TVA's former chief nuclear officer, who received $3.3 million in compensation despite the fact that three of TVA's nuclear plants spent much of last winter offline. That is not a formula for public confidence.

TVA leadership insists big spending decisions are necessary to meet future demand. Data centers like Elon Musk's xAI are lining up for power in the Valley. Federal officials and Tennessee's senators are pushing TVA toward new nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors. On paper, these projects promise innovation and growth.

But TVA has been down this road before. In the 1970s, it embarked on an ambitious nuclear expansion plan that ballooned into more than $20 billion in debt. Seventeen reactors were planned. Only seven were completed. Ratepayers are still paying for those mistakes decades later.

Today's small modular reactors have yet to prove they can deliver power at a competitive cost. Low-income Tennesseans relying on government assistance to cover energy bills are still waiting on help halted during the federal shutdown. That disconnect should trouble anyone who believes a public utility exists to serve the public first.

TVA says it will make sure the cost of new generation doesn't land on ratepayers. But local power distributors are already being told to prepare for another rate increase. Groups like the Tennessee Utility Consumer Alliance and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy are watching closely — and so should Congress.

Both Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty have called for changes at TVA. They're right to ask hard questions. Voters may argue about many things, but they understand one reality very clearly: When the electric bill goes up, families feel it.

That's why this new board matters. Its first responsibility should be affordability and accountability. Continuing to hand out large bonuses while warning customers to brace for higher bills and potential blackouts isn't just bad optics — it's tone-deaf.

People are still grappling with inflation. Small businesses are operating on tight margins. A public utility cannot behave like a private corporation.

The path forward isn't complicated. The board must scrutinize executive compensation, demand transparency in major projects, resist unnecessary rate hikes and insist that new technologies make financial sense before ratepayers are asked to fund them.

TVA is at a crossroads. The measure of success won't be how many data centers it attracts or how big the next reactor looks on a rendering. It will be whether families and businesses across the Tennessee Valley can rely on affordable, dependable power.

That was TVA's original promise. The new board should remember it — and honor it.

More than 3,800 research grants were abruptly terminated in 2025, pulling $3 billion in active research funding from the U.S. scientific enterprise.
Driven by the influence of fossil fuel interests, nowhere is this assault more targeted than in climate science.
The Trump administration has already fired climate experts across federal agencies, terminated the National Climate Assessment, and scrubbed climate data from government websites.
Still, even as the Trump administration erodes America’s climate capacity, universities and subnational governments across the country have refused to surrender progress.","The year 2025 began with President Trump withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement — the opening salvo in what would become a concerted campaign to dismantle the nation’s ability to combat climate change. From there, the Trump administration moved aggressively to gut key emissions standards for power plants and vehicles; suspend offshore wind projects; open millions of acres of protected land for fossil fuel extraction; extend the life of dirty coal plants; and reverse key Inflation Reduction Act initiatives. By November, the value of clean energy project cancellations stood at $32 billion, and the number of clean energy jobs lost at 40,000.

These policy reversals will set back the clean energy transition and lock in fossil fuels for years, but this White House’s most enduring damage will be the destruction of the scientific infrastructure that has enabled our understanding of climate change and informed our policies to combat it. Through the disruption of research programs, shuttering of agencies and institutions, mass firings of experts, and elimination of career paths, the Trump administration is undermining climate science in ways that will hobble American competitiveness for generations.

In effect, the United States is now dismantling its own capacity to address climate change, while ceding leadership in the clean energy economy to competitors like China. More than 3,800 research grants were abruptly terminated in 2025, pulling $3 billion in active research funding from the U.S. scientific enterprise. Each canceled grant represents years of painstaking work abandoned, research teams left without salaries, and important breakthrough discoveries that may now never happen. Universities across the country have also faced the effects of political influence on science, corrupting what was once determined by peer review and injecting political ideology into scientific funding decisions. Driven by the influence of fossil fuel interests, nowhere is this assault more targeted than in climate science. The Trump administration has already fired climate experts across federal agencies, terminated the National Climate Assessment, and scrubbed climate data from government websites. Most alarming is the announced closure of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a cornerstone institution that develops the world’s most widely used atmospheric and climate models, now branded a source of “climate alarmism.” The administration has also threatened to close federal atmospheric research offices and regional climate adaptation centers, which communities depend on to prepare for climate impacts.

The intentional damage extends beyond research; it also devastates the pipeline of future scientists who would normally drive American climate innovation. Universities have curtailed PhD admissions, paused offers to prospective students, and limited fellowships. Early career researchers face funding uncertainty and the prospect of being forced out of the field. The climate of instability and political interference is causing young people who are committed to pursuing climate science careers to reconsider their paths entirely, calculating that a system where research funding depends on political winds rather than scientific merit does not offer them a secure future. Anecdotes of researchers considering leaving the U.S. for more supportive environments abound. And as America drives its brightest minds away or abroad, China doubles down on research investment, racing ahead in an industrial transformation that dominates global electric vehicle markets and clean technology manufacturing.

Still, even as the Trump administration erodes America’s climate capacity, universities and subnational governments across the country have refused to surrender progress. Some universities have engaged in litigation to overturn funding cuts and have invested some of their endowments into research programs to sustain critical work. Climate coalitions of state-level governments and academic institutions have announced reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 24% below 2005 levels, while continuing to grow local economies. Committed states have achieved roughly 45% reductions in electricity sector emissions through cleaner power generation, and many have enacted binding clean electricity standards that lock in their progress.

The damage Trump is inflicting on American climate science will reverberate for decades. The lost discoveries, ignored human talent, and ceded global leadership will not be recovered quickly. However, the resistance from states, cities, and universities reveals that American climate progress is resilient. It will be up to us to sustain this momentum until federal policy realigns with reality.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/DSGDU6KWDZBNXJ3PQU3WKGEDG4.jpg?auth=cfb7ebb37e5b7b3e34480f6792b573a5331e578274cb623e956e529bd8486e81&width=1200,N,,2026-01-11 00:58:00.842489

It was fresh, it was entirely new and it was late November, 2021 – although the car had actually been in production since early 2020.

In fact, the production version was officially unveiled in February, 2019 and made its first public appearance at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show that month.

Yes, it’s been updated since then, but that’s still an awfully long time in the electric vehicle universe which is evolving and expanding at an exponentially rapid rate.

Polestar by the way is an offshoot of Volvo, now owned by the Chinese conglomerate Geely and the cars, or ours at least, are manufactured in China. It also has a factory in Ridgeville, South Carolina, presumably to keep Mr Trump happy, but it must be more costly to make vehicles there.

So, does the Polestar 2 still cut it?

STYLING

A facelifted Polestar 2 was revealed in January, 2023 when rear-wheel drive was adopted as the default.

The entry grade was previously front-drive.

The single motor model was also upgraded to produce 223kW of power and 489Nm of torque, resulting in a faster 0-100km/h time of 6.2 seconds.

Dual-motor models received a boost to 314kW and 740Nm, with 0-100km/h reduced to just 4.5 seconds.

At this time the long-range battery was also upgraded to a capacity of 82kWh.

Since then, however, power outputs have been adjusted to produce a clear, linear progression through the range, starting at 200kW and topping out at 350kW.

The upgrade saw the original mesh grille replaced by a blanked-out version, with an array of sensors and a camera in the centre.

The single motor, standard range is $55,509 driveaway, the long-range single motor version is $74,619 and the long range, dual motor, all-wheel drive is $81,444.

Metallic paint is standard and all models start with the same basic range of equipment.

You can crank the vibe up a notch or two with the addition of various option packs.

Our test vehicle this time around was the Polestar 2 long range single motor version, with a recommended retail price of $66,400 before on-roads and claimed range of 659km – that’s better than some conventional cars.

Standard kit includes embossed, textured textile trim and two-zone filtered air with vents for the rear seats.

Driver and front passenger seats are heated and partly power adjustable, with four-way power lumbar adjustment for the driver. The angle of the seatback must be adjusted manually.

The car rides on 19-inch alloys with wheel covers and has touch-operated locking with puddle lights, LED headlights with active beam, adaptive rear LED lights, retractable frameless mirrors, auto lights and wipers, auto-dimming rear-view mirror, front and rear park sensors and a foot-operated tailgate.

Additional features can be added with the addition of accessory packs: Climate Pack ($1500), Pro ($1900), Plus ($4700) or Performance ($8990).

Pilot Pack which was $3400 is now standard, which means Blind Spot is now standard, begging the question: why is it still listed at all?

Among other things the Climate Pack adds an energy saving heat pump.

Pro adds 20-inch graphite wheels, gold valve caps and black seat belts with a Swedish gold stripe.

Plus brings a raft of features for the price including a full-length glass roof, Harman Kardon sound and a power-operated tailgate.

The Performance Pack is available only with Long Range Dual Motor that has been fitted with the Plus Pack, and not relevant to our review.

Buying a Polestar is a bit different. The whole process takes place online from ordering to payment.

What about a test drive, I hear you ask? You can book that here, either at a designated ‘space’ in each capital city or location requested by you.

Polestar offers a five-year five warranty, along with five years complimentary servicing and roadside assistance.

The battery is covered by an eight-year/160,000km warranty.

Generally, Polestar 2 doesn’t need to be serviced for up to two years or 30,000km.

INFOTAINMENT

Polestar 2 is the first car to come with a built-in Google operating system.

Infotainment is controlled from an 11.2-inch portrait-style touchscreen, now looking somewhat small in comparison to competitors.

High Performance Audio delivers 250 watts through eight speakers, including a bass-boosting air woofer mounted under the bonnet.

The OS includes Google Assistant, Google Maps, with charging options and Google Play Store, which offers optimised in-car apps for seamless integration (with Gemini coming).

There’s also Bluetooth, wi-fi hotspot, FM and DAB+ digital radio, but no AM band – so no emergency broadcasts in tunnels.

Android Auto is supported as is Apple CarPlay, but neither is wireless.

The system is connected to the net via 4G and receives over-the-air updates like a phone.

It will even make an automatic emergency call in the event of an accident (or if the car has been stolen).

Connected Services are complimentary for 12 months but after that you will have to pay to continue using them.

There are two USB Type-C ports in front and two more in the rear of the car, with a 12-volt socket for the luggage area.

You can use the ports to charge your compatible devices, but they do not offer a data connection.

SAFETY

Polestar 2 gets a full five-star crash rating from ANCAP, with a rear-view camera and eight airbags including a centre airbag.

There’s also autonomous emergency braking (Car-to-Car, Vulnerable Road User and Junction Assist) as well as a lane support system with lane keep assist (LKA), lane departure warning (LDW) and emergency lane keeping (ELK), and an advanced speed assistance system (SAS).

Surprisingly, there’s no head-up display for the windscreen.

ENGINES/TRANSMISSIONS

With a 82 kWh Lithium-ion battery, 79 kWh of which is useable, the electric powertrain in this particular model produces 220kW of power and 490Nm of torque, with drive to the rear wheels through a single reduction gear transmission.

DRIVING

Polestar 2 is described as a fastback, but liftback is closer to the mark.

It’s just over 4.6 metres in length, just under 2.0 metres wide with mirrors and has a 2735mm wheelbase.

The sloping tailgate lifts to reveal a long but shallow luggage area, with another hidden area underneath and 407 litres of luggage space.

A small front boot or ‘froot’ is hidden under the bonnet, with a capacity of 43 litres and is handy for storing cables.

There’s no exterior release for the boot which is somewhat annoying as you fumble for the key fob.

You won’t find a spare tyre either with a puncture repair kit provided in the event of a flat.

The 2 was designed by Thomas Ingenlath alongside the Volvo XC40 with which it shares a platform.

The decision to incorporate a radiator grille was a good one because it gave the car a classy look.

The removal of the grille with the latest update, replacing it with a solid panel was a retrograde step in our opinion.

Inside, the fit out is Swedish and minimalist, with grey wood veneer trim and a cabin that has a light airy ambience.

So far so good, but coming from an SUV, the cockpit feels a bit cramped and lacks storage space, with only a small console box.

Much of the available space is given over to the wireless phone charger, which tended to heat up our phones.

Two cupholders are provided, but they are end to end. One is covered by the sliding lid of the console box, and not very practical – back seat passengers get the standard two.

I’m 183cm and my feet kept getting tangled with the foot pedals getting in and out of the car.

Rear legroom is not as generous as you might expect.

Air outlets are provided but the rear windows only partially wind down.

The dash from 0-100km/h takes 6.2 seconds which is pretty quick.

Energy consumption is claimed at 15.8 kWh/100km and the long-range single motor test vehicle has a claimed range of 659km (WLTP).

That’s commensurate with a conventional ICE vehicle, but of course it takes much longer to fill up.

The test vehicle displayed an initial range of 520km while a full overnight recharge upped this to 530km, still 130km short of its supposed range? We were getting 14.9 kWh/100km after 550km of driving.

It took us a while to find the trip metre.

Charging takes as little as 28 minutes using a public, high-powered DC fast charger or eight hours with a home Wallbox – that is if you have three-phase power.

We’ve yet to find a charger that can deliver this kind of speed, even with a bank of Tesla Superchargers just down the road.

The car is supplied with a ‘granny’ or home charge cable, but this can take up to 41 hours for a full charge from a 10A household power point.

Most manufacturers are no longer supplying additional cables as charging stations provide their own (just like a petrol station).

It’s easy to become fixated on range, but it is not really an issue with an EV such as the long range, single motor model, provided you have ready access to a charger when required.

Like Volvos there’s no key or start button. Just hop in, put your foot on the brake, put it into drive and off you go.

Acceleration is quick, but not lightning quick. It’s fast enough however to make you think you’re behind the wheel of something special.

Helping to keep the battery topped up is regenerative braking, which reclaims power when the car is travelling downhill.

You can choose between two levels of regenerative braking or adopt one-pedal mode where there’s no need to apply the brakes.

Just lifting off the accelerator brings the car to a stop. It takes some practice, but may not be to everyone’s liking.

The car weighs over two tonnes, but has a low centre of gravity which helps it sit flat in corners. The weight also impacts the suspension, taking a little longer to respond to bumps.

The ride is sporty. Think Euro firm, but we didn’t find it jarring on our test circuit through the backlots.

But all-in-all the handling is surefooted and it does not become unsettled by unexpected bumps mid-corner like some cars.

Of note be sure you shut the doors properly as the car failed to lock with a door slightly ajar (and did not supply a warning).

We had a running battle with the Google operating system.

We could connect to Android Auto only with the original cable that came with our Google Pixel and both our phones (Pixels) failed repeatedly to reconnect on re-entry.

Google Maps is the default for navigation, but we prefer the more user-friendly Waze which also supports speed camera warnings.

Navigating with Android Auto saw the car totally lose the plot in one of Sydney’s many tunnels.

It’s okay when it works.

SUMMING UP

Polestar 2 remains a favourite, but it has lost the instant appeal that it once had.

It continues however to offer a tight, sporty drive, or very sporty in the case of the dual motor, all-wheel drive version with the works.

At the same time, it’s difficult to believe that the first car to get the complete Google operating system does not support wireless CarPlay or Android Auto, and that it is very picky about the cable you use – that brings back memories.

Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition The Piedmont Environmental Council and nearly 30 environmental, preservation, and climate advocacy groups formed the Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition in late 2023.","The demise of the coal industry left much of Appalachia in economic tatters, with lost jobs, spoiled water, and depopulated communities across the coalfields of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia. Now, in an ironic twist of the region’s energy history, tech companies and data center developers are eyeing these same rural landscapes with ambitious plans to power the artificial intelligence revolution.

From the hollows of Tucker County, West Virginia, to the former strip mines of Wise County, Virginia, proposals for massive data center complexes are sparking both hope and fierce resistance. Proponents promise economic revitalization and tax revenues for struggling communities. Critics warn of environmental degradation, soaring utility bills for residents, limited job creation, and the stripping away of local control over development decisions.

The stakes are enormous. According to a September 2025 report from the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia initiative, approximately 92 gigawatts of data center capacity are currently in the pipeline across the United States, with seven gigawatts being added monthly by the end of 2024. Traditional data center hubs like Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” are becoming saturated, pushing growth toward rural regions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky.

Where Data Centers Stand Today

Northern Virginia remains the undisputed capital of the data center world, with roughly 300 operational facilities across Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William counties. Northern Virginia is one of the world’s largest internet interconnection hubs. But capacity constraints and community opposition are forcing the industry to look elsewhere. West Virginia has thrown out the largest welcome mat in the region.

In Appalachia proper, data center development remains nascent but is accelerating rapidly. Southwest Virginia’s Wise County hosts the Mineral Gap Data Center, which came online in 2023 and is powered by a 3.4-megawatt solar array built on former strip-mined land—widely promoted as the first abandoned mine land converted to solar in Virginia. OnePartner ATAC runs a facility in Duffield, Virginia.

In January 2025, developers announced plans for Kentucky’s first hyperscale data center in Louisville, a 400-megawatt campus to be developed by PowerHouse Data Centers and Poe Companies, with utility service from Louisville Gas and Electric. The Lane Report noted the project is expected to begin operations by late 2026. It will likely represent a demonstration of what can be exported to Eastern Kentucky.

Southwest Virginia’s Growing Pipeline

Beyond the Wise County proposals, data center interest is spreading across Southwest Virginia, often into communities with minimal regulatory frameworks to evaluate such projects.

In early December 2025, Wythe County announced its first data center: a 99-acre AI computing campus at Progress Park to be developed by Solis Arx, a newly formed digital infrastructure company led by CEO Rob Noll. Cardinal News reported that county officials project the facility will represent more than $1 billion in total investment. County Administrator Stephen Bear told the Wythe County Board of Supervisors that the project would generate more than $10 million in annual tax revenue by 2028, making Solis Arx the county’s single largest taxpayer.

The company claims its facility will consume only about 2,000 gallons of water daily—roughly equivalent to a restaurant—by using closed-loop and air-based cooling systems rather than the evaporative cooling that can require hundreds of thousands of gallons per day at older facilities. Appalachian Power will provide electricity, with water supplied by the town of Wytheville.

At a December 9, 2025 board meeting covered by Cardinal News, nearly all of the dozen residents who spoke during public comment opposed the project or raised concerns about electricity rates, water supplies, environmental impacts, and the loss of rural character. Resident Hannah Ainsworth questioned the trajectory of such development: “It’s 99 acres proposed today, but what about next year, in three years? At what point is our region unrecognizable?”

Board of Supervisors Chairman Brian Vaught acknowledged a significant vulnerability in how such projects arrive. Wythe County is one of approximately seven Virginia counties that lack zoning ordinances governing where data centers can be built. “So until that’s addressed, if you don’t live in the town of Wytheville or the town of Rural Retreat, one of these could pop up as your neighbor,” Vaught said, according to Cardinal News.

Pulaski County may not be far behind. The 2025 Virginia General Assembly allocated $15 million for site readiness improvements—including road extensions, grading, and natural gas pipeline work—to support what budget documents describe as “up to $3.0 billion in capital investment” through construction of a data center and power plant. The project remains under nondisclosure agreements, with no developer publicly identified, according to Inside Climate News and Cardinal News.

Montgomery County supervisors are also weighing the issue. Cardinal News reported in mid-December 2025 that local officials are considering commissioning a study on data center zoning—a sign that even communities without active proposals recognize the need to prepare for an industry expanding rapidly across the region.

The Wise County Vision: Mine Water Cooling

One of the most ambitious proposals involves transforming 65,000 acres of former coal mining land in Wise County, Virginia, into an energy hub including data centers. A nonprofit venture called Energy DELTA Lab, managed by Will Clear and Will Payne, envisions building a massive 450-acre “Data Center Ridge” on top of old mining lands that could be powered and cooled using billions of gallons of water that naturally replenish in abandoned underground mines.

In a December 2025 report, the Thomson Reuters Foundation detailed how the entrepreneurs hope to prove the feasibility of their idea to Texas-based Energy Transfer, which owns the land managed by Penn Virginia Operating Co. Unlike neighboring areas plagued by acid mine drainage, the Wise County coalfields lack the mineral pyrite that contaminates water. The underground mine water maintains a temperature of 55 degrees or below, roughly 10 to 15 degrees cooler than river water typically used for data center cooling elsewhere in Virginia.

Payne told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the water quality makes the site attractive for data center cooling. He acknowledged, however, that the region faces deep skepticism about outside development. “Anyone looking at expanding in the region, there is skepticism because there have been so many stories of promises made but not kept,” Payne said, according to the Reuters report.

Canary Media reported in September 2024 that tax revenues from data centers could help address the region’s fiscal crisis. Will Clear told Canary Media that local government finances face an existential threat without new development. The Virginia Mercury reported in July 2024 that a 36-megawatt data center could provide about $464 million in capital investment and create approximately 40 high-income jobs.

West Virginia’s Controversial Push

West Virginia has become the most aggressive state in pursuing data center development, passing sweeping legislation in April 2025 that strips local governments of regulatory authority over such projects. House Bill 2014, championed by Governor Patrick Morrisey as the centerpiece of his economic development agenda, prohibits counties and municipalities from enforcing zoning ordinances, permitting requirements, noise regulations, or code enforcement on certified microgrid districts or “high-impact” data center projects.

The law also diverts most property tax revenue from data centers away from local taxing bodies to state coffers. Under the final version, only 30% of property tax proceeds go to the host county, with five percent divided among the state’s other 54 counties. The West Virginia Gazette-Mail reported that this formula is estimated to cost counties and school districts millions of dollars.

Upon the bill’s passage, Morrisey declared it “the economic development bill of the session,” according to the Gazette-Mail. “West Virginia is America’s energy state, and this law is going to demonstrate it to the whole country that we are ready for action,” Morrisey said in a statement reported by Mountain State Spotlight.

At least four major data center projects are now publicly known in West Virginia. The most controversial involves Fundamental Data LLC, a Virginia-based company seeking to build a 1,656-megawatt natural gas power plant and data center complex on 500 acres between the towns of Thomas and Davis in Tucker County. The Wall Street Journal reported that the proposed facility could eventually span 10,000 acres across Tucker and Grant counties if fully realized.

Kentucky: Multiple Proposals, Growing Debate

Kentucky’s data center conversation has moved quickly from possibility to reality. Beyond the Louisville hyperscale campus, the Kentucky Lantern reported in August 2025 on a proposed multi-billion-dollar “technology campus” with data centers in Mason County, though key details remain thin, and local reaction has included both hope and skepticism.

In Oldham County, Louisville Public Media reported that residents organized against a proposed hyperscale data center, and the controversy has become a statewide case study in zoning disputes, noise concerns, and rural quality-of-life politics. The fight illustrates how quickly economic development proposals can become community flashpoints when a hyperscale project lands on rural ground.

The Economic Equation

The Promise of Tax Revenue

Proponents argue that data centers represent one of the few realistic options for diversifying Appalachian economies devastated by coal’s decline. The numbers from Virginia’s experience are eye-catching. According to Loudoun County officials quoted by the Citizens Voice in December 2025, data centers generate 35 to 40% of the county’s General Fund revenue, with fiscal contributions jumping from $1 million in fiscal year 2018 to $875 million in 2024. That figure is projected to reach $1.1 billion by fiscal year 2026.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers study cited by Virginia Business found that between 2017 and 2021, data centers contributed $54.2 billion to Virginia’s gross domestic product. Southwest Virginia localities have positioned themselves to capture some of this wealth by implementing the state’s lowest regional property tax rate on data center equipment at 24 cents per $100 of assessed value, compared to $3.70 in Prince William County, according to Virginia Business.

The Jobs Question

Critics contend that data centers deliver far fewer permanent jobs than their industrial footprint suggests. According to an October 2025 report from ReImagine Appalachia, most data center employment is in construction, and those jobs are often contracted from outside the communities where facilities are built.

A typical data center adds up to 1,500 workers during construction but employs only about 50 full-time workers when operational, according to a 2024 Virginia state report cited by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Those permanent positions are primarily security or janitorial staff.

At an April 2025 town hall meeting in Davis, West Virginia, covered by 100 Days in Appalachia, electrical engineer Brian Reed—whose family has been in Tucker County since 1896—challenged the jobs pitch. “$12 an hour isn’t a job, you can’t survive,” Reed said. “The operators in the plant where I work make $43 an hour. That’s a job that makes a difference. So don’t offer jobs that are for security people that are going to starve to death.”

Nationwide, data center employment grew from 306,000 to 501,000 workers between 2016 and 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But more than 40% of those jobs are concentrated in just three states, far from Appalachia’s coalfields, as reported by West Virginia Watch.

Environmental Concerns

The Water Challenge

Data centers rank among the top ten water-consuming commercial industries in the United States. A medium-sized facility can consume around 110 million gallons of water annually for cooling, with some consuming up to 5 million gallons daily, according to a report from the University of Tulsa. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute reported that data centers in Northern Virginia collectively consumed nearly 2 billion gallons of water in 2023, a 63% increase from 2019.

Water consumption varies significantly based on cooling technology. Evaporative or wet cooling requires substantial water withdrawals and raises concerns in drought-prone areas like Maricopa County, Arizona, which has been inundated by data center developments. Air cooling reduces water needs but increases electricity consumption. The Wise County proposal’s closed-loop mine-water cooling approach attempts to change the equation by using cool underground mine water as a heat sink, potentially eliminating dependence on surface water or municipal systems.

Water concerns are particularly acute in some Appalachian locations. Tucker County, West Virginia, suffered through a severe drought in 2024 that forced emergency water pumping from the Blackwater River. 100 Days in Appalachia reported that in neighboring Thomas, the reservoir reached its lowest level in 60 years, rendering water unusable due to high iron concentrations.

In a December 2025 Brookings Institution podcast, Davis Mayor Al Tomson expressed concern about cumulative water impacts. “We’ve suffered a drought for the last two summers,” Tomson said. “We’ve had to go to our secondary water source, which is the Blackwater River. But if the data centers start drawing water out of the aquifer... I’m concerned that it’s gonna affect the source water for the creek that we’re using right now.”

Noise Pollution

The constant hum of cooling systems and backup generators has emerged as one of the most contentious issues for communities living near data centers. According to TechTarget, facilities produce noise levels between 55 and 85 decibels from cooling fans, mechanical chillers, and ventilation systems—sounds that are particularly intrusive in rural areas where residents moved seeking quiet.

In Northern Virginia, Amazon Web Services data centers near the Great Oak subdivision in Manassas have drawn persistent complaints. WUSA9 reported that residents describe the sound as a low roar combined with a high-pitched whir. “These data centers are loud, noisy beasts, and they are being built too close to residential areas,” community activist Roger Yackel told WUSA9. “That’s not something that we should have to live with.”

The Prince William Times reported in December 2022 that noise remediation can cost millions of dollars, and unless regulators apply pressure, companies may be slow to implement solutions. In Tucker County, the prospect of constant industrial noise near the tourist towns of Davis and Thomas—known for stargazing, hiking, and natural beauty—has fueled fierce opposition.

Air Quality and Diesel Risk

Large data centers typically rely on diesel backup generators that produce air pollution during testing and emergencies. The Parsons Advocate of Tucker County reported that the Fundamental Data project there would include 30 million gallons of diesel fuel storage to back up its natural gas power plant.

The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection approved an air quality permit for the Tucker County facility in August 2025 over strenuous community objections. The Intermountain newspaper in Elkins, West Virginia, reported that more than 1,600 written comments were submitted during the public comment period.

“We are extremely disappointed that the West Virginia DEP really isn’t upholding their mission to protect our air, land, and water,” Nikki Forrester of Tucker United told The Intermountain. “They discussed at the public meeting that they’ve never rejected an air quality permit before.”

Community Backlash: Three Overlapping Camps

Across Appalachia, community reactions to data center proposals tend to fall into three overlapping camps. The first is the development coalition: county officials, industrial development authorities, some trades, landowners, and utilities who argue that data centers represent a once-in-a-generation chance to replace the coal-era tax base and keep young people local.

The second is the quality-of-life coalition: nearby residents, tourism businesses, and preservation groups focused on noise, light pollution, traffic, and land conversion. The third is the accountability coalition: people who might tolerate a project if rules are strict, demanding transparency about corporate identity, enforceable limits, and binding community benefits.

In Pittsylvania County, Virginia, grassroots organizing successfully blocked Balico LLC’s proposal to build what would have been Virginia’s largest natural gas power plant at 3,500 megawatts alongside a hyperscale data center campus.

In Tucker County, residents formed Tucker United within weeks of learning about the Fundamental Data proposal. West Virginia Watch reported that the group now counts hundreds of members. “No Data Center in Tucker County” signs have proliferated in windows, storefronts, and on vehicles throughout Davis and Thomas.

One recurring complaint involves the lack of transparency from developers. Fundamental Data’s air permit application was heavily redacted, with the company claiming confidential business information. The firm’s public website consists only of a logo and a copyright notice, as noted by 100 Days in Appalachia.

“The company hasn’t come down and spoken with us at all,” Forrester told Corporate Crime Reporter in August 2025. “From a local leadership standpoint, none of us were aware that this was even a possibility. It feels like it’s a power grab where they want to get rid of any local control, take the money, and leave West Virginians to suffer.”

WVVA reported in April 2025 that more than 1,000 West Virginians signed a petition asking Governor Morrisey to veto HB 2014. He signed it anyway.

Utility Companies in the Mix

This is not just a technology story—it’s a utility planning story. Several major utilities are positioning themselves to serve the anticipated data center boom in Appalachia.

American Electric Power, the parent company of Appalachian Power in West Virginia and Kentucky Power in eastern Kentucky, has emerged as a key player. Data Center Dynamics reported in February 2025 that AEP expects to bring 4.7 gigawatts of new data center capacity online in 2025 alone and has customer commitments for 20 gigawatts of incremental load by 2030.

Louisville Gas and Electric will serve Kentucky’s first hyperscale data center campus. Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility and the company most directly tied to Northern Virginia’s data center concentration, is expanding infrastructure across the Commonwealth. In Southwest Virginia, Appalachian Power and Dominion Energy provide electricity to the region where the Energy DELTA Lab project is proposed.

FirstEnergy has announced $15 billion for power infrastructure investments to support data center growth, according to the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia report. The company serves customers across Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator covering much of coal-country Appalachia, has become central to debates about supply, demand, and rate impacts. West Virginia Public Broadcasting reported that projected data center load growth far exceeds new supply coming online in the near term.

Will Electric Bills Rise?

The short answer appears to be yes, and in some cases dramatically. Data center demand has already contributed to soaring wholesale electricity prices across the PJM Interconnection, the regional grid that serves West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other mid-Atlantic states. Stories of ratepayer protests about rising electricity prices are appearing all across the mountains.

Mountain State Spotlight reported in October 2025 that the cost to secure an adequate power supply in PJM’s annual capacity auction jumped from $2.2 billion for 2024-2025 to $14.7 billion for 2025-2026, an increase of more than 500%. CNBC reported that an independent monitor found data center demand, both actual and forecast, accounted for $9.3 billion, or 63%, of that total. In the December 2025 auction, prices hit $16.4 billion, with PJM falling short of its reliability target for the first time. Nearly all of the 5,250-megawatt increase in projected demand was attributable to data centers.

Monitoring Analytics, a specialized firm that acts as an independent monitor for the PJM Interconnection, said in its June report: “Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices.”

These costs are spread across the entire grid, affecting ratepayers throughout the region. CNBC reported in November 2025 that residential electricity prices surged 13% in Virginia, 16% in Illinois, and 12% in Ohio during a recent 12-month period, well above the six percent national average.

A Harvard Law School study released in September 2025 warned that utilities may be subsidizing data center growth by shifting infrastructure costs to residential and other ratepayers. The Union of Concerned Scientists reached a similar conclusion in an October 2025 analysis: “The wealthiest companies are building extraordinarily expensive data centers that you and I are subsidizing.”

Cathy Kunkel, an energy consultant at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told Mountain State Spotlight: “One of the principles of electric rate regulation is that the entity that’s imposing cost on the system bears those costs to the extent possible. The historical way transmission cost allocation has been done is just not keeping up with that principle when it comes to data centers.”

Corporate Players in Appalachia

Two overlapping groups of corporations are driving the data center push into Appalachia. The first consists of hyperscalers—the companies whose cloud and AI services create the underlying demand: Amazon (AWS), Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Even when they aren’t named publicly, they often sit behind developer NDAs or vague references to “Fortune 100” clients, as the Kentucky Lantern has noted in its coverage.

Amazon Web Services has the largest data center footprint nationally, with hundreds of facilities in Northern Virginia alone. Google has committed $25 billion for data centers and infrastructure, including a $3 billion deal with Brookfield Asset Management for hydropower electricity, according to the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia report.

The second group consists of developers, landholders, and power partners—the visible local actors. PowerHouse Data Centers and Poe Companies are developing Kentucky’s first hyperscale campus in Louisville. Compass Datacenters and QTS Data Centers are building the Prince William Digital Gateway in Virginia, billed as the world’s largest future data center complex at 23 million square feet, according to Virginia Business.

In West Virginia, Fundamental Data LLC of Purcellville, Virginia, is pursuing the massive Tucker County project. TransGas Development Systems of New York is proposing two off-grid power plants in Mingo County for what the applications call the “Adams Fork Data Center Energy Campus,” according to Mountain State Spotlight. Texas-based Fidelis New Energy has proposed a data center complex in Mason County.

In early December, ten Mingo County residents filed a federal lawsuit seeking to halt the Adams Fork project, alleging violations of the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.

Questions Communities Should Ask

What Advocacy Groups Recommend

Several organizations have developed frameworks to help communities evaluate data center proposals and advocate for responsible development. Their recommendations share common themes: transparency, local control, binding commitments, and protection for existing residents and ratepayers.

Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition

The Piedmont Environmental Council and nearly 30 environmental, preservation, and climate advocacy groups formed the Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition in late 2023. Julie Bolthouse, the Council’s director of land use, told Inside Climate News in December 2023 that an “ever-increasing data center footprint” has resulted in “higher utility rates, new transmission lines, declining air quality, reduced water supply,” and a loss in Virginia’s “hard-fought climate goals.”

The coalition has articulated four pillars of reform. The first is enhanced transparency, requiring disclosure and statewide reporting on data center energy use, water consumption, and emissions. The second is state oversight, establishing state-level regulatory review to evaluate regional impacts. The third is ratepayer protection, safeguarding residents and businesses from subsidizing billions of dollars in infrastructure that data centers require. The fourth is incentivizing sustainability by connecting tax exemptions to clean energy and efficiency standards.

“There needs to be more transparency around this industry; we need to know how much energy, how much water, and their emissions,” Bolthouse told Data Center Dynamics in November 2024. “Our localities are ill-equipped to handle the regional implications that are coming from these massive projects.”

PennFuture’s Model Ordinance

PennFuture, a Pennsylvania environmental nonprofit, has created a model zoning ordinance and educational video series to help municipalities prepare for data center development. The organization developed its model after reviewing ordinances passed in Pennsylvania and Northern Virginia.

The model ordinance addresses water consumption, power consumption, noise, and aesthetic concerns. According to PennFuture’s website, “Municipalities must take seriously their responsibility to plan for this new land use and avoid being caught unaware, as many were when the distribution center boom struck Pennsylvania in recent years.”

Donna Kohut of PennFuture told the Republican Herald in August 2025 that Pennsylvania faces serious risks from legislation that would fast-track data center approvals. “By allowing developers to side-step critical and constitutionally required environmental protections, our elected officials would be allowing for unfettered destruction of Pennsylvania’s natural resources and risking the health of our local communities,” Kohut said.

ReImagine Appalachia

ReImagine Appalachia, a coalition focused on sustainable economic development in the Ohio River Valley, published a report in October 2025 titled “Is Responsible Data Center Development Possible?” The report argues that data centers can benefit communities if proper safeguards are implemented.

The organization recommends that data centers be located on shuttered industrial facilities rather than greenfields, ideally co-located with factories or greenhouses that can benefit from waste heat recovery. Components should be procured locally to contribute to the region’s manufacturing sector. Strong labor standards should ensure local workers are hired in development and construction, including prevailing wage requirements, project labor agreements, and registered apprenticeship programs.

“Attracting new industries to our communities should not be a race to the bottom,” ReImagine Appalachia wrote. “The new growth of data centers in the region is a call to assess how our policy models have historically favored economic and project development that benefits extractive, exploitative, absentee corporations at the expense of our communities, workers, and lands.”

NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Principles

In September 2025, the NAACP and environmental justice advocates released guiding principles for data center development following a convening in Memphis, Tennessee, of nearly 70 climate and community advocates. The gathering was prompted in part by concerns about Elon Musk’s xAI data center in South Memphis, which the NAACP has challenged legally over unpermitted gas turbines in a historically Black neighborhood.

The NAACP’s framework demands that companies disclose water and energy consumption, emissions, subsidies, and corporate ownership details as soon as they propose new projects. Energy efficiency standards and environmental commitments must become legally binding through community benefit agreements.

“No community should be forced to sacrifice clean air, clean water, or safe homes so that corporations and billionaires can build energy-hungry facilities,” the NAACP stated in the principles, as reported by The Verge. Abre’ Conner, director of the Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at the NAACP, told The Verge that the principles put tech companies “on alert” that “if they do not meet our demands... we move into other forms of advocacy, including filing litigation.”

An Uncertain Future

The data center rush into Appalachia encapsulates the region’s century-long struggle with extractive industries and outside development. Like coal before it, data centers promise jobs and prosperity while communities worry about bearing the environmental and social costs.

Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at the Piedmont Environmental Council, offered a warning to West Virginia Watch in June 2025: “What you’re going to get if you do it this way is the worst players, the ones that didn’t need to be in Northern Virginia. The players that are wanting that lack of regulations because they didn’t want to abide by rules and didn’t want to or need to protect communities, which is worse for West Virginia and the communities.”

The U.S. Department of Energy projects that data centers could consume between 6.7 and 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023. That growth will require new power generation somewhere, and Appalachia’s abundant natural gas, available land, and water resources make it attractive despite the challenges.

Whether the region can chart a different path than its coal experience remains to be seen. The battles playing out in Tucker County, Wise County, Wythe County, and communities across the region will help determine whether data centers become genuine engines of renewal or simply the latest chapter in Appalachia’s long history of extraction without lasting benefit.

As one Tucker County resident put it at an April town hall covered by 100 Days in Appalachia: “It’s been so long and such a hard fight, and then all of a sudden it feels like this is gonna kick the legs out from the stool from everything that’s already here.”

In the EU and the U.S., fossil fuel interests have regained the upper hand.
Those who still insist on subsidizing natural gas, fossil fuel combustion engines, fossil fuel heating systems, and fossil fuel-based industrial production will ultimately lose entire industries to China and end up in the poorhouse.
From the outset, the fossil fuel industry has managed to defame climate protection as a burden on the economy.
But even many climate activists have adopted the fossil fuel industry’s framing and talked about burden-sharing in climate protection.","Since Donald Trump took office, the U.S. government has been more aggressively boosting fossil fuels to exert geopolitical dominance. President Donald Trump stated unequivocally that the military assault on Venezuela and the kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife are aimed at gaining control of the country’s oil reserves. Meanwhile, oil company shares are soaring, a dividend on the investments of “Big Oil,” the major donor to Trump’s election campaign. It is also no coincidence that Nigeria (which the U.S. bombed over Christmas) and Iran and Greenland, which Trump repeatedly threatens, are oil-rich regions, too.

While the U.S. is focusing on fossil fuel extraction, a dramatic transformation is taking place worldwide. In China, CO2 emissions have been stagnating or declining for over a year and a half. The expansion of global renewable energy capacity reached an unprecedented 582 gigawatts (GW) last year. USD 2.4 trillion was invested in the energy transition, a third of which went into renewables. These are historic records, even if they are not enough to achieve the goal set at COP28 in Dubai: tripling the installed capacity of renewable energy worldwide by 2030.

Against this backdrop, climate and energy expert Hans-Josef Fell sees the world at a crossroads. Opting for fossil fuels not only leads to planetary catastrophe, but it is also economically misguided, he says.

Hans-Josef Fell was a member of the German Bundestag from 1998 to 2013. As a leading climate figure of the Green Party, Fell helped to advance the energy transition in Germany. He was a drafter of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), a law that came into force in Germany 25 years ago and has been copied by more than 60 countries. EEG promotes renewable energies (wind, solar, hydro, biomass) and guarantees their preferential feed-in to the power grid as well as fixed feed-in tariffs (which provide above-market prices) in order to drive forward expansion and shape the energy transition.

Today, Fell is president of the Energy Watch Group, an international network of scientists and parliamentarians researching fossil, nuclear and renewable energy resources, and, together with climate activists such as Bill McKibben, is an advocate for 100 percent renewable energy. In this interview, Fell discusses the widespread rollback of climate policies, how to transition to a zero-emission economy, and how investment in renewable energy is driving China’s economic boom.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

David Goeßmann: While greenhouse gases continue to rise to record levels globally, the U.S. is still the second-largest emitter in absolute terms, but with much higher per capita consumption and historical emissions than China. President Donald Trump has reversed the steps toward energy transition initiated under the Biden administration, attacked all environmental protection measures, and issued thousands of new oil and gas drilling permits while U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are going up again. In Europe, we see a boom of fossil gas and gas-fired power plants while overall climate policy is in decline. For instance, the German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz watered down the European Union’s (EU) climate targets and undermined the EU’s ban on combustion engines from 2035. The EU has also weakenedthe so-called Green New Deal. How do you assess climate protection in the industrialized world?

Hans-Josef Fell: There is no climate protection worthy of the name in the rich countries, nor globally. The Earth’s temperature is accelerating toward three degrees Celsius by 2050, as new calculations by the German Meteorological Society and the German Physical Society show. The Energy Watch Group has also clearly described this; one only has to extrapolate the current path of exponentially rising temperatures from the last 20 years.

This alarming result is also clear, because as early as 1990, the limit of 350 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is sustainable for human civilization was exceeded. Today, the atmosphere is already overloaded with almost 430 ppm. An effective climate protection target that could enable the planet, which is already overheated by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2024, to cool down can therefore only be to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (not to be confused with annual emissions!) to below 350 ppm. This can only be achieved if all emissions are stopped in about two decades and, at the same time, huge amounts of carbon are removed from the atmosphere. The anti-climate measures mentioned above and many others are irresponsibly counterproductive, as they even reward new increased emissions with tax breaks and, with tax subsidies, even promote the expansion of highly climate-damaging natural gas power plants and natural gas infrastructure. At the same time, these tax breaks for climate polluters place a further burden on the already highly indebted national budget, which could lead to crises that we remember all too well from Greece’s national bankruptcy crisis in 2010.

We see in different industrialized countries that emissions are going down; even in the U.S., the trend since 2005 shows a slight decrease. The EU has a climate goal to be climate neutral by 2050 while the Biden administration at least committed to net zero emissions by mid-century, though Trump revoked that. Will policies like these be enough?

Since we need to return to 350 ppm in a few decades, climate neutrality in 2045 is far too late and far too weak. In addition to achieving a zero-emission economy, we also need a strong carbon-reducing economy, which can be achieved through reforestation, regenerative agriculture, and marine algae farming.

A zero-emission economy with 100 percent renewable energies and an emission-free circular economy is possible — all the technologies are there. All that is needed is the declared political and social will and strong investment from the financial sector and private individuals. Building an emission-free industry would also boost the economy. However, only China is currently pursuing such a strategy aggressively. In the EU and the U.S., fossil fuel interests have regained the upper hand.

You’re often in China. How do you see developments there in terms of climate protection and the energy transition compared to Europe and the U.S.?

A zero-emission economy is based on an energy supply that is 100 percent renewable. If we had that globally, about 60 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions would be stopped. China alone — currently still the largest emitter of greenhouse gases — is on an industrial growth path toward this goal. Sixty-two percent of global photovoltaic growth, 71 percent of global wind energy, and about 60 percent of all batteries and electric vehicles were brought to market in China last year. In 2024, more than 90 percent of the solar cells installed worldwide and 70 percent of electric car batteries were produced in China. Investment in clean energy has been growing for years, while production capacities are being expanded. In 2023, investment increased by 40 percent compared to the previous year.

This is the key driver of China’s economic boom, which has been ongoing for years. Europe, with its half-hearted renewable energy policy, and the U.S. under Trump, with its anti-energy transition agenda, are threatening to go into industrial decline. The industry of the near future will be clean, renewable, and emission-free. Those who still insist on subsidizing natural gas, fossil fuel combustion engines, fossil fuel heating systems, and fossil fuel-based industrial production will ultimately lose entire industries to China and end up in the poorhouse.

At the moment, we are seeing a backlash against the green transformation in many societies, especially in the rich industrialized countries. Do you nevertheless see positive developments in the global energy transition?

Yes, renewable energies are advancing massively worldwide. However, this is being driven primarily by China and increasingly also by BRICS countries other than Russia [the BRICS group includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa]. Those who, like the U.S. and the EU, want to protect their own dirty fossil fuel economy from Chinese dominance with tariffs on solar products or electric cars will only lose market share, as we are already seeing clearly today with the German car manufacturers VW, Daimler, and BMW, which are late to the game and still half-hearted in their commitment to e-mobility.

You say that an energy transition in most countries can be completed within 10 years. Explain how such a rapid transition could take place.

Until around 2012, we had in Germany about 30 percent annual growth in solar energy, and until 2017, similar growth in wind energy. Had these growth rates in solar expansion not been halted in 2012 in the wake of the devastating amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) by Federal Environment Minister Peter Altmaier, and then in wind energy from 2017 onwards by Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel, Germany could have achieved a full supply of 100 percent green electricity by around 2022 with the corresponding parallel expansion of storage facilities. The increases in natural gas prices as a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine would have had little impact on our economy, energy security would have been very high, the average 81 billion euros in import costs for fossil fuels would have fallen dramatically, and emissions would have been significantly lower.

Today, we must build on the success story of the EEG from 2000 with its basic principles of fixed feed-in tariffs, whereby a modern EEG should also be geared toward system integration into the electricity grid. Then, with the simultaneous expansion of electric heating, e-vehicles, and industrial production, a full supply of 100 percent green electricity can be achieved by 2030. Such a market ramp-up would also give the domestic renewable energy industry a chance and reduce dependence on China.

If a rapid transition is possible and even economically advantageous, why is it not being implemented politically? Who is continuing to put the brakes on this?

The fossil fuel and nuclear industries have a firm grip on large parts of the media, both traditional and social, and thus also on the political debate. Fake news is constantly being produced, e.g., that renewable energies are driving up electricity prices or that there is a nuclear renaissance in the world. Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder recently claimed that Germany could support its economy by quickly building small nuclear power plants like those already in operation in Canada. A glance at Canada shows that there are no such small nuclear reactors there, not even under construction. There are only two in the planning stage, and their completion is still up in the air. So even a high-ranking politician can lie to the public with impunity.

In the broader debate, climate protection is often portrayed as a burden. In your opinion, what is wrong with the way the energy, transport, and agricultural transitions to protect the environment are discussed in the media?

From the outset, the fossil fuel industry has managed to defame climate protection as a burden on the economy. However, this only applies to the fossil fuel industry, which will of course have to completely cease its business activities involving oil, gas, and coal. But climate protection is a booster for the clean, emission-free economy, as China is now making abundantly clear.

But even many climate activists have adopted the fossil fuel industry’s framing and talked about burden-sharing in climate protection. Spending on renewable energies is not a cost burden, but rather an investment that creates jobs and tax revenue while reducing the costs of damage to health care due to poor air quality or environmental and climate damage. Climate protection is therefore not a burden, but an improvement in prosperity for everyone, except for businesses in the fossil fuel-polluting economy.

In recent years, environmental movements and climate activists have developed various strategies to promote more climate protection in countries. At the moment, it has become difficult to put the issue on the agenda. The pandemic, the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the rise of right-wing authoritarian parties have dominated the headlines. In your opinion, what strategies make sense to get governments to take climate action?

Climate activists must finally free themselves from the narratives of fossil fuel industry representatives and demonstrate that climate protection is an essential contribution to the economy, creates new jobs and industries, reduces the costs of disease and environmental damage, relieves private households of high energy costs, and ultimately slows down the galloping national debt. Furthermore, the lack of climate protection is one of the causes of the major problems that are weighing so heavily on us: increasing refugee movements, famines as a result of crop failures, wars over oil or natural gas, fossil fuels as a means of political blackmail, and much more.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2245399115-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 20:58:10.251235
,North Carolina Environment,2026-01-11 01:29:23+00:00,Common Dreams,The Nation Responds to a 'Truly Terrifying' Week - Common Dreams,"chuck-idelson, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/trump-terror-venezuela-ice,"And just a week after Keith Porter was shot and killed while celebrating on New Year’s Eve by an off-duty ICE agent in Northridge, California, a Los Angeles suburb.
And, in familiar tones, the Trump administration has been quick to demonize all four.
The administration wants to control the Good investigation even as Minnesota officials say the federal government is impeding a state investigation.
On the two arenas of the past week, Trump and his cabal are promising more.
I remember driving overnight from Los Angeles to San Francisco to march with 250,000 others across the city that same day.","“Truly terrifying.” That was how National Nurses United executive director Puneet Maharaj described this week in a group text exchange in the aftermath of the brazen murder of Renee Nicole Good by Immigration and Custom Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis on January 7. A day later there was another shooting, some 1,700 miles away in Portland, Oregon, of Luis David Nico Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras by border patrol agents. And just a week after Keith Porter was shot and killed while celebrating on New Year’s Eve by an off-duty ICE agent in Northridge, California, a Los Angeles suburb.

All three acts of violence capped a year in which the draconian anti-immigrant drive launched by President Donald Trump and campaign architect Stephen Miller has terrorized immigrant communities and sparked protests across the nation. A year in which at least 32 people have also died in ICE custody, the agency’s most deadly year in decades, according to the Detention Watch Network. Some were long-time residents, some recent abductees in ICE raids. “They died of seizure and heart failure, stroke, respiratory failure, tuberculosis or suicide,” or reported neglect, notes the Guardian.

The shootings reflect the broad portrait of US residents–Good, a white, 37-year old mother of three; Porter, a Black 43-year-old father of two; Moncada and Zambrano-Contreras, Venezuelan. And, in familiar tones, the Trump administration has been quick to demonize all four.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem rushed to defend shooter Ross insisting it was an “act of domestic terrorism” by Good. Vice President JD Vance called Ross a “deranged leftist.” Moncada and Zambrano-Contreras were immediately labeled as affiliated with the Tren De Aragua gang, though Portland officials voiced distrust in ICE characterizations. A DHS spokesperson claimed Porter was an “active shooter” and the off-duty agent was “protecting his community,” contentions that infuriated Porter’s friends.

It was a solemn beginning to the new year, an exclamation point on the past 12 months.

The administration wants to control the Good investigation even as Minnesota officials say the federal government is impeding a state investigation. Vance claims agent Ross has “absolute immunity,” a point refuted by Harvard legal scholar Lawrence Tribe on MSNow with Lawrence O’Donnell. “State laws of assault continue to apply, even to a federal officer,” he noted. Outraged Minnesotans are calling for state prosecution as was done, with a conviction, for the police officer who killed George Floyd a short distance from where Good was murdered. Gov. Tim Walz says he wants the state to do a “full investigation.”

Porter’s friends are pushing for justice for Porter. Los Angeles County is “reviewing Porter’s killing,” though, the Los Angeles Times adds, “it sometimes takes years for the agency to determine if a deadly use of force constitutes a crime.” While Los Angeles is a “sanctuary city,” the LA Police Department is notorious for supporting and defending ICE and other federal immigration agents and constraining community protesters instead.

Venezuela, of course, was the other high-profile calamity of the week. Trump’s January 3 military invasion of Venezuela, kidnapping President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. Up to 100 people, including civilians were killed, Venezuelan officials report. The US also bombed a medical warehouse, science labs, and an apartment complex, along with other sites in Caracas.

The long-planned assault followed months of extrajudicial bombings of boats in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific that have executed at least 115 people since September—like the invasion, in violation of international and US law, and without congressional authorization.

It was a solemn beginning to the new year, an exclamation point on the past 12 months. The Trump administration has carried out the most sustained assault on constitutional norms, dispatching of troops to threaten Americans in numerous cities, weaponization of the Justice Department and programs to punish political enemies and entire Democratic-run states, shredding of decades of healthcare standards that have saved millions of lives, and so much more.

It’s hard to even get more appalled. But the convergence of the emergence of a new American colonial empire abroad with the deadly escalation of Trump’s cruel, racist anti-immigrant program, is what made the week “truly terrifying.”

Many people on social media searched for analogs in recent US history. For this aging lefty who lived through and participated in frequent protests against the Vietnam war, President Ronald Reagan’s sponsoring of military coups and mercenary armies in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the disastrous invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, I dredged up one comparison.

On April 28, 1970, President Richard Nixon invaded Cambodia with combat troops, an enormous widening of the Southeast Asia war he had pledged to end. A week later on May 4, following days of protests, the Ohio National Guard fired 67 rounds in 13 seconds at student protesters at Kent State University in Ohio, killing four students and wounding nine more. I huddled around the radio listening to the accounts on Pacifica’s KPFA-FM with three roommates, thinking the world had dramatically changed in our lives. Then I rushed off to join a raucous protest at Sonoma State University where I was enrolled.

Trump’s stranglehold on Republican members of Congress is weakening.

Many parallels to that time with this moment exist. There had been years of rallies and marches protesting Nixon and President Lyndon Johnson’s war before him. Nixon was elected promising a secret plan to conclude the long Vietnam War while covertly sabotaging a long-delayed Johnson plan to initiate new peace talks. Trump campaigned as a “peace” advocate, pledging to end “forever wars,” and begging for a Nobel Peace Prize before launching the most unchecked expansion of US colonialism in more than a century.

The arrogant Nixon was, arguably, the most lawless president in US history to that point, before being finally forced to resign. Trump has proven to be far worse, engaging in monarchical dictates and policies, running roughshod over Congress, defying the courts, staging an insurrection at the US Capitol attempting to overturn the 2020 election, and now scheming how to subvert the 2026 and 2028 elections.

On the two arenas of the past week, Trump and his cabal are promising more. Trump has openly threatened to expand military operations to Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, and Greenland. “I don’t need international law,” Trump told the New York Times. He will only be constrained, he said, by his “own morality.”

Vance has intensified his increasingly desperate rhetoric to defend the murder of Good; the administration recognizes they have lost public support, as millions have viewed the damning video evidence. Going on the attack, as Trump always requires when challenged, Vance boasts the administration has doubled its Gestapo-style police force to over 22,000, and plans to send ICE agents “door to door,” in coming months, mimicking the odious practices of past dictatorships. Trump has also threatened, again, to invoke the Insurrection Act to send the military to American cities to combat protesters.

Both Nixon and Trump met massive opposition. Anti-Vietnam War marches mushroomed, with over half a million people joining a November 1969 march on Washington. I remember driving overnight from Los Angeles to San Francisco to march with 250,000 others across the city that same day. The repeated mobilizations, augmenting battlefield defeats in Vietnam, ultimately coerced the US to end its war.

Trump has faced similar growing resistance. Up to 8 million Americans joined “No Kings” rallies and marches in June and October last year. And in the two days since the Minneapolis murder, thousands have turned out in spontaneous protests in many cities and smaller communities including Asheville, North Carolina, Boston, Buffalo, Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Colorado Springs. Colorado, Columbus, Ohio, Dallas, Dayton, Ohio, Denver, Durham, North Carolina, Los Angeles, Merrimack, New Hampshire, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Providence, Rhode Island, Seattle, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and repeatedly in Minneapolis.

Trump’s stranglehold on Republican members of Congress is weakening. Trump lost two significant votes in Congress on January 7. Overriding House GOP leaders, 17 Republicans joined Democrats in the House to pass legislation to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years as millions of Americans are facing calamitous increases in healthcare coverage due to GOP obstruction in the fall.

In the Senate, five Republicans joined in a “rare bipartisan rebuke of the White House” to set up a War Powers Resolution vote to require congressional approval for Trump’s militarism in Venezuela and elsewhere. Incensed by the defiance, Trump called for the defeat of the five Republicans. Both actions face a difficult outcome, but the votes are significant. It shows Republicans are worried about the approaching midterm elections in November, following sweeping losses last year.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62687945&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2026-01-11 06:57:47.783525

Broad, www.nytimes.com, william-j-broad",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/science/trump-science-budget-cuts-congress.html,"Congress is racing to undo thousands of cuts to federal science programs that President Trump called for last year when planning the government’s current budget.
This week, the Senate Appropriations Committee released a bipartisan package of bills that largely scraps Mr. Trump’s planned cuts.
“That’s pretty solid,” said Alessandra Zimmermann, a budget analyst at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a scientific group based in Washington.
The Senate package countered with a reduction to $8.75 billion, or less than 1 percent.
On Thursday, the House voted to approve the Senate package.","Congress is racing to undo thousands of cuts to federal science programs that President Trump called for last year when planning the government’s current budget.

If enacted, the president’s bid for an overall cut in scientific funding to $154 billion from $198 billion — a plunge of 22 percent — would have been the largest reduction in federal spending on science since World War II, when Washington and the seekers of nature’s secrets began their partnership.

This week, the Senate Appropriations Committee released a bipartisan package of bills that largely scraps Mr. Trump’s planned cuts. Analysts say that, if the proposed budgets hold up in the weeks ahead, Congress will set aside roughly $188 billion for federal research — a drop of about 4 percent from the most recent annual budget.

“That’s pretty solid,” said Alessandra Zimmermann, a budget analyst at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a scientific group based in Washington. “Congress is really starting to push back.”

Surprisingly, analysts foresee a possible rise of more than 2 percent in the budget category known as basic research — the blue-sky variety that produces fundamental strides and spinoffs in fields such as health care and artificial intelligence. Last year, the Trump administration called for a cut in federal basic research of more than one-third.

Mr. Trump sought even larger cuts for the National Science Foundation, which sponsors much of the nation’s basic research. He proposed that its budget be slashed to $3.9 billion from $8.8 billion, a drop of 56 percent. The Senate package countered with a reduction to $8.75 billion, or less than 1 percent.

The bipartisan accord on funding science, Ms. Zimmermann said, stands in sharp contrast with the congressional impasse that shut down the government last fall as Democrats and Republicans clashed over the renewal of subsidies for the Affordable Care Act.

“They’re working together now,” she said. “It’s a return to normalcy.” The new cooperation, Ms. Zimmermann added, is “promising for the eventual passage of the bills.”

Each year, the president submits a budget request to Congress in advance of the annual appropriations process. Only Congress has the power of the purse.

In a statement, Senator Patty Murray of Washington State, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, praised the package of bills as good not only for investigating nature but also for enhancing public safety and the welfare of American families.

“Democrats fought to protect investments that matter,” she said. The package, she added, “rejects President Trump’s push to let our competitors do laps around us.”

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, called the package “a fiscally responsible” move that will “spur scientific research necessary to maintain U.S. competitiveness.”

The Senate package includes $24.4 billion for NASA (a 1.6 percent cut), $8.8 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency (a 4 percent cut), $8.4 billion for the Department of Energy Office of Science (a 1.9 percent increase), $6.2 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (roughly flat), $1.4 billion for the U.S. Geological Survey (a 2 percent cut) and $1.2 billion for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (a 2.3 percent increase).

On Thursday, the House voted to approve the Senate package. Many federal programs have recently had their budgets frozen at last year’s levels. Congress, eager to avoid another shutdown, is working to pass spending bills before stopgap measures expire on Jan. 30.

So far, the House’s moves on this year’s science budgeting add up to an estimated total of $185 billion — close to the Senate figure of $188 billion, and putting the two chambers not far apart for negotiations on a final budget.

The improved budgetary picture cannot undo the damage that the Trump administration’s frenzy of budget cutting and administrative chaos brought to the nation’s scientific establishment, analysts say. They see the cycles of cuts and reinstatements as taking a toll that in some cases may require years to mend.

Analysts also note that the administration has made policy shifts on how appropriated funds are spent. For instance, the National Institutes of Health, which traditionally hedged its scientific bets by supporting a wide range of investigators, is now dividing its annual budget into fewer projects.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/10/multimedia/10hs-science-budget-wmjp/10hs-science-budget-wmjp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 20:58:15.244993

Infrastructure is the foundation, Intelligence is the future. We design integrated, circular, and impactful strategies.”

— Harvey Blom, Managing Partner

DE, UNITED STATES, January 10, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — GRN Energy today announced its evolution into GRN Bi (GRN Business Intelligence), marking a strategic transition from infrastructure delivery toward intelligence-driven platforms, SaaS solutions, and AI-enabled decision-support systems for digital and infrastructure economies.

This transformation represents an evolution, not a break.

Over recent years, GRN Energy has developed deep expertise at the intersection of energy, digital infrastructure, and compute. As data centers increasingly evolve into AI-driven, grid-interactive systems, value creation now depends less on physical assets alone and more on real-time intelligence, orchestration, and decision-making.

GRN Bi positions itself as the intelligence layer.

*Infrastructure is the foundation. Intelligence is the future.*

About the Rebrand

GRN Energy is evolving into GRN Bi (GRN Business Intelligence) to reflect a strategic focus on:

* Business Intelligence & Analytics

* SaaS platforms and orchestration tools

* AI-driven decision-support systems

* Strategic advisory for digital and infrastructure economies

The company’s team, expertise, and global partner network remain unchanged. What has evolved is how GRN delivers value — translating energy, infrastructure, and compute into actionable intelligence, operational resilience, and long-term impact for enterprises, governments, investors, and infrastructure operators.

GRN Bi operates as a Business Intelligence and Digital Strategy company, enabling C-level decision-making across energy-powered digital ecosystems. The company’s website is currently being updated to reflect this next phase.

Strategic Partnership with Bentaus

As part of this evolution, GRN Bi (formerly GRN Energy) has entered into an official strategic partnership with Bentaus, supporting the global expansion of Bentaus’ business development and brand positioning.

This partnership strengthens GRN Bi’s role as a bridge between infrastructure and intelligence, while expanding Bentaus’ reach across data center operators, AI infrastructure developers, and energy-integrated digital ecosystems worldwide.

At the center of the collaboration is Bentaus’ Power Asset Orchestrator (PAO) — a next-generation orchestration platform designed for AI factories and energy-aware data centers.

PAO unifies power, compute, thermal, carbon, and grid intelligence into a single real-time control plane. Built on a zero-trust, event-driven architecture, PAO ingests telemetry from critical assets — including CDUs, PDUs, busbars, GPUs, inverters, and live grid signals — and converts it into deterministic, verifiable actions.

From soft-start GPU ramping and predictive thermal modeling to demand-response participation, PAO enables AI infrastructure to operate as an intelligent, flexible, and grid-aware system.

Functioning as the air-traffic controller of the AI factory, Bentaus PAO ensures reliability, efficiency, and resilience at scale. As data centers evolve into flexible grid assets and GPU flywheels, PAO delivers the intelligence required to support the next decade of AI infrastructure.

Industry Engagement: Powering AI Factories

In alignment with this partnership, GRN Bi is supporting the upcoming webinar:

“Powering AI Factories” By Michael Schulman, Robert Davidoff, and Kevin Culp

The session explores how unified compute and energy orchestration addresses the growing complexity of GPU clusters, liquid cooling, and HPC workloads, enabling visibility, optimization, and sustainability.

By integrating Supermicro’s Supercloud Composer (SCC) with Bentaus’ Power Asset Orchestrator (PAO), operators gain end-to-end infrastructure visibility, optimized GPU utilization, alignment with real-time grid pricing, and scalable AI factory operations.

This silicon anode upgrade addresses two things EV drivers care about most: range and charging speed.","Electric vehicles are getting closer to overcoming some of their biggest challenges — and a new battery breakthrough could play a major role in making EVs more practical and appealing for drivers.

Porsche-backed Group14 Technologies and New York-based Sionic Energy recently announced a major breakthrough in lithium-ion battery technology that could significantly improve EV performance. The innovation replaces traditional graphite anodes — a key battery component that helps store and move energy — with high-energy silicon-carbon materials. These new anodes deliver stable performance even at elevated temperatures while overcoming other long-standing problems, such as thermal instability and volume expansion, that have historically hindered the use of silicon in batteries.

""I've spent years watching the industry chase silicon's promise and hit the walls of complexity, cost, development time, and narrow performance,"" Ed Williams, president and CEO of Sionic Energy, said in a news release. ""That's why I'm proud to share this Sionic benchmark and the Group14 partnership that breaks through those walls and accelerates silicon's broad market adoption.""

""The anode is essentially responsible for how much energy a cell can hold and how quickly it can charge,"" Inside EVs reported. According to the companies, the silicon-carbon anodes allow batteries to store more energy — up to 55% more — and have a longer lifespan, plus benefit from extreme fast charging — potentially under 10 minutes.

Inside EVs noted silicon anode tech is already being used in high-performing smartphones, showing its potential, albeit on a smaller scale.

Graphite has long been the go-to for anodes because of its stability and energy density, but it comes with downsides. Mining and processing graphite is highly polluting and expensive, and much of the global supply is sourced from China, creating both environmental and geopolitical concerns.

The anode also makes up the largest share of a battery's volume and weight, according to the European Carbon and Graphite Association. By replacing heavier graphite with much lighter silicon, battery makers could reduce battery size and vehicle weight without sacrificing range or performance.

Another notable advantage is immediate scalability. The new technology is designed to work with existing battery manufacturing lines, allowing it to be adopted more quickly instead of requiring costly factory overhauls. This silicon anode upgrade addresses two things EV drivers care about most: range and charging speed. These key improvements could make EVs more appealing and accessible by lowering costs, as silicon-carbon materials are much cheaper and more abundant than graphite.

These silicon-carbon batteries also make better use of electricity, supporting the big goal to reduce planet-warming pollution. That impact can be amplified when drivers charge at home using renewable energy, such as home solar. Powering an EV with home solar can significantly lower charging costs and shrink a household's carbon footprint.

If you're curious what that could look like for your home, TCD's Solar Explorer is a helpful tool to explore solar options, estimate savings, and see how a new system could make EV ownership even more affordable.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ev-charging.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 17:58:39.071358

Legislative leaders understand that the key to South Carolina’s prosperity is providing all kids with a decent education, which creates a ready workforce that attracts businesses to our state. That understanding is paying off: We have fewer teacher vacancies, more kids are attending preschool, and test scores are on the rise. If we were, say, Minnesota, we’d be ready to rest on our laurels. But we’re South Carolina, which was way behind in educating our children, so we have to do more of the same — and other things as well.

We still have teacher vacancies, despite impressive pay increases and legislative shows of respect for teachers, because we’re still in the midst of a national teacher shortage; and once we reach Gov. Henry McMaster’s goal of paying first-year teachers $50,000 — which lawmakers should achieve this year — we’ll need to reset the goal, because inflation is eating up pay, and other states are raising it as well.

Meantime, more parents are enrolling their children in public charter schools, which would be fine if charter schools did as well here as they do in the rest of the country. Some do, but on the whole they don't, in no small part because of a loophole that lets them escape accountability. This must be the year lawmakers close that loophole. And don’t even get us started on the Legislature’s foolish decision to throw our tax dollars at private schools without demanding any accountability from them.

Pay for our needs

Back when Mark Sanford was governor, he tried to cap state spending increases to inflation plus population growth. Clearly, it wasn’t needed. Lawmakers slashed spending during the last big recession, and since then they’ve ignored the cost of rising prices and an exploding population, instead competing nearly every year to see who could cut taxes more. Little wonder our roads are crumbling, the wait for criminal and civil trials is interminable, we can’t afford to keep guards in our prisons or our Highway Patrol fully staffed; we can’t even afford to keep dangerously unstable people in prison or treatment, and on and on.

Yet legislative leaders are determined this year to eliminate the state income tax, which funds about 40 percent of state government. Some want to eliminate local property taxes instead — or in addition. There’s plenty of room to make our tax system smarter, with some taxes higher and others lower — although the plan House Republicans backed last year, to raise most people’s income taxes in order to slash it for some, would not have been smarter. South Carolina isn’t a high-tax state. We can’t afford to keep neglecting essential services so politicians can keep congratulating themselves for cutting taxes more.

Meantime, those tax-cutting House members and some senators will be fighting to lift the moratorium on budget earmarks. Whether there’s an appropriate place in the budget for earmarks or not, there’s no place for the secret and unvetted earmarks that have been the rule rather than the exception in our state.

Protect environment, public

Threats to South Carolina’s natural environment have taken a lot of forms over the years, but rarely have so many threats come in such a neat package as AI data centers. Their voracious electricity appetite is pushing utilities to take shortcuts on building new capacity, which can threaten our air and water while driving up everybody’s power bills. The centers' appetite for our water further threatens our groundwater, rivers and lakes. And their massive footprints mean they can wipe out large swaths of environmentally sensitive land, as one threatens to do near Walterboro.

When the Senate tried last year to prohibit state government from paying data centers to locate to our state — a modest effort to limit their damage — the House said absolutely no, and the Senate caved. But there’s too much at stake to let the House’s position stand. We now know that enticing data centers isn’t essential to power companies’ bottom line, so lawmakers should require Dominion and Duke to follow the lead of Santee Cooper and make data centers cover the entire cost of building new capacity for them. They also should require data centers to significantly reduce the amount of water they use to cool their computers, as some new centers are doing, and impose statewide restrictions on where the centers can locate.

Santee Cooper’s deal to sell the abandoned, unfinished nuclear reactors at V.C. Summer to Brookfield Asset Management could tie into this debate, as Brookfield is expected to sell the electricity to data centers or other large users. That almost certainly will require lawmakers to loosen South Carolina’s utility regulatory framework. If lawmakers don't pay attention to ratepayers' interests, that could be just as expensive to South Carolinians as the data centers buying their power from regulated utilities.

Make government honest

Protecting judicial independence, reducing politicians’ ability to profit from their offices at the expense of the public and just generally doing government honestly and publicly all fall into the catch-all “good government,” which is more about how government operates than what it does. We need a good bit of action on this front.

How we select judges will be back on the table, not because more legislators recognize what a bad idea it is for the Legislature to have near total say over the third branch of government but because they’re afraid to buck a deep-pocketed special interest who hasn’t gotten the rulings he wanted from judges. Still, the fact is that the governor needs a much larger role than he has. If anyone needs proof, lawmakers are threatening to provide it by unseating a justice who voted to take away their unconstitutional pay raises; there’s even some talk of reducing the court’s funding.

Perhaps we won’t need any more transparency about how lawyer-legislators attempt to intimidate judges if the whole Legislature acts openly to do that. But we do need more transparency in the rest of government. State law requires governments to provide most records to citizens who ask for them, and hold most debates in public. But from the smallest town council to the largest state agency, the laws are routinely violated, because officials know they’ll get away with it unless someone sues them, and they know even when they lose the lawsuit, there’s practically no punishment. The Legislature needs to change the math here, with real punishment for governments that violate the Freedom of Information Act and a state agency whose job it is to prosecute or sue violators, like police and prosecutors enforce other laws, so members of the public don’t have to do it themselves.

And there’s still the matter of those multibillion-dollar accounting messes created by the state treasurer, comptroller general and auditor, and their refusal to tell the Legislature about them. Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom and Auditor George Kennedy resigned for their roles in massive financial mishaps that also involved Treasurer Curtis Loftis. Mr. Loftis needs to be removed as well, we need a law to protect the auditor from bullying by the comptroller and treasurer, and voters should be given the option of making treasurer and comptroller appointed positions.

Provide local oversight

For years we’ve argued that the governor needs more control over the executive branch of government, and lawmakers are slowly making progress on that, but that doesn’t reduce the need for the Legislature to provide oversight of the governor’s agencies; if anything, the need increases each time the Legislature turns over more authority.

The same is true with local government: Counties and municipalities need to have more say over how they run their communities. But as we’ve seen from the growing number of local governments that face financial collapse from incompetence and corruption, they need help and sometimes oversight to ensure they’re being responsible financial stewards and obeying basic laws on ethics, transparency and money management.

The Ethics Commission could handle ethics violations if the Legislature would apply the State Ethics Act to local government, and that new FOI-enforcement agency could take care of that if lawmakers would create it. On top of all that, lawmakers should remove restrictions on how much money local elected officials collect and how they do it, and what sort of ordinances they adopt, while also creating an agency inspired by North Carolina’s Local Government Commission, which oversees local bond issues and required annual audits, monitors financial health and offers broad assistance in financial administration to local governments.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/ff/0fff2070-68a9-446c-b6f1-9a2304c99c77/695d38c48dedf.image.jpg?crop=1858%2C976%2C0%2C54&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-10 17:59:16.855353

Here are some key strategies and technologies that have been discussed on Reddit to address various forms of urban pollution:

Air Pollution

Industrial Air Capture: Companies like Climeworks are working on direct CO2 removal, though it is capital-intensive. ""Industrial air capture (direct co2 removal) — companies like climeworks, but capital intensive""

Pollution Sensors and Real-Time Monitoring: This approach is less capital-intensive and can provide immediate insights into pollution levels. ""Pollution sensors + real-time monitoring for factories/cities — more sass than hardware, faster to market""

Planting Trees: A simple yet effective solution to improve air quality by absorbing CO2 and releasing oxygen. ""We already have such air purifiers. They are called ‘Trees’. We just need to plant more trees and take care of the existing ones.""

Electric Vehicles (EVs): Replacing combustion engine vehicles with EVs can significantly reduce exhaust emissions. ""That plus china seems to be a world leader in terms of electric vehicles. There’s a lot to he said about the production process etc, but in the end these cars just don’t vomit exhaust gases into the air when and where people drive them.""

Waste Management

Underground Waste Systems: Systems like Sweden's Envac use underground piping to transport waste, reducing visible street litter and odors. ""Buildings and city blocks dispose of waste into sealed inlets. The waste is sucked through pipes to central locations outside the urban area.""

Peer-to-Peer Recycling: Connecting waste producers directly to recycling plants can reduce logistics waste. ""One idea I’m exploring is a subscription model connecting waste producers directly to recycling plants — cutting logistics waste and making the system cleaner overall.""

Composting: Reducing the amount of trash by composting organic material. ""I found during last spring and summer that composting significantly reduced the amount of trash that I put in my trash can.""

Water Management

Porous Pavement: This new pavement can absorb rainwater, help prevent urban flooding, and filter out pollutants. ""This new pavement, developed by AquiPor Technologies in Washington State, can absorb rainwater and help prevent urban flooding.""

Water Storage and Filtration: Investing in solutions like water bladders and filtration systems can help in emergency situations. ""If you have a bathtub I would invest in a Water Bob. Solved the issue of water supply in an emergency without taking up space.""

Noise Pollution

Enforcement of Noise Ordinances: More strict enforcement of existing noise ordinances can reduce noise from modified vehicle exhausts. ""Where I live 90% of road noise pollution is from cars, trucks and motorcycles with modified exhaust systems.""

Narrower Streets and Lower Speeds: Reducing vehicle speed and optimizing street design can significantly cut down on traffic noise. ""Narrower streets, lower speeds. That gets rid of most traffic noise.""

Soundproofing: Implementing better soundproofing standards in urban areas can help mitigate noise pollution. ""Better soundproofing standards deals with everything else.""

Urban Planning and Infrastructure

Green Roofs: While controversial, green roofs can be practical in certain contexts, especially when designed to manage water. ""Yes, if you are trying to solve a problem beyond having something green on your roof, they can be a sustainable option.""

General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.",https://i0.wp.com/vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gm-car-ev-suv.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-10 17:59:07.955139

But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.
Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.
Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.","As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing affordability crisis. While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady — or even come down — other costs such as rent, dining out, and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity — the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way — is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand — particularly from data centers — is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power” — the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the United States. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity — not tear it down — will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.

OpenAI and SoftBank will each invest $500 million in SB Energy to support the energy firm’s growth as a data center developer and operator, the companies said in a statement Friday. OpenAI also said it has selected SB Energy to build and operate its 1.2 gigawatt data center in Milam County, Texas. A single gigawatt is enough to power roughly 750,000 US homes at any given moment.

The companies did not disclose a valuation for the investment.

For large tech firms, securing power is key in their quest to satisfy lofty AI ambitions. That’s created a race for energy to support more and larger data centers — and is helping drive up electricity demand.

The need for power is leading some to invest in suppliers or plants, or line up their own energy sources. Meta Platforms Inc. on Friday said it has agreed to deals that could ultimately total more than 6 gigawatts of nuclear power.

SB Energy, which has long been backed by SoftBank, was founded as a renewable and storage developer, but has in recent years expanded into developing, owning and operating data centers. The new funding follows SB Energy lining up $800 million last year from Ares Infrastructure Opportunities funds.

The tie-up with SoftBank and OpenAI adds to a growing web of interconnected deals between tech companies that are helping to prop up the AI sector and raising concerns about the possible fallout if demand for artificial intelligence falls short of expectations. SoftBank is one of OpenAI’s largest investors.

The SB Energy partnership builds on OpenAI’s Stargate initiative, a joint project between the AI startup and partners including SoftBank and Oracle Corp with the goal of spending $500 billion on data centers and infrastructure for AI in the US over four years. The project’s first site is a massive data center in Abilene, Texas, developed by Oracle and built alongside development partner Crusoe.

House

FUNDING VARIOUS AGENCIES: The House has passed the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act (H.R. 6938), sponsored by Tom Cole, R-Okla. The bill would provide $215 billion of fiscal 2026 funding for many federal agencies, including the Energy, Interior, Commerce, and Justice departments. Cole said it reduced wasteful spending, maintained environmental and energy standards, and supported law enforcement and the effort against fentanyl. The vote, on Jan. 8, was 397 yeas to 28 nays.

YEAS: Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-3rd

FLORIDA INDIAN RESERVATION: The House has failed to override the veto by President Donald Trump of the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act (H.R. 504), sponsored by Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez, R-Fla. The bill would have expanded the Miccosukee tribal reservation to include land in the Everglades National Park. Gimenez said: “Including this land in the reserved area will empower the tribe to protect their community, manage water flow into the Everglades National Park, and raise structures within the camp to prevent catastrophic flooding.” The vote to override, on Jan. 8, was 236 yeas to 188 nays, with a two-thirds majority required.

YEAS: Perez

COLORADO WATER PIPELINE: The House has failed to override the veto by President Trump of the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act (H.R. 131), sponsored by Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. The bill would have expanded federal subsidies for a water pipeline in southeast Colorado to be built by the Bureau of Reclamation, including by reducing interest payments on a loan to communities that would be served by the pipeline. Boebert said: “Rural communities in southeastern Colorado need and deserve access to clean, reliable, and affordable water they can utilize on a daily basis.” The vote to override, on Jan. 8, was 248 yeas to 177 nays, with 1 voting present, and a two-thirds majority required.

YEAS: Perez

HEALTH INSURANCE SUBSIDIES: The House has passed the Breaking the Gridlock Act (H.R. 1834), sponsored by Rep. James P. McGovern, D-Mass. The bill would extend, through 2028, individual health insurance tax credits that were enacted in 2021 and 2022 and expired at the close of 2025. McGovern said: “It is unconscionable that anyone in the richest country in history should not have access to good, quality health care.” An opponent, Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., called the bill “subsidizing insurance plans for wealthy people,” given that families making up to $600,000 a year would benefit. The vote, on Jan. 8, was 230 yeas to 196 nays.

YEAS: Perez

Senate

MILITARY HEALTH OFFICIAL: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Keith Bass to be assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. Bass was a Navy sailor and officer for two decades, then a medical director at the Central Intelligence Agency, private health care executive, and most recently a hospital administrator at the Veterans Affairs Department. The vote, on Jan. 5, was 50 yeas to 35 nays.

NAYS: Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., Patty Murray, D-Wash.

CIA GENERAL COUNSEL: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Joshua Simmons to be general counsel at the Central Intelligence Agency. A legal adviser at the State Department since May 2025, Simmons was formerly a private practice lawyer specializing in international litigation. The vote, on Jan. 6, was 53 yeas to 47 nays.

NAYS: Cantwell, Murray

DRUG CONTROL OFFICIAL: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Sara Carter Bailey to be the director of national drug control policy, a White House post with responsibility for coordinating anti-drug efforts at 16 different agencies. A former reporter and contributor to Fox News, Carter Bailey also hosted a podcast until last April. An opponent, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said she “lacks any serious qualifications for this role. She is not a physician or addiction specialist. She has never been a prosecutor or law enforcement official.” The vote, on Jan. 6, was 52 yeas to 48 nays.

NAYS: Cantwell, Murray

SOUTH DAKOTA AIR QUALITY: The Senate has rejected a motion to proceed to consideration of a bill (S.J. Res. 86), sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., that would have voided an Environmental Protection Agency rule issued last August that approved South Dakota’s revision of its plan for implementing the EPA’s rule governing regional haze levels and visibility at national parks such as Mount Rushmore. Whitehouse said the approval was part of a Trump administration effort “to tear down the protections of Americans’ health and safety and our environment.” An opponent, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said: “Overturning EPA’s approval would force the state to adopt unnecessary pollution control measures, despite clear evidence that they would not meaningfully improve visibility.” The vote, on Jan. 7, was 43 yeas to 50 nays.

YEAS: Cantwell, Murray

VENEZUELA: The Senate has agreed to a motion to discharge from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a bill (S.J. Res. 98), sponsored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., that would require the ending of U.S. military force against Venezuela in the absence of authorization from Congress. Kaine said congressional oversight of military actions in Venezuela was necessary because of signs “that this will go on for a long period of time. The seizure of oil, the dictation of terms about elections and the politics of Venezuela will go on for years.” A bill opponent, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., cited various examples of past presidential use of military power overseas without prior authorization in saying President Trump has “constitutional authority” to act in Venezuela. The vote to discharge, on Jan. 8, was 52 yeas to 47 nays.

YEAS: Cantwell, Murray

LOUISIANA JUDGE: The Senate has confirmed the nomination of Alexander Van Hook to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. Van Hook had been an assistant U.S. attorney in the district since 1999, then was its acting U.S. attorney from January to September 2025. The vote, on Jan. 8, was 53 yeas to 40 nays.

A consortium of U.S. senators - including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.
), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) - is opening a probe into Big Tech practices that offload the cost of operating data centers onto the communities that host them.
While the probe is being led by Democrats, there has been a rare bipartisan groundswell over the issue in the states where data centers are concentrated.
Not only are data centers adding undue pressure to Americans' already considerable financial burdens, they are also competing for scarce resources in rural and agricultural economies.","For months, anger has been building in the communities that are involuntarily footing the bill for the AI boom. As data center clusters pop up around the globe to feed AI's massive and growing computational needs, nearby communities are seeing their utility bills skyrocket, even if they themselves don't benefit from the sector at all. And now, in the United States, the backlash against data centers' resource consumption - and its impact on consumers' bottom line - has spilled out of the bounds of local politics and landed in the Senate.

A consortium of U.S. senators - including Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) - is opening a probe into Big Tech practices that offload the cost of operating data centers onto the communities that host them. In open letters written to seven AI companies, the senators pushed for accountability and transparency, citing a study that found ""electricity prices have increased by as much as 267 percent in the past five years"" in ""areas located near significant data center activity.""

While the probe is being led by Democrats, there has been a rare bipartisan groundswell over the issue in the states where data centers are concentrated. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that in Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia, ""data centers are responsible for 65% to more than 85% of projected load growth"" for utilities.

Due to this intense demand growth, major utilities in these states, plus North Carolina, project that they will collectively add 32,600 MW of electrical load over the next 15 years. And it's consumers - of energy, not necessarily of AI - who will have to pay the price for all of that additional demand. It's estimated that Virginians can expect average electricity prices to increase by another 25 percent by 2030.

""We are witnessing a massive transfer of wealth from residential utility customers to large corporations-data centers and large utilities and their corporate parents, which profit from building additional energy infrastructure,"" Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp told Business Insider earlier this year. ""Utility regulation is failing to protect residential customers, contributing to an energy affordability crisis.""

And the terms behind that transfer of responsibility are extremely opaque, as is typical for the AI sector. In the Senators' letter to AI companies, they blast these firms for operating in the shadows against public interest. The letter notes that AI firms ""ask public officials to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) preventing them from sharing information with their constituents, operate through what appear to be shell companies to mask the real owner of the data center, and require that landowners sign NDAs as part of the land sale while telling them only that a 'Fortune 100 company' is planning an 'industrial development' seemingly in an attempt to hide the very existence of the data center,"" senators wrote.

Not only are data centers adding undue pressure to Americans' already considerable financial burdens, they are also competing for scarce resources in rural and agricultural economies. Data centers require huge amounts of land and considerable water sources, which could lead to conflict and issues of scarcity in certain hotspots such as drier climates and agricultural communities concerned about land competition and ""environmental impacts, noise and lack of transparency.""

In many ways, the country - and the world - simply is not prepared for the scale of the AI boom, and all of the resources and regulations that it will require. There are serious concerns about whether ageing power grids can keep up with demand, and whether energy output can keep up with surging demand. Plus, the way that our systems are designed simply never saw this coming.

As the senators express in their letter, ""the current, socialized model of electricity ratepaying"" in which costs are shared by all grid users, ""was not designed for an era where just one customer requires the same amount of electricity as some of the largest cities in America.""

The views expressed herein are those of the author alone.

The Trump Administration has seemingly adopted the sidelining of science as a core operating principle. Two egregious examples in this week’s news are emblematic of the extent to which this administration actively regards scientific research and evidence as a hindrance to their policies rather than a critical input.

The Washington Post reported that the scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were ignored in the recent overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule. The Post reported that, “That process to alter vaccine recommendations, they [CDC scientists] and several former health officials said, did not include extensive consultation with the agency’s subject matter experts or the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel that is usually done.” In other words, it was a wholly political decision with no regard for the scientific evidence.

It was also reported that, “Trump administration health officials said the revised schedule more closely resembles recommendations in other high-income countries and would build trust with Americans who think their children are getting too many shots…”. Of course, the officials didn’t note that they and the Secretary of Health and Human Services have aggressively worked to persuade Americans that their children are getting too many shots despite the scientific evidence to the contrary. Tautology is not dead, in case you were wondering.

The EPA Jumps on This Week’s Sidelining Bandwagon

Not to be left out, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to do all they can to ignore the science on chemical safety. After all, it is only one of their core responsibilities in protecting the public. ProPublica reports the EPA is considering adopting a position pushed by chemical companies that the agency does not have the authority to place new restrictions on air pollution once an initial decision has been made, regardless of new evidence as to the potential harm and public health effects of the pollutant. Even writing that sentence seems nonsensical to me.

The implication is straightforward. Scientific evidence that could protect people’s health and safety can only be used once like a Kleenex. New evidence should be ignored. The case in point for this particular sidelining action is restrictions on the use of ethylene oxide for sterilizing medical equipment and in other chemical processes. Prior to 2016, this chemical wasn’t considered as a major dangerous pollutant. It should be noted that the facilities that emit ethylene oxide are largely located in black communities or communities of color as is the case with many chemical facilities. New evidence emerged that ethylene oxide was far more dangerous than previously thought and in 2024 greater restrictions were placed on it’s use. Those restrictions were delayed by the Trump Administration already to allow for a slower transition by industry (apparently 10 years was too fast).

The EPA now is considering adopting the position that the restrictions that are on hold rely on new scientific evidence and that they don’t have the authority to use new evidence. Since the industry complied with the previous, weak, standards there is no problem. Except of course for the increased cancer risk for the people exposed to the pollutant.

Sidelining as a Principle

These two cases from two different agencies rely on the same essential approach by this administration. In the Trump Administration science will not be allowed to influence public policy. Danger to the public be damned.

But to meet future demand under Net-Zero will require adding 10 times more Wind/Solar infrastructure than we have today.
Further, we cannot generate enough energy using only “renewables” to replace aging Wind/Solar infrastructure as it wears out.
However, China must be pleased that the US is destroying its own economy by installing Chinese-made Wind/Solar infrastructure.
NYISO warned of big trouble (October NY Draft Energy Plan) because Albany has continued to push Wind/Solar/BESS.","Twenty years after “An Inconvenient Truth,” none of Al Gore’s wild speculations about climate catastrophe have emerged, yet people still cling to the climate nonsense, and New York state energy policy remains absurdly captive to that narrative.

By way of example, climate fraud led New York to require houses built after Jan. 1 to use electric heat, and required the state have 70% “renewable” energy by 2030. The simple fact that these impossible regulations were devised by Albany politicians demonstrates the absolute incompetence of those who run New York.

Reality recently forced Albany to pause these impossible mandates, but we should not expect Albany politicians to stop rewarding their corporate sponsors with continued subsidies for Wind/Solar/BESS installations. The political gravy train still outweighs the good of working people, and still threatens our region.

Seven years ago Albany passed the impossible Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), and still ignores the impending economic disaster it will cause. After spending billions, New York still derives less than 10% of its total electrical energy from Wind/Solar, which costs two to four times as much as conventional power. CLCPA will bankrupt us while never coming close to attaining its impossible Net-Zero mandates, and here is why…

Wind and Solar require 100% backup; hence we must pay to build redundant generation infrastructure using fossil fuels. But why should we waste resources building Wind/Solar infrastructure in addition to backup generation infrastructure when Natural Gas alone will do the job? It’s economic malpractice.

Worse: If Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are used for backup, then at least 4 days of energy storage will be required to cover lapses in Wind/Solar generation. But to meet future demand under Net-Zero will require adding 10 times more Wind/Solar infrastructure than we have today. Hence, under CLCPA, we will need 40 times more Wind/Solar/BESS infrastructure than we currently have (we are being generous). Where will we put all that stuff? At what cost?

It gets worse: All BESS must be replaced every 10 to 15 years at an estimated cost of about $3.6 trillion for New York state alone ($200,000 per person), and Wind/Solar infrastructure must be replaced every 15-20 years at massive cost. How will we pay for that? Where will we put all the non-recyclable junk?

Further, we cannot generate enough energy using only “renewables” to replace aging Wind/Solar infrastructure as it wears out. This is why Dems won’t pass NY Senate Bill 2023-S6732. Renewables are absolutely not sustainable as was claimed.

To transmit enough electricity for EVs, school buses, home heating, computing, etc., and to balance the Grid using Wind/Solar sources, we must massively increase the carrying capacity and extent of the Distribution and Transmission Systems. Where will all that copper come from?

However, China must be pleased that the US is destroying its own economy by installing Chinese-made Wind/Solar infrastructure. China also holds major stakes in American Wind/Solar companies that soak-up US subsidies – stealing from taxpayers to make China rich. The high cost of “renewables” using Chinese-made infrastructure keeps US industry uncompetitive.

Meanwhile, gas turbine manufacturers are doubling production to meet increasing world-wide demand for Natural Gas power generation, while Hitachi and others are cutting production of Wind Turbines because of their high cost and low effectiveness. The world (except Albany) is rejecting Net-Zero nonsense.

Worldwide more than 100 new designs are being developed for Small Modular Nuclear Reactors (SMRs), with some (China and Russia) already in commercial production. Thirty-five of these new designs are being developed in the US, but we are significantly behind because we have utterly wasted our human and financial resources subsidizing Wind/Solar/BESS for the past 20-plus years.

Japan is now restarting the Fukushima nuclear plant that was shutdown after a tsunami 15 years ago, while Michigan is restarting the Palisades nuclear plant that they previously shut down in a fit of Green stupidity.

In the push for renewables, Albany prematurely killed the Indian Point nuclear plant, which produced over 2.1 GW of reliable clean power 24/7/365, costing NY residents billions of dollars. Indian Point can’t be brought back, but Gov. Kathy Hochul wants us to thank her for finally cracking the door open for nuclear power. Yet she offers no mea-culpa for having wasted billions of NYS taxpayer money killing Indian Point, even after she was warned what would happen when she did so.

NYISO warned of big trouble (October NY Draft Energy Plan) because Albany has continued to push Wind/Solar/BESS. In addition, NYSERDA’s latest report openly states the impossibility of Net Zero under current law (CLCPA). Yet Albany keeps throwing money at Wind/Solar/BESS while Hochul plays politics.

A recent report showed that electricity cost in the state is now 58% higher than the national average. Is it any wonder that our businesses and people pack up and leave?

It’s time to push the Reset Button and repeal CLCPA, and remove all its supporters from Albany for malpractice.

The heat pumps element of the government's green energy strategy risks controversy.","The Warm Homes Plan, originally scheduled for publication late last year, is expected to be released this month, potentially as soon as next week, as part of the government's effort to make households more energy-efficient and reduce their bills.

The strategy will set out £15bn worth of measures designed to encourage people to switch to greener energy sources, and, according to the Labour government, will help lift over one million households out of fuel poverty by 2023.

As part of the plan, Ed Miliband's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) is considering around £2bn worth of loans, interest-free, for households to use to install solar panels, batteries and heat pumps, PoliticsHome understands. These loans would be spread over five to ten years, under one option being discussed.

The government has already confirmed ahead of the Warm Homes Plan that councils and social housing providers will be given up to £1.8bn to decarbonise social housing.

Ministers are also expected to keep long-term subsidies for heat pumps at their existing levels. The government currently offers households £7,500 grants towards heat pumps, with the aim of persuading millions of people to replace gas boilers with the greener, electric alternative.

The government told PoliticsHome it does not comment on leaks.

A DESNZ spokesperson added: “We are investing an additional £1.5bn into our Warm Homes Plan, taking it to nearly £15bn – the biggest ever public investment to upgrade homes and tackle fuel poverty ever.

""We are doubling down on support for home upgrades and will set out our plans to help households, and support thousands more clean energy jobs, soon.”

PoliticsHome understands there is a desire in government to move ahead with the Warm Homes Plan as quickly as possible, with the Prime Minister making tackling the cost-of-living key to his 2026 agenda and rebuilding Labour Party support.

Starmer this week told cabinet ministers to ""keep a relentless focus on the cost of living"" and argued that revivals by centre-left political parties elsewhere in the world have been sparked by driving down costs facing voters.

Ofgem recently confirmed that the energy price cap, which sets the maximum amount suppliers can charge households, would rise by 0.2 per cent from 1 January, meaning that the average household will pay £1,758 a year.

The heat pumps element of the government's green energy strategy risks controversy. The Times recently reported concern among some Labour MPs that a move to impose levies on gas boilers to subsidise heat pumps would disproportionately impact lower-income households, and fuel Reform UK criticism of the government's net zero agenda.

“The government is too focused on heat pumps… for many in the worst-performing houses, a heat pump isn’t the solution that dramatically changes bills,"" one anonymous Labour MP told the newspaper.

The Tony Blair Institute think tank (TBI), which has close links to the Keir Starmer Labour government, warned in October that the government's plan to achieve clean power by 2030 needed reform, arguing that earlier policies were ""launched in the middle of the gas crisis and in a low-interest environment, it was right for its time, but circumstances have changed"".","https://res.cloudinary.com/dyw8mv3b0/image/upload/q_85,w_1200,h_1200,c_limit/v1/news/2026_01/3DA7T5P_dptb32.jpg",N,,2026-01-10 18:58:48.987301

By Dan Murphy

Westchester Congressman Mike Lawler took to the House floor on Dec. 16, to blast the leadership of both parties, yes even his own republican leadership, over both sides lack of interest in solving the expiration of the Obamacare, ACA, tax credits. This resulted in huge premium increases for the millions of americans who rely on the ACA.

Lawler said, “For 43 days. The Democrats shut down the government and they said it was over the issue of the ACA premium tax credits. I went and confronted Leader Jeffries, and I asked him to sign on to a one year extension. He refused. When the government finally opened, I and a number of my Republican and Democratic colleagues sat down in good faith to negotiate an extension of the ACA premium tax credits with reforms, because we recognize that this system as designed is not working. That Obamacare is not actually reducing health care costs in America. And in fact, since it took effect, health care premiums have risen by 96%.

“But we understood that to allow the premium tax credits to expire would hurt the American people. And so we sat down and negotiated, and we came up with several plans. And compromises along the way to ensure not only that there was an extension, but that we did eliminate fraud, that we did hold the insurance companies accountable, that we did actually start to reduce cost.

“We have put those bills forward on the floor in two separate discharge petitions. 11 Republicans have signed on to those discharge petitions. Now, why is that necessary? Because House Republican leadership will not allow a vote. It is idiotic. And shameful. And so we have been forced to sign on to two discharge petitions.

“And yet my Democratic colleagues will not join us. But for those that were at the negotiation table, the Democratic leader will not release his members to sign those two discharge petitions. Why? Because he doesn’t actually want to solve the problem. He wants the issue. He wants the issue. Which is precisely why Senator Schumer put a three year clean extension on the Senate floor that was doomed to fail because it doesn’t have bipartisan compromise.

“This place is disgraceful. Everybody wants the upper hand. Everybody wants the political advantage. They don’t actually want to do the damn work. This problem could be solved today if everybody who says they care about extending this signs the discharge. It could be solved today. And we could say to the leadership on both sides, a pox on both your houses.

“Both of you are failing this country. Both of you are failing this institution and move the bill forward. So the challenge I have for every one of my colleagues is put the party crap aside and sign the damn discharge today. If you want this, vote to move. If you want to extend these subsidies, if you want to make sure that the American people’s health care premiums don’t skyrocket, then go sign the discharge. Now, because we all understand one thing. You need 218 here and you need 60 in the Senate. We saw the three year extension with no reforms fail last week. So to just say that we’re going to hold out and wait to see if four Republicans sign the three year extension that you know is destined to fail in the Senate is a failure of leadership and responsibility.

“So, Leader Jeffries, come down to this floor, sign the discharge and show real leadership, because sadly, my conference has failed to do that. And all of us, as representatives of our own districts and our own constituents, have a responsibility to stand up. It’s why I met with my Democratic colleagues as soon as the government was reopened to negotiate in good faith. It’s why people like Brian Fitzpatrick and Jen Higgins and David Valadao have been leading on this issue, with folks like Jared Golden and Josh Gottheimer and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Tom Suozzi, because we understand this needs to get done. And the failure of members on both sides of the aisle who know it needs to get done, but they just want the issue, or they don’t want to do it because they hate Obamacare. Yeah, we know Obamacare failed. We know it’s not actually reducing costs. But you can’t fix it with nothing. So do your job and sign the discharge,” said Lawler.

The enhanced subsidies (also known as enhanced premium tax credits) for Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health insurance plans expired on December 31, 2025.

These temporary enhancements—first introduced in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act and extended through 2025 by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act—made subsidies more generous (e.g., capping premiums at a lower percentage of income) and eliminated the “subsidy cliff” for incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level. Congress did not extend them further, so they lapsed at the end of 2025, affecting coverage starting in 2026.

The original ACA premium tax credits (subsidies) remain permanent and available in 2026 for eligible enrollees (generally those with incomes 100-400% of the federal poverty level), but they are less generous than the enhanced version. This has led to significantly higher out-of-pocket premiums for millions of marketplace enrollees in 2026.",https://yonkerstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mlcp-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 14:59:03.704709

Illinois will then be able to add large-scale capacity to its nuclear fleet, which already has more power reactors than any other site—11 across six plant sites.

New views: The CRGA was passed by the Illinois General Assembly on October 30, 2025, clearing the state Senate by a vote of 37–22 and the state House by 70–37. Pritzker’s signing of this legislation represented a shift from his August 2023 veto of a bill that would have lifted the state’s large reactor moratorium. At that time, he condemned that bill for “open[ing] the door to the proliferation of large-scale nuclear reactors that are so costly to build that they will cause exorbitant ratepayer-funded bailouts.”

Later that same year, Pritzker signed a bill to allow the construction of small modular reactors in Illinois. Now, the signing of the CRGA indicates that Pritzker wants the state to attract new nuclear investments.

At a press event announcing the new act in Joliet, Pritzker said, “In Illinois, we are pursuing every available option to produce affordable, efficient, clean, and abundant energy. We are leaving no stone unturned in the work to produce more electricity, lower prices for our people, and secure our long-term energy future. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act sets a national standard in the effort to lower energy costs and marks a historic step forward in our clean energy vision. Once again, Illinois is stepping up where the federal government is failing.”

Other provisions: There are several other provisions of the CRGA besides the lifting of the reactor moratorium. The act establishes a state procurement goal of 3 GW of grid-scale battery storage by 2030. It requires utilities to create “virtual power plant” programs that will reward participating households and businesses for using smart thermostats, solar panels, small batteries, and electric vehicles. The act also requires utilities that are administering state energy-efficiency programs to meet a minimum level of spending to help low-income households.

Additional provisions of the CRGA include the creation of an integrated resource planning process to find ways to keep energy bills low and make improvements to state programs, a requirement for the Illinois Power Agency to propose long-term clean energy contract procurements for Illinois Commerce Commission approval, and an increase in the maximum size for community solar projects to 10 MW.",https://www.ans.org/file/23125/l/Picture1.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 18:12:40.083236

Shaheen was joined by fuel delivery companies, advocates and members of Strafford County Community Action Partnership (CAPSC). Prior to the roundtable, Shaheen toured Gafney Home, CAPSC’s new, energy efficient and affordable housing facility for older adults. Photos from today’s event can be found HERE.

“Energy costs are always a top concern for families and businesses, especially during New Hampshire’s cold winters,” said Senator Shaheen. “The Trump Administration’s misguided actions are keeping electricity and home heating costs high instead of lowering them, so I appreciated hearing directly from folks on the ground about the challenges they’re facing as a result. With so many Granite Staters already feeling squeezed by the high cost of household expenses, it remains one of my top priorities to protect federal programs that help families lower their energy bills and stay warm in their homes.”

At a time when the cost of living is top a concern, Shaheen has led the charge in Washington to protect federal programs that help Granite Staters afford their energy bills and make energy efficiency updates that save money. Thanks to Shaheen’s efforts, the administration recently released delayed federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funding, which more than 57,000 Granite Staters rely on to help pay their home heating bills. Shaheen has condemned efforts by the Trump Administration to eliminate staff responsible for administering the LIHEAP program.

Shaheen was a key supporter of the Inflation Reduction Act and a lead negotiator of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, legislation that made landmark investments in energy efficiency. In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Shaheen helped secure $3.5 billion in additional funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program, including $18 million for New Hampshire. Shaheen has long-championed the Weatherization Assistance Program to lower energy costs for low-income families in New Hampshire, as well as the State Energy Program, which assists states with the development of energy efficiency renewable projects. In December, the New Hampshire delegation called on the Department of Energy to immediately release the remaining $9 million in funding for weatherization from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. In addition, Shaheen led the delegation in opposing the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to terminate a $43 million grant for New Hampshire to support community solar and other solar projects that would reduce residents’ utility bills by 20% or more.

Community Wealth Building in action Tilley remains Tiree’s financial backbone, but after major repairs it is uninsurable and nearing the end of its life.
The work done by the Tiree Community Development Trust shows what Community Wealth Building looks like in practice.
It reflects a wider shift – now enshrined in the Community Wealth Building Bill going through Holyrood – to root economic power closer to communities.
For Community Land Scotland and its members, Chalmers says Community Wealth Building “resonates with a lot of communities because it really describes what they’re doing naturally.","Approaching the wind-buffeted island of Tiree after a four-hour ferry journey, visitors and residents alike are greeted by the sight of Tilley – the community-owned wind turbine that rises fifty metres above the Atlantic. More than a landmark, Tilley has become a symbol of what happens when a community takes its future into its own hands.

“We are very lucky,” says Phyl Meyer, Chief Officer of Tiree Community Development Trust (Urras Thiriodh). “We’ve got a wind turbine right now that is providing the vast majority of funding, which allows my staff and I to be here to do all of these things and to professionally run projects and services.”

Like many rural and island communities, Tiree’s population has been declining for many years, as people move to the mainland to look for jobs, housing and other opportunities they couldn’t find on the island. Local people became increasingly worried about the sustainability of the school, and the risk of a tipping point for further population decline.

“There are families who are considering leaving the island because of the lack of childcare,” says Meyer. “And if we lose those families, it’s the impact of their jobs not being filled anymore, and how we replace them, less kids in the school, potential threats to the funding for that, etc. It’s all interconnected and if one domino falls over, another domino falls and another. We spend a lot of our time worrying about how we head off the cascading dominoes.”

In 2006 a group of local people came together to take the future of the island into their own hands, based on the belief that the community needed to generate its own income to be able to make the investments needed in the community, and set up Tiree Community Development Trust.

Their ambitious plan to harness the powerful natural resource flying over their heads paid off. Managed through the trading arm Tiree Renewable Energy Ltd, Tilley – a 900 kW turbine – has channelled about £4 million back into the community of just 650 people, funding everything from critical infrastructure to essential community services.

When the island’s two main harbours were crumbling, threatening the viability of the local fishing fleet, the Trust led a major regeneration, securing the livelihoods of dozens of families. When the island’s only petrol station faced closure, they built a replacement, sparing residents a two-day trip to the mainland for fuel. They run a community broadband service – recently the only working connection after a major storm – and rescued the village shop, which is now also a post office.

To further nurture local enterprise, they constructed four modern business units, providing permanent space for a hairdresser, art gallery and creative social enterprise, allowing small businesses to thrive where they once struggled for space. Now, with housing being the most urgent need on the island the Trust is driving forward a major project to build affordable community-owned homes.

Their work goes beyond physical infrastructure. The income from Tilley also funds a full-time youth officer who runs a year-round programme of activities, to make Tiree a vibrant place for children to grow up, a Ranger Service to manage tourism, a home energy efficiency improvement and community advice service, a vital electric community minibus and provides small grants for local groups.

At their core, the Trust is responsive to community needs, building solutions and resilience against the threat of domino effects, where one missing service can collapse the viability of industries, ways of life, and ultimately the community itself. Currently the Trust is working to find a solution to the retirement of the last vet on the island, exploring a community-owned practice to ensure the crofting economy remains viable, and working to develop a solution to the lack of childcare on the island.

Rhoda Meek, Head of Communications and Gaelic, says: “The work that community development trusts do is absolutely vital in places like this. You could argue these are things that should be done from a statutory level, but we are where we are. Our development trusts are vital for healthy communities and to keep economic development going.”

“We’re not just about one project,” she adds. “You’re running a petrol station, a business centre, broadband, youth work and a heritage centre, and you’ve only got a population of 650. It’s a lot.

“Core funding is what’s missing. You can get capital to build something shiny, but you can’t get money to keep it running or pay people properly.”

Networks Behind the Success

But this success of community ownership doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It requires an equally expert support system. Enter Community Land Scotland (CLS), an intermediary body providing the critical support organisations like the Tiree Trust need.

More than 500 communities across Scotland have taken ownership of buildings and land, covering over 200,000 hectares. As the representative body for Scotland’s community landowners CLS underpins that movement by providing specialist advice, peer learning and national advocacy.

“Our strength in Scotland is that breadth and the way organisations work together,” says Linsay Chalmers, Director of Communities & Operations at CLS. “We support emerging and existing community landowners with networking and peer-to-peer learning opportunities.”

When Tiree began tackling its housing crisis – nearly half of homes are empty or used seasonally – CLS helped by arranging visits to Eigg and Knoydart so the Trust could learn directly from peers who had already delivered affordable homes. That exchange of experience saved time, risk and money.

CLS also supported Tiree’s Gaelic work, providing funding for a development project and convening community groups on Raasay to share learning. Rhoda Meek who works on developing Gaelic on the island says: “Gaelic is hugely linked to crofting and to the sea. For those of us whose roots are in Tiree, our grandfathers fished and worked the ground. Crofting and fishing are still a huge part of our local economy – vitally important and completely intertwined with our Gaelic language and culture.”

Other networks and organisations – Development Trusts Association Scotland, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES) – have also provided invaluable technical and financial support, such as funding their new solar array and upgrading insulation in community buildings.

For the leaders doing this challenging work, the connections forged by these intermediary bodies and the support they provide are a lifeline.

Community Wealth Building in action

Tilley remains Tiree’s financial backbone, but after major repairs it is uninsurable and nearing the end of its life. As Meyer says: “If that turbine breaks tomorrow, we are not insured for loss of business. There will be a cliff edge that we will fall off without more core funding from the government.”

In response, the Trust is investing in more resilient and scalable solar arrays and exploring a local energy co-op to keep profits circulating locally. The strategy is clear: resilience through community ownership.

The work done by the Tiree Community Development Trust shows what Community Wealth Building looks like in practice. Wealth created locally stays local. Contractors are hired on the island, surpluses fund new services and decisions are made by residents.

It reflects a wider shift – now enshrined in the Community Wealth Building Bill going through Holyrood – to root economic power closer to communities. The Bill would require public bodies to develop local action plans that help generate, circulate and retain wealth within their areas.

For Community Land Scotland and its members, Chalmers says Community Wealth Building “resonates with a lot of communities because it really describes what they’re doing naturally. A lot of our members’ models are about creating wealth and reinvesting that back in their communities.”

Josh Doble, Director of Policy & Advocacy at Community Land Scotland highlights that some members have concerns that the Bill won’t do what it needs to. He says there’s been some discussion about a lack of clarity about what ‘wealth’ means and too much focus on state-led approaches: “There’s a fear that Community Wealth Building becomes too fixated on economics, and doesn’t capture the holistic benefits it can deliver for local communities. There’s a danger of it just becoming government jargon rather than a genuinely transformative way of rewiring the economy. That’s why we want to show that communities are already doing community wealth building, so successful community-led approaches don’t get lost.”

Jill Keegan, Partnerships Manager at Scottish Community Alliance, agrees: “Communities have been doing this for decades. The Bill is an opportunity for government and other stakeholders to make what’s already happening easier and more sustainable.”

Tiree’s story shows that Community Wealth Building isn’t a theory – it’s already happening. It’s being built from the ground up by local people, delivering real results, and filling the gaps where both market and state have struggled to keep rural places alive. What the island needs now is meaningful long term support to enable them to continue meeting the local community’s needs, ensuring life on Tiree remains viable and resilient for future generations.",https://www.scottishbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CWB-Tiree-3-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 18:58:53.735384

But experts who have researched radar interference from offshore wind farms have found that it can be addressed with technological fixes and training for boat captains.","It was three days before Christmas, and Patrick Crowley was getting ready for a holiday party when he got a shocking text.

Mr. Crowley, the president of the Rhode Island A.F.L.-C.I.O., learned that the Trump administration had halted construction on Revolution Wind, a nearly completed $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that employed hundreds of his members.

Again.

The same thing had happened in August, stunning leaders in Connecticut and Rhode Island, where the wind farm was expected to power more than 350,000 homes and businesses once completed. But the two states and Orsted, the Danish energy giant behind Revolution Wind, had sued and in September a federal judge had allowed construction on the project to resume.

Months had passed since that initial disruption. Construction was now 87 percent complete, with 58 of 65 wind turbines installed.

“People at the Christmas party were really in shock,” Mr. Crowley said. “We had already gone through this in August.”

Businesses around the world have been roiled by President Trump’s sudden policy shifts. But few have had it worse than offshore wind companies.

In its abrupt Dec. 22 announcement, the Trump administration halted work on all five wind farms currently under construction off the East Coast. They are collectively worth $25 billion and were expected to power more than 2.5 million buildings and create around 10,000 jobs.

The five wind farms were pioneers in what President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had hoped would be a new era of offshore wind power in the United States. The Biden administration had vetted the projects and awarded the permits, allowing the developers to secure financing, sign contracts to sell the electricity to states and utilities, hire workers, lease equipment and begin construction.

The projects — Revolution Wind, Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind off New York, Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind off Virginia — would join two smaller operating offshore wind farms in U.S. coastal waters.

Now, workers are idled in the middle of winter, when other construction jobs are scarce. The companies building the wind farms are hemorrhaging tens of millions of dollars a day. Some have said that if the work stoppage lasts much longer, they may have to abandon their projects altogether, absorbing billions of dollars in losses and laying off thousands of workers.

Developers of four of the five wind farms, along with the states of Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island, are suing to try to restart construction. Court hearings start on Monday and rulings could come as soon as next week.

This account of the turbulence in the country’s nascent offshore wind industry is based on interviews with more than a dozen union workers, energy lobbyists and politicians in both parties as well as a review of hundreds of pages of court filings. Some of the individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive deliberations.

Several people used the word “whiplash” to describe the shifting status of the five wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean.

The Interior Department notified developers of the latest halt just minutes before Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced it on Fox News. And Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat of Connecticut, found out from a call from Mr. Burgum soon afterward.

Mr. Lamont said that he told the secretary, “You’re a business guy. I thought this was a pro-business administration. This is incredibly anti-business. It’s so erratic, helter-skelter, back-and-forth, on-again, off-again.”

White House officials say their stance on offshore wind power has not changed since Mr. Trump’s first day back in office, when he issued a memorandum freezing approvals of all new wind projects on federal lands and waters. The president has repeatedly called wind turbines ugly, expensive and inefficient.

A brief reprieve

In the months leading up to the December stoppage, many lobbyists and executives at offshore wind companies had thought the political turmoil was over and the projects could safely proceed.

The outlook seemed stable enough for Equinor, the developer of the $5 billion Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island, N.Y., to pour an additional $1.5 billion into the project since May, court filings show.

The Trump administration had paused construction on Empire Wind in April but allowed it to restart in May after weeks of negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York. The administration suggested it had relented only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state, although Ms. Hochul has denied that such a deal was made.

Everything seemed to have returned to normal throughout the fall. Even on Friday, Dec. 19, just three days before the latest stoppage, many developers thought their projects were in the clear, according to two Republican energy lobbyists briefed on the matter.

But that day, senior administration officials met to discuss a classified report by the Defense Department that found the projects could threaten national security by interfering with radar systems, the two lobbyists said. By Monday, the administration announced it was pausing the leases that all five projects hold to build and operate in federal waters.

Representatives for Orsted and Equinor, who had been meeting regularly with officials from the Interior Department and the Coast Guard throughout the fall, were blindsided. Not once had any national security concerns ever come up, the companies both said in legal filings.

The Defense Department had repeatedly reviewed the plans for all five wind farms for years after they were proposed, and the companies had taken steps requested by the military to reduce impacts on radar systems. Dominion Energy, the developer of the largest stalled wind farm off Virginia, had paid $250,000 to upgrade military radar in the area.

Orsted, Equinor and Dominion have asked the Trump administration to give classified briefings on its concerns to representatives who hold national security clearances. But to date the Pentagon has not granted these requests, the companies said in legal filings.

“We have been clear and consistent that we are ready to address any additional national security concerns that were not already addressed over our lengthy engagement with defense agencies,” said Molly Morris, a senior vice president at Equinor overseeing Empire Wind.

“So this does come as a surprise to us,” she added, “and we have not been given access to the top secret evidence that apparently is available now.”

Orsted and Dominion declined to comment beyond what was in their public court filings.

Representative Jeff Van Drew, a Republican of New Jersey and a leading critic of offshore wind power on Capitol Hill, said he thought the national security concerns were legitimate. “If someone were to try to suggest that Trump is just using the Department of Defense as a vehicle or a tool in order to stop wind, I don’t think that’s accurate,” he said.

But experts who have researched radar interference from offshore wind farms have found that it can be addressed with technological fixes and training for boat captains.

“It is a known problem and it has been studied, but it doesn’t seem like the problem can’t be resolved,” said Frank Rusco, the director of natural resources and environment at the Government Accountability Office and an author of an April 2025 report on the topic.

From ‘dire’ to ‘near terminal’

Shutting down a partly built, multibillion-dollar wind farm in the middle of the ocean is neither cheap nor easy.

That’s because these projects involve a careful choreography of specialized workers, equipment and ships. Any delays can cause the entire timeline to unravel.

At Revolution Wind, Orsted is using a 450-foot-long ship called the Wind Scylla to install towering steel turbines. The ship is only under contract until Feb. 22 and then is scheduled to depart for other projects around the world.

Off the shores of Long Island, Empire Wind is in an even more precarious position.

Initially, the Interior Department allowed Equinor to conduct activities deemed necessary for health and safety, such as its work installing a 3,000-ton electrical substation in the ocean that would include lighting systems to help ships and aircraft avoid collisions in the area.

But the agency ordered a halt to most of these activities, too, on Jan. 5 with little explanation.

“This development turned a dire situation for Empire Wind into a near terminal one,” lawyers for Equinor wrote in a court filing. The company said that if it could not resume work by Jan. 16, it would likely have to cancel Empire Wind altogether because the vessel needed to lift the substation onto its foundations has to leave this month and would not become available for at least another year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/10/multimedia/10cli-offshore-wind-01-jwkl/10cli-offshore-wind-01-jwkl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 14:58:53.799627

One right off the top is its conflict with the federal Clean Air Act.

Last year, Climate Superfund bills in California, New Hampshire, and Virginia stalled.","The controversial Climate Superfund Act, in all likelihood, will not advance in this legislative session.

But it will likely get new life when the 222nd legislative session begins Tuesday, albeit with a different name.

What is certain, however, is the bill, which seeks to retroactively penalize New Jersey companies $50 billion for legally providing fossil fuels that are essential to residents' survival and prosperity, may still have a mountain to climb from a strictly legal standpoint.

In key written and verbal testimony to the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee this week, New Jersey Civil Justice Institute President Elissa Frank raised the three main obstacles – among others - which may be difficult to overcome.

One right off the top is its conflict with the federal Clean Air Act.

“Congress enacted the Clean Air Act to create a comprehensive national framework for regulating greenhouse gas emissions, delegating primary authority to the United States Environmental Protection Agency,” Frank told lawmakers on Thursday.

“States may play a cooperative role, but they do not have the authority to regulate out-of-state emissions or impose liability for global atmospheric conditions. This bill attempts to do just that, which creates a direct conflict with federal law.”

Frank also noted that the bill raises “serious due process concerns” with its retroactive approach.

“The bill retroactively penalizes businesses for activities that federal and state governments not only permitted but affirmatively encouraged for decades as part of national energy policy,” Frank said.

“Imposing massive liability now, after the fact, on a narrow subset of New Jersey companies upends settled expectations and does so in an arbitrary and disproportionate manner, particularly while ignoring the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emitters.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, New Jersey contributes just 1.7% of the United States’ GHG emissions and only 0.3% of worldwide emissions.

Frank also noted the bill runs afoul of the federal interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.

“By imposing liability for lawful extraction and refining activities that occurred outside of the state of New Jersey, the bill attempts to regulate conduct beyond the state's borders in violation of the U.S. Commerce Clause,” she said.

“Greenhouse gas emissions are global by nature, and this bill improperly assigns responsibility for worldwide emissions to a handful of in-state businesses.

Frank noted that NJCJI advocates for “a fair, predictable, and efficient civil justice system that supports investment, job creation, and critically, affordability for, for New Jersey families and businesses.”

And the Climate Superfund Act, which was suddenly renamed by sponsors without any explanation to the ""Polluters Pay to Make New Jersey Affordable Act"" on Thursday, likely didn’t pass legal muster in other smaller details, according to Frank’s written testimony.

“This bill is legally deficient, constitutionally suspect, and guaranteed to embroil our courts in prolonged and costly litigation, diverting judicial resources and undermining the predictability of New Jersey's civil justice system,” Frank said.

WATCHING OTHER STATES

Both New York and Vermont have voted for similar Climate Superfund laws, and the federal Department of Justice filed lawsuits last May against both states seeking to invalidate their statutes and block enforcement, citing them as ""lawless overreach.”

Also last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute filed a federal lawsuit against the state of Vermont, the first state to enact a climate Superfund law even though the state does not produce or refine fossil fuels.

Decisions on those lawsuits could be coming in the first half of 2026. And other states will be watching.

Last year, Climate Superfund bills in California, New Hampshire, and Virginia stalled. Other states like Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut, Hawaii, Oregon, Rhode Island and Tennessee also did not take action last year, despite consideration of the rule previously.

Presumably, they’re waiting on the outcome of the Vermont and New York lawsuits.

“Each state’s case has, or will have, unique circumstances,” NJBIA Deputy Chief Government Affairs Officer Ray Cantor said. “But what’s important to remember is that for all the ideological grandstanding or costly cash grabs that are attempted, the validity of these laws will come down to the courts.

“And we do expect they will have a long way to go to pass legal muster.”",https://njbia.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Untitled-2026-01-09T233146.373.png,N,,2026-01-10 13:59:30.942112

Investing in circular economy, partnerships and business resilience According to Dirk, sustainability at Volkswagen extends far beyond decarbonisation and EVs.
“We invest up to €25m per year into biodiversity projects – to demonstrate we can restore, regenerate or maintain nature,” Dirk says.
“Regenerative Plus was the first building block of the group strategy.
Building the future Volkswagen Group foresees electrification as central to the future of mobility.","Volkswagen Group, one of the world’s leading automotive conglomerates, is transforming its sustainability ambitions with a blueprint intended to regenerate value for people, planet and business. Leading this strategy is Chief Sustainability Officer Dirk Voeste.

Over the past two and a half years, Dirk has brought fresh perspective from a diverse background – first as a biologist, then as a space scientist and later as sustainability lead for chemical giant BASF – to Volkswagen Group, which encompasses brands such as Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, Porsche, Škoda, SEAT and more. His decision to join Volkswagen was an unplanned, dynamic step, shaped by a sense of duty to “clean up something our generation left”, as encouraged by his family.​

“To me, it’s about impact – but it’s also about business and how we drive it,” Dirk explains.

See the full feature in issue 60 of Sustainability Magazine, sister title to Manufacturing Digital.

The foundations of VW’s sustainability strategy

Much of VW’s work builds on what Dirk describes as “enormous, energising, impactful” activity – connecting technical innovation with deep-rooted values, strategising for long-term effect and embedding a culture where sustainability is a shared language and business imperative.

Despite his science-based entry point into sustainability through aerospace, agricultural and chemical sectors, Dirk’s approach at VW pivots around a four-pillared philosophy. The Regenerate+ strategy reframes traditional models, moving from the classic triad of environment, society and business to an expanded quartet:

Nature

Society

Business

People.​

“Volkswagen has 670,000 employees worldwide,” Dirk explains. “I think they need a voice, especially when transforming from analogue to digital, from combustion to electric.”

The result is a new, holistic vision for Volkswagen Group which defines sustainability as creating value “for today’s and future generations, nature, society and business”. It prioritises measurable impact across the value chain and links purpose and profitability inseparably in the Group’s strategy.​ Dirk insists, “It has to make business sense, it’s not philanthropic”.

Sustainability, he argues, becomes “real and tangible” only when it delivers benefits for customers and stakeholders, whether those are more efficient vehicles, lower emissions or improved user experience. “An electric vehicle, for example, is super efficient,” Dirk explains. “A regular ID.7 model runs with 20 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometres – equivalent to two litres of diesel. It offers enormous efficiency, less maintenance and quieter driving – once people drive electric, we rarely see them switch back.”​

The four pillars of Volkswagen’s Regenerate+ strategy are each tracked by dedicated KPIs. “We track these holistically, but always with a business lens,” Dirk says. “Sometimes certain projects engage our neighbourhood, but meeting the business case is vital.”

Sustainability-first strategy

Volkswagen Group’s Regenerate+ strategy was launched by CEO Oliver Blume in Berlin before the company’s wider strategy to highlight leadership commitment.

“Our suppliers also need to see we’re really staying close,” Dirk explains. “It has to be pragmatic, ingrained in the culture.”

The strategy’s legitimacy rests on rigorous transparency through progress reports. Volkswagen reports quantifiable progress each year, responding to the new EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

Investing in circular economy, partnerships and business resilience

According to Dirk, sustainability at Volkswagen extends far beyond decarbonisation and EVs. Central to the Regenerate+ strategy is the circular economy, which seeks to minimise extraction of new materials and maximise recycling and reuse across the vehicle life-cycle.

“Circular economy hits all our pillars – nature, decarbonisation, people, society and business. It’s a really overarching topic,” Dirk explains.

For automotive manufacturing, this involves steel, glass, aluminium, polymers and used parts, returned and refurbished for new use.​

“Why should we take more resources out than we already have?” Dirk asks. “Half of the copper demand could be met from recycled material, which is not currently being recycled. Circular economy helps reduce the carbon footprint, creates untapped value streams in automotive and is a form of business resilience. It makes sense regionally, too, by strengthening supply chains and reducing risk.”

VW’s supplier network is vast – more than 60,000 – operating under strict sustainability ratings. “We’ve set a target, so by 2040, 95% of our relevant suppliers need an A or B rating,” Dirk says. “We’re at 83% now. We talk to suppliers, de-risk, understand problems and help them improve.”​

This link between circularity, resilience and financial performance is vital. “If you reduce your carbon footprint, you take out energy, reduce costs and become more robust and competitive,” Dirk says. By focusing on partnerships for sustainability, Volkswagen also mitigates supply risk and controls costs, enhancing long-term competitiveness. “Sustainability is also about partnerships,” Dirk explains. “You can’t do it alone – you need partners in all instances, whether it’s decarbonisation, technologies or circular economy.”

Biodiversity and nature restoration: beyond the factory gates

For Volkswagen Group, responsibility for nature and biodiversity is integral to its sustainability mission. The company builds up to nine million cars annually, with 114 global assets and an expansive supply chain, all of which impact nature directly or indirectly. “If nature gets out of balance, we as a society have an issue,” Dirk says. “As a car manufacturer, you have an impact on nature – streets, production sites, supply chains.”​

VW’s solution is twofold – internal supply chain dialogue using sustainability ratings and a new annual biodiversity fund worth up to €25m (US$29.2m) for direct restoration projects. “We invest up to €25m per year into biodiversity projects – to demonstrate we can restore, regenerate or maintain nature,” Dirk says.

“If this works in our suppliers and own assets, it’s a form of resilience. It’s not philanthropic, but a business reason. If you can combine both, the better.”

The Group also empowers employees across its global brands – whether in Germany, France, UK, Canada, Spain, China or beyond – with an internal sustainability impact fund. This supports grassroots proposals for neighbourhood engagement, energy efficiency and process innovation in plant operations. “Ownership is with the people,” Dirk stresses.

Staff empowerment and organisational engagement in sustainability

Stakeholder buy-in is central to Volkswagen’s sustainability transformation. Employee engagement is encouraged, not only via financial backing but by fostering transparent dialogue. “In the last year, over 9,000 initiatives reduced energy consumption, saving 3.5 million megawatt hours annually – all through small, sustained changes,” Dirk says.

Governance is refreshed, too. A ‘sustainability practice group’ model supports each of Regenerate+’ four pillars, with three internal and three external experts on areas like nature, society, people and business. Advisory groups meet at least twice yearly with the board, cross-pollinating expertise between the World Wildlife Fund, biodiversity specialists and zero-carbon NGOs, as well as project leaders.

This network drives actionable knowledge and holds the organisation accountable. “You can always call the expert – on circular economy, decarbonisation, biodiversity – when you need help,” he says. Compared to standard advisory boards, this interactive, dynamic approach is a distinct innovation.

Commitment to delivering impact

Volkswagen’s commitment to measurable impact is evident across operations. The Zero Impact Factory programme targets all production facilities, aiming for near-zero environmental impact by 2040, ahead of the group’s overall target for 2050. Renewable energy will power Group factories by 2030, with transparent annual public reporting. “Wherever we can, we push the needle forward,” says Dirk. “If we’re in control, let’s do what we can to drive the topic.”

A key differentiator, he adds, is the sequencing of sustainability initiatives ahead of mainstream business strategy. “Regenerative Plus was the first building block of the group strategy. A completely different way of doing it, really unique. Thanks to Oliver, we did it this way.”

Even in the face of market uncertainty and geopolitical turbulence, Volkswagen has committed to ‘staying the course.’ The future is clear: leadership, consistency and ambition are non-negotiable.

Building the future

Volkswagen Group foresees electrification as central to the future of mobility. “Electrification will be the future. I’m not criticising combustion, but EVs are quieter, easier to use, super convenient, cool in summer and heated in winter – the future will be electric,” Dirk says.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/309cb1ea5e55302b3875fb04c5f5ddb8:16364b48f3146acac216ea55933cb9ed/vw-cso-2.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:00:22.922772

The question before justices in Chevron v. Plaquemines is whether Chevron can remove the lawsuit from state court to federal court if they are sued over actions connected to federal contracts?

Louisiana disputes the premise entirely, arguing the case against Chevron has nothing to do with a federal contract.

“There is no federal contract that this arises under,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in an interview. “Hard stop – we win.”

There were indeed federal contracts between the U.S. government and Texaco, later acquired by Chevron, to refine aviation gasoline for the war effort during World War II. But those were purchase agreements, not directives, Louisiana argues – deals that didn’t tell Texaco where to drill, how to operate in Louisiana’s coastal zone or to engage in the conduct the parish is now suing over decades later.

“They just said, ‘We’ll buy it from you,’” Murrill said from Washington, D.C., where she is preparing for Monday’s arguments. “You can get it from anybody you want, and we will buy it from you.”

Murrill’s point is that a procurement contract like that doesn’t make all of a company’s operations federally directed. World War II ended in 1945, she noted, while Plaquemines Parish’s claims center on activities that continued for decades afterward and, in the state’s view, violated Louisiana’s coastal permitting law adopted in 1979.

Chevron, however, will argue that the distinction doesn’t matter. The company says the federal-officer removal statute is intentionally broad — allowing not only federal officers but also private contractors “acting under” them to move cases to federal court when the claims are “for or relating to” work done under federal authority.

The companies say the parishes’ claims over oil-field production are intertwined with the refining that supplied the federal war effort, and that both activities were closely linked and federally supervised during World War II – enough to justify federal jurisdiction.

Meanwhile, Louisiana’s coastal parishes have filed more than 40 similar lawsuits over the past decade, alleging that oil-and-gas operations contributed to the state’s catastrophic land loss. In the first case to reach a jury, Plaquemines Parish won a verdict of about $744.6 million against Chevron.

The companies say those kinds of local verdicts are precisely why Congress created a path to federal court. Supporters argue that allowing such suits to remain in local venues risks bias in favor of local governments with massive sums on the line. Murrill said the total exposure across all the cases is “definitely in the multi-billions.”

Industry supporters warn that if the Supreme Court upholds Louisiana’s position, contractors could hesitate to take on federally directed work for fear of being exposed to local lawsuits decades later. “The question,” said former Justice Department attorney Mike Fragoso, “is whether contractors will keep doing federally directed work if they are exposed to this kind of tort liability down the line.”

The U.S. Solicitor General has sided with Chevron and other companies, requesting and receiving 10 minutes of argument time.

Fragoso pointed out that the case is ultimately about federal supremacy: even though states are sovereigns, the federal government is supreme, and contractors doing the federal government’s work shouldn’t be forced to defend that work in local courts. Fragoso invoked Chief Justice John Marshall’s warning that “the power to tax is the power to destroy,” arguing that the power to hit federal contractors with massive local verdicts can be an even more potent way to undermine federal operations.

“I think that it's convenient for them to say that,” Murrill said, noting her reputation as a virulent defender of the energy industry. “All the regulations and laws that we have effect now have not inhibited our ability to conduct warfare.”",https://delta.creativecirclecdn.com/lpn/original/20260109-101941-703-d43d6-LA%20Attorney%20Liz%20Murrill.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:13:29.928529

As anti-oil and gas activists seek legal pathways to straddle the energy industry, U.S. companies are making less effective products at higher prices to comply with demands while customers suffer, industry insiders argue.

On Monday, justices in the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in Plaquemines Parish v. Chevron. The legal battle centers around whether Chevron can move a case to federal court when federal government contracts are involved.

Plaquemines Parish, in Louisiana, originally sought damages from multiple oil and gas companies for allegedly engaging in oil and gas production on the coast without securing proper permits or violating preexisting permits.

Some of the violations date back to the World War II-era, when the federal government had production contracts with energy companies now owned by Chevron. The parish argues these contracts did not detail the methods by which companies were to obtain the oil and gas, leaving them liable for violating state permitting laws.

Louisiana’s coastal parishes have filed more than 40 similar lawsuits, claiming that oil and gas companies are responsible for coastal land loss in Louisiana. As the first case to reach a jury, Plaquemines Parish won a verdict of $744.6 million in damages against Chevron, which appealed.

Jason Isaac, founder of the American Energy Institute, told The Center Square a Supreme Court ruling in favor of Plaquemines Parish could be “devastating” for American energy companies.

“It’s essentially a tax on energy,” Isaac said. “This could be bad for consumers, it could be really bad for American energy independence and American energy dominance.”

He said the case is an attempt to pin the loss of coastal wetlands and certain weather events to a particular company over a period of several decades.

“They’re trying to make the claim that they can go back and look at every single bit of emissions and attribute certain weather events to that,” Isaac said.

A separate case, Suncor Energy v. Boulder County Commissioners, has also caught the attention of the nation’s highest court. The case focuses on whether state and local governments can file public nuisance lawsuits against oil and gas companies for global climate change effects.

“Public nuisance can’t be used for global problems. It can be used for local problems,” O.H. Skinner, executive director of Alliance for Consumers, told The Center Square.

The U.S. Supreme Court distributed the case for its Dec. 12 conference but did not decide whether to deny it or pick it up. The court relisted the case for its Jan. 9 conference and may decide whether to take it on Monday.

Isaac said the only reason the high court is still considering another energy case is because lower courts have yet to hear its merits.

“Courts recognize that cities can’t use local lawsuits to control global climate policy or rewrite federal energy law,” Isaac said. “Boulder’s longevity reflects delay and avoidance, not legal strength.”

While not all are being heard before the Supreme Court, similar litigation against energy companies is occurring throughout the country. Wrongful death lawsuits, state nuisance laws and near-total plastic bans are seeing fierce litigation.

Isaac said the cases stem from political desires to affect lasting change in the U.S. energy industry. He said Democrat-backed organizations will offer to cover attorneys and legal fees in law firms across the country to pursue litigation against large energy companies.

“They’re essentially a private firm becoming a de-facto government agency going after legitimate businesses here in the United States,” Isaac said. “The implications of these cases are to the tunes of billions of dollars.

Some companies and independent producers have experienced uncertainty due to fears associated with energy procurement lawsuits. Isaac said American Energy Institute’s member companies have settled certain lawsuits to avoid expensive court proceedings.

“That increases the cost that gets passed on to the consumer in the end,” Isaac said.

Increased consumer prices lead to less effective appliances in the home, Skinner told The Center Square. As executive director of the Alliance for Consumers, he said rules imposed on manufacturers to be climate friendly results in a less effective product.

“If you keep telling somebody that they have to use less water, less heat, less electricity, things take longer and they don’t do as well,” Skinner said.

As climate litigation is pursued across the country, Isaac and Skinner said they are concerned about increasing regulations that straddle companies from making the most efficient product.

“I don’t think people are recognizing that they’re truly getting hammered with their electric utility bills because these companies and states continue to mandate so-called green energy,” Isaac said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/0a/90ac18b2-9211-43f9-8ac8-2929d34c84e8/68dab8ca9ced3.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2026-01-10 18:12:57.940141

Many different creatures call the American prairie home, from the lovable, shaggy buffalo to the endangered rusty patched bumblebee.

Often overlooked, this prairie is actually one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, with numbers of species rivaling those of tropical rainforests. But it’s also one of the most threatened. Today, just one percent of eastern tallgrass prairie remains, and western shortgrass prairie is disappearing at a rate of more than a million acres a year.

Authors Josephine Marcotty and Dave Hage have teamed up to document the rapid destruction of these grasslands and the people working to save them. Their new book is “Sea of Grass: The Conquest, Ruin, and Redemption of Nature on the American Prairie.” This interview with Josephine Marcotty has been edited for length and clarity.

PALOMA BELTRAN: How did the idea for “Sea of Grass” first come about?

JOSEPHINE MARCOTTY: Like most people in this country, growing up, I really had little or no contact with the prairie because it was gone. I grew up in a suburb of Detroit, and the prairie was something I read about in books like Laura Ingalls Wilder, but not something that I had experienced. It was only when I started exploring the prairie that was left and understanding what we had lost that inspired me to write, not only about agriculture, but about what we were losing by expanding agriculture in the Midwest.

BELTRAN: Can you describe the American prairie for us? What does it feel like to visit such a place and what makes it special?

MARCOTTY: The tallgrass prairie, which is now almost completely gone, used to be an extraordinary place where grasses would be taller than a standing person, and in order to see over the top of them, you had to stand on top of a horse. It was a place where people could get lost—and often did in those tall grasses—or in the massive wetlands that used to occupy a third or 25 percent of the middle part of the country. It was an extraordinary place full of animals that we no longer have, wolves and bears and other carnivores, extraordinary birds.

The thing that I like about a prairie is the immense silence. All you hear is the sound of wind, and that enormous sense of space that you get, which is very similar to being out on a great lake or out on an ocean. Those are, of course, also lovely. But a grassland is just different.

BELTRAN: It sounds beautiful. Let’s talk about one of the main characters in your book, the buffalo. Tell us about how these large, lovable mammals fit into the narrative about grasslands and conservation.

Bison carry seed across thousands of miles when they eat the grass, and then they move the seed up to other parts of the grassland. That’s really important for evolution and mixing genetics amongst plants, so they create an environment that’s good for other species that use the same ecosystem.

BELTRAN: “Sea of Grass” centers on what you and Hage call the “paradox of the prairie.” Please explain this concept and why it’s especially relevant today.

MARCOTTY: The paradox of the prairie is partly rooted in the fear that early colonialists had when they first encountered it. It is a vast grassland, and that’s not something that most Europeans had experience with. They didn’t like that openness. They were fearful of the wetlands; they would easily get lost. The winters were terrifying because they were cold and windy, but it was, at the same time, a remarkably fertile place. At first, they thought nothing would grow there because there were no forests, and they thought, well, there must be just bad soil. But it turned out to be the most productive soil in the world, as we know now, based on our agricultural output from those former grasslands. So that’s one of the paradoxes.

BELTRAN: I think most of us don’t really equate prairies with biodiversity, but they are actually some of the richest ecosystems in the world. A recent study showed that the number of organisms present in grassland soil even rival the Amazon rainforest. What are some of the benefits of healthy prairies for humans and also for our planet?

MARCOTTY: There is a whole world and a whole ecosystem beneath your feet when you’re on a prairie, because the soil is so deep, and also because the roots of prairie plants are so long.

Kentucky bluegrass, which is the kind of grass we often grow in our yards, is only about six inches deep in the roots. But other plants, like the cup plant, those roots can extend down 15 feet into the soil, so they create a whole universe of organisms around them, and that’s an excellent way of sequestering and processing carbon, of sequestering and processing nitrogen, both of which are very important for world health in terms of air pollution and in terms of climate change.

The world’s grasslands contain more carbon than humans have released since the Industrial Revolution, more than the planet’s forests and atmosphere. At the current rate of plowing up Western grasslands, we’re plowing up about a million acres a year, and that’s the equivalent of adding 11.2 million cars to the road every year.

BELTRAN: How are we losing our grasslands in the United States at such an astonishing rate?

MARCOTTY: For many, many decades, intensive agriculture stopped at around the 98th parallel because it was too dry in the West to really grow crops properly. Instead, that’s why we have cattle there—it was good country for cattle and bison. But through genetic technology, we now are creating seeds, like for corn, that are much more capable of withstanding severe weather, that can thrive in dry conditions. The profits from that are much greater than from growing cattle. You can sell a piece of land that has been plowed for a much higher price than you can sell it if it hasn’t been plowed.

BELTRAN: So prairies are vanishing largely due to commercial agriculture replacing grasslands with monoculture crops. To what extent is industrial farming to blame for the disappearance of the prairies?

MARCOTTY: Yes, it’s mostly agriculture. If you look at a map, or if you fly over the country, what you will see is farmland below you when you fly over the Midwest. What’s driven the loss of grasslands really is agriculture, and much of that, in recent years, is driven by ethanol, which is a fuel derived from corn.

Ethanol was created in part to create a new market for corn, and the price of corn increased dramatically after those ethanol mandates were established by the federal government. That has driven a lot of the expansion of agriculture—just growing corn for our gas tanks.

BELTRAN: Of course, the assault on prairies couldn’t have been possible without the forced removal of Indigenous peoples from their native land. Describe for us how native farming practices differ from industrial farming and how Indigenous peoples know to protect the land they live on.

MARCOTTY: Native American people grew crops for their own consumption. They would grow a variety of food depending on where they were. They would have corn, they would have beans, they would have squash. They had much more diversity within their farming system, and so they could grow their food on a plot of land, and when the soil played out, they could move on to another place and grow food in another spot and let that area recover and become more fertile.

When European colonialists came in, they began to grow food for markets. So they grew far more food than they needed for themselves, and then they would sell the extra. Indians didn’t function like that. They didn’t have a capitalist system. They were people who grew their food for themselves and for their community, and they just grew what they needed for a season or for a year.

Bison were the primary source of food for Western Native Americans for many, many, many years, and they still are. In the last several decades, there has been a push to bring the bison from Yellowstone National Park and return them to the Native Americans and the tribal lands that used to rely on them, and this has been a great story of revival, not only for bison, but also for those native tribes to be able to have food sovereignty and their own source of food, and also to develop businesses around that source of food that they can generate income for their communities.

BELTRAN: Your book details the struggle between the farming industry and land conservation in the American West, but it sounds like restoring prairies is actually beneficial to farmers and to people everywhere. Could you describe that contradiction?

MARCOTTY: One of the contradictions is that we have many different viewpoints and opinions on what land is for. Farmers, the agricultural industry and farming communities often believe that land is best used to produce food and to produce crops, and that that is the economic engine of those small, rural communities. That’s been true for hundreds of years. That is the basis of what drove much of colonialism across the country.

But at the same time, one of the chapters we have in our book is about a prairie restoration in Northwest Minnesota called Glacial Ridge. It is the largest prairie restoration in the country; it’s like 24,000 acres. And The Nature Conservancy and the other organizations that helped restore that prairie, one of the reasons they were able to do that was because the tiny, little city of Crookston, which is primarily an agricultural economic city, needed a place to get clean drinking water, and they were able to put the city’s drinking wells in this restored prairie and know that they would never be contaminated with fertilizer or with other farm contaminants. Just clean drinking water alone is one real benefit.

The other, of course, is pollinators. The prairie is a place where you find more pollinators than almost anywhere else in the country, and we need those pollinators to pollinate the crops that we eat for food. There are estimates that pollinators have declined by up to 25 percent in some parts of the country, and we’re losing bumblebees at a high rate. The rusty patched bumblebee is on the endangered species list because it’s disappeared in much of the prairie states. Those are just two of the ecosystem services that prairies can provide.

BELTRAN: You talk to multiple farmers and people within the agricultural industry for your book. What’s their sentiment around the loss of the prairie and the loss of our grasslands?

MARCOTTY: I think many of them grieve it. Many people who live on the grasslands today love it the same way we all love the place where we grow up and appreciate its beauty, its wildlife and what it means to them culturally.

But it’s very difficult to compete with corn. If you are a rancher that owns land, and you want to retire, and all of your pension, all of your savings, are essentially the land that you own, and the only way that you can sell it is to sell it to someone who wants to raise corn and soybeans on it, you’re in kind of a bad spot. You don’t have a lot of options in terms of finding another rancher who wants to raise cattle on it. It’s going to be much easier in many places to sell it to someone who wants to raise corn.

Farmers are caught in a system, just like the rest of us. We are all part of a food system that we created and that we rely on. They don’t have a lot of room to experiment with different kinds of growing systems or different kinds of crops, and they often feel like they can’t really afford to let grasslands be and to maintain grasslands. For them, land has to produce. They need to make money on it.

BELTRAN: The farming industry relies heavily on support from the federal government, including from important legislation like the Farm Bill, which provides aid for farmers through programs like crop insurance and funding for research and development. How can the Farm Bill aid in preventing the loss and collapse of the American prairie while continuing to support farmers?

MARCOTTY: One of the things that would help a lot would be parity. The Farm Bill is designed to help certain kinds of farmers—the people who grow corn and soybeans and other commodities like cotton. It is not designed to help people who grow cattle. Grasslands need grazers. Ungulates have been a part of the grassland system for millions of years, and humans need ungulates, or animals on the land, because that is the way that we turn sunshine into protein, is those animals who graze on the grasslands.

It’s enormously important for our diets and for our food system, but the protections that ranchers get, or anybody who raises animals on the land, is not equal to what you get if you are raising corn or soybeans. If Congress was able to provide parity so that all farmers and all producers, whether you’re a rancher or even a fisherman, if you also had the same kind of protections from risk that farmers have, that would give landowners much greater diversity in what they can grow on the land.

BELTRAN: What are some of the restoration efforts currently taking place across the country?

MARCOTTY: There’s a bill that’s been introduced called the Grassland Act, and it would help protect existing prairies by providing support for ranchers and by installing protections elsewhere in the law. So that is one thing we could do—pass some policy that is designed to protect grasslands.

Minnesota is one of the only states that has a statewide plan to protect prairies, and they’re doing a lot to buy up marginal cropland and converting it back to prairies, and helping landowners who have prairies protect them and understand what they have and how to manage them. It is really important for the nation and for the federal government to recognize that they are something of immense value that needs to be protected.

There are many ecosystems that are under threat. The prairie is just one of them that we thought the risks to were not recognized and needed to be recognized. But all of the outdoors is under threat, either from agriculture or development or from pollution, and the way to really protect all of them is for people to get outside and understand what they have and what they can do to stop whatever destruction is going on.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1143011799-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:58:23.981714

Congress came back to Washington this week with significant unfinished business, particularly on government funding. Coming off the largest government shutdown in history late last year, it needs to pass the remaining nine of 12 government funding bills for fiscal year 2026 by January 30 in order to avert yet another shutdown. Congress passed the first three bills (Legislative Branch, Military Construction-Veterans Affairs and Agriculture) in November as part of a compromise to end the shutdown. The House this week passed a package of three more spending bills (Energy-Water, Interior-Environment, and Commerce-Justice-Science). The Senate will vote on that package as soon as next week. Passage of these three bills provides some momentum for lawmakers to finish their work. However, the remaining six bills, which include Defense, Labor-Health-Education and Homeland Security, are the most contentious. They also are important since they make up nearly 70% of all federal discretionary spending. Congress has only three weeks to reconcile key differences and pass the remaining bills. Congress may need to extend current funding for the remaining government agencies through another continuing resolution (that could be a short-term extension to buy some more time or an extension through the end of the fiscal year).

Health Care.

While back at home, many lawmakers heard from constituents about expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. Last month, House Democrats received support from four Republicans to force a vote on renewing the (now expired) ACA subsidies for three years. The House passed that bill in a 230-196 vote, with 17 Republicans joining Democrats. However, the bill’s prospects are not good in the Senate, which voted down similar measures last month. With Republican leadership showing little interest in having another vote on a simple extension, a bipartisan group of senators have been working on finding an alternative. That could combine a short-term extension with income caps and a minimum premium requirement. There are major obstacles. One is timing given that open enrollment for ACA plans ends January 15. Also complicating matters is Republicans’ desire to expand the Hyde amendment, which prohibits the use of federal dollars from being used for abortion. In a meeting with Republicans this week, President Trump urged Republicans to be flexible on the issue, though many Republicans disagree. Meanwhile, Democrats are staunchly opposed to any Hyde amendment expansion. While bipartisan discussions continue, there seems like little chance of a breakthrough.

Foreign Policy.

The Trump administration last year had a more assertive and active agenda on foreign policy than many expected. There was a wide breadth of activity, but key areas of focus included trade, relations with China, diplomacy in the Middle East and efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine. Late last year, the Trump administration issued a national security report that called for the US to pursue national interests (particularly military and economic strength) while mostly avoiding foreign military entanglements. The report breaks from a longstanding US worldview that positioned the US as an indispensable leader in promoting an international order built around security and economic ties with allies (particularly other democracies), multilateral institutions and international rules. Seeing a global order where regional powers (including the US) can and will exercise power in their respective spheres of influence, the Trump administration this past week has put its national security strategy into practice and set the tone for another active year with its military action in Venezuela, renewed calls for acquiring Greenland, and withdrawal of the US from dozens of international organizations.

Venezuela. The Trump administration’s actions to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro quickly became a key preoccupation of Congress. Reactions have fallen mainly along party lines, with most Republicans publicly supporting the President and virtually all Democrats decrying the actions. In addition to concerns about the legality of these actions, there are questions about the US’s ongoing role in the country and in its oil sector (Venezuela has a degraded oil infrastructure that will require significant investment, but it also has the world’s largest oil reserves). Following the military operation in Venezuela, the Trump administration has thrown out threats for future military action elsewhere in the world and has amped up talk of acquiring Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. While Republicans have largely brushed this off, there are some simmering concerns. Reflecting that, five Republicans joined all Senate Democrats in a procedural vote to advance a war powers resolution that would prohibit any new military action in Venezuela without congressional authority. While the resolution is largely symbolic and likely won’t pass the House, the vote shows some Republican concerns. Further war powers resolutions (Greenland, Cuba, and others) could follow. Beyond the immediate questions about Venezuela and any further US actions in the western hemisphere, a big geopolitical question on the horizon concerns the degree to which other regional powers, including traditional US adversaries, will see the US’s actions and its overall national security doctrine as a green light to assert their interests and prerogatives in their spheres of influence.

China. US-China relations last year had a roller-coaster ride, with tensions ebbing and flowing and with cumulative tariffs on goods from China briefly reaching over 160%. They ended on a stable note as the Trump administration worked with urgency last fall to deescalate another brewing trade fight. Those efforts yielded a détente (nominally a one-year reprieve) between the two countries. This year will be punctuated by planned visits between President Trump and President Xi (a visit to China in April and potentially a state visit in the US later in the year). Given China’s dominance in the mining and processing of rare earth metals that are critical for many key technologies, the US will look to maintain the current truce, though there is plenty of risk of bumps in the road.

Ukraine. A peace deal to end the war in Ukraine continues to be elusive and a key objective of the Trump administration. President Trump has pushed Ukraine to make territorial and other concessions in the interest of having de-escalation with Russia. However, it has been Russia that has shown little interest in ending the war. While there is a possibility of a breakthrough, the base case remains of quagmire on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.

Trade Decisions.

There will be many key milestones on trade this year. The biggest is the Supreme Court’s decision on the Trump administration’s use of emergency powers to apply broad-based “reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners. The court returns next week and is expected to make its decision on an expedited basis. An adverse decision would be a big blow for the Trump administration’s trade agenda. If that were to happen, the Trump administration likely would reimpose tariffs through other authorities. Using other broad-based authorities would allow them to keep many of the tariffs in place, but that would be subject to similar legal challenges and vulnerabilities. Alternatively, it could rely more on sectoral and other tariffs that rest on a stronger legal foundation, though the composition of that tariff regime (and the industries and trading partners it would impact) would be different and take time to implement. The administration’s efforts on sectoral tariffs are ongoing no matter what the court decision is. It has investigations on establishing new tariffs in the coming months in areas such as semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals and civilian aircraft. The US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement is up for review and renewal (by July 2026), and President Trump may use this deadline as a means to extract concessions by renewing tariff and other threats on these neighbors and trading partners. The upcoming Supreme Court decision will be the starting point rather than the end point for another active year on trade developments.

Reconciliation 2.0?

As mentioned, Republicans’ main legislative achievement last year was the One Big Beautiful Bill. They advanced the bill through the process of reconciliation. The process allows changes to federal tax and spending policies to be considered on a more streamlined basis. The key advantage is only a majority is needed in the Senate instead of the 60-vote threshold applicable to most legislation. Some Republicans are interested in doing another reconciliation bill this year. A Republican plan on healthcare could be an anchor for such a bill, which also could include additional tax measures. President Trump has promoted the idea of using tariff revenue for some sort of stimulus check to Americans and that could be a candidate for inclusion in a reconciliation bill. However, beyond the legal questions regarding many of the tariffs, there are questions about the design of any such plan and concerns about its cost. We are skeptical of any Reconciliation 2.0 effort moving forward, but we will be paying close attention to developments given that it can’t be entirely ruled out.

Crypto Bill.

Digital assets policy will continue to be a major focus for Congress and the administration. Last year, Congress passed bipartisan legislation (called the GENIUS Act) that established a new regulatory framework for stablecoins (digital assets issued by private entities but backed by other assets including fiat currencies like the dollar). The House also passed a crypto market structure bill that would set rules for the trading of digital assets and delineate regulatory authority between the SEC (securities) and the CFTC (commodities). However, despite active bipartisan discussions over months, progress has been slower in the Senate. Market structure legislation is a more complex and contentious undertaking than the stablecoin bill. Differences remain on key issues, including rules around conflicts of interest, decentralized trading, and payment of interest on stablecoins. Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) plans to move ahead with a mark-up next week, but that may only produce a party-line vote given the lingering differences on key issues. With many unresolved issues and a ticking political clock before the midterm elections, efforts to pass a crypto market structure bill continue to face stiff headwinds.

Fed Drama Continues.

Last year, President Trump frequently criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Powell’s conduct of monetary policy and the cost of a renovation of the Fed’s facilities. Despite frequent threats, he has refrained from attempting to fire Powell (there also are legal protections in place that would prevent Powell from being fired without cause). President Trump did take an unprecedented step last year in trying to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook (on the grounds of alleged mortgage fraud). The attempted firing has been subject to litigation, with the Supreme Court scheduled to hear oral arguments on the case on January 21. In September, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran (former head of the Council of Economic Advisors) to fill a temporary vacancy. The big upcoming development will be Trump’s announcement of his choice to place Powell. That person will need Senate approval and won’t take over until the end of Powell’s term in May, but an announcement is expected in the coming weeks. With ongoing concerns about the impact of attacks on the Fed’s independence, this will be a closely watched transition process.

Other Policy Issues.

President Trump will deliver a State of the Union address on February 24, where he will make his pitch on the administration’s policies ahead of the midterm elections. Congress faces an April 20 deadline to renew the contentious Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Artificial intelligence (AI) will remain a key interest in Washington but will be more the province of executive and regulatory action than legislative. The Trump administration issued a comprehensive action plan on AI last year and a recent order aimed at thwarting state-level regulation of AI. There are bipartisan efforts on different piecemeal measures to try to address the affordability of housing measures in both the Senate and House, but it remains to be seen whether there is sufficient time and inclination to work out differences between the different approaches. Trump recently weighed in with support for a ban on large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, but many Republicans are opposed. There also are a number of end of fiscal year deadlines that Congress will need to tackle. Lawmakers will try to garner momentum to reauthorize US farm and food aid programs, but they may need to punt again with an extension before current policies expire on September 30. Congress also will need to pass a five-year reauthorization of highway and infrastructure legislation by September 30. Lawmakers are looking to revive bipartisan negotiations around permitting reform for energy and infrastructure projects. The House has passed permitting bills, but discussions are stalled in Senate. The aforementioned transportation bill could be a vehicle for any permitting reform package. Congress also must reauthorize the Export-Import Bank by September 30. The Senate will continue to pass Trump’s nominees throughout the year. There will be many issues on Congress’s radar screen, but most have little pathway for legislative success this year.

Midterms Loom.

If past is precedent, Congress’s focus will shift almost entirely to campaigning by the spring. While the landscape still could shift, both parties already have signaled what their lanes will be in the months ahead. Democrats continue to lean heavily into affordability, arguing that President Trump won on promises to reduce costs but has instead amplified the problem while turning his attention abroad. Republicans, for their part, will try to localize contests and try to distance themselves from Trump’s low approval ratings as they confront tough historical headwinds. With congressional control up for grabs and 2028 hopefuls already maneuvering behind the scenes, the political climate only will intensify from here.

House. Republicans entered the cycle with a narrow 220–215 majority. In a typical midterm, the party out of power gains seats. This has been true in 18 of the last 20 cycles, with an average pickup of 26 seats. Particularly with positive results in certain elections held last year, Democrats at first blush are in a good position to retake the House. However, mid‑decade redistricting across nearly a dozen states has significantly reduced the number of true toss‑up districts (now roughly 25). As a result, Democrats would need to win close to 85% of the most competitive seats to reclaim the majority. In today’s polarized climate, national swings tend to move districts uniformly. This isn’t impossible, but it is far from guaranteed. The House remains the likeliest chamber to flip, but the path is narrower and more complicated than historical trends would suggest.

Senate. Republicans hold a 53–47 majority, and the map tilts in their favor. Because Vice President Vance will continue to cast the tiebreaking vote next Congress, Democrats need a net gain of four seats to retake control. Their route begins with holding difficult seats in Georgia, Michigan, and New Hampshire while flipping Republican seats in Maine and North Carolina. Even if they run the table in all of these, they still need to flip two more seats. Their next opportunities in Alaska, Iowa, Ohio, and Florida have grown increasingly challenging. Their last target, Texas, remains the Democrats’ perennial white whale. Democrats point to strong 2025 showings and improved candidate quality as signs of momentum, but Republicans remain confident the structure of the map works in their favor. The Senate majority is not out of reach for Democrats, but it would require a near‑perfect night.

Governors. 36 states will elect governors this fall, with several competitive contests emerging, especially where incumbents are not seeking reelection. Democrats are defending closely watched races in Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, and Wisconsin, with only Arizona featuring a sitting Democratic governor. Republicans have competitive defenses in Georgia, Nevada, and Iowa, with Georgia and Iowa lacking an incumbent. The stakes extend beyond state policy since governors can shape federal delegation dynamics, influence redistricting processes, and provide political coattails. There could be significant downstream effects in states such as Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, and Kansas where Republican legislatures could be checked by Democratic governors and in states like Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin where Democratic legislatures could be checked by Republican governors. These races may draw less national attention than congressional contests, but their impact will be significant.",https://www.ubs.com/us/en/wealth-management/washington-weekly/2026/washington-weekly-9-january/_jcr_content/root/pagehead/opengraphimage.coreimg.jpg/757145923/washington-weekly-d.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:58:29.042581

Headquartered internationally in Vancouver, Canada, with existing U.S. operations in Southern California and West Virginia, GreenPower said the decision was driven by New Mexico’s growing electric vehicle ecosystem, the Santa Teresa Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ), and a competitive package of state and local incentives.

The planned 135,000-square-foot facility will serve as GreenPower’s base for North American manufacturing and its U.S. corporate headquarters. The project is expected to generate more than $200 million in economic impact over the next decade and create over 340 jobs.

“GreenPower’s decision to locate in Santa Teresa represents a meaningful investment in our local workforce and economy,” said Davin Lopez, President and CEO of the Mesilla Valley Economic Development Alliance. “This project brings high-quality manufacturing jobs and reinforces the NMBorderplex’s role as a destination for sustainable, long-term growth.”

State and local support played a key role in securing the project. New Mexico leveraged several economic development programs—including the Local Economic Development Act (LEDA), the Job Training Incentive Program (JTIP), Rural Jobs Tax Credits, and the High-Wage Jobs Tax Credit—to support GreenPower’s expansion and workforce development plans.

In a statement released previously by Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office, GreenPower CEO Fraser Atkinson highlighted the company’s commitment to partnering with local communities, government leaders, and financial stakeholders. He noted that New Mexico’s expanding electrification and clean-energy ecosystem provides a strong foundation for sustainable manufacturing growth.

The Santa Teresa Foreign Trade Zone was another key factor, offering streamlined customs processes, supply-chain flexibility, and cost efficiencies—advantages that are increasingly important for manufacturers navigating global trade volatility.

“The Doña Ana County Foreign Trade Zone continues to be a powerful tool in attracting advanced manufacturing investment,” said Jerry Pacheco, Senior Business Recruiter with the New Mexico Partnership. “The FTZ enhances supply-chain efficiency and strengthens New Mexico’s competitive position.”

GreenPower’s move aligns with the state’s broader clean-energy goals. In 2025, the company partnered with the New Mexico Economic Development Department to launch the state’s first all-electric, zero-emission school bus pilot program, supporting the Energy Transition Act and New Mexico’s target of achieving 100% zero-carbon electricity by 2045.

“We are proud to welcome GreenPower to Doña Ana County,” said County Manager Scott Andrews. “This announcement reflects strong collaboration across state, regional, and local partners and reinforces our region’s leadership in clean transportation and advanced manufacturing.”

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to extend the ​life of aging coal-fired power plants to continue to provide baseload power to meet the growing demand ‍for electricity from the buildout ​of data centers to power artificial intelligence.

KEY ​QUOTE

“Reliable baseload energy sources are essential to Powering the Great American Comeback and ‍ensuring families have cost-effective energy,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

CONTEXT

The administration last year issued five emergency orders to keep retiring coal plants running, most recently on December 30 when Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an order ‍to keep a coal plant in Craig, Colorado, operating even though it was set to retire at the end of ‍2025.

BACKGROUND

Colorado had ‍ordered three older coal plants that ​were set to retire in 2030 to ​shut ⁠down two years earlier to comply with ‌its regional haze plan. The EPA said it would help Colorado rewrite its plan, or else impose one on the state.

[Editorial note: update on Dec. 5, 2019: now Connecticut has announced that the 804 MW Park City offshore wind project will be “offered at a price lower than any other publicly announced offshore wind project in North America.”]

While Europe has a 28-year history of offshore wind, with about 18,000 MW of offshore wind power in operation, there is just one offshore wind farm in operation in the U.S, rated at 30 MW. Therefore, until the last couple years, estimating the price for major offshore wind projects in the United States was fairly speculative.

As some of the first commercial-scale offshore wind projects in the U.S. with purchase contracts signed, the New York and Massachusetts contracts provide some of the first data points of how much offshore wind power actually costs in the U.S. and they send a promising signal. While the New York price point of $83 per megawatt-hour (MWh) is much higher than the prices that utilities typically pay for wholesale power in the Southeast, it is a level that is far below what people expected offshore wind in the United States to cost even just a couple years ago.

The news is encouraging because it helps to show a trend of unexpectedly low-price offshore wind power contracts. Last year, the Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts stunned people with a price of $98 per MWh (estimated) for 800 MW, which was then lowered even further through tax credits and other revenue. Then, the Revolution Wind project signed contracts with Connecticut and Rhode Island for $94 (to Connecticut) and $98.43 (to Rhode Island) per MWh for a combined 600 MW. And now, New York’s contracts come in at $83 per MWh for about 1,700 MW and while the exact pricing of Massachusetts’ new 800 MW contract is not yet publicly known, it is required by law to be lower than last year’s Vineyard Wind contract. [Editorial note: update on Dec. 5, 2019: and the new Park City wind project off Connecticut’s coast will be the least expensive of them all]

The recent wave of advancements toward offshore wind development appear to blunt the long held suspicion that the cost of offshore wind power development in the nascent United States market would be significantly higher than what it costs across the Atlantic in the more mature European market. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s analysis of the Vineyard Wind contract found its price consistent with European pricing, and we now know that Vineyard Wind’s pricing was not an outlier but rather the beginning of a trend.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-11 00:13:01.131176

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

DTE Energy Co. is not the kind of name that usually trends on social media. It is a century-old, Detroit-based utility whose core business is deceptively simple: keep the lights on and homes heated. But beneath that familiar surface, DTE Energy Co. is in the middle of one of the most consequential product overhauls in its history, transforming from a regulated power provider into a tech-enabled, decarbonizing energy platform.

That shift is not optional. Extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and rising expectations around clean energy and reliability are forcing utilities across the U.S. to rethink how they generate, transmit, and manage power. For DTE Energy Co., that means turning its service territory into a live testbed for large-scale renewable deployment, grid automation, and customer-facing digital tools that promise more transparency and control over energy use.

This is the real product story behind DTE Energy Co.: not a single device or app, but an integrated energy system that has to work 24/7, withstand climate shocks, satisfy regulators, and increasingly, hit ambitious climate targets—all while remaining affordable. In utility land, that combination is the equivalent of shipping a flagship smartphone every day that never crashes and can’t go offline.

Get all details on DTE Energy Co. here

Inside the Flagship: DTE Energy Co.

When analysts and regulators talk about DTE Energy Co. today, they are really talking about a bundle of interlocking products: a generation portfolio that is shifting from coal to gas and renewables, a high-voltage and distribution grid undergoing accelerated modernization, and a growing layer of digital services riding on top.

On the generation side, DTE Energy Co. is in the late stages of a structural pivot away from coal and toward a mix of natural gas, wind, solar, and energy efficiency programs. The company has committed billions of dollars in capital expenditure to building utility-scale wind and solar farms in Michigan, backed by long-term planning commitments to retire coal units and hit emissions reduction targets. Within its service territory, DTE’s renewables are no longer a side-show—they are becoming a core ""product line"" that shapes capacity planning, rate cases, and customer programs.

But the real technological story is in how DTE Energy Co. is stitching those generation assets to the customer’s meter. The company is deploying advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to give near-real-time visibility into energy usage. Those meters feed data into grid management platforms that can help pinpoint outages faster, reroute power, and eventually support more sophisticated demand-response programs. In practical terms, that means fewer blind spots when storms hit and more optionality for customers who want to shift usage or participate in peak reduction programs.

On the customer side, DTE Energy Co. has been rolling out online account management, usage dashboards, and mobile-accessible tools that allow residential and business users to track consumption, enroll in renewable or green tariff programs, and access energy efficiency rebates. Compared to the polished UX of a consumer tech giant, these interfaces still feel more functional than delightful, but the direction is clear: DTE Energy Co. is treating customer data and interaction as a product surface, not just a billing endpoint.

The utility is also expanding behind-the-meter offerings, such as energy efficiency programs and optional green power subscriptions for corporate clients who need to hit ESG targets. These offerings may not get the same buzz as rooftop solar installers or EV charging networks, but for Fortune 500 customers trying to decarbonize their footprints, utility-backed renewable programs can be the difference between a marketing slide and a verifiable carbon reduction strategy.

Underpinning all of this is a massive, multi-year grid modernization program. DTE Energy Co. is investing in substation upgrades, new circuits, undergrounding in targeted areas, automation devices, and enhanced vegetation management. Think of it as a forced migration from a largely analog, reactive grid to a more digital, sensor-heavy network that can be monitored, modeled, and managed in something close to real time. It is not as glamorous as a new gadget launch, but for customers, it directly translates into fewer outages and faster restoration.

Market Rivals: DTE Energy Co. Aktie vs. The Competition

In the world of regulated utilities, DTE Energy Co. does not have direct consumer-facing rivals in the way a phone or EV maker does. Its customers in Michigan cannot simply switch to another grid provider. But in capital markets and in the broader policy and technology arena, DTE Energy Co. competes every day with other large integrated utilities that are pitching a similar story of decarbonization and modernization.

Compared directly to NextEra Energy Inc.—often treated as the benchmark ""growth utility"" in North America—DTE Energy Co. is positioned more as a balanced, regionally focused operator. NextEra’s flagship product is its huge portfolio of wind and solar projects across multiple states, combined with a Florida-based regulated utility that has become a case study in hurricane hardening and solar deployment. Where NextEra Energy leans heavily into being a renewables developer at national scale, DTE Energy Co. is focused on retooling a single-region system with a mix of gas, renewables, and grid investments. That makes DTE’s story less explosive in growth terms but arguably more about execution under tight regulatory scrutiny.

Against Duke Energy Corp., another heavyweight in the U.S. power sector, DTE Energy Co. looks more nimble in certain ways. Duke spans multiple states across the Southeast and Midwest, and its capital plan includes nuclear, gas, and a rising share of renewables. However, that scale also drags in a complex web of state regulatory environments and political dynamics. DTE Energy Co., by being more geographically concentrated, has the advantage of aligning its grid and generation strategy with a single primary state regulatory framework and a focused decarbonization roadmap. For investors comparing DTE Energy Co. Aktie with a name like Duke, the trade-off is between national diversification and the ability to execute a coherent, region-specific transition.

There is also an emerging competitive comparison with utilities like Xcel Energy Inc., which have moved aggressively on clean energy commitments and have built strong brands around being early decarbonization leaders. Xcel’s flagship narrative centers on being among the first major U.S. utilities to set 100% clean or net-zero targets and integrate large-scale wind in the Midwest. DTE Energy Co. has moved slower historically, but in recent years it has stepped up its climate commitments and accelerated coal retirements, working to close that perception gap.

On the technology front, many of these competitors are leaning into similar themes: advanced metering, grid automation, EV charging support, and customer-facing digital tools. Where DTE Energy Co. is trying to differentiate is in how it packages these investments into a coherent reliability-and-resilience story for a state that has endured high-profile outage events. If NextEra is selling a pure-play renewables and growth story, and Duke is selling scale and stability, DTE Energy Co. is positioning its ""product"" as a real-world demonstration of how to harden a legacy Midwest grid while decarbonizing it.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

DTE Energy Co. will not win by being the flashiest name in clean energy. It wins, if it wins, by threading together innovation, regulatory alignment, and reliability in a way that feels tangible to both regulators and customers.

First, there is the integrated approach to modernization. DTE Energy Co. is not treating renewables as a bolt-on marketing line. Its capital plan ties wind and solar additions directly to coal retirements, grid investments, and customer programs. That integration matters: it reduces the risk that new renewable capacity becomes stranded or congested and makes it easier to argue for cost recovery in rate cases. Where some peers tout headline megawatt numbers, DTE Energy Co. is emphasizing system-level reliability and emissions benefits, which resonate with regulators and large industrial customers.

Second, the company’s focus on grid resilience in a storm-prone, aging infrastructure environment gives it a very clear problem to solve. Michigan customers remember multi-day outages and tree-downed lines; that lived experience sharpens the value proposition for grid automation, undergrounding, and aggressive vegetation management. The ""product"" is not an abstract promise of a clean future grid; it is a concrete reduction in outage frequency and duration, backed by specific investments and timelines.

Third, DTE Energy Co. is building out a customer-facing ecosystem that, while still maturing, turns energy usage data into a service platform. AMI-enabled insights, time-based rates, energy efficiency rebates, and optional renewable programs create an expanding menu of ways for customers to interact with their energy consumption. For corporate buyers under pressure to hit ESG goals, DTE’s ability to structure renewable contracts and green tariffs offers an increasingly important differentiator, effectively making the utility an embedded partner in their sustainability strategies.

Finally, DTE Energy Co. benefits from being a regulated utility with a relatively predictable cash flow profile, which underwrites its energy transition investments. Where pure-play renewable developers may ride boom-and-bust cycles tied to tax credits and merchant power prices, DTE’s regulated structure allows it to plan capital investments over long horizons with clearer cost recovery mechanisms. For the underlying product—the physical and digital grid—that stability is a feature, not a bug.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

DTE Energy Co. Aktie (ISIN US2333311072) trades in a market that increasingly prices utilities not just on current earnings and dividends, but on the credibility of their transition plans. As of the latest available trading session data accessed via multiple financial sources, DTE Energy Co.’s share price reflects the profile of a regulated utility in the midst of a multi-year capital deployment cycle: investors are effectively buying into a bond-like dividend stream plus a long-duration grid and renewables build-out.

Because the company’s ""product"" is long-lived infrastructure, markets react most strongly not to single technology announcements, but to updates on capital plans, regulatory settlements, and execution against reliability and decarbonization targets. When DTE Energy Co. secures approval for major grid modernization initiatives or accelerates the retirement schedule of coal plants in favor of renewables and gas, it is effectively shipping a new version of its core product. Those milestones tend to support the valuation narrative by signaling lower long-term carbon risk, higher potential rate base growth, and a pathway to more stable earnings.

Conversely, high-profile outage events or regulatory pushback on rate increases can pressure the stock, as they raise questions about the balance between investment, affordability, and execution capability. In that sense, the success of DTE Energy Co.’s modernization and decarbonization agenda is not just a climate or technology story—it is a valuation story. The better the company can demonstrate that its grid upgrades, renewables expansion, and customer-facing digital services translate into measurable reliability improvements and manageable rate impacts, the stronger the case for DTE Energy Co. Aktie as a steady, long-term compounder.

For investors, DTE Energy Co. represents a specific bet: that a Midwestern utility can transform its legacy coal-heavy system into a more digital, cleaner, and more resilient platform without triggering a regulatory or customer backlash. For customers, the bet is simpler: that the lights stay on more often, outages get shorter, and the energy they use gets cleaner over time. If DTE Energy Co. can continue to deliver on both fronts, its product—the modernized grid and the services layered on top—will become one of the more important, if least flashy, technology platforms in the region.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404994_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 11:13:23.267441

Toyota Motor Corp. confirmed it will plow as much as $10 billion into the US over the next five years to boost its local operations, less than a month after President Donald Trump flagged that the Japanese carmaker planned such an investment.

The announcement clears up a confusing moment from Trump’s visit to Tokyo in October, when he said Toyota would build plants all over the US “to the tune of over $10 billion.” At the time, the automaker wouldn’t confirm such a plan, calling it mere speculation.

The automaker provided no further details on how it will spend the funds. David Christ, Toyota’s US sales chief, said that will be revealed at a later date.

“We’ll announce the investment plans for the $10 billion as we get closer to making the investments,” Christ told reporters Wednesday at a ceremony for a new battery plant in North Carolina.

The investment announcement comes as the Trump administration pressures the global auto industry to shift more production to the US and imposed punitive tariffs on many car parts and vehicles sourced from abroad.

Toyota’s top executive in the US, Ted Ogawa, said the battery plant and new investment “marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history.”

The president called out Toyota by name earlier last year for importing too many vehicles from Japan to the US, and also singled it out during this first administration for building up manufacturing operations in Mexico.

In an attempt to blunt that earlier criticism, Toyota promised in 2017 to invest $13 billion in US manufacturing. The company said earlier this year that it had spent those funds and that its total investment in the US currently exceeds $50 billion — spread over nearly seven decades.

The Japanese company imported about half of the vehicles it sold in the US in 2024, mostly from Canada and Mexico but also including some 281,000 vehicles made in Japan.

The latest investment commitment was timed to coincide with the official opening of Toyota’s newest plant, a lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility located near Greensboro, North Carolina.

Construction of the factory in the rural town of Liberty cost $13.9 billion and production is expected to slowly ramp up over the next decade. Toyota said it will create 5,100 new jobs and supply both hybrid gas-electric and all-electric models.

Swift About-Face

When Toyota first announced the US battery plant project in 2021, it envisioned a steady rise in Americans’ demand for EVs due in part to then-President Joe Biden’s efforts to speed adoption of zero-emission vehicles with favorable policies.

Trump’s return to the White House has led to a swift about-face in federal emissions regulations, including the abandonment of incentives for EV buyers such as a $7,500 tax credit.

Toyota has four lines currently producing batteries for hybrids, which at full capacity can supply up to 600,000 gas-electric vehicles. Those will be installed in models such as the Camry mid-size sedan and hybrid versions of the Corolla Cross crossover and best-selling RAV4 compact SUV.

Three more lines will be added next year, one dedicated to batteries for 45,000 all-electric vehicles a year and two that can make batteries for an additional 74,000 fully electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, Anne Souder, a plant general manager, told reporters at a briefing.

The carmaker aims for a total of 14 lines to be operational by 2034, but its decision to scale back ambitious plans to sell as many as seven EV models in the US has injected uncertainty into Toyota’s plans for production of all-electric vehicle batteries.

“With the regulation changes, it’s changed a little bit,” Don Stewart, president of the battery plant, told reporters.

Demand for EVs has is expected to soften, and BloombergNEF now forecasts a major surplus in US battery cell manufacturing capacity by 2030. That’s largely due to a 14 million-unit downward revision in projected US sales of EVs by then.

The carmaker delivered fewer than 30,000 all-electric in the US in 2024, even as its sales of hybrid gas-electrics have skyrocketed.

But in late 2025, the point person for the wind project was laid off, he said, something that’s been happening across the offshore wind industry.
Alvernaz, who has worked for Vineyard Wind for at least two years, recently secured another contract with a subcontractor on Orsted’s Sunrise Wind project.
“For a decade, our favorite expression in offshore wind was building a plane while we’re flying it.
“Figure out how to get the right policies, procedures and regulations in place that enable offshore wind to be able to flourish in the next political cycle.” In the real, not metaphorical sense, the giant vessels associated with offshore wind won’t be sidelined.","This story first appeared in The New Bedford Light. Read the original version here.

When the first turbine pieces for Vineyard Wind inched into port in 2023, cranes and union labor stood at the quayside of a nearby terminal, ready and waiting to get to work. In the more than two years since, the project has kept the state-owned New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal busy and funded through a multimillion dollar lease.

But the 26-acre site wasn’t always bustling.

Eight years before Vineyard Wind entered the scene, the state finished construction on the $113 million terminal, purpose-built to support offshore wind, a buzzy industry that hadn’t yet landed. The site expected to welcome Cape Wind as the first tenant around 2015, but the Nantucket Sound project fell through after opposition. The taxpayer-funded site remained underutilized for years, and was left to find new, and smaller, revenue streams.

Amid the Trump administration’s offshore wind crackdown, it will soon find itself in a similar predicament. As the final Vineyard Wind blades trickle out, two questions emerge: What now for the offshore wind terminal, and what now for New Bedford — a city that courted millions in investment and built out its port to support an industry that’s facing an existential threat?

In a best-case scenario, experts predict construction in Massachusetts will stall for the remaining years of the Trump administration. But the worst-case scenario: the uncertainty imposed by the Trump administration in these last 12 months may be too challenging for a future pro-wind administration to overcome, freezing development longer-term.

For those on the New Bedford waterfront, their concerns are tempered with optimism. It’s a long game, and they’ve begun laying the groundwork to pivot their businesses for a few years until the next wave comes.

Still, “if the president that follows [Trump] is as hostile as he is, then we may be looking at a much longer term problem,” said New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell.

What’s next at the Marine Commerce Terminal and Foss Terminal?

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, a quasi-state agency that owns and operates the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, is currently undertaking a $45-million expansion of the site to support the larger and heavier “next generation” turbine components. It includes the addition of a few acres.

As that work has been underway, the site has largely emptied out with 61 of Vineyard Wind’s 62 turbines now towering above the Atlantic. The project’s lease with the terminal expires in June.

Before President Donald Trump was re-elected, MassCEC expected some lull at the site before the next project, which is supposed to be SouthCoast Wind. But the lull has had two years added to it, while SouthCoast Wind finds itself under increasing threat.

Bruce Carlisle, MassCEC’s managing director of offshore wind, wouldn’t provide much detail on the agency’s plans for the intervening years at the New Bedford site, stating staff have started to “put out feelers with interested parties.”

But Mitchell wants to know.

“There is going to be an extended period between projects. [MassCEC has] to figure out how to manage the in-between,” he said. “What we don’t want to see there in the interim is scrap metal or … other bottom of the barrel materials.”

Before Vineyard Wind, the terminal hosted land-based wind turbines, offshore wind research and survey vessels, recycled steel, ferry parking, modular building components, shipping containers, and timber piles. The terminal’s revenue was also millions less before Vineyard Wind arrived.

Just a minute or two drive north of the terminal is another wind site, the New Bedford Foss Marine Terminal — a private investment that remains under construction.

More than four years ago, city and state officials gathered at the then-abandoned power station to announce the site would take on new life to support a new generation of energy: wind.

Since 2024, the terminal has berthed offshore wind support and research vessels for Vineyard Wind and other projects. But it has become a bellwether of the industry’s stalling.

The original deed required the site to commit to exclusive use for renewable energy projects. But in October, Foss and city officials amended their agreement so the site may support transportation projects and storage of breakbulk (cargo too big to fit into a container).

The new agreement also temporarily allows the Seastreak Ferry to dock at the Foss terminal while it’s displaced from the closure of the State Pier. It allows parking for ferry customers — activities that have not been part of the terminal’s mission.

“We see there will be a lull,” said Andrew Saunders, president of the Foss terminal. “We see we need to adapt to what the market is.” He stressed their preferred market is “always the offshore wind market.”

If the next generation of wind projects was moving forward now, Saunders said he’d be in front of the city’s planning board to secure approval to build the terminal’s third phase: two 30,000-square-foot warehouses for wind developers.

But without power purchase agreements between the developers and utilities, the money won’t flow.

State proceeding with second wind terminal in Salem

Mitchell wants New Bedford to be competitive with ports not just outside Massachusetts, but in it. So despite the hits to the offshore wind industry, he sees a possible opportunity for New Bedford amid some of the federal actions.

He’s talking about the Salem terminal, a public-private partnership between MassCEC, the City of Salem and Crowley (a maritime logistics company) that’s been in development since 2022 to support what was then a steady pipeline of projects to be built off the commonwealth’s coast and the Gulf of Maine.

That pipeline has since frozen, and the proposed terminal — on the site of a former coal plant — had $34 million in federal funding terminated this summer. (That funding amounts to about 10% of the project’s budget, per the City of Salem.)

Carlisle said the federal backing was a “critical part” of the funding mix. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo in November said it alone is “not entirely fatal” to the project’s completion.

Mitchell asked whether it makes sense for the state to have two staging terminals, stating New Bedford’s will be available when the industry picks back up.

“It’s no secret we in New Bedford have long been concerned about the possibility of the proposed facility in Salem competing against New Bedford,” he said. “The state has to explain why it would, at this point in the game, allow that project to proceed, given there aren’t offshore wind projects that might use New Bedford for the foreseeable future.”

But MassCEC believes the future market — as well as plans for floating wind turbines in the Gulf of Maine — warrants a second marshaling site.

“We’re taking … the medium and the long view,” said Carlisle. “We are positioning ourselves for when this industry gets some traction again.”

Because the floating turbines in the Gulf of Maine will involve different technology, Carlisle said, the state needs a different port infrastructure to support it.

Pangallo, like Mitchell, is bullish on the industry’s long-term future — and his city playing a lead role in its buildout: “The horizon we see … is over decades, not just the next couple of years.”

Pangallo said the parties are exploring a phased buildout or possible redesign of the terminal to deal with the funding loss. He said they’re also exploring “other temporary alternative uses that could support the port’s operation in the interim.”

In other words, Salem’s future terminal is already facing a predicament similar to New Bedford’s after Cape Wind fell through.

Further complicating the terminal’s future plans: its anchor tenant, New England Wind, has been targeted by the Trump administration. The federal government has asked a court for the ability to reconsider its approval of the project’s construction plan — a permit necessary for buildout.

MassCEC in 2024 said the Salem site was expected to be operational by 2026. Not much work has progressed beyond a symbolic groundbreaking in the summer of 2024. Carlisle said he could not comment on the expected commercial operation date.

“The actions by the Trump administration certainly have led to more uncertainty on the part of developers and their ability to commit to leases, and that has impacted the long-term revenue and financing visibility for Salem,” Carlisle said. “But we are actively working with Crowley and the City of Salem as we speak on plans.”

Yearslong pause ahead

In the short to medium term, there will be “quieter times” at the ports that support offshore wind, said Kris Ohleth, director at the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a Delaware-based nonprofit.

“I think market and investor confidence is pretty much as low as it can possibly be,” she said, saying developers are contemplating submitting permitting documents near the end of Trump’s term — three years away.

“I would venture that the ones that started construction last year have been living in a perpetual state of fear and potentially regret that they did start,” Ohleth continued. “I can’t imagine any developer risking capital investment in this environment.”

The developers’ fears are reasonable. Two have seen their projects paused twice, costing millions in losses per day. And in December, all five projects under construction along the Atlantic coast were suspended, with the federal government citing national security concerns.

Timothy Fox, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, believes a longer term freeze is in the realm of possibility.

“The question is… will we see the industry ramp back up after Trump leaves office?” said Fox. “Our new best-case scenario for long-term offshore wind is that this is a pause. But we’re not convinced it is. We think the administration has sought to inject so much uncertainty into the industry that there’s not going to be a lot of interest among investors and financiers.”

Because the permitting timelines are lengthy and often span two presidencies, developers have experienced pendulum swings in the approaches of Democrat and Republican administrations. This last swing has been so extreme that it could have more lasting impacts, experts say.

New Bedford jobs on ice

Though offshore wind is touted as a clean energy alternative, Mitchell sees the industry’s role and impact in New Bedford as an economic one. And with no project to follow once Vineyard Wind concludes its high-capital construction phase, that economic spout is expected to reduce to a trickle.

Mitchell said it concerns him, but he emphasized New Bedford never was, and never will be, a wind-only port.

“New Bedford is still primarily a fishing port. … That said, the recent contribution of marshaling of the Vineyard Wind project is a not insignificant contributor to the port’s total economic output,” he said. “It’s created jobs, opportunities for small businesses in the city.”

SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind, the two projects planned next for Massachusetts, face threats of having their federal permits and approvals revoked. They missed another deadline to secure power purchase agreements with the state utilities.

Each project promises about 100 jobs for the city, Mitchell previously estimated, including union labor.

Andy Benedetto, business representative at Local 1121, which includes carpenters and millwrights, said the union was in planning talks with SouthCoast Wind on what training and standards worked best.

But in late 2025, the point person for the wind project was laid off, he said, something that’s been happening across the offshore wind industry.

“We invested millions into training people and building this workforce that now is just going to be more or less stagnant,” Benedetto said.

The National Offshore Wind Institute, a Bristol Community College site that opened in 2024 to train the union workforce and other industry members, is looking to pivot, like its waterfront neighbors.

Brianne McDonough, interim vice president for economic and business development at Bristol Community College, in an interview this fall said the school “designed the use of the building around wind,” but that it can train different industries, including oil, gas, and construction.

Some smaller-scale wind work may continue in the coming years out of New Bedford. That includes possible operations and maintenance work, and fishermen providing site and safety security for turbine installation or subsea cable laying.

Tony Alvernaz, a New Bedford scalloper, made it clear that he supports the Trump administration and opposes wind turbines being installed around fishing grounds. But, he’s also appreciative of the work he’s found with the industry.

Alvernaz, who has worked for Vineyard Wind for at least two years, recently secured another contract with a subcontractor on Orsted’s Sunrise Wind project. His fishing boat will guard a bigger vessel as it lays cable. The job was set to start in February, but that’s unclear now that the project is suspended.

“I won’t say I’m grateful for [offshore wind],” Alvernaz said. “I’m grateful for the work I guess. Who knows where I would’ve been without this extra work.”

e’s glad to see a slowdown as it will allow research to catch up: “Now you get to see these guys fully permitted finish their projects… the pros and cons will come out in the next few years.”

Mitchell shared similar sentiments, saying the Trump administration’s revisiting and reconsideration of some lease siting with more weight given to fishing interests was necessary.

The speed at which the wind industry was taking off under the Biden administration, and even before, often sparked analogies about those involved building the ship as they’re sailing it. Now that it’s slowing — if not stopping — Ohleth offered a variation.

“For a decade, our favorite expression in offshore wind was building a plane while we’re flying it. Now the plane is on the ground. That’s an opportunity,” she said. “Figure out how to get the right policies, procedures and regulations in place that enable offshore wind to be able to flourish in the next political cycle.”

In the real, not metaphorical sense, the giant vessels associated with offshore wind won’t be sidelined. The foreign jack-up ships and retrofitted barges are in high demand and will return to Europe or the south to support other projects and industries.

But the local workforce, shoreside companies, terminals and smaller fishing boats that have built offshore wind into their business plans will need to pivot.

Duke Energy, a Fortune 150 company headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., is one of America’s largest energy holding companies.","This one-of-its-kind system begins with Duke Energy Florida’s existing DeBary solar site, which provides energy for two electrolyzer units that separate water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen atoms.

The resulting oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the green hydrogen is delivered to reinforced containers for safe storage.

During times when energy demand is highest, the system delivers the stored green hydrogen to an existing combustion turbine that has been upgraded – using GE Vernova technology – to run on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen or up to 100% hydrogen.

This process makes the natural gas turbines more flexible and diversifies Duke Energy Florida’s generation fleet to support the expansion of renewable energy.

Because the green hydrogen is an on-demand source of energy, the turbines can be turned on and off at any time – it is not dependent on the time of day or the weather.

The site’s reliability allows for more renewable, yet intermittent, energy sources – like solar – that displace the cost of fuel for customers while still meeting rising customer demand.

“Diverse generation is strong, reliable generation,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “The DeBary hydrogen project underscores Duke Energy Florida’s deep understanding of that notion and our commitment to making strategic infrastructure investments that will allow us to continue providing value for our customers while meeting their rapidly increasing demand for energy.”

“The DeBary system allows for safe, reliable generation and storage of clean energy,” said Reggie Anderson, Duke Energy Florida vice president of regulated and renewable energy. “Duke Energy Florida is proud of this successful innovation and the lasting impact it will have on our industry, our company and, most importantly, our customers.”

Please see below for more information on significant releases in December 2025.[1]

Business

IRS Releases Updated FAQs on Section 163(j): On Dec. 23, 2025, the IRS updated the frequently asked questions in Fact Sheet 2025-09 regarding the limitation on the deduction of business interest expenses (Section 163(j)) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The updated FAQs address the gross receipts tests, floor plan financing interest expenses, the adjusted taxable income (ATI) limitation calculation and other OBBBA changes.

Importantly, the FAQs note that for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024, the ATI limitation will again be based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

The updates also clarify that small businesses with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less for 2025 are exempt, even if the prior year’s additional interest carries forward. The FAQs define business interest expense as interest allocable to non-excepted trades or businesses (excluding employee services, electing real property/farming businesses and utilities). It also includes loans to finance trailers/campers held for sale or lease for taxable years after Dec. 31. 2024.

Education

IRS Issues Guidance on Scholarship Granting Organizations: On Dec. 12, 2025, the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 2026-6, which establishes procedures for states to make an Advance Election to become a “covered state” under the new Section 25F credit for contributions to qualified scholarship granting organizations (SGOs), established by the OBBBA. The guidance allows a state to notify potential SGOs of the state’s participation in the new federal scholarship tax credit program before formally submitting the state’s SGO lists for calendar year 2027. States making the Advance Election must file Form 15714 between Jan. 1, 2026, and the deadline for submitting their SGO lists.

Energy

IRS Provides Safe Harbor for Carbon Capture Verification Standards: On Dec. 19, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2026-01, which provides a safe harbor for eligibility determinations for taxpayers claiming the Section 45Q Carbon Capture and Sequestration credit. The guidance allows sequestration data to be verified by an independent engineer or geologist beginning in tax year 2025 to ensure continued compliance until a long-term solution replaces the greenhouse gas reporting framework. The change follows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s September proposal to terminate its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) for industrial facilities. Current regulations require section 45Q credit claimants to meet the requirements from this program for verification of sequestration volumes.

IRS Provides Information on Dyed Fuel Excise Tax for Taxpayers: On Dec. 22, 2025, the IRS issued Announcement 2026-01 informing taxpayers about refunds available for federal excise taxes paid on undyed diesel or kerosene that later exits a terminal as dyed fuel intended for tax-exempt purposes.

Health Care

IRS Issues Guidance for HSAs: On Dec. 9, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2026-05, which addresses questions regarding the OBBBA changes to health savings account (HSAs). The notice explains how high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) can now cover telehealth services without a deductible if they match Medicare’s list of over 250 approved remote care codes, with 2025 plans grandfathered in—although in-person visits, equipment or non-vaccine drugs typically are not eligible. It also describes how bronze and catastrophic plans from health insurance exchanges count as HDHPs even if they skip standard deductibles or spending caps (and work with employer reimbursement accounts like ICHRA), but small business exchange plans and recent Indian Health Services use often do not qualify. It also details Direct Primary Care arrangements, which will not preclude HSA use if they are just for basic primary care (by specific doctors or nurses), charge a flat monthly fee up to $150/$300 (individual/family) for up to a year, skip extras like anesthesia or lab tests outside a doctor’s office and let employers pay separately from the HDHP—HSAs can reimburse fees early, but higher fees block contributions while still qualifying as medical costs.

IRS Issues Fact Sheet Regarding Premium Tax Credits: On Dec. 23, 2025, the IRS updated the frequently asked questions in Fact Sheet 2025-10 regarding advanced premium tax credits (APTC). The changes highlight eligibility rules (income at least 100% of federal poverty line, no affordable employer/government coverage, non-Married Filing Separately except for abuse victims), household income definition (modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) plus certain exclusions), affordability tests for employer plans and PTC computation (second-lowest silver plan minus income percentage, reconciled via Form 8962 and Form 1095-A). It also states that taxpayers must reconcile APTC on returns even if filing solely to claim additional credit, with reporting mandatory if any APTC was received.

Individuals and Families

IRS Issues Guidance on Auto Loan Interest Deduction: On Dec. 31, 2025, the IRS issued proposed regulations regarding the auto loan interest deduction. The rule addresses information reporting requirements for lenders, identifies eligible taxpayers and loans and guidelines for determining final assembly.

Qualifying vehicles must be “new” to the taxpayer (original use starts with the purchase), built mainly for roads and highways (not rails or off-road only), and have their final assembly in the United States, which taxpayers can check via the vehicle’s ID number (VIN) details or the label on the car showing the assembly location. Only individuals, estates of deceased people and certain trusts can claim the deduction, which is subject to phase-out limitations.

Qualifying loans must be taken out after Dec. 31, 2024, secured by a first lien on the qualifying vehicle, and used to buy the car plus typical add-ons like sales tax, registration fees or service plans, but not insurance or “negative equity” from trading in an old car loan. The deduction does not apply to loans to finance boats or trailers. Additionally, deductible interest on refinanced loans are capped at the original loan’s remaining balance. To qualify as “personal use,” the taxpayer must expect to use the financed vehicle for more than half the time for individual, rather than business, purposes.

Lenders receiving more than $600 in interest annually from a qualifying loan must report the details to the IRS and send taxpayers a statement noting that not all interest may be deductible. The lender would be required to file an information return for each borrower, reporting items such as the borrower’s name and address, total interest received, outstanding principal at the start of the year, loan origination date and the vehicle’s VIN, year, make and model. The guidance incorporates existing penalty frameworks for failures to file or furnish required information returns and payee statements.

Public comments on the proposed regulations are due by Feb. 2, 2026, and a public hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 24, 2026.

International

IRS Issues Initial Guidance on OBBBA International Tax Provisions: On Dec. 4, 2025, Treasury and the IRS issued Notices 2025-75, 2025-77 and 2025-78 previewing proposed regulations on the OBBBA international tax transition rules. Notice 2025-75 covers modified subpart F pro rata share rules for CFC dividends paid on or before June 28, 2025. Notice 2025-77 clarifies the 10% foreign tax credit disallowance under section 960(d)(4) for taxes on section 959(a) distributions of section 951A. Notice 2025-78 addresses the new foreign-derived deduction-eligible income regime excluding gains after June 16 outbound sales of intellectual property or depreciable property (adopting the definitions of intangibles under section 367(d)(4), excluding leases and licenses).

IRS Issues Guidance on Foreign-Government Income: On Dec. 12, 2025, Treasury and the IRS issued proposed and final regulations under section 892 that update and clarify the treatment of income earned by foreign governments from their U.S. investments. The proposed rules would redefine “commercial activity,” establish new standards for determining government control of entities, and clarify that partnerships are not considered government-controlled even if wholly owned by a sovereign government. The final regulations confirm that income from qualified, government-controlled entities such as foreign pension funds remains eligible for U.S. real-estate tax exemptions.

Real Estate

IRS Issues Penalty Relief Guidance for the Sale of Farmland Property: On Dec. 22, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2026-03 for penalty relief from estimated tax penalties for taxpayers that make a valid section 1062(a) election related to gain from the sale of qualified farmland to a qualified farmer. Section 1062(a) allows eligible taxpayers to elect to pay the tax attributable to that gain in four equal annual installments instead of in full by the original due date of the return. The notice clarifies that the deferred portion of the tax may be excluded when computing required estimated tax payments for the year of sale and relief applies only if the taxpayer files a return on time, properly makes the election with the required covenant or restriction attached, and complies with all associated requirements.

Retirement

IRS Issues Guidance on Trump Accounts: On Dec. 2, 2025, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2025-68, announcing its intent to issue upcoming regulations on Trump Accounts, a new type of tax-advantaged individual retirement account (IRA) for eligible children under 18 established under the OBBBA. The accounts will include a one-time $1,000 federal pilot contribution for U.S. citizen newborns between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. Families or others can contribute up to $5,000 annually. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 tax-free per employee (counting toward the limit), and certain governments and charities may add qualified general contributions.

The IRS also released draft Form 4547 (Trump Account Election(s)) and instructions for electing into the Trump Accounts program for eligible children. Elections for 2026 are expected to be made by filing the new form or through the online portal at trumpaccounts.gov, which is expected to be available by mid-2026.

IRS Issues Guidance on 403(b) Plans: On Dec. 3, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2025-60 announcing the 2025 Required Amendments List (RA List) for qualified 401(a) plans, 403(b) plans and preapproved interim amendments. The guidance sets Dec. 31, 2027, as the general deadline to amend non-governmental plans (later for governmental or union plans). The list has Part A items (RMD rule updates affecting most plans), Part B items (partnership/trust attribution changes under section 414(c) for unusual plans), and no Part C items, The list aligns with SECURE 2.0 deadlines of 2026 through 2029.

These join facilities in Steyr, Austria, Tudela, Spain and Gothenburg, Sweden.

Individual decarbonisation roadmaps have been developed for each of SKF's factories, outlining the emissions reduction trajectory for every site.

The company-wide strategy incorporates specific actions, investments and anticipated improvements, supporting each location with energy efficiency measures and fossil fuel phase-out initiatives.

“By reducing the carbon footprint of our products, we are also enabling our customers to develop sustainable solutions as well as supporting society in the transition to a more sustainable future.”

Six factories creating global impact

The newly acknowledged factories enable SKF to generate positive environmental impact on a global scale, with sites positioned across Malaysia, Mexico, India, Italy and the US.

At these locations, the company has implemented investments in energy efficient technologies, including heat pumps and advanced chillers, delivering energy savings alongside increased production output.

The nine decarbonised facilities collectively represent nearly 20% of SKF's baseline manufacturing emissions, contributing to overall carbon footprint reduction.

Susanne Larsson, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer and SVP Finance at SKF, says: “Climate change is a global challenge and this achievement reflects our commitment to climate action and operational excellence.

“By investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency and innovative solutions, we are also increasing our own resilience by lowering our energy demand.”

How do the factories fit into SKF’s strategy?

The decarbonised sites support SKF's progression towards its operational decarbonisation goal by 2030.

The company has established a science-based target for achieving net zero emissions across its entire supply chain by 2050.

SKF was amongst the first industrial companies to receive goal validation from the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), with sustainability targets aligned to the Paris Agreement's 1.5C objective.

According to the company, its 2030 decarbonisation goal will be reached through energy and material efficiency improvements combined with transitioning to renewable energy sources for operations.

Supply chain optimisation also features in the strategy, particularly through supporting customers in reaching their sustainability objectives.

This approach involves developing products that are lighter, more efficient, longer lasting and repairable, helping to reduce both product footprints and material consumption.

Rob Jenkinson, Net Zero Manager at SKF, says: “Achieving our net zero goal by 2050 is ambitious, but also needed to speed up both innovation and change in society.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c4b8298a1617ae5fa0a7c151fb89ccf4:bc2a208011aae81ebcc9f92ccab13303/a8b10ce15c622160-org.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 10:59:12.519348

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.",https://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2026/01/6961738b67cae5.77070586.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-10 14:00:11.291784

Tightening market pressure has raised uncertainty over timelines for this year. 2026 is supposed to continue the trend of new hydrogen projects reaching commissioning; however, new reports from reputable institutions have pointed to an alternative reality in 2026. With several electrolyzer manufacturing companies noting a less-than-ideal environment for production this year, the industry needs some self-introspection.

Hydrogen industry leaders are grappling with a new reality this year

With the unstable global geopolitical landscape that emerged towards the tail end of last year, several market analysts noted that this year will see some troubling trends emerging for electrolyzer manufacturers. Regionalization across the hydrogen market has emerged following years of a global new world order aimed at increasing hydrogen developments.

Consolidation has become an all-too common theme across the hydrogen market over the past few years. While some regions have embraced the potential of the hydrogen sector to deliver vast amounts of clean energy, others have languished in their adoption of the renewable energy market overall, such as the United States, which has been actively rolling back clean energy permits over the past few months.

“We’ve gone from that globalization to regionalization—that almost helps some of your high cost players very short term…that’s a very near term. How long that lasts if we have another round of tariff movements—European, and we will, but European, I don’t know what it is, but we will in Q2.“ – Andrew Neale Vice President – Chemicals, Derivatives, Plastics & Materials, S&P Commodity Insights

With a litany of other energy experts noting the substantial stagnation of the hydrogen energy dream, the market will need to reconsider delaying certain projects this year to give the sector some organic recuperation time. Thankfully, the energy market is nothing if not adaptable.

Several electrolyzer manufacturers expect this year to see a dip in sales

Among the world’s top electrolyzer manufacturers, several are reporting some worrying sales expectations for the new year. Thyssenkrupp Nucera, one of the global energy market’s top hydrogen companies, has stated that it expects significantly lower sales this year. It attributes this less-than-ideal sales to the stagnation and delays of financing for hydrogen projects around the world.

The company has forecasted revenues of €500–600 million for the 2026 fiscal year, which is a dramatic dip from last year, which saw upwards of €845 million in electrolyzer sales across the renewable energy market. The company’s CEO, Werner Ponikwar, said that the global hydrogen market has become an exceedingly challenging place to do business, but assured investors and shareholders that the company will stand strong in the face of adversity.

Germany has become the home of the hydrogen market in Europe

Thyssenkrupp Nucera, which is majority-owned by German company Thyssenkrupp AG, has become an essential driver for the hydrogen sector over the past few years. Germany, overall, has been a welcoming destination for the hydrogen market, with a new report stating that Germany produced hydrogen plasma at 20 million ºC.

The decline in EV sales does matter, but there are several reasons to believe the company's EV sales will rebound in 2026. Here are a few of them.

The Model Y refresh significantly impacted sales in 2025

Not all Teslas are made equal. In fact, the Tesla story is really a Model Y (midsize SUV) and, to a slightly lesser extent, a Model 3 (sports sedan) story. The Model X (luxury SUV) and Model S (luxury sedan) are bit part players -- a fact that illustrates the desire for affordable EVs.

As such, when Tesla decided to refresh the Y, it was clear that there would be a noisy quarter or two as production shifted to the new Model Y (known as Juniper) and buyers waited for the latest model to be released.

That's precisely what happened, and as you can see below, Tesla had a very weak first and second quarter as a result. For an idea of how essential the Model Y is, industry analysts estimate it's responsible for more than a quarter of total EV sales in the U.S.

Moreover, for those attributing Tesla's EV sales decline in 2025 to its high-profile CEO Elon Musk's political involvements, it's worth noting that, according to Cox Automotive, Model 3 sales rose by 17.6% in the first nine months of 2025 in the U.S. This isn't a Tesla or Musk problem, at least not in the U.S., it's a Model Y problem.

Furthermore, the rollout of the Juniper was phased regionally, as is the issue of newer standard, more affordable versions of the Model Y that Tesla is selling to better compete on price. With an easier comparison to the first half coming up and the Juniper rollout now global, Tesla's Model Y sales are expected to improve in 2026.

Tesla's sales recovered in the second half

In addition to the Model Y's impact, there's also the pull-forward of sales in the U.S. to the third quarter, caused by the expiration of U.S. federal EV tax credits at the end of September. This contributed to the sales increase observed in the third quarter, followed by a decline in the fourth quarter.

But here's the thing. If you annualize the fourth-quarter deliveries, it comes to 1.67 million deliveries. If you annualize the second half (to adjust for the tax credit expiry issue), it comes to 1.83 million deliveries. For reference, Tesla published the Wall Street analyst consensus for deliveries in 2026, which is 1.75 million deliveries, a figure in the middle of the two figures I calculated above.

Robotaxis and lower rates will help, too

The advent of robotaxis, led by regulatory approval and, hopefully, the production of Cybercabs, will highlight a key value-added feature of Tesla EVs. Specifically, Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software.

While Tesla's unsupervised robotaxis haven't been approved anywhere yet, Musk believes that regulatory approvals will flow in 2026 (such that Cybercab commercial production is planned to begin in April), and so will European approval of FSD -- Musk believes it will be granted in the Netherlands in early 2026.

These actions will significantly raise the profile of Tesla's FSD solutions and add perceived value to Tesla's EVs. In addition, all vehicle sales will benefit from a lower interest rate environment for investors.

What it means for Tesla investors

While the most critical catalysts for Tesla's stock in 2026 will be the advent of robotaxis, Cybercab production, and ongoing regulatory approvals, a return to growth in EV sales also matters, not least from a narrative perspective, as Tesla's declining EV sales have been a stick for the bears to beat the stock with. In addition, building production volume is a key factor in generating margin expansion and lowering the cost of EV production, ensuring that Tesla can make EVs more affordable.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F850074%2Ftesla-sales-building-with-tesla-logo-and-teslas-parked-in-front.png&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-10 07:57:50.236808

Growth Energy’s Ask Enact legislation to permanently allow year-round sales of E15(S.593/H.R.
Passing legislation to allow E15 to be sold year-round would increase availability and save consumers money.","In 1990, Congress specified that fuel with 10% ethanol (E10) could be sold year-round to encourage the use of ethanol-blended fuels, which save consumers money and burn cleaner than fuels without ethanol. However, the waiver Congress granted for E10 predated the introduction of higher ethanol blends like E15. E15 has an even lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) than E10, meaning it has lower evaporative emissions than standard E10 fuel. This means that despite having lower emissions than E10, E15 cannot be sold in most states during the summer months, except temporarily through emergency waivers.

Growth Energy’s Ask

Enact legislation to permanently allow year-round sales of E15(S.593/H.R. 1346, Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act).

As a result of emergency waivers and other EPA regulatory action from 2019-2025, consumers saved upwards of 30 cents per gallon by choosing E15, with some locations offering E15 for over $1 per gallon less than E10.

Passing legislation to allow E15 to be sold year-round would increase availability and save consumers money. If we made E15 the standard fuel in the U.S., we could save $20 billion+ in fuel costs each year.

BIOFUEL BLENDS

Nationwide adoption of E15 would save consumers $20.6 billion in annual fuel costs, put an additional $36.3 billion in income into the pockets of American families, and generate $66.3 billion for the U.S. GDP.

Nationwide adoption of E15 will result in an increase in corn demand of about 2.3 billion bushels per year.

E15 and higher biofuel blends have lower evaporative emissions than standard vehicle fuels.

Higher biofuel blends are better for air quality, reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants harmful to human health, like carbon monoxide.

Ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 46% compared to gasoline.

If the United States transitioned from E10 to E15 nationwide, greenhouse gas emissions would fall by 17.62 million tons per year, the equivalent of removing 3.85 million vehicles from the road.

In September, his administration also let lapse federal authorization for California's Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which allowed solo EV drivers to use carpool lanes.
""The governor and legislative leaders must act now to fully fund zero-emission transportation and pursue new revenue to grow and sustain climate investments.""
""Just yesterday, the Governor acknowledged in his State of the State address that the climate risk is a financial risk.
That is exactly why California needs climate investments that are stable and ongoing,"" said Sierra Club director Miguel Miguel.","Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday doubled down on California's commitment to electric vehicles with proposed rebates intended to backfill federal tax credits canceled by the Trump administration.

The plan would allocate $200 million in one-time special funds for a new point-of-sale incentive program for light-duty zero-emissions vehicles. It was part of a sweeping $348.9-billion state budget proposal released Friday, which also included items to address air pollution and worsening wildfires, amid a projected $3-billion state deficit.

EVs have become a flashpoint in California's battle against the Trump administration, which moved last year to repeal the state's long-held authority to set strict tailpipe emission standards and eventually ban the sale of new gas powered cars.

Last year, Trump ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of President Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In September, his administration also let lapse federal authorization for California's Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which allowed solo EV drivers to use carpool lanes.

""Despite federal interference, the governor maintains his commitment to protecting public health and achieving California's world leading climate agenda,"" Lindsay Buckley, spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, said in an email. ""This incentive program will help continue the state's ZEV momentum, especially with the federal administration eliminating the federal EV tax credit and carpool lane access.""

Newsom had previously flip-flopped on this idea, first vowing to restore a state program that provided up to $7,500 to buy clean cars and then walking it back in September. That same month, a group of five automakers including Honda, Rivian, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Audi wrote a letter urging Newsom and state legislators to establish a $5,000 EV tax rebate to replace the lost federal incentives, Politico reported.

During his State of the State speech Thursday — one year after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles — Newsom said California ""refuse[s] to be bystanders"" while China and other nations take the lead on electric vehicles and the clean energy transition. He touted the state's investments in solar, hydrogen, wind and nuclear power, as well as its recent move away from the use of any coal-fired power.

""We must continue our prudent fiscal management, funding our reserves, and continuing the investments Californians rely on, from education to public safety, all while preparing for Trump's volatility outside our control,"" the governor said in a statement. ""This is what responsible governance looks like.""

Several environmental groups had been urging Newsom to invest more in clean air and clean vehicle programs, which they say are critical to the state's ambitious goals for human health and the environment. Transportation is the largest source of climate and air pollution in California and is responsible for more than a third of global warming emissions, said Daniel Barad, Western states policy manager with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.

""As federal attacks threaten California's authority to protect public health, incentives are more essential than ever to scale up clean cars and trucks,"" Barad said. ""The governor and legislative leaders must act now to fully fund zero-emission transportation and pursue new revenue to grow and sustain climate investments.""

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California senior director with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, called it ""an essential step to save money for Californians, cut harmful pollution, spur innovation, and support the global competitiveness of our auto industry.""

While the budget proposal does not include significant new spending proposals, it contains other line items relating to climate and the environment. Among them are plans to continue implementing Proposition 4, the $10-billion climate bond approved by voters in 2024 for programs geared toward wildfire resilience, safe drinking water, flood management, extreme heat mitigation and other similar efforts.

Among $2.1 billion in climate bond investments proposed this year are $58 million for wildfire prevention and hazardous fuels reduction projects in vulnerable communities, and nearly $20 million to assist homeowners with defensible space to prevent fire. Water-related investments include $232 million for flood control projects and nearly $70 million to support repairs to existing or new water conveyance projects.

The proposal also lays out how to spend money from California's signature cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allows large polluters to buy and sell unused emission allowances at quarterly auctions. State lawmakers last year voted to extend the program through 2045 and rename it cap-and-invest.

The spending plan includes a new tiered structure for cap-and-invest that first funds statutory obligations such as manufacturing tax exemptions, followed by $1 billion for the high speed rail project, $750 million to support the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and finally secondary program funding such as affordable housing and low-carbon transit options.

But while some groups applauded the budget's broad handling of climate issues, others criticized it for leaning too heavily on volatile funding sources for environmental priorities, such as special funds and one-time allocations.

The Sierra Club called the EV incentive program a crucial investment but said too many other items were left with ""patchwork strategies that make long-term planning harder.""

""Just yesterday, the Governor acknowledged in his State of the State address that the climate risk is a financial risk. That is exactly why California needs climate investments that are stable and ongoing,"" said Sierra Club director Miguel Miguel.

California Environmental Voters, meanwhile, stressed that the state should continue to work toward legislation that would hold oil and gas companies liable for damages caused by their emissions — a plan known as ""Make Polluters Pay"" that stalled last year amid fierce lobbying and industry pressure.

""Instead of asking families to absorb the costs, the Legislature must look seriously at holding polluters accountable for the harm they’ve caused,"" said Shannon Olivieri Hovis, California Environmental Voters' chief strategy officer.

Sarah Swig, Newsom's senior advisor for climate, noted that the state's budget plan came just days after Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a major global treaty signed by nearly 200 countries with the aim of addressing global warming through coordinated international action.

""California is not slowing down on climate at a time when we continue to see attack after attack from the federal government, including as recently as this week with the Trump administration's withdrawal from the UNFCCC,"" Swig told reporters Friday. ""California's leadership has never mattered more.""",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/la_times_articles_853/160eef23583183e08a649043fc1a29cf,N,,2026-01-10 14:59:11.313906

Darnell Tingle,,,,,https://www.bnd.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/article314249484.html,"Pritzker start 2026 off right by passing a major bill to help lower electricity bills in the Metro East and across Illinois.
CRGA is built upon the strong foundation laid by Illinois’ previous landmark climate and jobs bills, including 2017’s Future Energy and Jobs Act (FEJA) and 2021’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).
FEJA kickstarted Illinois’ clean energy economy, and CEJA made sure its benefits were extended to communities often left out of the conversation.
Equally important as the economic benefits, environmental preservation and remediation is a core tenet of Illinois’ energy policy.
It will lower costs for our struggling neighbors, create opportunities for workers and aspiring clean energy entrepreneurs, shepherd in a new era of environmental justice, and deliver on the promises our state made with previous clean energy legislation.","With everyday costs skyrocketing throughout 2025, from groceries to health insurance to holiday gifts, I was happy to see Gov. Pritzker start 2026 off right by passing a major bill to help lower electricity bills in the Metro East and across Illinois.

After Ameren bills spiked as much as $200 per month in our community this year, I joined many other voices from across Illinois to call for lawmakers to ease the burden on people’s wallets. In response, Gov. Pritzker has signed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act, which will lower Ameren bills by more than $20 per month by 2035.

My colleagues and I at United Congregations of Metro-East (UCM) were incredibly happy to see the General Assembly and Gov. Pritzker enact a solution that addresses the ongoing affordability crisis while also creating jobs in our community and protecting our environment. As an organization committed to social justice and climate action, UCM is incredibly proud to operate in a state that is building a strong, more equitable economy through clean energy.

CRGA is built upon the strong foundation laid by Illinois’ previous landmark climate and jobs bills, including 2017’s Future Energy and Jobs Act (FEJA) and 2021’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA). FEJA kickstarted Illinois’ clean energy economy, and CEJA made sure its benefits were extended to communities often left out of the conversation.

CEJA has been incredibly valuable for the communities we, and other organizations like ours, serve. In fact, UCM was one of the many community advocacy organizations that gave underrepresented communities a seat at the table during negotiations over CEJA.

Our successful lobbying efforts led CEJA to institute nation-leading equity standards, ensuring jobs and clean energy projects benefit people from disadvantaged backgrounds – whether based on income level, prior incarceration, environmental issues in a community, racial disparities, or other factors that have historically excluded certain people from the clean energy economy.

We at UCM have witnessed firsthand the benefits of CEJA’s equity standards, as we are one of the state’s designated organizations responsible for helping people access CEJA’s workforce opportunities. Through our involvement with CEJA, we have helped numerous individuals put themselves on a path to a high-quality career in a fast-growing field.

The latest bill, CRGA, retains all of CEJA’s equity targets and will be critical in ensuring Illinois meets those marks, thanks to its continued support of programs that provide families access to clean energy and promote growth for small, diverse businesses across Illinois.

Equally important as the economic benefits, environmental preservation and remediation is a core tenet of Illinois’ energy policy. The Metro East region is second only to Chicagoland when it comes to the number of officially designated Environmental Justice Communities. Our area has long been disproportionately impacted by environmental racism; a 100% renewable energy grid will begin to roll back the horrific legacy of industrial pollution that plagues minority and low-income neighborhoods.

CRGA will make the goal of a carbon-free future a reality by investing in energy storage – a technology that absorbs excess solar and wind energy to use later, keeping our grid clean even when the sun is down or the wind isn’t blowing.

In addition to its environmental benefits, storage is proven to save money; for example, storage saved Texas residents $750 million since 2023, and CRGA is projected to save more than $12 billion over the next 20 years. CRGA’s storage program will also create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic development in our state – with an intentional focus on benefiting the communities that most need it.

It’s not often that new legislation offers a win for every party involved, but CRGA has accomplished this for organizations like UCM and the communities we serve. It will lower costs for our struggling neighbors, create opportunities for workers and aspiring clean energy entrepreneurs, shepherd in a new era of environmental justice, and deliver on the promises our state made with previous clean energy legislation.

EDMONTON — Alberta Premier Danielle Smith is calling on Ottawa to further speed up its approval process for major projects, saying she wants to see applications green-lit within six months.

Prime Minister Mark Carney's major projects office, established last year, currently aims to complete regulatory reviews within two years.

Smith, in a letter to Carney shared on social media Friday, said that two years is too long, considering the recent U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to ramp up oil production in the South American country.

""Renewed Venezuelan crude production, supported by United States investment, will ultimately increase the amount of heavy oil bound for U.S. refineries and directly compete with Canadian production for limited refining capacity,"" Smith said in the letter.

The premier, who said she had a ""positive"" meeting with Carney on Friday discussing the developments in Venezuela, has previously said Maduro's capture underscored the need for new pipelines, including one to the West Coast being pitched and planned by her government.

Smith's letter says an application for such a pipeline will be submitted by June, and asks that it be approved no later than fall.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called for an even quicker approval of Alberta's desired pipeline, saying Ottawa should sign off on it within 60 days of receiving the application.

A route for the pipeline and a private-sector proponent have yet to be determined.

Smith said in her letter that ""within the current geopolitical context, timelines of up to two years are still woefully long"" and put Canada at risk, especially since the U.S. is accelerating its own oil and gas projects.

""Any delay risks ceding market share, losing investment, and undermining Canada's competitive position in a rapidly changing global energy landscape.""

Trump met with executives from 17 major oil companies Friday, saying he expected at least US$100 billion in investments to expand oil production in Venezuela, which has the largest proven reserves in the world.

The president also promised ""government protection"" for those investments, saying the U.S. was able to work with Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's interim president, and that the companies would be dealing with his administration directly when it comes to oil production.

Smith's letter says there is proven demand for Alberta's heavy oil in Asia and that a new pipeline — and an expansion of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline connecting her province to the B.C. tidewater — would secure further investments and stabilize oil prices, which make or break her government's budgets.

""As a stable democracy with some of the most modern, efficient and lowest emissions intensity oil produced globally, Canada is uniquely positioned to significantly expand its role in global energy markets,"" Smith wrote.

""The federal government must act with urgency to seize this opportunity, safeguard long-term economic security, and secure our energy future.""

Later Friday, Carney said on social media he and Smith talked about getting ""big things built"" for Albertans and Canadians, but didn't address the premier's call for quicker approvals.

Questions sent to Carney's office about Smith's call for quicker project approvals were forwarded to a spokesperson for Energy Minister Tim Hodgson.

Charlotte Power, Hodgson's press secretary, said the government was working with Alberta to make sure the approval process for a bitumen pipeline was ""clear and efficient.""

""When it comes to specific timelines, we are still in early stages but look forward to engaging with Alberta, B.C. and Indigenous communities further,"" she said Friday in a statement.

Carney said earlier this week he thought Canada's oil would remain competitive, despite the removal of Maduro, because it is low risk and low cost.

Power said the government continues to monitor developments, but added that it's ""too early to speculate on the impacts on Canada’s oil industry.""

""Regardless of any potential long-term impacts, our government is taking bold action to transform our economy and energy industry into one that is diverse, independent and resilient to global shocks.""

The firm will announce final results on January 29.

Seoul-based LGES, a supplier to automakers including Tesla and General Motors, is grappling with weaker demand for battery-powered vehicles and US President Donald Trump's policy ‌changes on ‍green energy.

General Motors said on Thursday it would ‍take a $6 billion writedown on some EV investments, the ‌latest car company to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration's policies and cooling demand.

Last month, LGES reported that a battery contract worth 9.6 trillion won with Ford has been cancelled after Ford slashed its outlook for the EV market, followed by another cancellation with Freudenberg Battery Power Systems worth 3.9 trillion won.

LGES plans ‍to sell some factory assets in the United States to Japanese carmaker Honda Motor, citing the need to improve business ‍efficiency.

The company ⁠may soon announce the ⁠suspension of operations at its plant jointly run with GM in the United States, which would cause at least 1 trillion won in temporary cost, according to a January 2 note from Seoul-based NH Investment & Securities.

GM said in October it would halt battery cell production at its two US joint-venture battery plants with LGES - in Tennessee and Ohio - in January for about six months.

The letter was transmitted to the “FOIA Officer.”

The letter states that it is serving to notify the Corps:

… of its ongoing violation of its duty to proactively disclose information under the “reading room” provisions of the Freedom of Information Act1 (“FOIA”) and to request that the Corps immediately correct these violations by making publicly available through an online portal all final permitting decisions and associated documents issued pursuant to section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

CBD states that the Corps is required under the FOIA’s “reading room” provisions to make available for public inspection in an electronic format records of all standard individual permits granted under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as well as amendments thereto and certain associated approval documents. It further alleges that such records are required to be available as soon as a final permit or permit modification is issued by a District Engineer.

The Corps is alleged to, upon issuing such permits, be failing to proactively disclose permitting decisions on the associated records documenting the decisions.

CBD acknowledges the Corps’ decentralized structure for granting permits. It further acknowledges that some Districts may publish these records as required but the three organizations and the broader public are stated to have no ability to review records from key Districts even:

New Delhi, January 9, 2026: The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) today released a landmark report titled, “India’s PV Manufacturing & Its Strategic Inflection Points” at the Bharat Climate Forum (BCF) 2026, held at ITC Maurya, New Delhi. The report was unveiled during the formal launch of India’s National Cleantech Manufacturing Implementation Plan, in the presence of senior government leaders, global institutions, industry, and finance stakeholders.

The release took place during a dedicated session in the evening, with Dr Vibha Dhawan, Director General, TERI, present at the launch. The report provides a strategic assessment of India’s solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing ecosystem and outlines policy, financing, and industrial interventions required to strengthen India’s global competitiveness across the value chain. About the report, Dr Dhawan said, “TERI’s landmark macro-level study, Reassessment of Solar Potential in India, points to a horizon of unparalleled abundance: an aggregate solar potential exceeding 10,800 GW, spanning multiple modalities including ground-mounted, rooftop, and other emerging deployment pathways. This abundance changes the strategic question in front of us. When a country has this scale of clean energy opportunity, the issue is no longer whether we can deploy enough solar. The real question is whether we will capture enough value at home through manufacturing, technology, skills, and resilient supply chains, while keeping electricity affordable for households and industry.”

While formally launching the report, Shri Santosh Sarangi, Hon’ble Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, highlighted the need to strengthen India’s renewable energy ecosystem and scale clean energy deployment, stating, “India’s renewable energy journey over the last decade has been nothing short of spectacular, marked by phenomenal leapfrogging in global rankings. Our strategy has been defined by a single-minded national objective pursued across three clear verticals: accelerating RE deployment, achieving Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in manufacturing, and driving higher citizen adoption. Through a strategic combination of policy initiatives and trade instruments, we have scaled our solar capacity from a mere 2.63 GW in 2014 to over 134 GW today. This transition is not just about capacity; it is about building a resilient, self-sufficient ecosystem that serves as a blueprint for global energy shifts.”

The report notes that while India has built significant strength in module manufacturing, with domestic module capacity far exceeding current annual demand, critical vulnerabilities persist upstream. India continues to import nearly all of its polysilicon and the vast majority of wafers, creating risks that could constrain future solar deployment if upstream capacity is not established in time.

According to the study, tool chains and manufacturing equipment are emerging as a key chokepoint, with a heavy reliance on imported high-end furnaces, deposition tools, and precision equipment. Without focused incentives for domestic equipment manufacturing and accelerated R&D, these dependencies could expose India’s solar sector to supply-chain disruptions, foreign exchange volatility, and geopolitical risks.

The report underscores that access to affordable, blended finance will be decisive in enabling large-scale upstream investments. It highlights the role of sovereign “Green-PV” bonds, co-equity participation by national investment institutions, concessional debt from development finance institutions, and risk-mitigation instruments in reducing the cost of capital and improving the bankability of upstream fabs.

The study further recommends the development of Solar–Semicon Technology Parks, shared pilot fabs for next-generation technologies, and a dedicated PV–Semicon Skill Council to strengthen innovation pipelines and workforce readiness, with a particular emphasis on linking incentives to skilling outcomes and greater participation of women in manufacturing.

The report release formed part of a broader set of high-level discussions at BCF 2026, which featured addresses by Shri C P Radhakrishnan, Hon’ble Vice-President of India, Union Ministers, and global leaders, positioning climate action, cleantech manufacturing, and resilience as central pillars of India’s growth strategy. On India’s cleantech manufacturing vision and the role of domestic manufacturing in strengthening climate and economic resilience, the Hon’ble Minister said, “A developed India cannot be built on imported technologies, fragile supply chains, or outdated energy systems alone. It must be built on homegrown clean technologies, resilient manufacturing, and a future-ready workforce”.

The Bharat Climate Forum brought together senior policymakers, global leaders, and experts from institutions including the United Nations, World Bank Group, International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Asian Development Bank, International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, NABARD, State Bank of India, and leading private sector and financial institutions.

Throughout the day-long plenary, discussions focused on clean energy transition, climate-resilient growth, cleantech manufacturing, long-term climate finance, digital and green convergence, and governance reforms needed to deliver a green, resilient, and Viksit Bharat.

Union Ministers addressed key priorities for India’s climate and development agenda, highlighting policy direction, implementation pathways, and the role of finance and industry in accelerating the transition. Regarding India’s power, housing, and urban transition priorities and their role in driving low-carbon growth, Shri Manohar Lal Khattar, the Hon’ble Union Minister for Power, Housing and Urban Affairs said, “India has rapidly transitioned towards clean energy.

The stubborn persistence of partisan politics aside, the vehicle electrification movement faces significant structural obstacles. Chief among them are the high costs of installing fast-charging stations, and an aging, creaky, bottleneck-y grid that can’t support fast-charging technology in many locations. Not to worry. The EV charging station environment is getting a quick pick-me-up in the form of AI-assisted charging-plus-storage systems, as capably illustrated by the California startup ElectricFish.

EV Charging In The USA: Where Have All The EVs Gone?

The launch of new EV charging technology into the US market comes at a fraught time for decarbonization advocates. As anticipated, domestic EV sales crashed in the months following the premature death of the federal EV tax credit on September 30 of 2025, and the outlook for 2026 doesn’t look rosy, either.

Still, EV sales did not totally evaporate, and some automakers are still planning to elbow new EVs into the gap left by industry leader Tesla’s ongoing nosedive, including Toyota and Ford along with newcomer Telo Trucks and the Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Auto. Together, they lend support to the idea that investing in the the nation’s EV charging network is still a worthwhile proposition.

In addition, while loss of the tax credit may discourage current EV owners from buying another EV, the fact is that the horses have already run out of the barn. More than 4 million EVs are currently on the road in the US, and that’s no small potatoes. Chances are that some — if not most — of those drivers will stick with an EV when they need another car, further supporting investments in new charging stations. Sales of plug-in hybrids, including range-extended options like those offered by the Scout Motors branch of Volkswagen, will also support the demand for more convenient, more accessible charging stations.

The ElectricFish Solution: Go For The Gas Stations

Into this scenario jumps ElectricFish with an economical EV charging station solution that works around grid bottlenecks, with a particular focus on enabling traditional gas stations to incorporate EV charging into their business model.

“Gas stations are built for short dwell times and high turnover. We designed our new service to behave like a pump, not a parking space,” emphasizes ElectricFish CEO and co-founder Anurag Kamal.

ElectricFish first floated across the CleanTechnica radar in March of 2025 with the official launch of its new “350Squared” charging station, for which it claimed a savings of 90% of the cost of grid upgrades needed for conventional fast-charging stations, achieved by eliminating new trenches and other infrastructure expenses. The containerized system can also be picked up and moved with a minimum of complications, if needed.

“ElectricFish’s chief contribution is ‘350Squared,’ a modular, plug-and-play charging station that can deploy existing 200-amp electrical infrastructure to pull double duty as a community microgrid and energy storage facility, providing backup power in case of emergency,” CleanTechnica observed. The ultra-fast charging system includes 400 kilowatt-hours of storage, enabling it to recharge itself slowly while delivering a quick charge to EV drivers in a hurry.

In the latest news from ElectricFish, the company unveiled its new “400Squared” charging station solution at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas earlier this week, providing CleanTechnica with additional details by email (the info is also available here).

Convenience is front and center in ElectricFish’s business model. The idea is to provide EV drivers with a quick, 8–10 minute top-off at any nearby gas station, pumping up to 180 miles of range into their batteries while a revenue-sharing model relieves property owners from upfront installation costs.

“Conventional fast charger installations require utility upgrades that can run north of $150,000 per port and take 12–18+ months to complete,” ElectricFish notes.

“The grid can’t keep pace with EV adoption — and legacy DC fast charging makes the problem worse,” the company adds. “Each new installation adds massive peak demand to already strained infrastructure, deepening the very constraint holding EV infrastructure back. The harder the industry pushes, the more the grid pushes back.”

With the storage element and energy management software, ElectricFish states that it can provide 400-kilowatt charging from a 30-kilowatt grid connection, or even less than 30 kilowatts in some cases. The installation can be completed in 4–6 weeks, a sharp contrast with the 12–18 months typical of conventional fast-charging stations.

“We don’t sell EV chargers or batteries; we sell time and uptime. We’ve decoupled charging speed from grid limits by actively managing when energy flows in or out, so fast charging strengthens the grid instead of destabilizing it,” explains ElectricFish CTO and co-founder Nelio Batista.

More EV Charging Stations For More EVs

The ElectricFish solution has already earned a big thumbs-up from Hyundai, which put the system through its paces at its California Proving Ground in the heat of the summer in 2025. “We see this as a way to unlock fast charging at sites that the grid alone can’t support today,” reported Hyundai Senior Engineer Dean Vivo Amore.

Toyota is also onboard. ElectricFish also notes that the Toyota Mobility Foundation’s Sustainable Cities Challenge was instrumental in its most recent commercial deployment, located at the Eastern Market food and warehouse hub in Detroit.

ElectricFish is just one of among a number of new charging-plus-storage innovators to anticipate that today’s dismal environment for EV sales is a passing blip along the way to a decarbonized future.

Another up-and-comer to watch is the Seattle firm ElectricEra, which is pitching its fast-charging technology to the convenience store market. The company unveiled its new, trademarked “RetailEdge” charging station at the National Association of Convenience Stores in October. The company is focusing attention on sleek styling, by way of encouraging property owners to position their EV chargers front and center rather than hiding them in the back of the lot, while also enabling retailers to squeeze more value from the addition of new charging stations.

“RetailEdge Experiences unlocks the full value of the EV charge kiosk’s premium touchscreen by allowing retailers to configure the screen to deliver loyalty program signups, membership validation, retail media campaigns — and even conduct retail transactions by linking with point-of-sale systems,” ElectricEra explained.

Without the need for significant new electricity infrastructure, ElectricEra reports a 54-day installation timeline for its 400-kilowatt charging stations. To further grease the EV sales wheels, the company is also pitching its “HaloAI” assistant, which can guide drivers through the EV charging process.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-10.33.25-AM.png,N,,2026-01-10 09:59:10.250836

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.
Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.
Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.","General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/bffed1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3159+0+293/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F40%2Fc4%2F98bc022db674e0cbbe52109ebe9e%2F56a05b2cb00c426cb5f12412b46e1cbd,N,,2026-01-10 05:58:28.105170

“Caveat emptor.” Buyer beware. Property managers who hire contractors and maintenance professionals to work on residential properties (and some commercial properties) built before 1978 should heed this warning, given the recent tightening and enforcement of federal regulations regarding lead-based paint.

In January 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency tightened its standards under the “Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule” to protect individuals from hazards posed by lead-based paint, but delayed enforcement of penalties until Jan. 12, 2026, one year after the rule change took effect. Property managers who engage in renovation and repair of residential properties on behalf of the owner and fail to comply with the updated standard could face costly lawsuits, project shutdowns, future insurance denial and fines of up to $40,000 per violation.

“The vast majority of small property managers are not tracking EPA updates, and levied fines can be business-killers,” says Troy Garrett, CEO of the National Association of Residential Property Managers. “The EPA does not communicate with practitioners or investors about rule changes. Without a clear understanding of the rules, non-compliance can drive both small investors and property managers out of the market,” says Garrett.

The RRP Rule also applies to pre-1978 commercial properties where children are routinely present, such as schools, daycare centers and healthcare facilities. Although lead-based paint was banned for consumer use in the U.S. in 1978, it remains in millions of structures.

Lead poisoning cases have significantly declined since the 1970s; however, exposure via old pipes, paint and ceramics is still considered especially dangerous for children under age 5, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Even very low blood lead levels have been shown to reduce a child’s IQ and academic performance.

Significantly Lower Dust-Lead Hazard and Clearance Levels

The rule change lowers the dust-lead hazard standards to “any reportable level” as analyzed by an EPA-recognized laboratory. Additionally, it lowers post-abatement dust-lead clearance levels to between 50% and 75% of the previous levels for floors, window sills and troughs. The most common source of lead exposure in the body is inhaling or ingesting microscopic dust, often associated with property renovations and repairs.

Renovation and repair work that disturbs more than 6 square feet of lead paint (think window replacement, interior remodeling or surface preparation for painting) must be performed by a Lead-Safe Certified firm, with at least one worker on the job site who is Renovator-Certified by the EPA or an EPA-authorized program. The fee for most firms is $300 every five years, equivalent to a cost of $60 per year.

The EPA estimates that renovator-certified training, which is also valid for five years, costs $562 per person trained, including tuition, value of time for the eight hours the renovator is in class, travel and lunch.

The certification requirement applies to property managers who maintain in-house contractors. Firms that outsource renovation, repair and painting are responsible for confirming whether a contractor is Lead-Safe Certified and should ask to see a copy of the EPA training certificate.

NARPM advises its members to contact their state EPA office to understand how officials will enforce the new regulations in their state. “Some offices work to help property managers do the right thing to care for the health and safety of tenants, while others are more aggressive or even predatory in nature about compliance,” says Garrett.

The EPA has authorized 16 states to operate their own training and certification programs. If you manage property in multiple states, you may need to pursue multiple certifications.

Often called “white gold”, lithium is the backbone of electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, smartphones, and even data centers that support blockchain networks. Today, the eyes of America and China are firmly fixed on lithium, and the competition is intensifying.

China currently dominates much of the global lithium supply chain — from mining and refining to battery manufacturing. This dominance gives China a significant advantage in electric vehicles and clean energy technologies. In response, the United States is aggressively pushing to secure alternative lithium sources through domestic mining, strategic partnerships, and investments in South America, Australia, and Africa.

Why does this matter beyond traditional markets? Because energy security is now digital security. Bitcoin mining, AI infrastructure, and Web3 ecosystems all rely on stable energy systems and advanced batteries. As lithium demand grows, its price, supply constraints, and geopolitical control could indirectly influence the cost of energy-intensive technologies, including crypto mining and blockchain infrastructure.

This resource rivalry also opens doors for investors. Companies involved in lithium mining, battery technology, and energy innovation are gaining attention. At the same time, crypto narratives around energy efficiency, green mining, and sustainable blockchains are becoming more relevant than ever.

Lithium is no longer just a commodity — it is a geopolitical weapon, an economic driver, and a technological cornerstone.

If Colorado declines to write a new plan, the EPA could impose one on the state.
“You do not have to shut these down to ensure the people in Colorado have clean air,” he said.
The Trump administration is intent on keeping the state’s coal plants burning through other means.
Ulla Reeves, the National Park Conservation Association’s clean air program director, previously told The Denver Post that the agency is undercutting Colorado’s progress to clean its air.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday determined Colorado cannot order the closure of coal-fired power plants under the Clean Air Act, and, therefore, the agency will deny the state’s plan to reduce the haze that clouds views at Rocky Mountain National Park and other federal lands.

The move is part of the Trump administration’s push to make sure no federal regulations stand in the way of restoring the coal industry and powering the electric grid with the fossil fuel, which pollutes the air with carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, soot and other chemicals that contribute to climate change and harm human health.

Those coal emissions also help create a haze that dims visibility for people experiencing the outdoors, something that is important to Colorado’s economy and state identity. Colorado is required to find ways to reduce that haze under the Clean Air Act. To do so, the state had proposed shuttering coal plants — a move that would also help meet its goal to eliminate almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The EPA signaled in July that it would at least partially deny Colorado’s plan to reduce haze, but on Friday, it kicked the entire strategy back to the state for a rewrite. If Colorado declines to write a new plan, the EPA could impose one on the state.

Cyrus Western, administrator for EPA Region 8, which includes Colorado, said the state cannot shut down coal-fired power plants without consent from the utilities that run them, and, therefore, the mandate does not comply with the Clean Air Act.

Because Colorado Springs Utilities wants to exclude its Ray D. Nixon Power Plant in Fountain from the state’s closure plans, the EPA rejected Colorado’s entire plan, he said.

The plants are vital to supplying reliable and affordable electricity, and Colorado can still meet its requirements to reduce haze while keeping them open, Western said.

“You do not have to shut these down to ensure the people in Colorado have clean air,” he said.

Michael Ogletree, senior director of state air quality programs at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an emailed statement that the EPA’s decision will negatively impact Colorado’s environment and the “majestic national parks and wilderness areas the program was designed to safeguard.”

The state’s Air Pollution Control Division will review the EPA’s decision and consider its next step, he said, noting that the state had not failed to meet its regional haze requirements.

“Regardless of EPA’s decision, Colorado will continue to lead,” Ogletree said. “Coal plant retirement dates remain in state regulation, and many facilities have already closed or are on track to retire voluntarily because cleaner energy is more affordable and makes economic sense for consumers. Colorado has demonstrated that it is possible to protect public health, reduce pollution and maintain a reliable energy system at the same time.”

Environmentalists disagreed with Western’s assessment that Colorado can improve its mountain views while continuing to burn coal.

Jeremy Nichols, a senior advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the EPA is mistaken in its decision because Colorado had submitted a “landmark proposal” that would have benefited the state’s open spaces, air quality and residents who need to breathe clean air.

He said Western “is going to lie through his teeth and deny science.”

“It’s beyond crooked how brazen they are in doing the bidding of the coal industry,” Nichols said. “Obviously, a war has been declared against Colorado by the Trump administration and this is another continuation of it.”

Most utilities in the state have plans in place to retire their coal-burning plants and to transition to cleaner power sources such as solar, wind, batteries and natural gas.

However, Colorado Springs Utilities told the Trump administration in 2025 that it needs to keep the Nixon plant open past its 2029 retirement date because its management is having difficulties finding resources for the transition to renewable energy.

Xcel Energy last year received permission from the state to keep one of its coal-burning plants open longer because it needs to repair another, larger plant that is scheduled to close in 2030.

The EPA will assist Colorado in creating a regional haze plan that fulfills all statutory requirements, the agency said in a news release.

Western said it was Colorado’s business if it wants to mandate coal plant closures through state law, but the federal government would not allow the state to use the Clean Air Act as an option for doing so.

The Trump administration is intent on keeping the state’s coal plants burning through other means.

On Dec. 30, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order to keep an aging coal-fired power plant in Craig operating even though it is broken, out of operation and was scheduled to be retired at the end of 2025. The order left Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association in a bind as it tries to figure out how to comply with the order and restart a broken, 45-year-old plant.

Environmentalists and park conservationists oppose the EPA’s plan to support the coal industry.

Ulla Reeves, the National Park Conservation Association’s clean air program director, previously told The Denver Post that the agency is undercutting Colorado’s progress to clean its air.

“Colorado had one of the strongest plans that we’ve seen in the entire country,” Reeves said. “This is really turning that progress backwards. It’s extremely concerning what the EPA is doing here and undercutting the state’s authority.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Climate_Coal_Town_Transition_91724.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-10 00:58:53.747781

While the Mississippi River Ship Channel has seen plenty wins of late, challenges remain.
“The Big River Coalition remains concerned about these changes to the system and believes that resilient ports depend upon resilient waterways,” Duffy said.
“I embrace the opportunity to represent the ‘With You’ leadership team of Big River Coalition LLC while allowing commerce on the Mississippi River to speak with a unified voice and with a strong navigation accent,” Duffy said.
A newly launched Big River Coalition LLC website is forthcoming.","The Big River Coalition, formed in 2010 as a non-profit trade association under the umbrella of the New Orleans Steamship Association (also known as the Louisiana Maritime Association, or LAMA), has spent the past 15 years promoting the economic and navigational interests of the Mississippi River Ship Channel—and to great effect.

The organization’s founding purpose was to address a funding shortfall at the time in the Corps of Engineers’ budget for maintaining the Mississippi River Ship Channel, which extends from Baton Rouge, La., to the Gulf. Sean Duffy Sr., who began serving as the organization’s executive director in 2011, later helped lead the effort to deepen the Mississippi River Ship Channel from 45 feet to 50 feet. Work to deepen the ship channel got underway in 2020, with the deeper channel certified from the Gulf to above New Orleans just two years later.

The new year ushered in a noteworthy change for the organization, Duffy has announced. Effective January 1, Big River Coalition transitioned to an independent limited liability corporation, with Duffy now serving as president and CEO.

“This was a mutual decision between the leadership of the Louisiana Maritime Association and me,” Duffy said. “For the last 15 years, every success of the Coalition has been made on behalf of and shared with the Louisiana Maritime Association. I have enjoyed the full support of LAMA and Capt. Ron Branch, but in becoming an independent LLC, I simply wanted more accountability for expanding the Big River Coalition’s efforts to promote, advocate and maintain the Mississippi River Ship Channel.”

Duffy’s strength has always been acting as a waterways polyglot, speaking the languages of a diverse set of waterway stakeholders, from shippers and pilots to dredgers, government agencies, engineers, civic groups and port officials.

“In many ways, I serve as a translator between government agencies and the navigation industry to deal with things like dredge restrictions, dredge placement areas, revetment restrictions, etc.,” Duffy said. “I’m a team guy, and I’ve always said that waterways management is a team sport.”

To that end, Duffy said that, under the Big River Coalition LLC banner, he will continue to represent “Team Mississippi River” in conference rooms, emergency operations centers, the halls of Congress and anywhere in between.

While the Mississippi River Ship Channel has seen plenty wins of late, challenges remain. One challenge involves extending the 50-foot channel upriver beyond Mile 180.

“Deepening above Mile 180 will be a challenge due to a number of required pipeline relocations and the need to adjust the U.S. Coast Guard’s aids to navigation in order to accommodate the Corps’ plan to realign the ship channel in certain locations,” Duffy said.

Another challenge that Duffy frequently highlights is “climate variability.” High water seasons, like those between 2018 and 2020, and low water periods, seen each year from 2022 to 2025, present challenges for navigation and the sustainability of the river itself. Duffy frequently has raised an alarm on instability along the east bank of the river below Bohemia, La., comparing that stretch of the river to a “leaky garden hose.” Decreased flow along that stretch promotes siltation and saltwater intrusion, which seasonally threatens fresh-water intakes for communities and industry up to New Orleans. Conversely, high-water periods increase flows through crevasses on the east bank of the river and threaten to further erode the main channel.

“The Big River Coalition remains concerned about these changes to the system and believes that resilient ports depend upon resilient waterways,” Duffy said. “A personal concern is the need for more proactive deltaic riverine management focused, not only on flood control and navigation, but also on protecting the drinking water supply along the Big River from New Orleans to the Gulf of America.”

Regardless of the challenge or opportunity, Duffy said the mission of Big River Coalition LLC remains the same.

“I embrace the opportunity to represent the ‘With You’ leadership team of Big River Coalition LLC while allowing commerce on the Mississippi River to speak with a unified voice and with a strong navigation accent,” Duffy said.

A newly launched Big River Coalition LLC website is forthcoming. In the meantime, people can reach Duffy through his LinkedIn account. Search for “Sean M. Duffy Sr.”

There are steps that governments — and companies — can take to reduce negative data center impacts for residents, which can include increased energy costs and significant water usage.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced Thursday that xAI is locating a data center in Southaven — the latest project in a nationwide trend of data center expansion — and the company is approved for the state’s Data Center Incentive, which provides a sales and use tax exemption on computing and equipment software for eligible data centers. The company, per the announcement, will create hundreds of permanent jobs, retrofit the building that is housing its operations and provide tax revenue for the city of Southaven.

Companies often tout job creation as a benefit of data centers, but some public officials have argued that data center jobs are not always what a community needs, as was the case with a Tucson, Ariz., data center project. The project promised to create 180 jobs, but residents voiced opposition over water and energy concerns.

Tucson Council Member Lane Santa Cruz said during an August City Council study session that construction jobs to support data center builds are temporary, underlining that data centers require “very few” long-term employees. The data center project in question, Project Blue, would not bring the jobs the community needed, she said.

“The jobs that data centers do create locally are typically low-wage, term-limited, non-technical positions such as security, maintenance and janitorial work,” according to research from the University of Michigan.

The decision to approve these data centers are happening largely at the government level, and are sometimes shrouded in secrecy involving non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), giving members of the public little say in if and how these builds will progress.

Job creation claims and community benefits touted vary based on project and location.

When Google announced its $1.7 billion plan to expand three data center sites in Ohio, it promised thousands of jobs. However, while about 1,200 jobs were expected to be created at each facility during construction, it was unclear at the time exactly how many permanent jobs would be created — although one Google official estimated permanent staff would be around 200 employees, as reported by Ohio Capital Journal.

Pennsylvania’s $20 billion investment from Amazon for data centers claimed it would create at least 1,250 jobs — notably, high-paying roles like data center engineers and engineering operations managers. This was in addition to the expected thousands of construction jobs. Officials said Amazon would partner with educational institutions and workforce organizations in the state to create training programs and STEM learning opportunities. In contrast to workforce investment, members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission opposed the proposal, arguing that costs would be shifted to ratepayers.

In Indiana, residents said recently xAI’s data center is impacting people’s health through air quality, and delivering only tens of jobs while receiving tax abatements.

Not all data center projects offer transparency about community benefits, and officials do not always disclose the benefits companies receive. One report found that most states offering incentives to data centers do not disclose which companies benefit. For example, the research found that Virginia forgoes nearly $1 billion in state and local sales and use tax revenue annually without public disclosure as to which companies are receiving these benefits.

GOVERNMENT CAN PUSH INDUSTRY TO DELIVER

Policymakers can take steps to protect communities, as a December report from Public Citizen outlined. These can include prohibiting NDAs and requiring a commitment to local hiring and apprenticeship programs. Officials can also require companies to deliver on minimum operational commitments, strict water conservation measures and renewable energy procurement.

Another strategy to ensure companies are benefiting the places where data centers are built is community benefits agreements. These contracts allow for data center expansion in ways that meet community-specific needs, as Brookings Center for Technology Innovation Director Nicol Turner Lee explained during a November panel discussion.

One example of such an agreement occurred in Lancaster, Penn. This pact committed the projects in question — multiple data center campus builds — to a water-use cap, and noise and air emissions controls. The developers also pledged to contribute $20 million to benefit the community; half will go toward economic development and half to sustainable development.

San Jose announced an agreement with PG&E in July to support the energy demands of new data center projects. City leaders were looking for a commitment of energy and infrastructure improvements; if their delivery timeline is not met, the city is able to step away from the agreement. While data centers in the city are not required to work with San Jose Clean Energy — which provides mainly carbon-free energy — many of them are, according to San Jose’s Deputy City Manager Manuel Pineda.

“We have been very upfront … with everything we’re trying to do with PG&E, with data center projects, and with all our communication — putting it out there so everybody knows what we’re doing and why we’re doing it,” Pineda said in November, noting that having data centers nearby supports the city’s innovation.

At the state level, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has introduced legislation to protect consumers from the costs of AI data centers, and plans to see it advance despite an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in December attempting to limit states’ regulatory authority on AI.

At the federal level, some legislators have proposed a national AI data center moratorium be enacted until consumer and environmental protections are addressed.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have be shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Nessel announced Friday that her office filed a petition for rehearing with the Michigan Public Service Commission over its Dec. 18 decision to conditionally approve two special contracts sought by DTE Energy to serve a proposed 1.4-gigawatt hyperscale artificial intelligence data center in Saline Township.

The project, tied to Oracle, OpenAI, and developer Related Digital, would be among the largest data centers in the country and is expected to consume as much electricity as nearly one million homes. Its scale has caused concerns among residents, environmental advocates, and consumer watchdogs about long-term impacts on electric rates, grid reliability, and the environment.

Nessel’s move also pits her against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a fellow Democrat who has publicly backed the data center as “the largest economic project in Michigan history.” Whitmer celebrated the project when it was announced last fall, citing thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of permanent positions.

On Thursday, U.S. Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive Democrat, released what he called “terms of engagement” aimed at protecting communities from higher utility bills, grid strain, and environmental harm tied to data centers.

At least 15 data center projects have been proposed across the state in the past year.

The split among Democrats is part of a broader debate over whether Michigan should keep fast-tracking energy-hungry data center projects tied to the AI boom.

In her petition, Nessel challenges the commission’s authority to approve the contracts behind closed doors without holding a contested case hearing that would allow discovery, sworn testimony, and full public review. She also questions whether the conditions imposed by the commission are meaningful or enforceable.

In a statement Friday, the Michigan Public Service Commission said it “looks forward to considering Nessel’s petition for rehearing,” but the commission “unequivocally rejects any claim that these contracts were inadequately reviewed.”

The commission said its professional staff, advisory staff, and commissioners were provided with unredacted versions of the special contracts and reviewed them thoroughly to ensure existing customers are protected. The commission said its order recognizes DTE’s legal obligation to serve the data center while imposing what it described as the strongest consumer protections for a data center power contract in the country.

The attorney general is seeking clarification on how those conditions would protect ratepayers, noting that many appear to rely on repeated assurances from DTE, rather than concrete commitments backed by evidence. Nessel also objected to the commission allowing DTE to serve as the project’s financial backstop, rather than requiring the data center operator to provide sufficient collateral to cover potential risks.

“I remain extremely disappointed with the Commission’s decision to fast-track DTE’s secret data center contracts without holding a contested case hearing,” Nessel said in a statement. “This was an irresponsible approach that cut corners and shut out the public and their advocates. Granting approval of these contracts ex parte serves only the interests of DTE and the billion-dollar businesses involved, like Oracle, OpenAI, and Related Companies, not the Michigan public the Commission is meant to protect. ”

She said the commission’s approval process served the interests of DTE and the companies behind the project rather than Michigan residents.

“The Commission imposed some conditions on DTE to supposedly hold ratepayers harmless, but these conditions and how they’ll be enforced remain unclear,” Nessel said. “As Michigan’s chief consumer advocate, it is my responsibility to ensure utility customers in this state are adequately protected, especially on a project so massive, so expensive, and so unprecedented.”

Large portions of the contracts remain heavily redacted, preventing outside parties from verifying DTE’s claims that serving the data center will not raise rates for existing customers. Nessel said a contested case is necessary to review the full contracts, assess affordability claims, and confirm that protections, such as collateral requirements and exit fees are in place.

The commission ordered DTE to formally accept its conditions within 30 days of its Dec. 18 order. Nessel said that timeline complicates decisions about whether further legal challenges are necessary, prompting her office to file the rehearing petition in part to preserve its arguments.

The power contracts are one piece of a larger controversy surrounding the Saline Township project referred to as “Project Stargate.” Residents and environmental groups have raised alarms about wetlands destruction, water contamination risks, and the permanent transformation of a rural farming community.

More than 5,000 public comments opposing the data center power deal were submitted to the commission ahead of its December vote. Critics argue the rush to approve the contracts is part of a broader pattern as deep-pocketed utilities and developers seek to capitalize on the AI boom, which is driving a nationwide surge in electricity demand from large-scale data centers.

“As my office continues to review all potential options to defend energy customers in our state, we must demand further clarity on what protections the Commission has put in place and continue to demand a full contested case concerning these still-secret contracts,” Nessel said.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet.
“We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium.
He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.

Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.","CHICAGO — Amid warnings of impending energy shortages, Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday signed a wide-ranging energy reform package into law aimed at bolstering the state’s power grids after years of negotiations.

Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — will fund battery storage, grant greater authority to state utility regulators, create new options for “virtual power plants” and lift a longtime ban on new large-scale nuclear power plants.

“We’re making it easier to develop renewable energy,” bill sponsor Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet. “We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium. That’s all going to bring more supply onto the grid, and that will help hold the line on our electrical bills.”

The Illinois Power Agency, an independent body responsible for planning and procuring cost-effective energy for Illinoisians, found that the law will save utility customers in the state $13.4 billion over the next two decades. But opponents question those projections, pointing to increased subsidies for battery storage that will eventually be reflected via a new charge on consumers’ bills beginning in 2030.

The bill signing took place less than a month after state regulators projected energy shortfalls would likely drive up costs in the next three to five years and force Illinois to import more power from out of state absent action from lawmakers and grid operators.

Shortfalls, Pritzker said, would be exacerbated by actions at the national level, including the Trump administration’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phased out renewable energy tax credits and froze federal funding for energy projects. He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.

“All of that raises prices in the short term, while threatening our long-term ability to meet growing electricity demand,” Pritzker said.

CRGA, he said, will allow Illinois to forge its own path.

What’s in the law?

At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects. It will result in new charges to ratepayers, though supporters of the bill say that those costs would be offset by cost savings from greater energy efficiency, storage and planning.

The law grants new authority to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state body responsible for regulating utilities. The ICC will now have the power to set long-term plans for managing energy supply and demand in the state through approval of an integrated resource plan.

It additionally adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at electric and natural gas utilities and places new air regulations on backup generators used by data centers.

It also secures new labor protections by closing a loophole for community solar projects that has allowed some developers to avoid hiring union labor, a major priority for organized labor groups involved in negotiating the bill.

CRGA also lifts a longstanding ban on constructing new large-scale nuclear power plants, while at the same time increasing fees for nuclear plant operators. It outlines new programs for geothermal and thermal energy network projects, using naturally occurring heat from underground and transferring it via water-filled pipes to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel heating.

The law also creates new “virtual power plant,” or VPP, programs. That’s not virtual as in occurring via the internet or virtual reality, but rather as a program that allows homes and businesses with solar panels or wind turbines to pool energy together, acting “virtually” like a power plant despite not physically existing as one.

The idea is that the energy stored in residential and business batteries can be contributed to the electrical grid when the state’s primary electric delivery companies, like ComEd and Ameren Illinois, face high supply prices during peak hours of use, especially during the summer.

Homes and businesses who contribute energy to the grid via VPPs will be paid for their energy. The law also mandates that electric utilities offer optional “time-of-use” pricing, allowing customers to save money by using less energy during periods of high demand.

ComEd already offers time-of-use pricing, as approved in an ICC ruling in January 2025, but CRGA enshrines the requirement for both Ameren and ComEd into law.

Path to passage

The legislation passed during the legislature’s veto session in late October with support from environmental, labor and utility oversight advocates. Business groups and Republicans criticized the bill for its reliance on a new ratepayer charge to fund new battery storage and for yielding what they said was too much power to the ICC.

“Senate Bill 25 is a guaranteed rate increase that does nothing to increase energy production,” Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.

Rep. Norine Hammond, R-Macomb, also denounced energy sources like wind and solar as unreliable in a statement, saying that the state “should focus on preserving reliable energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power that actually work when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.”

Supporters, though, say that ratepayer charges will be offset with savings from increased energy supply and grid reliability. They argue the investment in battery systems allows the state to store extra energy generated on bright sunny days or windy days and deploy it at night and when other energy supply is low.

Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of Citizens Utility Board and champion of the bill, said CRJA was the state’s response to market signals sent by regional grid operators.

“To me, CRGA is really about us here in Illinois, together as a state, deploying the tools we have here at our disposal to defend the promise of clean and affordable power for Illinois,” Moskowitz said.

Organized labor advocates also supported the bill, which is expected to generate up to 100,000 jobs according to statements from multiple House Democrats. AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Pat Devaney and LiveWire Construction CEO Shon Harris joined Pritzker on stage at the signing ceremony.

“By expanding access to pre-apprentice programs, lowering thresholds for project labor agreements, ensuring that wind, solar and thermal energy projects are built by skilled Illinois workers, this bill clearly says the future of clean energy in Illinois will be union built,” Devaney said.

The bill prioritizes grants to historically underserved contractors and projects in communities that would most benefit from investments to combat discrimination. Harris said that legislation keeps the doors open for businesses like his.

“CRGA ensures equity remains a part of Illinois’ clean energy future,” Harris said. “That means that companies like mine can keep building projects, training workers and creating good-paying jobs all across Illinois.”

The Trump administration has been moving to strengthen the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain.
Conventional nuclear fuel Immediate growth in nuclear power production – like last year’s announcement of restarting a Three Mile Island Nuclear Generation Station reactor – depends on the deeply international supply chain for nuclear fuel.
One ton of Gen IV nuclear fuel is estimated to require almost 40 tons of mined uranium, compared to less than 10 tons for conventional nuclear fuel.
Broadly, the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Roundtable highlighted the need to reduce technological, economic, and policy uncertainty throughout the nuclear fuel supply chain to stimulate growth.","The vision of a U.S. nuclear power renaissance has a blind spot – uranium fuel – in the near term and long, according to a Stanford University-led industry meeting.

AI data centers, reshoring of manufacturing, and the electrification of transportation, buildings and other sectors have heightened demand for affordable, reliable power around the clock. Nuclear energy could check those boxes, its proponents say, but supplies of enriched uranium for existing power plants are tight, vulnerable to geopolitics, and getting more expensive. New fuel forms for advanced reactors, meanwhile, offer promise, but scaling them affordably and in parallel with conventional fuel systems could squeeze conventional fuel markets even more.

Over 100 leaders across the nuclear fuel sector, utility executives, government regulators, and reactor designers and developers gathered in July in Arlington, Virginia, to examine these barriers and identify possible ways to overcome them. The Nuclear Fuel Cycle Roundtable was organized by STEER, an initiative of Stanford University’s Precourt Institute for Energy and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Congressman Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), chair of the House Energy & Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, opened the discussion with a keynote address.

On Dec. 29, Nature Energy published a summary of the insights that emerged from the meeting. The Trump administration has been moving to strengthen the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain. On Jan. 5, the U.S. Department of Energy announced $2.7 billion in contracts to three domestic fuel enrichment companies for conventional reactors and next-generation reactors now in development.

“As in any hard-tech sector, investment enthusiasm can often be driven by exuberance,” said the founder and team lead of STEER, Adrian Yao, who spearheaded the roundtable. “We sought to focus on the fuel supply chain while much of recent private investment activity has been focused on current- and next-generation reactors amid this new nuclear groundswell. Specifically, our objective is to identify ‘what must be true’ for the fuel supply chain to support the growing demand.”

STEER, which is funded in part by the U.S. Department of Energy, analyzes emerging energy technologies from supply chains to deployment roadmaps in order to inform what to build, where to innovate, and how to invest. The Precourt Institute is part of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability.

Conventional nuclear fuel

Immediate growth in nuclear power production – like last year’s announcement of restarting a Three Mile Island Nuclear Generation Station reactor – depends on the deeply international supply chain for nuclear fuel. That chain has four links:

mining and refining the uranium;

converting it to a gas form;

enriching the gas to increase the fissile U-235;

and fabricating uranium pellets and fuel rods for shipment to nuclear power plants.

The industry discussion stressed that several links in this chain are at risk. Four countries dominate mining: Kazakhstan, Namibia, Australia, and Canada. The United States mines very little uranium, due to lower-grade ore and higher costs. While most meeting participants did not express strong concerns about mining due to friendly partners, some stressed the importance of rebuilding U.S. domestic mining, highlighting uranium as a critical mineral. Also, the largest producer – Kazakhstan – continues to seek strategic autonomy from its interdependence on Russia and, increasingly, China. This may be viewed as an opportunity for the United States.

Only five facilities worldwide convert mined uranium on a large scale into the gas needed for enrichment. This step may pose one of the most critical pinch-points in the supply chain. Markets for these services have been turbulent in recent years, with price dips and spikes forcing western plants into shutdown and restart cycles. Stockpiles of converted uranium gas are shrinking. Without big, long-term contracts, conversion company executives at the July roundtable expressed hesitation to expand capacity.

Uranium buyers, meanwhile, are reluctant to pen long-term agreements inflated by today’s high prices. Even when buyers are prepared to sign, the incremental demand is significantly less than the stepwise supply added by capacity expansions. To break this deadlock, several meeting participants suggested that U.S. federal and state governments could act as customers of last resort for new facilities.

“This could provide the payment certainty required for investment in new conversion capacity,” said Yao, PhD ’25.

Enrichment, the third stage of the nuclear fuel supply chain, remains heavily concentrated: Nearly half of global capacity is in Russia, with only two major commercial enrichers operating in the United States and western Europe. This poses a strategic challenge for the United States, which relies on Russia for nearly 30% of its enriched uranium supply. In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Congress passed legislation in 2024 to ban enriched uranium imports from Russia. Several European countries are also working to reduce their dependence on Russian fuel.

The United States is self-sufficient only in the final fourth step of the conventional fuel supply chain: making ceramic pellets from enriched uranium and producing fuel rod assemblies. Meeting attendees generally agreed, however, that for national and economic security the United States should develop capacity across the entire supply chain for conventional reactors.

The U.S. ban on enriched uranium from Russia sparked some interest in investment to do just this, but the investments stalled due to concerns about the ban’s effectiveness and durability. For example, waivers can be granted if alternatives to Russian supplies are insufficient, and Russia may be able to circumvent the ban via other countries.

“Many participants suggested that China could circumvent the ban by ‘flag swapping’ Russian uranium in U.S. markets,” said Bennett Johnson, MBA ’24/MS ’25, a co-author of the report and STEER’s strategic partnerships lead. “Other participants questioned how long the political support for the ban would last. Investors want some certainty that it would last at least 10 years.”

Next-generation reactors

The meeting turned its attention to next-generation fission reactors now mostly in development, generally known as “Gen IV.” Fuel for these new generators will need a much higher degree of enrichment. One ton of Gen IV nuclear fuel is estimated to require almost 40 tons of mined uranium, compared to less than 10 tons for conventional nuclear fuel. Those higher degrees of enrichment translate into fuel that generates electricity for a longer time, so the impact on mined uranium is less severe than four to one. Still, fuel suppliers at the roundtable said that without significant additional mining, conversion, and enrichment capacity, next-generation reactors could further stress uranium supplies for the existing nuclear fleet, already burdened with high fuel costs.

Reactor designers and fuel manufacturers working on next-generation advanced reactors noted that the complexity and limited commercial experience with new fuel forms could lead to low fabrication yields and high costs.

Access to test reactors, critical for validating fuel performance and refining manufacturing specifications, is limited, the designers and fuel manufacturers emphasized. Today the only operating Gen IV reactor is in China. Standardization of chemistries and fuel specifications, particularly through coordination between reactor designers and fuel fabricators, was proposed to accelerate the fuel manufacturing learning curve.

Broadly, the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Roundtable highlighted the need to reduce technological, economic, and policy uncertainty throughout the nuclear fuel supply chain to stimulate growth. Primary avenues for doing so potentially include strategic global partnerships and coordination of fuel standards; additional clarity on enforcement of geopolitical policy actions, like the ban on uranium from Russia; R&D to support efficient and low-cost manufacturing of nuclear fuels for advanced reactors; and independent and timely analysis.",https://energy.stanford.edu/sites/energy/files/styles/large/public/media/image/fleischmann_steer_nuclear_fuel_960x640_1.jpg?itok=xg1j0BQP,N,,2026-01-09 23:13:25.373838

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world’s largest EV automaker, replaced by China’s BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.

Build SHIIT Now: New Report Finds $149 Billion, 24 GW Worth of Economic and Energy Capacity Trapped in WA Clean Energy Pipeline

580,000 Jobs and $60 Billion in Untapped Labor Income Also At Risk

Top WA Regulatory Leaders to Discuss Today at Future of Carbon Policy Forum in Seattle

January 8, 2026 (Seattle, WA) – Clean & Prosperous and Greenline Insights today released the Build Sustainable High Impact Infrastructure Together (Build SHIIT) report detailing the vast scale of economic, energy, and workforce capacity trapped in Washington’s clean energy pipeline. The analysis evaluated more than 250 individual clean energy projects and found billions of dollars in economic activity and hundreds of thousands of jobs that could be lost due to permitting, siting, and interconnection delays.

Washington state law requires limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 45% below 1990 levels by 2030. Additionally, no single utility can generate more than 20% of its power from methane gas power plants by 2030. At the same time, Net-Zero Northwest is predicting Washington’s electricity demand to grow by 77% by 2045 due to increased load.

Against this backdrop, a landmark May 2025 report from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica found that Washington state is 50th in the country in renewable growth, experiencing -3% growth between the decades of 2005-2014 and 2015-2024. The reporting found that the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) approved just 0.2% of large renewable energy projects seeking connection since 2015, compared with 28% in Texas.

Other climate-ambitious states have outpaced Washington in renewable energy growth over the past decade, including New Mexico (ranked 3rd nationally), Illinois (9th), Colorado (13th), Minnesota (19th), and California (30th), which continues to add large volumes of renewable capacity and ranks second nationally in total renewable electricity generation.

From the Build SHIIT report: “Washington state has established some of the most ambitious pollution reduction goals in the country…However, Washington’s glacial rate of clean energy development has not matched the state’s ambitions. This reality places Washington’s emissions reduction goals at significant risk of failure and keeps massive economic and employment opportunities out of reach. Falling short in Washington will tarnish its national – and international – reputation while discouraging the adoption of ambitious climate policies by other subnational entities.”

The Build SHIIT report identifies 258 clean energy and industrial projects spanning renewable power, grid-scale storage, manufacturing facilities, and industrial modernization opportunities that could reasonably move forward over the next decade if development processes improve. These projects represent a substantial buildout pipeline and a large set of investments ready to advance if development pathways become more efficient and predictable.

The Build SHIIT report finds that the existing clean energy pipeline contains:

24 gigawatts (GW) of new electricity generating capacity

13 GW of new storage capacity

$149 billion in new statewide economic output

$95 billion increase in state GDP

More than 580,000 jobs (defined as job-years) created

Over $60 billion in labor income earned across Washington households

Twenty-four GW of new clean generation could provide enough electricity to power approximately 7 million homes each year. The 13 GW of storage could power roughly 11 million homes for a four-hour period during peak demand.

The analysis shows that economic and job growth is spread throughout Washington, with the construction industry experiencing the most gains in employment, and Southeast and Central Washington experiencing the biggest increase in economic growth.

Alongside the report, Clean & Prosperous has released the Build SHIIT map, which maps all 258 projects featured in the study and allows the user to understand the scale of economic activity, energy capacity, and job growth at risk down to the regional level. View the Build SHIIT map here.

The Build SHIIT report and map provide a material sense of what is at stake should Washington’s business-as-usual clean energy development process continue. To continue this work, Clean & Prosperous is developing a Build SHIIT coalition to support and advance clean energy projects across the Pacific Northwest. If you are interested in joining the coalition, please reach out to info@cleanandprosperous.org.

Statements from Build SHIIT partners:

“Combating climate change and cleaning up our air requires one thing above all else: We must transition off of polluting and expensive fossil fuels. To do that, we need to build more clean energy facilities and we must do it much faster. Our goal with this report is to make clear the urgent stakes of continued delay, and to kickstart action across legislators, regulators, investors, and the broader community,” said Michael Mann, Executive Director, Clean & Prosperous.

“Electricity demand is rising fast, and meeting it sustainably requires building clean power and grid infrastructure at a much faster pace. The good news is that Washington already has hundreds of clean energy and manufacturing projects in the pipeline. Advancing them would unlock tens of gigawatts of new capacity, more than 580,000 jobs, and an estimated $149 billion boost to the state’s economy. It’s a clear win for both the economy and the clean energy transition, but only if stakeholders can move these projects from the pipeline into the ground,” said Ashna Aggarwal, Director of Analysis, Greenline Insights.

“The future of our economy depends on clean energy—it’s a proven job creator and an affordability solution. In Washington, we’ve already shown that we can reduce carbon pollution while growing our economy. It’s time to take that to the next level,” said Casey Sixkiller, Director, Washington State Department of Ecology.

“Washington has long been the undisputed leader in climate initiatives, and it is not the time for us to fall behind. We are committed to reclaiming our leadership position and setting an even higher standard in renewable energy growth. Our economy and environment depend on our fast and bold leadership,” said Joe Nguyen, Director, Washington State Department of Commerce.

“Washington has some of the strongest labor standards in the country and a workforce ready to build and operate our clean energy future but right now, those jobs are being left on the table. When we fail to permit and build the infrastructure required for clean power, transmission, and manufacturing, we’re not just delaying climate progress, we’re forfeiting thousands of family-wage, union jobs and billions in economic activity. Washington’s inaction is costing working people real opportunities and putting our reputation as a climate leader at risk. Climate leadership means building things—and if we can’t build, we can’t lead,” said Cassie Bordelon, Executive Director, Climate Jobs Washington.

“Washington is a clear leader with some of the most innovative climate and clean energy policies in the country, but we woefully lag in our business-as-usual approach to permitting, siting, and connecting clean energy projects to the grid. We need an all hands on deck approach from legislators, regulators, investors, and the broader community to build and connect more clean energy now,” said James Hove, Washington State Director, Climate Solutions.

“Washington state is an innovation powerhouse. With investments in transmission infrastructure, it can lead in clean energy manufacturing and great jobs, too,” said Chris Dougher, VP, Operations, Sila.

“At Energy Northwest, we are committed to providing safe, reliable, cost-effective and responsible power. Delivering innovative, carbon-free energy technologies is core to what we do, and we support efforts to scale and accelerate clean energy development across Washington state. Collaborative action is essential to turn plans into progress to ensure our state meets its clean energy goals,” said Greg Cullen, Vice President, Energy Services and Development, Energy Northwest.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to extend the ​life of aging coal-fired power plants to continue to provide baseload power to meet the growing demand ‍for electricity from the buildout ​of data centers to power artificial intelligence.

KEY ​QUOTE

“Reliable baseload energy sources are essential to Powering the Great American Comeback and ‍ensuring families have cost-effective energy,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

CONTEXT

The administration last year issued five emergency orders to keep retiring coal plants running, most recently on December 30 when Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an order ‍to keep a coal plant in Craig, Colorado, operating even though it was set to retire at the end of ‍2025.

The plan would allocate $200 million in one-time special funds for a new point-of-sale incentive program for light-duty zero-emissions vehicles.
Last year, Trump ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
In September, his administration also let lapse federal authorization for California’s Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which allowed solo EV drivers to use carpool lanes.
That is exactly why California needs climate investments that are stable and ongoing,” said Sierra Club director Miguel Miguel.","Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday doubled down on California’s commitment to electric vehicles with proposed rebates intended to backfill federal tax credits canceled by the Trump administration.

The plan would allocate $200 million in one-time special funds for a new point-of-sale incentive program for light-duty zero-emissions vehicles. It was part of a sweeping $348.9-billion state budget proposal released Friday, which also included items to address air pollution and worsening wildfires, amid a projected $3-billion state deficit.

EVs have become a flashpoint in California’s battle against the Trump administration, which moved last year to repeal the state’s long-held authority to set strict tailpipe emission standards and eventually ban the sale of new gas powered cars.

Last year, Trump ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV customers that were part of President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In September, his administration also let lapse federal authorization for California’s Clean Air Vehicle decal program, which allowed solo EV drivers to use carpool lanes.

“Despite federal interference, the governor maintains his commitment to protecting public health and achieving California’s world leading climate agenda,” Lindsay Buckley, spokesperson for the California Air Resources Board, said in an email. “This incentive program will help continue the state’s ZEV momentum, especially with the federal administration eliminating the federal EV tax credit and carpool lane access.”

Newsom had previously flip-flopped on this idea, first vowing to restore a state program that provided up to $7,500 to buy clean cars and then walking it back in September. That same month, a group of five automakers including Honda, Rivian, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Audi wrote a letter urging Newsom and state legislators to establish a $5,000 EV tax rebate to replace the lost federal incentives, Politico reported.

During his State of the State speech Thursday — one year after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles — Newsom said California “refuse[s] to be bystanders” while China and other nations take the lead on electric vehicles and the clean energy transition. He touted the state’s investments in solar, hydrogen, wind and nuclear power, as well as its recent move away from the use of any coal-fired power.

“We must continue our prudent fiscal management, funding our reserves, and continuing the investments Californians rely on, from education to public safety, all while preparing for Trump’s volatility outside our control,” the governor said in a statement. “This is what responsible governance looks like.”

Several environmental groups had been urging Newsom to invest more in clean air and clean vehicle programs, which they say are critical to the state’s ambitious goals for human health and the environment. Transportation is the largest source of climate and air pollution in California and is responsible for more than a third of global warming emissions, said Daniel Barad, Western states policy manager with the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.

“As federal attacks threaten California’s authority to protect public health, incentives are more essential than ever to scale up clean cars and trucks,” Barad said. “The governor and legislative leaders must act now to fully fund zero-emission transportation and pursue new revenue to grow and sustain climate investments.”

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California senior director with the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, called it “an essential step to save money for Californians, cut harmful pollution, spur innovation, and support the global competitiveness of our auto industry.”

While the budget proposal does not include significant new spending proposals, it contains other line items relating to climate and the environment. Among them are plans to continue implementing Proposition 4, the $10 billion climate bond approved by voters in 2024 for programs geared toward wildfire resilience, safe drinking water, flood management, extreme heat mitigation and other similar efforts.

Among $2.1 billion in climate bond investments proposed this year are $58 million for wildfire prevention and hazardous fuels reduction projects in vulnerable communities, and nearly $20 million to assist homeowners with defensible space to prevent fire. Water-related investments include $232 million for flood control projects and nearly $70 million to support repairs to existing or new water conveyance projects.

The proposal also lays out how to spend money from California’s signature cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions and allows large polluters to buy and sell unused emission allowances at quarterly auctions. State lawmakers last year voted to extend the program through 2045 and rename it cap-and-invest.

The spending plan includes a new tiered structure for cap-and-invest that first funds statutory obligations such as manufacturing tax exemptions, followed by $1 billion for the high speed rail project, $750 million to support the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and finally secondary program funding such as affordable housing and low-carbon transit options.

But while some groups applauded the budget’s broad handling of climate issues, others criticized it for leaning too heavily on volatile funding sources for environmental priorities, such as special funds and one-time allocations.

The Sierra Club called the EV incentive program a crucial investment but said too many other items were left with “patchwork strategies that make long-term planning harder.”

“Just yesterday, the Governor acknowledged in his State of the State address that the climate risk is a financial risk. That is exactly why California needs climate investments that are stable and ongoing,” said Sierra Club director Miguel Miguel.

California Environmental Voters, meanwhile, stressed that the state should continue to work toward legislation that would hold oil and gas companies liable for damages caused by their emissions — a plan known as “Make Polluters Pay” that stalled last year amid fierce lobbying and industry pressure.

“Instead of asking families to absorb the costs, the Legislature must look seriously at holding polluters accountable for the harm they’ve caused,” said Shannon Olivieri Hovis, California Environmental Voters’ chief strategy officer.

Sarah Swig, Newsom’s senior advisor for climate, noted that the state’s budget plan came just days after Trump withdrew the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a major global treaty signed by nearly 200 countries with the aim of addressing global warming through coordinated international action.

“California is not slowing down on climate at a time when we continue to see attack after attack from the federal government, including as recently as this week with the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the UNFCCC,” Swig told reporters Friday. “California’s leadership has never mattered more.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75739dd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4301+0+582/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2Faa%2F251634a546449758d1a5e8fb650d%2F1537269-me-0108-tesla-gem-005.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 19:59:47.395265

WHEATFIELD — Barb Deardorff was looking forward to the day when she wouldn’t see the giant smokestacks — or the pollution pouring out of them — looming in the distance near her rural Jasper County home.

The 49-year-old organizer for the Indiana teachers’ union has lived 2 miles away from NIPSCO’s coal-fired Schahfer Generating Station her entire life.

Some days, the smoke from the towers turned the sky into a yellowish-brown mirror, Deardorff described. Water from the well on her property has tested high for arsenic and lead.

When the utility in 2018 announced it would shutter the coal units, Deardorff was elated. The last two were set to close at the end of 2025, bringing an end to the Schahfer facility that was named one of the nation’s worst super polluters in 2016.

“I couldn’t believe it was finally happening and we don’t have to worry about their pollution anymore,” she said.

That excitement disappeared Dec. 26 when the U.S. Department of Energy issued an emergency order requiring NIPSCO to take all the necessary steps to keep the coal units operating for 90 days.

The same mandate was sent to CenterPoint Energy’s F.B. Culley Generating Station in Warrick County, where one of the coal units was to be retired at the end of 2025.

Deardorff was stunned. “I was really disappointed when I heard about the Trump administration’s order,” she said. “I think this is all just a political football.”

MOUNTING LEGAL CHALLENGES

Indiana wasn’t the first state to receive an order to keep a coal plant open. The Trump administration this year has demanded facilities in Washington, Michigan and Colorado remain operating despite years of planning to close them.

The administration argues it has the authority to require plants to remain open under the Federal Power Act, which allows the Department of Energy to issue electricitygeneration orders during wartime or an energy emergency.

The agency claims the soaring demand for more electricity coupled with the closure of coal plants will create an energy deficit that equates to a national emergency. The coal plants must stay open to maintain the reliability of the electric grid, according to the orders.

But consumer advocates say that argument has a major f law: There is no energy emergency.

In November, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. reported the grid operator for Indiana and surrounding states had “normal risk” for the winter season.

The move to keep the coalburning plants running represents an “unprecedented power grab” by the federal government to commandeer the state’s right to make energy decisions, according to Ben Inskeep, program director for Citizens Action Coalition, an Indiana c o n sume r advocacy group.

“These illegal orders are pushing the really dirty, really expensive forms of energy that are raising our bills and directly harming people living with the massive pollution from these facilities,” he said.

Environmental groups are asking a federal judge to reverse similar emergency orders issued in Michigan by the Trump administration. The Michigan attorney general is also suing the Department of Energy.

The decisions in those cases could directly impact the mandates keeping Indiana’s two coal plants open.

At the same time, Indiana advocacy groups have jointly threatened to sue NIPSCO if the utility tries to pass on to ratepayers the cost of keeping the coal units operating.

“We will not let NIPSCO simply add unneeded, unlawful and very high costs to peoples’ electricity bills without a fight,” said Sameer Doshi, an attorney with Earthjustice, which is representing the Indiana groups.

‘A HEAD SCRATCHER’

Trump isn’t the first president to use the Federal Power Act to issue orders allowing for more energy production, but he’s the first to use it so often and so forcefully.

From 1977 to 2024, the act was used 19 times by the energy department, according to the lawsuit filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. Last year, under the Biden administration, it was used once to help alleviate potential energy shortages following Hurricane Milton in Florida.

Just last year, the Trump administration used the act 16 times.

Historically, orders have been directed exclusively to address short-term emergencies like natural disasters and extreme weather, according to the lawsuit. They are almost always requested by power grid operators or utility companies to mitigate short-term energy disruptions, notes the suit.

But Trump’s order to keep coal plants open past their scheduled retirement date marks a sharp — and illegal — departure from how the act was intended to be used, Nessel argues in the lawsuit.

Rather than address emergencies, the orders attempt to dictate energy policy to favor coal over renewable energy “under the guise of grid reliability concerns,” she argued.

The fact the orders keep Indiana’s coal plants open for only an addit ional 90 days also under cut s the Trump a dmi n i s t r a t i o n ’ s claims that the facilities are needed as a longterm energy solution, explained Janet McCabe, the former deputy administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden.

Even more telling are the administration’s orders to stop clean-energy projects that are nearly operational and cutting nearly $8 billion in funding for wind and solar projects, all of which could quickly add significant amounts of power to the grid, argued McCabe, now a visiting professor at Indiana University.

“It’s kind of a headscratcher about these orders for coal plants while renewable projects, especially wind, are not being supported by the current administration,” she said. “To the extent that the country needs more power on the grid, we should be supporting all kinds of energy projects.”

A COSTLY PROPOSITION

The illegal orders will force utility companies to spend millions of dollars to keep them running, according to Inskeep with the Citizens Action Coalition.

At NIPSCO’s Schahfer Generating Station, one of the coal units that must continue to operate has a broken turbine blade and had been under a “forced outage” since the summer.

NIPSCO President Vincent Parisi told the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission this year the unit would need to be rebuilt and could take as much as six months to fix.

Inskeep said the cost of the rebuild and repairs would be “substantial.” At the Michigan coal plant, the utility reported it cost $80 million to operate the facility past its planned retirement date of Sept. 30, averaging more than $615,000 per day.

That’s why the Citizen Action Coalition joined three other Indiana environmental groups to send a letter reminding NIPSCO it wasn’t required to follow an illegal order from the Trump administration, Inskeep explained.

The groups also told NIPSCO they would sue for the “recovery of any imprudently incurred expenditures” made to keep the coal unit operating.

NIPSCO acknowledged in an email to the EPA that it would require “significant capital investment” to keep the coal units running past the end of last year. That cost could only be justified if the units were allowed to remain open for at least three years, wrote Fred Gomos, senior director of environmental policy with NiSource, the utility’s parent company.

NIPSCO administrators wrote in an emailed statement that it would comply with Trump’s order and any subsequent orders, but its “long-term plan to transition to a more sustainable energy future remains unchanged.”

That’s little comfort for Deardorff, who lives near the power plant. While the Trump administration issues orders to win political points with the coal industry, residents like her, she said, will continue to suffer from air and water pollution created by the facility.

“I haven’t seen the Trump administration show any concern about our health,” Deardorff said. “This is really just trying to take the United States back to the 1950s when Trump thinks we were at our apex.”

State Budget Director Chad Ranney told the Indiana Capital Chronicle the contingency fund that covers salary adjustments was reduced by 90%.
There is a mechanism in state law to return surplus money to state taxpayers.","Indiana lawmakers got an early Christmas surprise back in December — a newly projected tax revenue boost. But that money puts them in a bit of a bind.

Do they let the state surplus rise to $5 billion by the middle of 2027 while also cutting state agency budgets, laying off workers and slashing social service assistance for poor Hoosiers?

It appears so.

“Though the state’s revenue forecast has improved compared to April 2025, it’s not responsible to spend money that hasn’t yet materialized. Senate Republicans will hold the line on major spending proposals, as budget decisions should be made during budget sessions,” the caucus said in a Wednesday news release.

Let’s review how we got here.

The two-year budget process began in December 2024 with a forecast that estimated how much tax revenue was expected to come in over the next two fiscal years. Then, state fiscal leaders spent months crafting a budget that would run from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027.

But just before they finalized the budget in April 2025, an updated forecast showed that much of the new revenue that had been expected wouldn’t materialize.

That forecast process has been used for decades and has generally served the state well. Lawmakers technically always spend money that is expected to come in the future.

New forecast shows big growth in Indiana surplus

It can be confusing, but think of it as if you were told you’d receive a 3% raise next year, so you used that to budget for the year. But, before it took effect, your employer dropped the raise to 1%. You will still receive more pay, though not as much as you had planned for.

So, lawmakers in April 2025 reduced the appropriations in the budget bill by about $2 billion. The two-year spending plan was signed into law in May. That led to Gov. Mike Braun cutting agency budgets, laying off hundreds of state employees and limiting child care subsidies, among other austerity measures.

Fast forward to December 2025, and the annual forecast comes around again. Except this time, the projections move in the other direction — a surprise boon! That means the state will now take in far more money than it is scheduled to spend.

This would be your boss unexpectedly going back to the 3% raise. Would you adjust your spending for the year, or save the additional amount?

The state surplus is now expected to rise to nearly $5 billion by mid-2027 — about double what was anticipated last summer. That’s almost 22% of annual state spending, when legislators usually try to keep it between 10-15%.

Future action?

Democrats are pushing to reverse some key cuts.

House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, said the first thing state government should do is eliminate the waitlist for low-income child care vouchers.

“Child care is such a big issue out there, for parents, for employers, something that we could do, we need to really work on that. We could use some of the money for that,” he told reporters Thursday. “I’ve toured a facility in Fort Wayne back in October, and then in December, they put out a notice that it’s closing. And it’s not the only one closing throughout the state. So the providers need paid; the parents need safe, productive places … where they can take their children. And that’s something that we really should do, and that’s everyone’s asking for. It very disappointing that it’s not on their priority list.”

The waitlist has entered its second year. There were more than 32,000 children in line in November, according to the latest update to a state dashboard. That’s constricting enrollment at providers already struck by the state’s cuts to voucher reimbursement rates.

Is the state really going to stockpile $5 billion when day cares are closing? And state employees are not getting a pay raise.

State Budget Director Chad Ranney told the Indiana Capital Chronicle the contingency fund that covers salary adjustments was reduced by 90%. While he hopes to find a way to help employees it might not be possible.

“The revenue has to materialize before we can spend it,” he said. “That’s a ton of money for the state to sit on but that’s 18 months away.”

Ranney also mentioned that the budget cut capital repair and rehabilitation funds, which could be adjusted

House Speaker Todd Huston said lawmakers were surprised when the forecast was downgraded last April and were surprised again with the positive news in December.

“That probably suggests to me that we probably should wait and see how this all shakes out. We know going into 2027 there are all sorts of changes taking place economically at the federal level and those types of things, and we really should probably wait to see how all that turns out,” he said Thursday. He hoped that would lead to a strong budget session in 2027.

There is a mechanism in state law to return surplus money to state taxpayers. The automatic taxpayer refund splits excess revenues between pension relief and income tax relief for Hoosiers. But it only kicks in during odd-numbered years unless lawmakers choose to change the schedule.

It doesn’t seem very conservative to take more taxpayer money than necessary, so Republicans have a choice: return it now or invest it in key areas that were previously slashed. Either can happen and still maintain an appropriate surplus to protect Indiana’s vaunted AAA credit rating and mantle of fiscal discipline.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/state-budget-getty-700x394-1.jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 21:58:07.215772

Grid reliability concerns nationwide have prompted the Department of Energy to issue emergency orders under Federal Power Act Section 202(c) to keep coal plants operational and prevent potential shortages.
The state now has two years to submit a revised haze plan or risk a federal version taking its place.","Federal air quality regulators on Friday rejected Colorado’s latest haze-reduction plan, saying the state wrongly tried to force coal-fired power plants to close early as part of efforts to clear up views in national parks and wilderness areas.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ruled that Colorado’s 2022 plan did not properly prove the forced shutdowns followed federal law, including concerns about taking private property without fair payment.

The decision prevents the state from using the federal haze program to enforce those mandatory closure dates.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment responded Friday.

“The EPA’s decision will negatively impact environmental protections for Colorado and for the majestic national parks and wilderness areas the program was designed to safeguard,” said Michael Ogletree, senior director of state air quality programs at CDPHE via email. “Colorado submitted a highly protective, innovative plan that met all state and federal requirements to reduce regional haze. EPA’s action is not based on a failure to meet regional haze requirements or visibility protections, which Colorado continues to meet. The EPA’s decision reflects a disagreement over Colorado’s inclusion of coal-fired power plant retirement dates – a provision that signals the state’s commitment to a cleaner energy future and aligns with existing state law, utility planning, and market realities.”

Colorado Springs Utilities sought more time for its Nixon Unit 1 beyond 2029, citing difficulties replacing the power with renewables at reasonable cost and argued that forced retirement would cause power shortages.

“The thing is we have to have base load power to supplement and work alongside a diverse portfolio of renewables,” said Travas Deal, CEO at Colorado Springs Utilities, in comments to The Denver Gazette last summer. “There is no technology currently that allows a hundred percent of all power to be renewable within the state because the technology doesn’t support it.”

Colorado has been in compliance with haze improvement requirements since 2018, staying on track well before coal plant closures became part of the discussion.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stressed the need to protect both clean air and reliable electricity supplies.

“Reliable baseload energy sources are essential to powering the Great American Comeback and ensuring families have cost-effective energy,” Zeldin said in a news release. “The Trump EPA has repeatedly demonstrated that we can achieve our statutory obligations, support baseload power, and improve visibility within our national parks.”

EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western reinforced the focus on everyday energy needs.

“Administrator Zeldin and the Trump Administration are laser focused on ensuring Americans have an abundance of highly reliable and affordable energy,” Western said in the release. “EPA’s denial of Colorado’s SIP revision delivers this outcome in a manner that’s fully compliant with the Clean Air Act while simultaneously providing for clean air for all Americans.”

The haze program aims to reduce smoke-like particulate pollution that creates vista-blocking haze from power plants and other sources in places like Rocky Mountain National Park.

Colorado’s plan included shutting down several coal units by 2029 to cut nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and soot.

State officials said the closures would continue anyway under state laws pushing for cleaner energy.

“Regardless of EPA’s decision, Colorado will continue to lead,” Ogletree said. “Coal plant retirement dates remain in state regulation, and many facilities have already closed or are on track to retire voluntarily because cleaner energy is more affordable and makes economic sense for consumers. Colorado has demonstrated that it is possible to protect public health, reduce pollution, and maintain a reliable energy system at the same time.”

The Colorado Mining Association praised the EPA’s action, citing energy supply concerns.

“Today’s decision by EPA is prudent given the state’s failure to sufficiently or reasonably consider the energy impacts of its plan to require the retirement of the coal fleet and the negative effects for grid reliability, particularly with respect to the loss of unreplaced baseload power,” said Adam Eckman, president and CEO of the Colorado Mining Association, in a statement.

Grid reliability concerns nationwide have prompted the Department of Energy to issue emergency orders under Federal Power Act Section 202(c) to keep coal plants operational and prevent potential shortages.

In Colorado, the department ordered Craig Station Unit 1 to remain available through March 30, 2026, due to forecasted regional shortfalls. Similar directives have delayed retirements elsewhere amid surging demand forecasts caused in part by burgeoning AI data center energy needs.

Denver environmental attorney Paul Seby called haze rules more of a goal than a strict mandate.

“There is a standalone SIP for visibility,” Seby said in an interview with The Denver Gazette. “Why is that? It’s because Congress said the aspiration to remedy impairment in a national park is a goal and not a requirement. And the majority of the impairment now is coming from forest fires, from the management of public lands or international emissions that are transported here from outside the United States that contain visibility impairing pollution (including) Africa and China.”

The EPA’s disapproval comes amid ongoing debates over ozone non-attainment in the Denver Metro/North Front Range area, which has faced repeated reclassifications for the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard. A 2023 petition by the Center for Biological Diversity and 350 Colorado challenged EPA’s partial approval of Colorado’s serious attainment plan elements, arguing for stricter measures.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

In climates like Denver’s, where homes face extended periods of low temperatures, window performance can have a measurable impact on comfort and energy use. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, air leaks around windows and doors can account for up to 30% of a home’s heating energy loss when sealing and insulation are inadequate.

During winter, window performance issues often become easier to notice as indoor heat contrasts with outdoor temperatures. Homeowners may begin to feel drafts near windows, notice that certain rooms are harder to keep warm, or find that heating systems run longer than usual. In some cases, condensation on the glass or fogging between window panes can signal a loss of insulating performance, while increased outside noise may point to air leakage around aging frames or seals. Even windows that appear intact can allow heat to escape when seals or insulation deteriorate, contributing to higher energy use and reduced indoor comfort.

Energy-efficient windows in Denver are designed to address these challenges by limiting heat transfer and reducing air leakage. Features such as insulated glass, low-emissivity coatings, and properly sealed frames help retain indoor heat while minimizing cold-air infiltration. When installed correctly, these windows help maintain more consistent indoor temperatures and improve overall home efficiency throughout the winter.

Conservation Construction notes that proper window installation is just as important as the window itself. Even high-performance windows can underperform if they are not sealed and fitted correctly, particularly in a cold-weather environment where pressure differences and temperature extremes are more pronounced.

“In Denver, energy-efficient windows and proper installation work together to protect homes during winter,” a company spokesperson said. “Understanding how windows function as part of the home’s thermal envelope helps homeowners make informed decisions about efficiency.”

By educating homeowners on the role energy-efficient windows play in winter performance, Conservation Construction aims to help Denver residents better evaluate their homes and prepare for long-term comfort in cold-climate conditions.

Uprates are increases in nuclear power generation from equipment upgrades.
Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said, “At Meta, we are investing in nuclear energy because it provides clean, reliable power that is essential for advancing our AI ambitions and strengthening American leadership in energy innovation.
Economic engine for the region Vistra’s nuclear plants have been significant contributors to local economies since their construction.
More on Vistra’s nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania, per the company: Perry is a single-unit power plant located on Lake Erie, about 40 miles northeast of Cleveland in Perry, Ohio.","Vistra announced it has entered into 20-year power purchasing agreements to provide more than 2,600 megawatts of zero-carbon energy from three Vistra nuclear plants—two in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania—to support Meta’s operations in the region.

In its own announcement, Meta said the agreements—along with additional deals struck with TerraPower and Okla—will deliver power to the grids that support Meta’s operations, including its AI-focused Prometheus supercluster in New Albany, Ohio.

Dallas Innovates reported on Vistra’s purchase of the Ohio and Pennsylvania nuclear plants in 2023. Today’s news is the second big announcement Vistra has made this week. Just days ago, Vistra agreed to acquire Cogentrix Energy, consisting of 10 modern natural gas generation facilities totaling approximately 5,500 MW of capacity, in a $4 billion deal.

Largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the U.S.

The Meta-Vistra power purchasing agreements include 2,176 MW of operating generation and an additional 433 MW of combined power output increases, billed as “the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the United States,” Vistra said. Uprates are increases in nuclear power generation from equipment upgrades. The agreements will also grow the local tax base, foster economic development in the region, and protect existing jobs while creating new ones, the company added.

“This is a unique and exciting collaboration, and Vistra is proud to partner with Meta on these long-term power purchase agreements, which ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of Vistra’s Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse, and Perry nuclear power plants for decades to come while providing a competitive solution for our customer to support its sustainable operations,” Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra, said in a statement.

“Importantly,” he added, “this commitment from Meta provides Vistra the certainty needed to invest in these plants and communities and bring new nuclear generation online for the grid—through uprates at our existing plants.”

License extensions planned for all three nuclear plants

With this announcement, Vistra said it will now begin planning for subsequent license extensions at all three plants, which would extend operations of these carbon-free assets for another 20 years.

Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said, “At Meta, we are investing in nuclear energy because it provides clean, reliable power that is essential for advancing our AI ambitions and strengthening American leadership in energy innovation. By supporting nuclear power, we ensure that our operations — and the communities we serve — benefit from energy solutions that drive both technological progress and economic growth.”

Agreement details

Vistra detailed the agreements, noting that Meta is purchasing 2,176 MW of nuclear energy and capacity from the operating Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio. Meta is also purchasing 433 MW of incremental nuclear energy and capacity from equipment upgrades to increase generation output (uprates) at the Perry (Ohio), Davis-Besse (Ohio), and Beaver Valley (Pennsylvania) plants—more than 15% of the contracted capacity announced today will be new capacity added to the PJM region.

The electricity generated at the plants will continue to go to the grid for all electricity users, Vistra noted.

The agreement is designed to benefit “PJM customers,” Vistra said, referring to Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland, where the electricity provider got its start. The company delivers energy to all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, according to the PJM website.

“As recently as 2020, before Vistra owned Perry, Davis-Besse, and Beaver Valley, these plants were on a path to retirement,” said Stacey Doré, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of Vistra. “When we signed a deal to acquire these plants in 2023, Vistra saw their tremendous contribution—to the reliability of the grid, to the stability of the region, to their local communities, and to the people who work there. Fast-forward to today and we’re investing in expanding these same plants, and thanks to our dedicated employees and a committed partner like Meta, this fleet will continue to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to power the grid of the future.”

Meta’s purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034, when the full 2,609 MW of power will be online, Vistra said.

Each of the three plants has received initial license renewal from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agreements provide certainty for Vistra to pursue subsequent license renewal for each of the reactors, which would extend each license an additional 20 years. Currently, Beaver Valley Unit 1 is licensed through 2036; Davis-Besse is licensed through 2037; Perry is licensed through 2046; and Beaver Valley Unit 2 is licensed through 2047.

Economic engine for the region

Vistra’s nuclear plants have been significant contributors to local economies since their construction. The agreements continue that commitment, including tens of millions of dollars in state and local taxes each year, substantial charitable giving, community involvement, and volunteerism by the company and its employees.

These three plants provide thousands of well-paying jobs, Vistra said. Over the life of the uprate projects, which span approximately nine years, approximately 3,000 project-related jobs across engineering, construction, and planned outage work are expected, adding to the economic impact around these plants.

More on Vistra’s nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania, per the company:

Perry is a single-unit power plant located on Lake Erie, about 40 miles northeast of Cleveland in Perry, Ohio. The plant has a capacity of 1,268 MW and provides more than 600 full-time jobs in the North Perry area.

Davis-Besse is a single-unit power plant in Oak Harbor, Ohio, located on Lake Erie, approximately 35 miles east of Toledo. The plant has a capacity of 908 MW and provides more than 600 full-time jobs in the area.

Beaver Valley is a two-unit power plant in western Pennsylvania, about 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The plant has a capacity of 1,872 MW and provides more than 750 full-time jobs in the area.

Support for the deal

Vistra’s agreement with Meta garnered bipartisan support from politicians across the region.

“Bringing new nuclear generation online is key to Ohio and our nation’s growth and security, and Vistra’s significant investment is a huge win for Ohio,” U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) said in a statement. “Thanks to this announcement, essential plants will remain on the grid for the long-term, supporting jobs and local revenues.”

“This agreement reinforces Pennsylvania’s leadership in clean, reliable nuclear power and will support Pennsylvania’s workers, unlock new capacity to meet rising electricity demand, and help power economic growth and development across Beaver County and our Commonwealth,” said U.S. Senator Dave McCormick (R-Pennsylvania).

Governor Josh Shapiro (D-Pennsylvania) said the partnership between Vistra and Meta “taps into Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and will create and protect good-paying jobs, grow our economy, and ultimately add more power to the grid.”

Shapiro said his administration “is working to generate even more power in the Commonwealth to keep up with rising demand—with more power comes more national security, more independence, and more economic freedom. Projects like this—bringing new clean energy to our grid to power next generation technology—are exactly the types of projects we want to welcome to the Commonwealth.”

“The Beaver Valley Nuclear Plant has been a trusted source of affordable, reliable power since 1976,” said Pennsylvania State Rep. Josh Kail (R-Beaver Co./Washington Co.). “Extending its operating license will secure over 750 high-quality jobs for decades, ensuring long-term economic stability for Beaver County and beyond. It’s a smart, private investment that benefits communities without shifting the burden to taxpayers. This is a major win for western Pennsylvania.”

WHEATFIELD — Barb Deardorff was looking forward to the day when she wouldn’t see the giant smokestacks — or the pollution pouring out of them — looming in the distance near her rural Jasper County home.

The 49-year-old organizer for the Indiana teachers’ union has lived 2 miles away from NIPSCO’s coal-fired Schahfer Generating Station her entire life.

Some days, the smoke from the towers turned the sky into a yellowish-brown mirror, Deardorff described. Water from the well on her property has tested high for arsenic and lead.

When the utility in 2018 announced it would shutter the coal units, Deardorff was elated. The last two were set to close at the end of 2025, bringing an end to the Schahfer facility that was named one of the nation’s worst super polluters in 2016.

“I couldn’t believe it was finally happening and we don’t have to worry about their pollution anymore,” she said.

That excitement disappeared Dec. 26 when the U.S. Department of Energy issued an emergency order requiring NIPSCO to take all the necessary steps to keep the coal units operating for 90 days.

The same mandate was sent to CenterPoint Energy’s F.B. Culley Generating Station in Warrick County, where one of the coal units was to be retired at the end of 2025.

Deardorff was stunned. “I was really disappointed when I heard about the Trump administration’s order,” she said. “I think this is all just a political football.”

MOUNTING LEGAL CHALLENGES

Indiana wasn’t the first state to receive an order to keep a coal plant open. The Trump administration this year has demanded facilities in Washington, Michigan and Colorado remain operating despite years of planning to close them.

The administration argues it has the authority to require plants to remain open under the Federal Power Act, which allows the Department of Energy to issue electricitygeneration orders during wartime or an energy emergency.

The agency claims the soaring demand for more electricity coupled with the closure of coal plants will create an energy deficit that equates to a national emergency. The coal plants must stay open to maintain the reliability of the electric grid, according to the orders.

But consumer advocates say that argument has a major f law: There is no energy emergency.

In November, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. reported the grid operator for Indiana and surrounding states had “normal risk” for the winter season.

The move to keep the coalburning plants running represents an “unprecedented power grab” by the federal government to commandeer the state’s right to make energy decisions, according to Ben Inskeep, program director for Citizens Action Coalition, an Indiana c o n sume r advocacy group.

“These illegal orders are pushing the really dirty, really expensive forms of energy that are raising our bills and directly harming people living with the massive pollution from these facilities,” he said.

Environmental groups are asking a federal judge to reverse similar emergency orders issued in Michigan by the Trump administration. The Michigan attorney general is also suing the Department of Energy.

The decisions in those cases could directly impact the mandates keeping Indiana’s two coal plants open.

At the same time, Indiana advocacy groups have jointly threatened to sue NIPSCO if the utility tries to pass on to ratepayers the cost of keeping the coal units operating.

“We will not let NIPSCO simply add unneeded, unlawful and very high costs to peoples’ electricity bills without a fight,” said Sameer Doshi, an attorney with Earthjustice, which is representing the Indiana groups.

‘A HEAD SCRATCHER’

Trump isn’t the first president to use the Federal Power Act to issue orders allowing for more energy production, but he’s the first to use it so often and so forcefully.

From 1977 to 2024, the act was used 19 times by the energy department, according to the lawsuit filed by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel. Last year, under the Biden administration, it was used once to help alleviate potential energy shortages following Hurricane Milton in Florida.

Just last year, the Trump administration used the act 16 times.

Historically, orders have been directed exclusively to address short-term emergencies like natural disasters and extreme weather, according to the lawsuit. They are almost always requested by power grid operators or utility companies to mitigate short-term energy disruptions, notes the suit.

But Trump’s order to keep coal plants open past their scheduled retirement date marks a sharp — and illegal — departure from how the act was intended to be used, Nessel argues in the lawsuit.

Rather than address emergencies, the orders attempt to dictate energy policy to favor coal over renewable energy “under the guise of grid reliability concerns,” she argued.

The fact the orders keep Indiana’s coal plants open for only an addit ional 90 days also under cut s the Trump a dmi n i s t r a t i o n ’ s claims that the facilities are needed as a longterm energy solution, explained Janet McCabe, the former deputy administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden.

Even more telling are the administration’s orders to stop clean-energy projects that are nearly operational and cutting nearly $8 billion in funding for wind and solar projects, all of which could quickly add significant amounts of power to the grid, argued McCabe, now a visiting professor at Indiana University.

“It’s kind of a headscratcher about these orders for coal plants while renewable projects, especially wind, are not being supported by the current administration,” she said. “To the extent that the country needs more power on the grid, we should be supporting all kinds of energy projects.”

A COSTLY PROPOSITION

The illegal orders will force utility companies to spend millions of dollars to keep them running, according to Inskeep with the Citizens Action Coalition.

At NIPSCO’s Schahfer Generating Station, one of the coal units that must continue to operate has a broken turbine blade and had been under a “forced outage” since the summer.

NIPSCO President Vincent Parisi told the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission this year the unit would need to be rebuilt and could take as much as six months to fix.

Inskeep said the cost of the rebuild and repairs would be “substantial.” At the Michigan coal plant, the utility reported it cost $80 million to operate the facility past its planned retirement date of Sept. 30, averaging more than $615,000 per day.

That’s why the Citizen Action Coalition joined three other Indiana environmental groups to send a letter reminding NIPSCO it wasn’t required to follow an illegal order from the Trump administration, Inskeep explained.

The groups also told NIPSCO they would sue for the “recovery of any imprudently incurred expenditures” made to keep the coal unit operating.

NIPSCO acknowledged in an email to the EPA that it would require “significant capital investment” to keep the coal units running past the end of last year. That cost could only be justified if the units were allowed to remain open for at least three years, wrote Fred Gomos, senior director of environmental policy with NiSource, the utility’s parent company.

NIPSCO administrators wrote in an emailed statement that it would comply with Trump’s order and any subsequent orders, but its “long-term plan to transition to a more sustainable energy future remains unchanged.”

That’s little comfort for Deardorff, who lives near the power plant. While the Trump administration issues orders to win political points with the coal industry, residents like her, she said, will continue to suffer from air and water pollution created by the facility.

“I haven’t seen the Trump administration show any concern about our health,” Deardorff said. “This is really just trying to take the United States back to the 1950s when Trump thinks we were at our apex.”

""I'm hoping this passes so there's a much better chance for people who drive electric vehicles don't go through what we've gone through.","Electric vehicles could soon be in the crosshairs of Congress, with a new bill that would force more rigorous safety standards.

The legislation is especially important to one Westchester County, New York, family, after two wives were killed in a fiery crash that they believe could have been prevented.

""Electric vehicles have gone out of control""

A Bloomberg report shows 15 people have died in Tesla crashes because the doors became inoperable during a crash. Latimer introduced a bipartisan bill calling for national standards on electric vehicles.

""Electric vehicles have gone out of control. The driver could not stop them. Driver crashed and died. When it happens once, it's a tragedy. When it happens more than once, something needs to be done,"" Rep. George Latimer said.

Specifically, the bill calls for latches that allow occupants to escape or be rescued when the electronic system fails, as well as for improved battery storage and protection, and better firefighter training.

""In this bill, we make sure firefighters have adequate training to fight these fires so if an accident happens, we have a higher likelihood of saving lives,"" Latimer said.

The bill would give the Department of Transportation a two-year deadline to outline new national standards for electric vehicles, but would allow enhanced firefighter training to begin as soon as it's passed into law.

""The accident was horrific. The fire was horrific""

Greenburgh City Councilman Francis Sheehan's wife and daughter-in-law were killed in a September 2024 crash involving a Tesla.

""The accident was horrific. The fire was horrific,"" Sheehan said. ""Every day, I think about how much my wife and my daughter-in-law Diana would love seeing the grandkids grow up.""

Witnesses describe the Tesla as exploding like a bomb when it plowed into a White Plains building, leaving just a charred skeleton of the vehicle behind.

Sheehan has officially endorsed the bill, and believes its passage would save lives.

""If it were in place, would I still have my wife? I think there's a good possibility I would,"" Sheehan said. ""I'm hoping this passes so there's a much better chance for people who drive electric vehicles don't go through what we've gone through. No one should die that way, and unfortunately, they did.""

The Vancouver, BC-headquartered company said it chose New Mexico because of the state’s growing EV ecosystem, generous financial incentives, and Santa Teresa’s designation as a Foreign Trade Zone.
Operations are scheduled to begin in Q1 2026, with GreenPower taking possession of the factory on June 1, 2026.
In 2025, the state signed a contract to help electrify more than 5,000 state fleet vehicles through an Electric Vehicles as a Service (EVaaS) model, as part of a mandate requiring all state agencies to buy zero-emission vehicles when available and transition the entire state fleet to zero-emission by 2035.

The Vancouver, BC-headquartered company said it chose New Mexico because of the state’s growing EV ecosystem, generous financial incentives, and Santa Teresa’s designation as a Foreign Trade Zone. GreenPower already operates manufacturing facilities in California and West Virginia.

The new 135,000-square-foot facility, located in Santa Teresa near the US-Mexico border, is expected to create around 340 permanent jobs and generate over $200 million in economic impact. Operations are scheduled to begin in Q1 2026, with GreenPower taking possession of the factory on June 1, 2026.

New Mexico’s push to electrify its own fleets also played a major role in the decision. In 2025, the state signed a contract to help electrify more than 5,000 state fleet vehicles through an Electric Vehicles as a Service (EVaaS) model, as part of a mandate requiring all state agencies to buy zero-emission vehicles when available and transition the entire state fleet to zero-emission by 2035.

Last year, the state also awarded a separate four-year, $400 million contract aimed at electrifying more than 2,000 school buses and 3,500 state transit and so-called “white fleet” vehicles. The program includes charging infrastructure and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration as part of New Mexico’s “Electrify New Mexico” initiative.

To secure GreenPower’s investment, the state committed a total of $14.6 million in incentives. That package includes $5 million through the Local Economic Development Act (LEDA) program, $4.6 million in Job Training Incentive Program (JTIP) funds, $1.36 million in Rural Jobs Tax Credits, and $3.65 million as part of the state’s High-Wage Jobs Tax Credit program.

Santa Teresa’s Foreign Trade Zone status was another key factor. The designation enables manufacturers to streamline customs procedures and reduce costs associated with imports, exports, and inventory – an increasingly valuable advantage as companies navigate tariff uncertainty and supply chain risks.

Santa Teresa sits within the fast-growing Borderplex region, anchored by the Santa Teresa Port of Entry and major rail connections from Union Pacific and BNSF. The area has become a hub for manufacturing and logistics, backed by significant state investment in infrastructure such as the Border Highway Connector.

GreenPower builds all-electric, purpose-built medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for delivery, shuttle, transit, and school bus markets. The company says the New Mexico facility will support both domestic manufacturing and deployment as states and fleets accelerate the shift to zero-emission transportation.

About Entergy Mississippi Entergy Mississippi provides electricity to approximately 459,000 customers in 45 counties.
Entergy Mississippi is a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation.","JACKSON, Mississippi – As winter brings bouts of colder temperatures, customers will begin using their heating systems more and this could lead to an increase in electricity usage. However, staying warm and comfortable does not have to come at the cost of high electric bills. By making a few simple changes around your home, you can improve its energy efficiency and keep costs down throughout the colder months.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, home heating and cooling costs can make up more than 52% of an average customer’s electric bill. In some cases, poor insulation, air leaks and inefficient HVAC systems can lead to even greater energy costs each year. To keep your home warm without significantly raising the thermostat and save money on your bill at the same time, try these low-to-no-costs tips.

Improving energy efficiency with low-to-no-cost tips

Use solar energy: Open curtains on the south-facing windows during the day to allow sunlight to naturally heat the home and close them at night to reduce the chill from cold windows.

Insulate drafty windows: Use a heavy-duty, clear plastic sheet on a frame or tape clear plastic film to the inside of window frames and make sure the plastic is sealed tightly to the frame to help reduce infiltration.

Adjust the thermostat: When you are home and awake, set the thermostat as low as is comfortable, but when you are asleep or out of the house, turn the thermostat back to save on your heating and cooling bills.

Find and seal leaks: Seal air leaks around utility cut-throughs for pipes and recessed lights in insulated ceilings, and unfinished spaces behind cupboards and closets.

Maintain heating systems: Schedule routine service for home heating systems and replace furnace and heat pump filters once a month or as needed.

Reduce heat loss from the fireplace: Keep the fireplace damper closed unless a fire is burning and check the seal on the fireplace flue damper and make it as snug as possible.

By following these simple steps, you can stay warm and comfortable all winter long while keeping your bills under control. We also offer free comprehensive residential energy audits and rebates to help reduce the upfront cost of installing energy-efficient equipment.

Exploring resources through Bill Toolkit

To make sure customers have quick access to energy efficiency, bill management and financial assistance resources, Entergy created an online platform called Bill Toolkit. The platform consolidates helpful resources for customers interested in exploring ways to lower their electric use and costs and learn more about different payment options the company offers. It also provides information on our energy efficiency programs and incentives and rebates associated with these programs.

Tracking energy use through myAdvisor

Entergy customers can set electric usage alerts and monitor how much energy they use each day through bill management tools like myAdvisor, which is available through their myEntergy account online. Tracking usage over time can help customers identify trends that contribute to higher usage and budget their monthly expenses. With the myAdvisor dashboard, customers have access to not only usage and cost details, but also bill history and projections, analyzer tools and more. On the Entergy mobile app this information can be found by tapping the “usage” tab.

Managing bills through payment and assistance options

Entergy offers several flexible payment options so customers can choose when, where and how they receive their bills.

Pick-A-Date allows customers to pay their bills when it works best for them.

Level Billing allows customers to “level out” seasonal energy use fluctuations, making their bills more consistent every month.

PaperFREE billing allows customers to get their bills emailed as soon as they post and instant access to two years of billing history.

AutoPay allows customers to avoid late fees, writing checks and paying for postage by having bills automatically deduct from their bank accounts.

We also offer flexible payment options such as deferred payment arrangements or payment extensions. Customers can find out if they qualify for these options through our mobile app or myEntergy online.

Supporting nuclear energy development strengthens our country’s energy infrastructure and helps create a more reliable electric grid, which are key to powering the economy and securing America’s energy independence and global leadership in AI.

Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo — and the one we signed with Constellation Energy last year — make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history.

At Meta, we’re focused on building personal superintelligence for everyone, and delivering the app experiences and computing devices that will improve the lives of billions of people around the world. Our industry-leading data centers are the backbone of these breakthroughs — they provide the infrastructure that drives innovation and brings transformative technologies to life. Innovation at this scale requires more electricity, and that’s where nuclear energy comes in. It provides clean, reliable, and firm electricity that helps power America’s economy and communities.

That’s why today, we’re proud to announce agreements with three companies — following our nuclear RFP process — that will help add clean, reliable energy to electric grids, preserve continued investment in operating nuclear power plants, and support the nuclear fuel supply chain, American jobs, and AI innovation.

Our commitments to Oklo and TerraPower support the next generation of American developers creating safer, advanced nuclear reactors and accelerating the development of nuclear technologies. Through our partnership with Vistra, we’re providing financial support for operating nuclear power plants, extending the operational lifespan, and increasing energy production at the Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. The projects we’re announcing today will deliver power to the grids that support our operations, including our Prometheus supercluster in New Albany, Ohio.

These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW of new and existing clean energy by 2035. Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.

This work builds on our ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational. We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.

“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history. State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone. These projects are going to create thousands of skilled jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania, add new energy to the grid, extend the life of three existing nuclear plants, and accelerate new reactor technologies.”

– Joel Kaplan, Chief Global Affairs Officer, Meta

Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology

As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.

These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.

TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology

Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium® units capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.",https://i0.wp.com/sightlineu3o8.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nuclear_Header.webp?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-09 20:59:13.981753

One of the unintended consequences of this consumer trend is the effect on gas tax revenue.

Every gasoline and diesel sale in the U.S. includes a small added tax. This tax is used to fund state transportation budgets, highway maintenance, and infrastructure projects. As a result of more EVs on the road, the amount of revenue generated by the gas tax is decreasing. This has created interesting financial repercussions, and a variety of solutions are being adopted to help.

Using fuel tax data from the Department of Energy and consumer EV trends from the Alternative Fuels Data Center, CheapInsurance.com analyzed the economic impact of the changing transportation landscape on Louisiana and what's being done to remedy the situation.

Nationwide EV adoption trends

Millions of Americans are choosing to purchase electric vehicles over traditional gas ones. The reasons include reduced charging costs compared to gas, lower emissions, and tax incentives.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported that, in 2024, there were 1.2 million electric vehicle sales and 1.6 million hybrid electric vehicle sales. This is up from 238,000 EV sales and 455,000 hybrid-electric sales in 2020. This upward trend is likely to continue.

A look at gas tax revenue loss in key EV states

The states with the highest EV registration numbers per 100,000 residents have the most significant loss in gas tax revenue. The number of EV vehicles on the road compared to gasoline vehicles is still quite low, so impacts are not being strongly felt yet. However, many states are predicting substantial losses in their gas tax revenue over the next decade.

In California, for example, the Mineta Transportation Institute predicts that there will be a 64% loss in revenue from 2025 to 2040. In this study, researchers considered eight different scenarios, each with a different rate of how many EVs are purchased, how many people in the state drive, and how many personal vehicles get registered. Results used 2024 inflation-adjusted numbers.

Budget impacts on state transportation departments

Millions of dollars in losses will have a severe impact on state highway and transportation departments if left unaddressed. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024 data pulled from the National Association of State Budget Officers states that gas tax revenue accounts for 35.9% of state transportation department revenue nationwide.

Without this revenue, several impacts will be felt:

Deficits in highway and road maintenance

Slower completion of infrastructure projects

Less development and expansion

Higher vehicle maintenance costs for the general population

How states are responding and planning for the future

States are recognizing that action needs to be taken to secure transportation budgets. Pew Research Center reports that many states are suffering from budget gaps and are having difficulty completing projects like bridge repairs.

To tackle the issue of reduced gas tax revenue, many states have begun taking measures and implementing programs that will generate revenue from electric vehicles instead.

EV registration fees

The most significant way that governmental bodies have buoyed transportation department revenue is with EV registration fees. These fees are charged at the initial time of registration and on an annual basis.

In Texas, for example, EV owners must pay $400 for the first-time registration and $200 each year, according to the Department of Energy.

Road usage charges

Other states are opting for a road usage fee. In Hawai'i, EV owners are given the option to pay an annual, per-mile usage fee instead of a large registration fee. This is currently set at $0.08/mile, up to $50/year.

Oregon offers a similar program, called OReGO. California is also experimenting with its own pilot program.

What changes are needed on the road ahead?

It's clear that policy change is needed to address the compounding loss in gas tax revenue as a result of widespread EV adoption. The amount of revenue that will need to be replaced is unclear, however, especially with an anticipated decline in EV demand due to the federal tax incentives ending.

Regardless, state agencies and the federal government will need to prioritize alternative methods for generating revenue. This could be through registration fees, road usage programs, or other revenue-generating systems that are put into place. It's likely that the EV marketplace will continue to grow and that more households will begin replacing their gas vehicles, so prompt change is needed in the coming years.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/klax-tv.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/90/69065c85-b3b3-5ce0-b148-6f5a319eedaa/696176e4a3f63.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-10 18:59:02.305348

This comes as the company reevaluates its investments in electric vehicles and restructures its operations in China. The automaker from Detroit explained that around $6 billion of this charge is connected to adjustments in its EV strategy due to weaker demand than anticipated.

The remaining $1.1 billion mainly stems from a significant overhaul of a joint venture in China, which includes about $500 million in cash expenses.

These charges will impact GM's net income as reported, but they won't be included in the adjusted figures. This news follows a previous $1.6 billion charge highlighted in October when GM first hinted that it was rethinking its EV initiatives.

Ford Motor, a competitor in the area, took similar actions in December, revealing nearly $19.5 billion in charges related to restructuring and cuts in electric vehicle investments.

GM clarified that about $1.8 billion of the EV-related charges are non-cash impairments, while the rest involves supplier settlements, contract cancellations, and other costs that will be incurred over time. More EV-related charges are anticipated in 2026, but at lower amounts.

Even with these challenges, GM remains optimistic about the long-term potential of electric vehicles, although it recognizes that traditional gas-powered cars will continue to dominate for a while longer.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

A new study from the Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University, through its Trilateral Energy Security Committee (TESC), in partnership with Wood Mackenzie, projects Vietnam’s electricity demand to more than triple by 2050, and finds that LNG will be critical to keeping the lights on.

The study outlines some key policy reforms needed to unlock investment in LNG-to-power infrastructure at scale.

The study, “Economic Evaluation of LNG Potential in Vietnam” (January 2026), projects that Vietnam’s electricity demand will increase from 330 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2025 to 1,100 TWh by 2050, a 300% rise. This means the country will require a power system capable of delivering over three times its current electricity output, with the economy expected to grow at an average annual rate of 4.6% during this period.

“Vietnam’s power demand is rising fast, and reliability will matter as much as capacity,” said Dr. Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute. “LNG can be a practical solution to add reliable power at scale and strengthen energy security. This study lays out some key policy and regulatory reforms that can unlock investment and make integrated LNG-to-power projects financeable.”

What the study finds

Vietnam’s growing power demand will strain domestic energy supply, even with significant renewable expansion and new domestic gas production expected in the 2030s.

The analysis concludes that LNG imports will be necessary to bridge the gap between demand and domestic supply, particularly in regions with high industrial activity.

Key projections and takeaways include:

LNG demand is projected to increase significantly, from 0.5 million tons per year in 2025 to 17 million tons per year by 2050, driven by both power and non-power sectors. Approximately 65% of this demand will be concentrated in southern Vietnam.

Domestic gas production is expected to rise in the 2030s, supported by major discoveries in central Vietnam, though the timelines for these upstream developments are currently uncertain. However, overall supply will remain insufficient as demand grows across the power and industrial sectors.

Gas-fired power generation is projected to increase from 33 terawatt-hours in 2025 to 200 TWh by 2050. Gas will help balance intermittent renewables and maintain grid stability as coal use declines.

Attracting investment

The paper emphasizes that the financial viability of LNG-to-power projects is critical.

It identifies some key policy and regulatory areas that can help increase project bankability and make them more attractive to international investors:

Minimum dispatch factor: Investors and lenders require assurance that plants will operate sufficiently to meet take-or-pay obligations in LNG sales and purchase agreements.

Fuel-cost pass-through: Tariffs should include automatic mechanisms to reflect monthly LNG price changes without requiring repeated approvals.

Power tariffs and currency treatment: Long-term contracts require predictable management of currency conversion and repayment risk throughout the tariff structure.

“Vietnam has a real opportunity to pair economic growth with lower emissions by getting the power mix right,” said Dr. James E. Payne, dean of the Spears School of Business at OSU and a Hamm Institute Fellow. “Our analysis shows domestic gas and renewables help, but they do not close the gap on their own. LNG imports can bridge that gap, and targeted reforms on dispatch, fuel-cost pass-through, and tariffs can make projects bankable and accelerate investment.”

LNG, reliability, and emissions

Vietnam currently relies heavily on coal for electricity.

The study finds that LNG can support near-term emissions reductions by displacing coal and providing firm power to support renewables as wind, solar and storage capacity increase.

The analysis estimates lifecycle emissions for coal-fired power generation in Vietnam at 224-242 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule compared with 102-146 gCO2e/MJ for U.S.-sourced LNG, depending on fuel characteristics and supply chain conditions.

This indicates that LNG can significantly reduce emissions intensity compared to coal in the power sector.

The role of U.S. LNG

The study notes that the U.S. is expected to increase its share of global LNG supply by the mid-2030s, providing additional supply options for Asian buyers.

Based on Wood Mackenzie’s trade flow analysis and high-level assumptions, the paper estimates that approximately 1.5 million tons of U.S. LNG could be supplied to Vietnam as early as 2035, but exact quantity will depend on contract signings and market conditions.",https://news.okstate.edu/articles/communications/images/2026_hamm_vietnam_study/hamm_vietnam_banner.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 17:13:42.840685

For the U.S. energy sector, the implications are immediate.
Beyond energy exports, the policy has wider resonance for the U.S. maritime sector.
The Deepwater Port Act was originally designed for oil imports but has evolved significantly over five decades.
Streamlining deepwater port approval is one element of a wider effort to expand offshore industrial capacity and solidify U.S. influence in global energy markets.","A new policy hands MARAD the lead role in approving offshore ports, a move officials say will streamline environmental reviews and unlock billions in stalled energy export projects.

Paul Morgan (gCaptain) – In a move that could reshape how the United States approves some of its most strategically important maritime infrastructure, the Trump administration has transferred responsibility for deepwater port licensing from the U.S. Coast Guard to the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD).

The policy, announced on January 5 by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, marks the most significant change to offshore terminal permitting since the Deepwater Port Act was passed more than fifty years ago. Officials say the shift will streamline environmental reviews, reduce multiyear delays and accelerate development of major offshore facilities, including LNG export terminals, crude-oil loading platforms, and the ports required to support the next generation of offshore wind and alternative-fuel industries.

At the center of the shift is a consequential administrative reordering. MARAD will now serve as the lead federal agency for environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act, taking over from the Coast Guard, which has led these reviews since the 1970s. The Coast Guard retains its central role in safety oversight, structural and operational regulation, security standards and inspection of deepwater port facilities, but it no longer directs the licensing process itself. The change was authorized by language in the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2025, which formally reassigns NEPA duties and licensing leadership to MARAD.

The rationale behind the change is rooted in long-standing frustration with the pace of offshore terminal approvals. Under the Deepwater Port Act, developers must satisfy extensive environmental, maritime-safety and financial criteria before a license can be granted. The statistics reveal a regulatory bottleneck that has frustrated industry for decades. Since the licensing system was created in 1975, only 31 applications have been filed and a mere eight licenses ever issued. Several flagship projects illustrate the problem.

According to MARAD’s website, more than 3.8 million barrels per day of new offshore crude export capacity and roughly 10.6 million tonnes per year of LNG capacity are currently stalled in the Maritime Administration’s deepwater port licensing pipeline, with at least four major oil and gas terminals trapped under so-called “stop-clock” suspensions. The delayed projects — Blue Marlin, Bluewater Texas, New Fortress Energy’s Louisiana FLNG, and West Delta LNG — represent enough capacity to materially reshape U.S. energy exports, tanker demand, and global supply balances, yet most have been effectively frozen since 2019–2022 as regulators await additional environmental and technical information.

Phillips 66’s Bluewater Terminal, filed in May 2019, suffered a devastating setback in 2022 when the EPA forced the company to withdraw and refile permits due to emissions compliance issues. After six years, the project remains suspended and in regulatory limbo. Energy Transfer’s Blue Marlin Offshore Port, filed in October 2020, has been positioned as the only brownfield project that could leverage existing infrastructure to speed construction, yet still awaits federal approval despite completing internal engineering studies and securing a heads of agreement with TotalEnergies.

MARAD and senior DOT officials argue that giving a single agency clear responsibility for coordinating environmental reviews will eliminate duplication, reduce bottlenecks and allow the United States to approve strategically important maritime infrastructure at a pace that matches market demand. Duffy framed the change as central to President Trump’s energy dominance strategy, arguing it will help America use more of its natural resources, create good-paying jobs, and lower energy costs for families.

MARAD Administrator Steve Carmel, who was only recently confirmed in December, said the agency is ready to take the helm. “We’re excited to lead the Deepwater Port Program and continue working closely with the Coast Guard to make the process more efficient and fuel our energy economy for years to come.”

Just before the policy shift took effect, Sentinel Midstream’s Texas GulfLink deepwater crude oil export terminal received its Record of Decision from MARAD on February 14, 2025, concluding a multi-year environmental and technical review. Located approximately 30 miles off Brazoria County, Texas, the facility represents the kind of project the administration hopes to expedite.

For the U.S. energy sector, the implications are immediate. Offshore LNG export terminals, often built in deepwater locations because their carriers require depths that many onshore ports cannot provide, have become vital to America’s role as one of the world’s largest LNG suppliers.

Preliminary data shows the United States became the world’s first country to export more than 100 million tonnes of LNG in a single year in 2025, while crude oil exports topped 4.1 million barrels per day in 2024. Companies behind several proposed Gulf-based projects, including floating liquefaction schemes and fixed-platform gas export terminals, have privately expressed confidence that MARAD’s more centralized coordination will reduce waiting times and increase investor certainty. A more predictable approval pathway could unlock billions of dollars in spending over the next decade.

Ports, dredging firms, offshore engineering specialists and vessel operators have welcomed the change. The American Association of Port Authorities praised the decision as common-sense reform, arguing that it aligns environmental oversight with MARAD’s broader mission to strengthen U.S. maritime infrastructure. Supporters argue that MARAD, as part of the Department of Transportation, is better suited than the Coast Guard to coordinate NEPA consultations with other federal agencies such as NOAA, EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, all of which play central roles in environmental and navigational reviews.

But not everyone is convinced. Critics, including former MARAD officials and environmental-law specialists, warn that the transition risks overwhelming an agency that has historically played a smaller role in NEPA litigation and environmental analysis than the Coast Guard. Jeff Lewis, former MARAD chief counsel now with Cozen O’Connor, warned last year that the Coast Guard standards and law divisions already have the breadth and depth of experience from 50 years of deepwater port work, while MARAD does not possess these competencies at all.

Some worry that the change could weaken environmental scrutiny or create fresh administrative confusion if MARAD lacks sufficient personnel and technical expertise. A 2025 legal commentary by Cozen O’Connor warned that the shift could undermine the robustness of environmental assessments and complicate the interface between environmental analysis and maritime safety obligations.

Environmental groups remain cautious. Although the administrative reorganization does not reduce the legal obligations under NEPA or the Deepwater Port Act, requirements for impact assessments, endangered-species consultations, air-quality modelling and spill-risk mitigation remain unchanged. They fear that political pressure to accelerate fossil-fuel export capacity could influence how aggressively MARAD evaluates cumulative impacts. Texas Gulf Link, which received its Record of Decision just weeks ago, is projected to emit over 100 million tons of greenhouse gases annually. Residents along the Texas Gulf Coast have raised concerns about air quality impacts on already overburdened communities, reflecting broader tensions between the administration’s energy dominance agenda and environmental justice advocates who argue these facilities lock in decades of fossil fuel dependence and pollution. The Department of Transportation insists that every statutory safeguard remains intact, and that NEPA timelines will be improved through better coordination rather than reduced scrutiny.

Beyond energy exports, the policy has wider resonance for the U.S. maritime sector. Deepwater port licenses are expected to underpin future offshore infrastructure, including ammonia and hydrogen export hubs, large-scale carbon-capture and sequestration terminals, and the supply bases needed to support expanded offshore wind deployment. The Deepwater Port Act was originally designed for oil imports but has evolved significantly over five decades. Congress expanded the law in 2002 to include natural gas facilities and again in 2012 to address LNG exports specifically. As these industries grow, MARAD’s leadership role could make it one of the most influential agencies shaping the next generation of American maritime commerce.

The shift also reflects a broader repositioning of maritime priorities in Washington. Amid geopolitical competition over energy security, supply-chain resilience and emerging maritime technologies, the U.S. is moving toward a more coordinated federal maritime strategy. Streamlining deepwater port approval is one element of a wider effort to expand offshore industrial capacity and solidify U.S. influence in global energy markets. With global energy demand in flux, shipping markets tightening and geopolitical tensions reshaping trade routes, the ability of the United States to approve and build modern deepwater ports will help determine the country’s competitiveness in a world where maritime infrastructure is once again a strategic asset.

For now, the transition from the Coast Guard to MARAD is complete. The test will come in the months ahead, as MARAD begins issuing draft and final environmental impact statements for pending deepwater port proposals. If timelines improve without compromising safety or environmental integrity, the change may be hailed as the most significant modernization of U.S. offshore-infrastructure policy in decades. If not, critics will claim that Washington has traded expertise for expediency. What is certain is that the stakes are high, both for the projects worth billions of dollars currently languishing in the regulatory pipeline and for America’s broader ambitions to dominate global energy markets through expanded maritime infrastructure.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shutterstock_134979962.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 17:00:39.004632

The industry broke production records in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
Texas energy is not disconnected from global markets, but it is more resilient.
Texas energy remains productive, reliable and the cornerstone of the Texas economy, and is globally essential.","Hello everyone. I'm Todd Staples. We appreciate you joining us for today's release of TxOGA’s 2025 Energy and Economic Impact Report, which details the extraordinary role oil and natural gas play in under-guarding the Texas economy and securing our energy future.

At the conclusion of my prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A, and then we will disseminate a press release with a link to the report, which contains data as well as graphics for your use.

In my 20-plus years of public service to the people of Texas and more than a decade of representing the state's oil and natural gas industry, I can attest to this unwavering truth: in Texas lasting progress is built on performance, not opinion. Talk doesn't grow jobs, keep homes warm or cars running. Action, investment and innovation drive greatness across the Texas economy. And certainly in our industry, results matter, reliability matters. And on that score, the Texas oil and natural gas industry continues to deliver amazing results. Even when dominated by market challenges. I'm proud to say that oil and natural gas have demonstrated once again, to be the power behind Texas progress.

While oil prices decline, the industry delivered another outstanding year of strong economic performance, supporting rising employment, higher wages and critical investments statewide. In fiscal year 2025, the Texas oil and natural gas industry paid $27 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties, the second highest total in Texas history, just 1% less than last year's historic achievement. The industry remains the single largest generator of tax-like revenues per employee, paying seven and a half times more per employee than the rest of the private sector. $27 billion is greater than 34 states’ entire tax revenues. $27 billion translates to nearly $74 million every day that directly funds our public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other essential services for every Texan, whether you live in the oil patch or not.

In FY ’25, Texas school districts received $2.6 billion in property taxes from mineral-producing properties, pipelines and gas utilities. Counties received an additional $1 billion in these property taxes. Oil and natural gas revenue remains the primary source of new capital for the Permanent School Fund and the Permanent University Fund. With those funds receiving $1.4 billion and $1.72 billion respectively. Together, these education endowments exceed $100 billion. With a balance of over $66 billion, the Permanent School Fund alone is larger than Harvard's endowment, and is the largest educational endowment in the nation.

Our state's rainy day fund, or economic stabilization fund, has received over $35.9 billion from oil and natural gas production taxes since its inception in 1987. In FY ’25 the Rainy Day Fund and the State Highway Fund each received $2.7 billion from oil and natural gas production taxes. And since 2007, when Texas first started compiling this data, the Texas oil and natural gas industry has paid more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in state and local taxes and state royalties. This figure does not include the hundreds of billions of dollars paid annually in payroll for some of the highest paying jobs in the state, or the royalties paid directly to Texas families. Nor does it include tax assistance buildings and personal property and the enormous economic ripple effect that benefits other sectors of the economy.

After accounting for both the quantifiable direct and indirect benefits to the economy, the Texas oil and natural gas industry supported $779 billion for the Texas economy. That's 31% of the total private sector Texas GSP. More than 495,500 Texans have a direct job in oil and natural gas, earning an average of $133,000 per year, 68% more than the average paid by the rest of Texas private sector. Conservatively, these jobs generate approximately two more jobs, with nearly 1.4 million total jobs supported across the Texas economy. Some economic analyzes suggest that the industry's employment total over two million jobs supported by the industry across Texas.

Despite market challenges, the oil and natural gas industry shattered another string of records in FY 2025. The industry broke production records in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. This production triplet alongside increased direct use of NGOs and refining and record low crude oil imports demonstrates how Texas continues to adapt by increasingly utilizing resources produced within the state.

Throughout the fiscal year, pipeline and LNG export infrastructure continue to expand, fortifying our own energy security and contributing to global energy stability for our allies. The figures associated with these records are included in this year's Annual Report.

Operational and economic milestones coincided with another year of unmatched environmental performance. Industry led initiatives like the Texas Methane and Propane Coalition and the environmental partnership are dramatically reducing flaring, consistently achieving flaring rates of less than 1%, meaning more than 99% of natural gas produced in Texas was being beneficially used. Operators are working to eliminate routine flaring entirely by 2030 with many companies ahead of schedule.

The consistent performance of the oil and natural gas industry does not happen by chance. It reflects Texas’ long standing commitment to reliability over rhetoric and pragmatism over politics. A fair, predictable regulatory and legal framework, paired with a pro-infrastructure posture, has allowed innovation, investment and responsible development to flourish. Policy makers recognize that science-based rules and free market principles deliver affordable energy, a strong grid and broad-based economic opportunity. Sustaining our progress requires policies that build on success.

Texas is also positioned to lead in emerging technologies like carbon capture and storage and produce water recycling and reuse. I'm especially proud of the collaborative work between industry, academia, the Railroad Commission, TCEQ, the Texas Water and Seismicity Partnership, Produce Water Consortium at Texas Tech University, TexNet , and the Center for Injection and Seismicity Research, our cooperative, deliberative efforts to develop science-based, consensus-driven policies will unlock new solutions while supporting responsible development statewide.

These future opportunities require infrastructure. To maintain Texas current trajectory, we must continue to invest in pipelines, water systems, electricity generation, and transmission to drive growth reliability and opportunity across Texas.

Against this backdrop of strong performance and opportunities before us, it's important to address the broader market commentary shaping perceptions about the year ahead. Some have characterized the outlook for 2026 as a so-called year of the glut, pointing to projections that global supply could exceed demand. We do not see evidence of a disorderly oversupply. What we see instead are markets adjusting, not breaking. Much of the additional supply reflects long lead projects sanctioned years ago, not reckless new investment.

At the same time, global energy demand continues to grow and is repeatedly surprised to the upside, even amid economic uncertainty. U.S. production growth, including in Texas, is being driven by productivity gains and efficiency, not unsustainable capital expansion.

For Texans, it's important to look past the headlines. Texas energy is not disconnected from global markets, but it is more resilient. Productivity, infrastructure, investment, and export capacity all matter. And that is the core message of this year's Energy and Economic Impact Report. Texas energy remains productive, reliable and the cornerstone of the Texas economy, and is globally essential. Even in volatile markets, fundamentals, not sentiment, continue to drive outcomes for our economy and for consumers.

At a time when the energy debates are often driven by competing narratives, the Energy and Economic Impact Report focuses on facts. It underscores a simple truth, Texas runs on oil and natural gas, and it's made possible by hundreds of thousands of skilled men and women who rise before the sun every day to keep our economy moving and our community secure.

We look forward to continuing our partnership with state leaders and communities to keep Texas powered prosperous and prepared for what comes next. We appreciate you joining us today.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/riogrande/original/20260109-163130-f96-Todd_Staples.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 16:59:57.528442

This program ensures that industrial users comply with local, state, and federal regulations by monitoring and managing the types of waste entering the sewer system and the facilities that treat the water from the sanitary sewers.

IPP protects the infrastructure of the sanitary collection system by developing ordinances, issuing permits when necessary to industrial users, by conducting inspections and sampling events throughout the system, by evaluating compliance of industrial users in our jurisdiction, and by taking enforcement action as appropriate.

Did you know?

Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) is defined by the EPA as any intercepting sewers, outfall sewers, sewage collection systems, pumping, power, and other equipment including the POTW treatment plant.

Significant Industrial Users (SIUs) are defined by the EPA as facilities that discharge 25,000 gallons or more of process wastewater per day; contribute a process waste stream making up 5% or more of the POTW’s capacity; are designated by the Control Authority due to potential for impact on the system.

Any non-residential user that discharges process wastewater into the public sanitary collection system, especially those classified as SIUs, must comply with pretreatment regulations.

National IPP Standards

The Clean Water Act (CWA) of 1972 was passed by Congress to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation’s waters. Since POTWs are designed to only treat typical household wastes and biodegradable commercial/industrial wastes, and to address “indirect dischargers” to waters of the U.S. from industrial discharges to public sewers, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), through CWA authorities, established the National Pretreatment Program.

The National Pretreatment Program requires industrial and commercial dischargers to treat or control pollutants in their wastewater prior to discharge to POTWs. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), in its role as approval authority, oversees the development and implementation of local pretreatment programs in the state.

Below are the EPA’s six minimum required pretreatment program elements:

1. Legal Authority

The POTW must operate pursuant to legal authority enforceable in federal, state or local courts, which authorizes or enables the POTW to apply and enforce any pretreatment requirements developed pursuant to the CWA and implementing regulations. At a minimum, the legal authority must enable the POTW to

i. Deny or condition discharges to the POTW;

ii. Requi14re compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements;

iii. Control IU discharges through permits18, orders, or similar means;

iv. Require IU compliance schedules when necessary to meet applicable pretreatment standards and/or requirements and the submission of reports to demonstrate compliance

v. Inspect and monitor IUs

vi. Obtain remedies for IU noncompliance; and

vii. Comply with confidentiality requirements.

2. Procedures

The POTW must develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with pretreatment requirements, including

i. Identifying and locating all IUs subject to the pretreatment program;

ii. Identifying the character and volume of pollutants contributed by such users;

iii. Notifying users of applicable pretreatment standards and requirements;

iv. Receiving and analyzing reports 39from IUs;

v. Sampling and analyzing IU discharges;

vi. Evaluating the need for IU slug control plans;

vii. Investigating instances 45of noncompliance; and

viii. Complying with public participation requirements.

3. Funding

The POTW must have sufficient resources and qualified personnel to carry out the authorities and procedures specified in its approved pretreatment program.

4. Local Limits

The POTW must develop local limits in defined circumstances or demonstrate why these limits are not necessary.

5. Enforcement Response Plan (ERP)

The POTW must develop and implement an ERP that contains detailed procedures indicating how the POTW will investigate and respond to instances of IU noncompliance.

6. List of SIUs

The POTW must prepare, update, and submit to the Approval Authority a list of all SIUs and where applicable, indicate which SIUs are NSCIUs or MTCIUs.",https://www.boynton-beach.org/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-09 20:00:28.574543

This target was aggressive even at the time, set against federal policies like the $7,500 EV tax credit that aimed to boost adoption. The plan required massive investments in battery production and EV models, but demand has not materialized as expected.

Following the elimination of the tax credit on Sept. 30, GM’s EV sales tumbled 43% in the fourth quarter, prompting the company to halt production at two joint-venture battery plants for six months, reduce shifts at its Detroit EV factory, and repurpose a Michigan plant originally slated for EVs to build gas-powered Cadillac Escalades and full-size pickups instead.

Ford’s More Pragmatic Edge

Other manufacturers set more tempered goals. Ford, for example, targeted half of its global vehicle volume to be hybrids, extended-range EVs, or full battery EVs by 2030, up from 17% in 2025 — a mix that proved less disastrous than GM’s all-EV push. Ford’s $19.5 billion charge covered pivoting factories, like converting a Tennessee plant from EV pickup production to gasoline models, and redirecting battery capacity to energy storage.

Toyota (NYSE:TM) adopted arguably the most realistic approach with an all-of-the-above strategy, emphasizing hybrids that address consumer concerns like range anxiety and charging infrastructure gaps. Toyota’s hybrid focus has paid off, as hybrids now outsell pure EVs in popularity. U.S. EV sales growth slowed to 1.2% in 2025 and is projected at just 6% market share in 2026, down from 7.4% last year.

GM’s ambitions appear worse than Ford’s because GM went all-in on battery EVs, largely bypassing hybrids. This left GM vulnerable when EV demand collapsed after policy shifts, including the tax credit repeal under the One Big Beautiful Bill signed in July.

Ford, by contrast, offers a wide range of hybrids, such as the 2026 Escape Hybrid and Plug-In Hybrid, plus the F-150 PowerBoost V6 hybrid. These options provide flexibility, helping Ford maintain profitability in a market where hybrids are surging.

Worse for GM, analysts note it has limited hybrid exposure, which could erode its recent market share gains, while Ford’s diversified lineup positions it to meet buyer demands more effectively.

Key Takeaway

GM made numerous mistakes in its EV journey, pursuing aggressive electrification without widespread proven demand for pure EVs. The company’s 2035 gas phase-out ignored market realities, leading to overinvestment in batteries and suppliers now resulting in multibillion-dollar charges. It also warned that the $6 billion charge won’t be the last it takes. The EV fever dream GM suffered under will continue to be felt for some time to come.

With federal policies significantly changed — including the end of consumer EV incentives — GM stands to lose market share as it refocuses on giving buyers what they actually want, like gas and hybrid options, instead of what policies were once pushed. It makes Ford’s balanced approach the stronger long-term bet in the challenging auto market.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/imageforentry37-1at.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 18:00:15.310825

TCEQ’s stated motivation for advancing the ECO process is efficiency. This new enforcement path will enable eligible respondents with qualifying violations to skip the current time-consuming enforcement process in favor of a formulaic, true-to-its-name Expedited Compliance Order. TCEQ hopes the process will achieve: (1) faster overall time-to-compliance for all regulated facilities and (2) a reduction in the agency’s backlog of pending enforcement matters. TCEQ plans to offer respondents that elect to use an ECO significant penalty reductions (up to 50 percent of the base penalty), if they bring their facilities back into compliance within 60 days.

Who is eligible for an Expedited Compliance Order?

The ECO process will be open to all TCEQ-regulated entities, provided they meet the following criteria:

The respondent has no active or pending matters before the Office of the Attorney General;

The respondent has no pending or active default, shutdown, or revocation orders at any of its facilities;

The respondent has no outstanding, unpaid penalties or fees;

The respondent and regulated facility have not been offered an ECO for the same violation within the past two years; and

The respondent is not a TCEQ-designated “Repeat Violator” or “Unsatisfactory Performer.”

Which violations qualify for an Expedited Compliance Order?

ECOs will only be available for violations with no significant impacts on the human environment. At the public meetings, TCEQ explained that “actual” events like emissions events, releases, or spills generally will not qualify for the ECO process given their impacts and often lengthy remediation timelines. TCEQ did advise that under rare circumstances, extremely low-impact actual events could conceivably qualify for an ECO depending on how TCEQ investigators categorize the level of harm to public health and the environment. TCEQ will publish a comprehensive list of all violations which may be resolved via an ECO before the program is finalized. While the agency has not yet shared its list, it has shared, at the public meeting, that the current draft includes: 102 types of drinking water violations, 76 types of waste violations, 11 types of water violations, and four types of air violations.

All of the violations in the applicable Notice of Enforcement must be enumerated in TCEQ’s published list of qualifying violations. TCEQ indicated it would not “split” an enforcement matter into ECO-qualifying and non-qualifying cases.

What must a respondent do to obtain an ECO?

To resolve a Notice of Enforcement through an ECO, the respondent must be able to resolve all of the violations within 60 days of receipt of notice from the TCEQ. TCEQ explained that this truncated timeline is one of the reasons more serious violations — like unauthorized emissions and discharges — are ineligible for ECOs; if the violations take more than 60 days to correct, they are ineligible for an ECO. Violations that are not resolved in 60 days will be rerouted to TCEQ’s standard enforcement process. As an example, in circumstances where the purchase, delivery and installation of equipment necessary to correct a violation would take more than 60 days after the Notice of Enforcement was issued, the violation would not qualify for an ECO. As another example, if resolving a violation involved additional permitting that would require more than 60 days, the respondent would likewise be unable to take advantage of the ECO process.

What are the benefits of the ECO program?

The public would benefit from quicker compliance, the agency would recover enforcement capacity, and respondents would be able to quickly resolve enforcement matters with a significant reduction in penalties.

The penalty reductions would be based in the existing Penalty Policy. For example, a 50 percent overall penalty reduction would consist of a 20 percent reduction from the respondent’s expedited deferral, a 20 percent reduction from the respondent’s good faith effort, and a 10 percent reduction from the respondent’s satisfactory compliance history.

Like any other administrative enforcement order, TCEQ will publish a proposed Agreed Order and a proposed penalty in the Texas Register for a 30-day public comment period. However, because violation characteristics that are normally evaluated in a Penalty Calculation Worksheet (PCW) are mostly fixed, threshold criteria to an ECO — effectively pre-answered — a PCW is unnecessary and will not be issued as part of the ECO process.

When will the ECO program go live?

As a formal enforcement policy, the ECO process requires approval by the TCEQ Commissioners. TCEQ indicated it expects the policy to be reviewed at either the TCEQ’s second agenda meeting in January 2026 or the first agenda meeting in February 2026. TCEQ will not be accepting formal comments, but will hear public comments at its agenda meeting.

Meta Platforms has stated that it has struck 20-year agreements to buy power from three Vistra nuclear plants in the U.S. heartland and develop projects with two companies hoping to build small modular reactors.

Shares of Oklo surged nearly 20 per cent, whereas Vistra rose about 8 per cent in premarket trade.

Meta and other Big Tech companies want to secure long-term electricity supplies as artificial intelligence and data centres increase U.S. power demand for the first time in two decades.

The company stated in a blog that it will purchase power from Vistra’s Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio, as well as the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania.

Meta said the deal will help finance expansion at the Ohio plants and extend the lifespan of the plants, which are licensed to operate through at least 2036, with one of the two reactors at Beaver Valley licensed through 2047.

Meta will also help develop small modular reactors planned by Oklo and TerraPower, the latter of which is backed by billionaire Bill Gates.

SMR backers say the reactors will one day save costs because they can be built in factories instead of on-site. Critics argue that they will struggle to achieve economies of scale comparable to those of current large reactors. There are no U.S. SMRs in commercial operations yet, and the plants will require permits.

Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, said the plans, along with its agreement last year with Constellation to keep an Illinois reactor operating for 20 years, will “make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history.”

The agreements will provide up to 6.6 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2035, Meta said. The size of a typical nuclear power plant is about 1 GW. In 2024, Meta sought interest from nuclear power developers for 1 to 4 gigawatts of nuclear power.

Meta will help fund TerraPower’s development of two reactors to generate up to 690 megawatts of power as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other TerraPower reactors by 2035. TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said the agreement will support the rapid deployment of reactors.

Meta said its partnership with Oklo will help develop up to 1.2 GW of energy in Ohio as early as 2030.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have be shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

This comes on top of a $1.6 billion charge disclosed in October, also related to changes in the company’s EV strategy.

The move highlights the growing financial strain facing traditional automakers after President Donald Trump rolled back federal policies designed to accelerate the adoption of zero-emissions vehicles. Those policies had played a major role in shaping the industry’s aggressive push toward electrification over the past several years.

Like many of its peers, GM invested heavily in EV development during the Biden administration, anticipating stricter environmental regulations and expecting more states to follow California’s lead in banning gasoline-powered vehicle sales within the next decade. At one point, GM had even set a bold goal: producing only electric vehicles by 2035.

However, the regulatory landscape has shifted. The Trump administration has reversed key emissions rules, reduced financial incentives for EV buyers, and challenged states’ authority to enforce tougher environmental standards. As a result, automakers are recalibrating their long-term plans.

Despite this retreat, electric vehicles are far from disappearing. Demand remains solid in the United States and continues to grow rapidly in several international markets. GM’s decision reflects a slowdown, not a full stop.

A large portion of GM’s $6 billion charge will be used to settle canceled contracts with parts suppliers affected by the revised EV plans. The announcement follows a similar move by Ford, which revealed in December that it would take a massive $19.5 billion charge tied to changes in its own electric vehicle strategy.

GM has not said it will discontinue any specific EV models, nor has it announced factory closures or new job cuts. However, in October, the company revealed it would eliminate one shift at its Factory Zero EV plant in Detroit, placing 1,200 hourly workers on indefinite layoff. Additionally, 550 workers at an EV battery plant in Ohio were also laid off indefinitely.

The EV market itself has shown signs of volatility. Sales surged through the summer and September, driven largely by buyers rushing to take advantage of a $7,500 federal tax credit before its scheduled expiration. But industry-wide EV sales dropped sharply in the fourth quarter, both compared to the previous year and from the record-breaking third quarter.

Still, GM CEO Mary Barra struck a measured tone when speaking to investors in October. “Electric vehicles remain our North Star,” she said, while acknowledging that sales of traditional gasoline-powered cars and trucks “will remain higher for longer.”

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) – California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing $200 million in new state electric-vehicle tax rebates after Congress earlier this year ended a federal $7,500 state ‍tax deduction on new EVs, the state said on Friday.

In late 2024, Newsom said if President Donald Trump eliminated a federal EV tax credit, he would propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize 586,000 ‌vehicles over a decade. EV sales fell sharply ‌in the final three months of 2024 after the federal tax credit expired on September 30.

The legislation ending the $7,500 new federal EV tax credit also ended a $4,000 used EV credit.

On Friday, the California Air Resources ​Board said it was not yet clear how much per vehicle the state may offer in tax rebates.

Automakers are grappling with ‍the fallout of fewer EV sales.

Chrysler-parent ​Stellantis said on Friday it will stop selling ​its plug‑in hybrid electric Jeep Wrangler and Grand Cherokee in North ‍America, while General Motors , opens new tab said Thursday it would take a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments.

The federal government, effective October 1, barred states from allowing electric vehicles and other clean cars to use carpool lanes without meeting vehicle occupancy requirements.

California ‍and other states had used the perk to encourage sales of EVs. Trump has taken aim at EVs on a number of fronts including ‍signing legislation in ‍June to bar California’s electric vehicle sales mandates. In ​July, the administration told automakers a new law ​signed ⁠by Trump will not require them to pay ‌any fines for failures to meet fuel-efficiency rules dating back to the 2022 model year.

The administration is making other changes that will save automakers billions of dollars in purchasing credits from Tesla and others to meet prior regulatory requirements.

And in Boston, a centuries-old ban on shellfish harvesting is coming to an end in certain parts of Boston Harbor.","A new report finds that 2025 was a banner year for climate disasters in the worst way. Beginning with the destructive Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles in January, major floods in China, India, Pakistan and Texas, and deadly hurricanes, Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean, and ending with cyclones that struck Southeast Asia in November.

On top of thousands of deaths, the economic loss from the world’s top-10 climate disasters was high: $120 billion.

“Climate change is really expensive,” said Dr. Gaurab Basu, assistant professor of global health & social medicine at Harvard Medical School. “Climate solutions are much more affordable. There’s nothing I can see that’s as expensive as the impacts of climate change and intervening to prevent those financial costs.”

And experts believe the $120 billion is an underestimate: It doesn’t include long-term environmental effects, loss of livelihood or, as Basu adds, the health repercussions to the people and their environments.

In the United States, the Trump administration has taken a hard-line opposition to certain types of renewable-energy sources, particularly wind and solar. But in Massachusetts, clean-energy initiatives like battery storage are moving forward.

“We need battery storage to be able to meet the grid,” said Cabell Eames, chief strategist for Castling Strategies, which supports climate, clean-energy and resilience advocacy statewide. “We need battery storage so that when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing, we’ve got that energy stored and we can put it out.”

Eames said that although it may take some time for the battery-storage facilities to be brought online, including a proposed one in Everett, the fact that plans are being green-lit and supported by leaders is a “win-win” for the state.

And in Boston, a centuries-old ban on shellfish harvesting is coming to an end in certain parts of Boston Harbor. A recent analysis from the state’s Division of Marine Fisheries found that Winthrop, Hingham and Hull are safe for shellfishing, meaning that oysters, mussels and clams from Boston Harbor could end up on dinner plates by late 2026.

Beth Daley, general manager and executive editor of The Conversation U.S., said this is a terrific step for the city and showcases just how far environmental clean-up efforts have succeeded locally.

So, would she eat shellfish from Boston Harbor? Daley gave a resounding “yes.”

“This is so exciting,” Daley said. “I trust science. I trust that the water is clean enough. It’s awesome! It will take time to convince people, but it’s fantastic.”

All that and more on this week’s environmental news roundtable!

The Sierra Club, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) filed a motion to reconsider Georgia Power’s “Requests for Proposals,” or RFP, which the PSC approved on Dec. 19. Georgia Power’s plan could lock Georgia ratepayers into higher utility bills for decades while expanding methane gas plants that will pollute Georgia communities until 2075. The PSC’s own staff estimates customer bills could go up about $20 per month and customers would pay $50-60 billion over the next 50 years.

Despite clear evidence that Georgia Power does not need to procure 10 gigawatts of resources by 2031 —including the unnecessary, overly expensive 757-megawatt Plant McIntosh gas plant— the Commission approved the company’s plan anyway. The Sierra Club, SELC and SACE’s motion asks the Commission to reconsider its decision in light of the record.

""The PSC approving Georgia Power’s RFP will line the pockets of corporate executives and shareholders while hardworking Georgians will be left to foot the bill for the most costly fossil fuel expansion in the country. All in the name of speculative data centers that hog power and water in our local communities,” said Michael Hawthorne, Campaign Organizing Strategist for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign. “This lame duck PSC has delivered another blow to Georgians and the PSC must reconsider the RFP.”

“This approval by the PSC gives Georgia Power the largest and most expensive grid expansion in the country. This is state-sanctioned corporate welfare approved by two lame duck commissioners with one foot out the door, and it’s exactly the business-as-usual approach that voters overwhelmingly rejected at the ballot box in November,” said Adrien Webber, Sierra Club Georgia Chapter Director. “The RFP should be reconsidered now that Commissioners Johnson and Hubbard have been seated.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-09 17:59:51.859877

Looking exclusively at onshore wind energy, an especially dynamic picture emerges: from January to December 2025, net additions amounted to 4,501 MW.","Münster (Germany) - The German wind energy market is on a growth trajectory in 2025. Over the full year, more than 5,400 MW (2024: 4,045 MW) of new wind power capacity were commissioned on a gross basis. The results of the latest onshore wind tender are contributing to the expectation that Germany’s expansion pace will remain on track in the coming years.

The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur, BNetzA) has published the awards from the latest tender round. The bid submission deadline was November 1, 2025. With a submitted bid volume of 8,155 MW, a new record was achieved. Across all four tender rounds, the BNetzA awarded onshore wind projects totaling 14,445 MW in 2025. Remuneration levels continue to decline and are well below the maximum value of 7.35 euro cents per kilowatt-hour.

2025 onshore wind tenders reach an award volume of 14,445 MW - all rounds heavily oversubscribed

As in previous rounds, the tender held on November 1, 2025 was clearly oversubscribed. For a tendered volume of 3,450 megawatts (MW), 905 bids were submitted, totaling a record volume of 8,155 MW. Ultimately, 415 bids amounting to 3,456 MW were awarded contracts. According to the BNetzA, 37 bids were excluded.

The average volume-weighted award value fell to 6.06 ct/kWh (previous round: 6.57 ct/kWh), significantly below the maximum value of 7.35 ct/kWh. Bid values ranged between 5.80 and 6.12 ct/kWh (previous round: 6.39–6.64 ct/kWh).

“The submitted bid volume of more than 8 GW represents the highest value ever achieved in a tender. Looking at the entire year 2025, it is encouraging that every tender was oversubscribed. At the same time, award values have continued to decline compared with the previous round,” commented Klaus Müller, President of the Federal Network Agency, on the results of the latest tender.

The regional distribution of awards shows that North Rhine-Westphalia once again leads the federal state ranking with 1,093 MW (148 awards). Lower Saxony follows closely behind with 1,091 MW (133 awards). Brandenburg ranks third at a considerable distance with 262 MW (34 awards).

Together with the awards from the February (4,094 MW), May (3,447 MW), and August (3,448 MW) rounds, the BNetzA awarded a record onshore wind capacity of 14,445 MW in total in 2025.

“This puts onshore wind back on the expansion path of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). It is important that the federal government maintains these targets in the upcoming reform of the EEG next year—as agreed in the coalition committee—so that this development is not slowed down. Grid access must also be ensured,” commented Bärbel Heidebroek, President of the German Wind Energy Association (BWE), on the 2025 tender results.

wind energy in Germany: onshore expansion gathers pace in 2025 - offshore grid connection delayed

The tender results provide a clear indication of market development in the coming years. The continued strengthening data from the national wind energy market in 2025 also point to increasing market momentum.

From January to December 2025, according to an initial evaluation of data from the Federal Network Agency’s Market Master Data Register (MaStR) by IWR (as of January 4, 2026), wind turbines with a total gross capacity of 5,414 MW were connected to the grid in Germany (2024: 4,045 MW). After deducting the decommissioning of older turbines, this results in a net increase of around 4,790 MW (2024: 3,296 MW).

These figures include both onshore and offshore installations. Looking exclusively at onshore wind energy, an especially dynamic picture emerges: from January to December 2025, net additions amounted to 4,501 MW. Compared with the previous year 2024, this represents an increase of 76 percent (2024: 2,554 MW).

Offshore, a total of 24 wind turbines with a capacity of 291 MW were commissioned in 2025 at the He Dreiht (960 MW) and Borkum Riffgrund 3 (913 MW) offshore wind farms, both of which are still under construction. As a result, Germany’s offshore wind capacity in operation approached 9,506 MW by the end of 2025, nearing the 10,000 MW mark.

Originally, He Dreiht and Borkum Riffgrund 3 were scheduled to be fully operational in 2025. Assuming that full commissioning of both projects now takes place in 2026 and that the Windanker offshore wind farm in the Baltic Sea (300 MW) is also connected to the grid, Germany’s offshore wind capacity in operation could rise to around 11,500 MW by the end of the year.

The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It’s anticipated to come online this year.

Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.

The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.

“These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,” the company said.

Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.

Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant in Pennsylvania.

The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI’s Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio to support Meta’s data centers in the region.

The nuclear power agreements come after Meta announced in June that it reached a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy.

The question before justices in Chevron v. Plaquemines is whether Chevron can remove the lawsuit from state court to federal court if they are sued over actions connected to federal contracts?

Louisiana disputes the premise entirely, arguing the case against Chevron has nothing to do with a federal contract.

“There is no federal contract that this arises under,” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in an interview. “Hard stop – we win.”

There were indeed federal contracts between the U.S. government and Texaco, later acquired by Chevron, to refine aviation gasoline for the war effort during World War II. But those were purchase agreements, not directives, Louisiana argues – deals that didn’t tell Texaco where to drill, how to operate in Louisiana’s coastal zone or to engage in the conduct the parish is now suing over decades later.

“They just said, ‘We’ll buy it from you,’” Murrill said from Washington, D.C., where she is preparing for Monday’s arguments. “You can get it from anybody you want, and we will buy it from you.”

Murrill’s point is that a procurement contract like that doesn’t make all of a company’s operations federally directed. World War II ended in 1945, she noted, while Plaquemines Parish’s claims center on activities that continued for decades afterward and, in the state’s view, violated Louisiana’s coastal permitting law adopted in 1979.

Chevron, however, will argue that the distinction doesn’t matter. The company says the federal-officer removal statute is intentionally broad — allowing not only federal officers but also private contractors “acting under” them to move cases to federal court when the claims are “for or relating to” work done under federal authority.

The companies say the parishes’ claims over oil-field production are intertwined with the refining that supplied the federal war effort, and that both activities were closely linked and federally supervised during World War II – enough to justify federal jurisdiction.

Meanwhile, Louisiana’s coastal parishes have filed more than 40 similar lawsuits over the past decade, alleging that oil-and-gas operations contributed to the state’s catastrophic land loss. In the first case to reach a jury, Plaquemines Parish won a verdict of about $744.6 million against Chevron.

The companies say those kinds of local verdicts are precisely why Congress created a path to federal court. Supporters argue that allowing such suits to remain in local venues risks bias in favor of local governments with massive sums on the line. Murrill said the total exposure across all the cases is “definitely in the multi-billions.”

Industry supporters warn that if the Supreme Court upholds Louisiana’s position, contractors could hesitate to take on federally directed work for fear of being exposed to local lawsuits decades later. “The question,” said former Justice Department attorney Mike Fragoso, “is whether contractors will keep doing federally directed work if they are exposed to this kind of tort liability down the line.”

The U.S. Solicitor General has sided with Chevron and other companies, requesting and receiving 10 minutes of argument time.

Fragoso pointed out that the case is ultimately about federal supremacy: even though states are sovereigns, the federal government is supreme, and contractors doing the federal government’s work shouldn’t be forced to defend that work in local courts. Fragoso invoked Chief Justice John Marshall’s warning that “the power to tax is the power to destroy,” arguing that the power to hit federal contractors with massive local verdicts can be an even more potent way to undermine federal operations.

“I think that it’s convenient for them to say that,” Murrill said, noting her reputation as a virulent defender of the energy industry. “All the regulations and laws that we have effect now have not inhibited our ability to conduct warfare.”",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/08/Liz-Murrill-1170x780-1.jpg?w=622,N,,2026-01-09 17:00:46.047980

First up was the Wyoming State Geological Survey (WSGS). The agency said only 16% of the state is mapped to scale for mineral resources and geological hazards. Having accurate mapping helps companies and towns plan for future development and energy projects.

WSGS testified they are mapping more of the state every year, with new publications expected soon for the Medicine Bow Mountains. But more mapping takes money, and they’re expecting less funds from the federal government. The agency said they’ll narrow in on higher priority areas and smaller federally funded projects going forward.

The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) bucked a trend of agencies reporting they’re having trouble retaining workers. Director Todd Parfitt said his department’s job vacancy rate is at 5%, compared to 15% two years ago.

Parfitt credited a new program adopted in the Air Quality Division that offers more opportunities for employees to boost their salaries.

“It just kind of drives home the point that we need to always consider the salary adjustments when we can,” Parfitt said. “In the long run, I think it saves the state money.”

He said he’d like to adopt something similar for his employees working on uranium projects, where turnover remains high.

The Wyoming Energy Authority (WEA) didn’t ask the state for additional funds. Executive Director Rob Creager gave a general agency update focusing on both policy and incentive work.

Policy-wise, Creager said WEA has gone from “defense to offense” because of Pres. Trump’s directives, like the Unleashing American Energy executive order that aims to boost fossil fuel production. Creager highlighted the $100 million federal funds being allocated to reinvigorate old coal plants, and he’s hoping some of that money will come to Wyoming.

However, Wyoming’s Naughton coal plant fully switched to natural gas at the end of 2025.

Creager was recently appointed to the National Coal Council. Rep. John Bear (R-Gillette) specifically asked Creager to convey to D.C. stakeholders that “we are ready to build coal fired power plants, and provide the coal for those not just here in Wyoming but across the country.”

However, economists and analysts still project a downward decline in coal production and a continued shift to renewables and natural gas.

Creager spoke about WEA’s incentives. He first focused on the state’s Energy Matching Funds Program, which was created by the Legislature in 2022. Over a couple of appropriations, the fund had $155 million to divvy out to companies innovating energy solutions, like carbon capture retrofits on coal plants and a FEED study [Front-End Engineering Design] for building a new coal plant.

WEA has awarded funds to 27 projects, and said that a third-party review of those investments is expected to return $1.2 billion over the next decade.

The fund is down to its last $13 million, and is currently reviewing potential future recipients. The governor has the final say on which projects are selected, which has been a point of scrutiny by state lawmakers in recent years.

A similar, but separate, program is the Large Project Energy Matching Funds. The Legislature approved $100 million to create the fund in 2024. The entire pot of money was awarded to BWXT in December. The company is proposing a nuclear fuel manufacturing facility near Gillette.

WEA is not asking for more money for either energy matching fund. Bear asked Creager if lawmakers should be expecting a letter from the governor with a funding request, and Creager said, “Not that I'm aware of.” Without additional funding, the future of the programs are a bit in question.

Sen. Ogden Driscoll (R-Devils Tower) asked if this will hurt Wyoming’s ability to attract energy companies to the state. He pointed out that other states have similar energy incentive programs.

“If we get in a dollar to dollar war with a state like Texas, we’re gonna lose,” said Creager. “They’ve got more money than we do.”

Creager added that Wyoming’s partnership with companies and plentiful resources can give the state an edge. However, he said it didn’t work in the state’s favor for attracting a uranium conversion plant. Creager said there’s only one serving the U.S. market for the last 60 years and it’s nearing retirement.

“Whoever gets that new one will probably cover the market,” Creager said, adding WEA has been in talks with a company looking to do so. “They’ve been very frank with us that Texas has X amount on the table ready to roll. What do we have? We have more uranium up here, so that’s an advantage, but right now that’s not tipping the scales enough for them to make that move.”

On November 17th, 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) proposed a new rule making, Updated Definition of ‘‘Waters of the United States’’ (Docket ID EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322) that will substantially reduce the amount of wetlands, streams, and other water bodies subject to federal regulation. What that means is it is easier to develop and destroy these critically important ecosystems, which have already undergone significant losses.

The proposed rule aims to change several definitions of what a “Waters of the US” (WOTUS) means. These definitions are used to determine what waterbodies are federally regulated, and therefore, subject to a permit. The permits ensure that water quality is not degraded and that there is no net loss of wetlands. However, with the newly proposed rule, it is estimated that over 80 million miles of stream and 38 to 70 million acres of wetlands are at risk, meaning no permit will be needed to destroy these ecosystems.

The rule substantially reduces what waterways are not regulated because it bends science to meet other objectives. It will narrow the scope of what a WOTUS is, aiming to require federally regulated waters to be permanent and continuously connected, rather than acknowledging the ephemeral and ever changing nature of water and wetlands. The proposed changes are a continuation of the Trump administration’s constant effort to reduce protections for wetlands and streams to facilitate development and exploration across the county, and reflects their complete disregard for science-based policy.

The rule underwent a 45-day comment period which commenced on January 5th, 2026. Hoosier Environmental Council joined forces on two different fronts, signing on to comments written by the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Water Protection Network, calling on the agencies to withdraw the proposed rule.

The EV tax credit ended in September.
GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.
Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.
Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world's largest EV automaker, replaced by China's BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.","General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the world's largest EV automaker, replaced by China's BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Also Friday, Netherlands-based Stellantis, said that due to shifting customer demand it would “phase out plug in hybrid (PHEV) programs in North America beginning with the 2026 model year, and focus on more competitive electrified solutions.” Stellantis owns Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and other carmakers.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AUU_RUehHxrRi3O0a95jIQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap_finance_articles_694/f73f9073250ea30665db8dbc430c0e14,N,,2026-01-09 20:59:07.634013

And you cannot turn your back on the hardworking men of the labor movement here on Long Island by stealing their jobs.
Let's fight because you're not just fighting for the jobs of today you're fighting for the jobs of tomorrow.","Earlier today, Governor Kathy Hochul rallied with union leaders in Suffolk County to save Long Island jobs following the Trump Administration’s stop work orders on two fully permitted New York offshore wind projects that are under construction.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

Thank you John, thank you everyone, thank you Kevin. Thank you IBEW Local 25 for hosting us here today. Is the union membership in the house today? Are you ready to fight like hell with me to save your jobs? Then I'm in the right place because I'm going to be a little crass here, but I'm really pissed off, and so are you.

Because one thing that we work so hard for in our State, is to create good paying jobs for the future, for our people — and we did it. We leaned hard into an energy future. We decided we'd have training and apprenticeship programs, have our unions get excited about this, be part of the coalition along with our environmental experts and advocates like Adrienne Esposito and Julie Tighe, you'll be hearing from them.

But we pulled it all together, billions of dollars have already been spent. The work's been going on for years. We're just about to turn it on in 2027 and start seeing the benefits of clean energy from offshore wind. And I'm telling you right now, as I'm planning our energy future and something the Governor has to do, I'm counting on this power for the grid.

I'm counting on it to head off brownouts or blackouts and don't think that's just an idle threat my friends, that is not an idle threat. I can't tell you how close we were last summer during a very intense heat wave. We almost had a blackout because we did not have enough power on the grid.

So I've been counting on offshore wind to sustain us and move us forward so we can keep the lights on here on Long Island and across the State. So here we are, I know the power of the union movement. You may not know this about me, but I've got union blood running through my veins. I may be from Buffalo, but I'm also the daughter of steelworkers, the granddaughter of steelworkers.

My uncles are longshoremen, carpenters, plumbers. They help build the economy where I come from, a steel town, a tough, gritty place. That actually prepares you very well for the rough and tumble of politics. So I'm used to a fight, but this is one we have to stand united with the business community, the elected officials, labor, and our environmental community as well.

So think about the power of that coalition, we need to drive change. And how does that happen? Yes, we come together and speak with one voice. Get it on the media, let people know what this means to us. But also, there are elected officials right here on Long Island who need to feel the pressure. They need to know that this is not the future that you envision, that you train for, that you've worked hard for, or the future that we want to leave for our kids.

So I say this, raise up your voices, show up at their offices, push them on social media, whatever you know how to do. Because I know when you want something from me, I know you're pretty strong. Okay just saying ....just saying. But I also just want to say something. I so believe in this. I've been at the ribbon cuttings and the groundbreakings and all the milestones and just so excited. I've been in this business, even back when I was Lieutenant Governor, I'd never missed one of these events, but why at this point, we're just about to unleash the incredible power of wind for our people — after all the work, the dangerous work that's being done by our union members, it's dangerous out there. They work all through the winter, they put their lives in jeopardy because they so believe in the mission. Why at this moment in time, we're on the cusp of doing something we're so proud of unleashing this power that we have a President so hostile to what we're doing, that he literally on December 22nd issued an order that said, stop.

Literally, it is called a stop work order. And what is the premise behind this? I called because I asked. I called the Secretary of Interior, what is going on here? What is the issue here? And I'm told, I'm not making this up, National security. I'm thinking, isn't it long understood that energy independence is national security that we're able to provide our own wind without having to get oil from other countries. Like this is part of becoming more strategic in protecting our people. It is a National Security strategy to have our own wind source and our own solar sources and our own battery storage and hydro and thermal and everything else we can think of.

We're going to keep doing that. So I said, can you explain this to me because I'm the Governor of the State of New York. If there is a national security threat off the shores of my state, you better give me a briefing right now. because I want to know what it is because I actually didn't believe them. It's all about the radar.

I guess they're expecting long range missiles to come from somewhere, I don't know what they're expecting, it is B.S. It is made up because we've had wind in other parts of our country. Places in Europe have had this. There is an issue with radar and there's a way to solve it, the companies know this.

The companies are doing it. They're doing everything they're asked to do because I talked to CEOs just yesterday. So they're just making up the pretext to shut this down so they can make sure that their oil and gas benefactors and donors can continue on the path that they're on — without allowing us to have our all the above approach strategy, which the foundation of which is wind and solar for us in New York.

So they just want to shut us down to help their rich buddies, and we're just not going to take that in New York. We're going to continue to stand up and I want you to mobilize a movement here because so much is on the line, so much is on the line. Don't be silenced, they want you to say this is the President, it's Washington, there's nothing we can do. Don't be subdued into submission here. We must rise up because this is our moment and I'll do my part.

I don't mind going into any room talking to anybody because I have. That's very strange conversations, and a lot of it initially was hostility toward wind because of the birds.

I didn't know the president was such a beloved naturalist now, I'm going to protect it. Okay, so that was the excuse. Last spring, we fought hard to get Empire wind turned back on because I said, “Mr. President, there are 1,800 good paying union jobs that you just killed.” And we got that turned back on.

This time, they're buying the national security crap, the Department of Defense. And my friends, I'm not done with this fight either. So together I feel confident that rising up with one voice, and I'm telling you to put pressure on members of Congress' offices who do not support your position right now — I'm going to let them know there are consequences to that, there are consequences. You cannot turn your back on the Long Island economy. You cannot turn your back on our environmental justice movement. You cannot turn your back on the businesses who work so hard here and are contributing to our societies. And you cannot turn your back on the hardworking men of the labor movement here on Long Island by stealing their jobs.

We're not putting up with that, we're going to fight back. We have a right to chart our energy future and our own independence without being stopped by a hostile government in Washington. So my friends, let's carry on. Let's take up the mantle. Let's fight because you're not just fighting for the jobs of today you're fighting for the jobs of tomorrow. And the future, a clean future for our children.

Thank you very much everyone. Thank you for coming out today. Thanks for standing strong, thank you labor. Let me bring up Matty Aracich, the President of the Nassau Suffolk Building and Construction Trades because I know he's just as pissed off as I am as well.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2026-01/offshore_hero_1.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=wQ60-zR6,N,,2026-01-09 16:59:20.998157

The lack of EV tax credits, combined with more affordable gas, can result in a prolonged correction for EV stocks and electric vehicle deliveries.
Oil infrastructure is far more robust, with all of the gas stations that line up U.S. streets and highways.
Any shift to traditional vehicles over electric vehicles will create more headwinds for EV infrastructure companies.","Electric vehicle stocks haven’t fared well ever since the EV tax credit expired on September 30, 2025. While some companies delivered excellent results leading up to the deadline, that’s more of a reflection of last-second buyers than a long-term trend that puts electric vehicles back on top.

The EV boom peaked during the pandemic, with SPACs making the public markets more accessible to questionable companies like Nikola Motors. While investors are always looking for good opportunities to buy dips, the drops in EV stocks may not be the best opportunities. These are some of the reasons why.

A Major Incentive Is Gone

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the leading EV maker in the U.S., and even its status as a luxury auto manufacturer couldn’t save it from declining market share. The company delivered 418,227 vehicles in Q4 2025, which is a decline from 495,570 deliveries in Q4 2024. That’s a 15.6% year-over-year decline.

It’s also an accelerated dip from Tesla’s overall decrease in deliveries in the full-year 2025. The automaker delivered 1.6 million vehicles in 2025 compared to 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, marking an 8.6% year-over-year decline. Q4 2025 is the first full quarter of the EV tax credit’s expiration. The drop was immediate for Tesla and accelerated heading into the end of 2025.

Tesla wasn’t the only EV maker to sell fewer vehicles. Competitors like Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) also lost market share. Buying an EV was once a path to a tax credit of up to $7,500. That’s a major incentive, and now it’s gone. Many consumers have followed suit and feel less inclined to buy electric vehicles.

Trump’s Push Into Venezuela And Greenland Can Reduce Oil Costs

President Trump’s recent capture of Venezuelan President Maduro and his desire to acquire Greenland can dramatically increase the U.S. oil supply, and that will translate into lower gas prices. As the cost of fuel goes down, more people will want to drive traditional vehicles over electric cars.

It’s another headwind for electric vehicles, and although Trump hasn’t fully capitalized on this opportunity, oil prices are already falling. The lack of EV tax credits, combined with more affordable gas, can result in a prolonged correction for EV stocks and electric vehicle deliveries.

EV Infrastructure May Also Face Setbacks

Reduced demand for electric vehicles isn’t just bad for automakers. It also hurts the companies that install EV chargers across the country. Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) is officially a penny stock and has resorted to crypto payment offerings at select stations to boost demand. ChargePoint (NASDAQ:CHPT) is another struggling EV infrastructure stock that is down by more than 70% this year due to stalled revenue growth and significant net losses.

Oil infrastructure is far more robust, with all of the gas stations that line up U.S. streets and highways. Any shift to traditional vehicles over electric vehicles will create more headwinds for EV infrastructure companies. Those same companies may go out of business due to excessive debt and declining demand. In that scenario, the EV makers suddenly become responsible for scaling their infrastructure in addition to selling vehicles.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190848931-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 15:59:42.560550
,Detroit Environment,2026-01-09 20:26:29+00:00,Detroitisit,How One Organization Is Rewriting The Story Of Demolition In Detroit - Detroitisit,"Kim Kisner, Maria Kornacki",,,,,https://detroitisit.com/how-one-organization-is-rewriting-the-story-of-demolition-in-detroit/,"Instead of knocking houses down, ASW Detroit deconstructs them — piece by piece — salvaging lumber, doors, trim, fixtures, and architectural elements and putting them back into circulation.
Unlike many mission-driven organizations, ASW Detroit operates largely as a fee-for-service business.
ASW Detroit is also deeply involved in urban wood reuse, salvaging trees removed for development or city maintenance and turning them into usable lumber.
Workshop Detroit, Wallace Detroit Guitars, and Detroit Audio Lab have all worked with ASW materials to create guitars, speakers, and other products, proving that reuse can support not just sustainability goals, but local manufacturing and creative enterprise.
Historically focused on providing low-cost materials, the organization expanded its mission in fall 2024 to offer no-cost building materials to Detroit residents living near the poverty line.","In a city shaped by cycles of construction, abandonment, and reinvention, demolition has long been treated as an end point. Tear it down. Haul it away. Move on. But at the Architectural Salvage Warehouse of Detroit, the work begins where most projects stop — not with destruction, but with careful removal and reuse.

Founded in 2003 and led since 2013 by Executive Director Chris Rutherford, the organization has built a rare and quietly effective model centered on one simple idea: valuable materials shouldn’t be wasted just because a building’s life has ended.

Instead of knocking houses down, ASW Detroit deconstructs them — piece by piece — salvaging lumber, doors, trim, fixtures, and architectural elements and putting them back into circulation.

“When we deconstruct a home, 80 to 90 percent of the material is saved from the landfill,” Rutherford says. “That’s a full semi-trailer of lumber from a single house.”

What happens to those materials next is where ASW’s work becomes more than salvage.

Unlike many mission-driven organizations, ASW Detroit operates largely as a fee-for-service business. Property owners pay the organization to deconstruct homes, and that revenue supports a multi-pronged operation that includes retail sales, construction and millwork, wholesale material distribution, and workforce development. The diversification isn’t accidental — it’s what allows the organization to weather economic swings and continue operating without heavy reliance on grant funding.

Today, ASW Detroit’s work spans several interconnected areas. Its retail store, now housed in a building the organization purchased last year near the Packard Plant, sells salvaged materials at low cost to homeowners, builders, architects, and designers.

Its construction arm works with architects and property owners to design and build new spaces using reclaimed materials, including visible projects like millwork at the Foundation Hotel and the Apparatus Room. A full mill shop allows ASW to turn salvaged lumber into furniture, architectural elements, and custom builds.

The organization also operates a wholesale business, shipping flatbed trailers of reclaimed lumber to clients across the Midwest when supply allows. One recent example is the Gordie Howe International Bridge project, where scaffolding lumber was reclaimed, reused locally, and also shipped to clients in Wisconsin.

“We’re trying to grow a full reuse marketplace,” Rutherford says. “The more outlets we have for these materials, the more deconstruction we can do. And every time we don’t do it, those materials end up in a landfill.”

That commitment to keeping materials in circulation extends beyond buildings. ASW Detroit is also deeply involved in urban wood reuse, salvaging trees removed for development or city maintenance and turning them into usable lumber. Red oak and silver maple — trees that once lined Detroit’s streets — are now finding new life as furniture, flooring, and architectural features.

In recent years, the organization has also become a quiet incubator for Detroit makers. Workshop Detroit, Wallace Detroit Guitars, and Detroit Audio Lab have all worked with ASW materials to create guitars, speakers, and other products, proving that reuse can support not just sustainability goals, but local manufacturing and creative enterprise.

But perhaps the most impactful evolution of ASW’s mission has come through its Community Uplift Program. Historically focused on providing low-cost materials, the organization expanded its mission in fall 2024 to offer no-cost building materials to Detroit residents living near the poverty line. Lumber, doors, windows, appliances, lighting and more are now being granted directly to families who need them.

“Our mission has always been to provide affordable materials,” Rutherford says. “This is about going one step further — empowering people to make their homes safer and healthier.”

The program also solves a practical challenge. Moving materials quickly allows ASW to bring more in, keeping its operations flowing while serving residents at the same time. “It’s a win-win,” Rutherford says.

ASW Detroit’s work also reflects a broader cultural role in the city — preserving history by letting materials move forward. While not every building can be saved, Rutherford believes these materials can carry a story into the future.

“If we can’t save a structure, we can still save the wood,” he says. “That oak might become a dining table, or a guitar, or part of a new building. The materials we’ve kept out of landfills can be seen throughout the city.”

This played out in a highly visible way last year, when ASW Detroit partnered with DTE Energy and the City of Detroit to deconstruct the city’s official Christmas tree.

Instead of discarding it, the massive tree was taken apart, slabbed into lumber, and reused for projects around the city — a symbolic and practical example of reuse embedded in Detroit’s public life.

It’s also a reminder that ASW’s work sits at the intersection of environmental stewardship, economic resilience, and workforce development. The organization employs returning citizens and individuals facing barriers to employment, offering work tied directly to community impact.

“Reuse creates jobs,” Rutherford says. “And it gives people skills they can carry with them.”

Looking ahead, Rutherford hopes Detroit continues shifting from crisis response toward intentional, sustainable systems. After nearly three decades in the city, he sees progress not just in growth, but in how that growth is happening.

“We’ve come to a point in Detroit where we are passed the triage phase where we were working to simply get blight out quickly. Now we can slow down, do things right, put people to work, preserve our history, and keep materials out of landfills.”

At a time when cities everywhere are grappling with waste, housing affordability, and climate pressure, the Architectural Salvage Warehouse of Detroit offers a grounded alternative — one built not on sweeping gestures, but on careful hands, practical systems, and the belief that what already exists still has value.

“We can make a deep impact on Detroit while showing other cities what this looks like,” Rutherford says.",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-8.33.59-AM.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 16:59:53.473906

‘Bring Your Own Generation’ ‘Bring your own generation’ is the new trend that is expected to become mainstream as data center developers seek faster and reliable connections to the grids.
Goldman Sachs research analysts said in an October report that data center power demand growth alone would accelerate total U.S. power demand growth through 2030 by 1.2 percentage points to an overall level of 2.6%, the highest growth in America’s electricity demand since the 1990s.","“It’s a high-stakes fight, because hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions of dollars of capital are on the line,” Michael Webber, an engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin and former chief technology officer at investment firm Energy Impact Partners, told the Journal.

Big Tech isn’t too enthusiastic about being disconnected at peak demand hours, but ultimately, the hyperscalers may not have any other choice if they want to connect to the grid faster.

Some grid operators, such as the Southwest Power Pool, plan to start offering a so-called “conditional” connection—giving data center operators priority timing to connect to the grid, but on the condition that they agree to be cut off at times of extreme demand.

“Some may want to do that. Others may not,” Antoine Lucas, SPP’s chief operating officer, told the Journal.

ERCOT of Texas is also looking to grant large power load users a quicker interconnection if they commit to reducing their power use from the grid during certain grid or transmission conditions, the Texas Tribune reports.

ERCOT is inundated with requests for large load interconnection. These requests are currently exceeding 205 GW, nearly quadruple from 56 GW of requests a year ago. Of the 205 GW large load interconnection requests, over 70% are from data centers and another 10% from cryptocurrency mining operations.

‘Bring Your Own Generation’

‘Bring your own generation’ is the new trend that is expected to become mainstream as data center developers seek faster and reliable connections to the grids.

“As they think about permitting and constructing their facility, I mean, the first thing they're looking for is a load interconnect. And a lot of parts of the country, in securing a load interconnect, you've got to bring your own generation,” NextEra Energy’s chairman, president and CEO, John Ketchum, said on the Q3 earnings call in October.

“You got to get the load interconnect to be able to take the power off the grid to be able to satisfy the initial phases. And many of the load serving entities are saying, well, bring your own generation to make that happen.”

The large load marketplace is quickly evolving, with “Bring your own generation” a key component of the transformation, NextEra Energy said at its investor conference last month.

At the current rate of interconnection requests and grid capacity, the U.S. could face a power crunch by 2030, Samantha Dart, Goldman Sachs’ co-head of global commodities research, said at a conference this week.

Goldman Sachs research analysts said in an October report that data center power demand growth alone would accelerate total U.S. power demand growth through 2030 by 1.2 percentage points to an overall level of 2.6%, the highest growth in America’s electricity demand since the 1990s.

“We aren’t adding enough capacity,” Dart said this week at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech and Utilities Conference in Miami, adding that if the issue remains unaddressed, the U.S. could lose the AI race with China.

General Motors (GM), once at the forefront of this transition, is now facing a major setback.
The company recently announced $6 billion in charges for the fourth quarter of 2025, reflecting the financial strain of declining EV sales and the expiration of key US EV tax credits.
This follows a $1.6 billion charge in the previous quarter, bringing the total EV-related financial impact for the year to $7.6 billion.
Max Zhang, CTO at Digital Solutions, commented, “General Motors’ staggering $7.1 billion charge is a wake-up call for the entire automotive industry.","The electric vehicle (EV) market has long been seen as the future of the automotive industry, with promises of reduced emissions, innovative technology, and a shift away from fossil fuels. Automakers worldwide have invested billions to transition their fleets to electric power, driven by government incentives, stricter environmental regulations, and growing consumer interest in sustainable transportation. However, the road to electrification has proven more challenging than anticipated, with fluctuating policies, high production costs, and uneven EV adoption creating significant hurdles.

General Motors (GM), once at the forefront of this transition, is now facing a major setback. The company recently announced $6 billion in charges for the fourth quarter of 2025, reflecting the financial strain of declining EV sales and the expiration of key US EV tax credits. This development, reported by the Associated Press (AP), underscores the challenges posed by declining EV sales, the expiration of federal tax credits, and the easing of emissions standards.

The charges, detailed in GM’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, include $1.8 billion in non-cash impairments and $4.2 billion in supplier settlements, contract cancellations, and other costs. This follows a $1.6 billion charge in the previous quarter, bringing the total EV-related financial impact for the year to $7.6 billion. GM’s shares slid nearly 3% on Friday in response to the news.

Policy shifts and market realities

The expiration of the US EV tax credit in September 2025 has significantly impacted GM’s challenges, which offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones. It was a key factor driving EV consumer demand. Without these incentives, EV sales have declined, leading automakers to rethink their bold electrification strategies.

GM had previously announced plans to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025, aiming to make the majority of its fleet electric by 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. However, these goals are now in question as the company scales back its EV strategy. The relaxed emissions standards under the Trump administration have further complicated the transition, creating uncertainty for automakers.

Industry perspectives on LinkedIn

The news has sparked widespread discussion on LinkedIn, with industry professionals weighing in on the implications for GM and the broader automotive sector. Max Zhang, CTO at Digital Solutions, commented, “General Motors’ staggering $7.1 billion charge is a wake-up call for the entire automotive industry. The transition to electric vehicles was built on fragile policy promises, not genuine consumer demand. GM's struggle to honor contracts amidst evaporating federal tax credits showcases a crucial miscalculation—one that many automakers are now repeating.”

Dan Sheehan, Director of Portfolio Management, shared a similar sentiment, stating, “The early end of federal tax credits, slower consumer adoption, and rising cost sensitivity have forced automakers to pivot away from aggressive EV buildouts. GM was among the earliest to commit tens of billions to the transition, but the market that materialized was smaller and slower than forecast.”

These opinions highlight the broader challenges facing legacy automakers as they navigate the complexities of electrification. Ford, for example, recently announced nearly $20 billion in charges tied to its own EV strategy adjustments, further illustrating the difficulties of transitioning to electric power. It also ends F-150 Lightning production.

Looking ahead

Despite the setbacks, GM remains committed to its long-term EV goals. The company is now focused on lowering production costs and tightening commercial terms to adapt to market realities. Additional EV-related charges are expected in 2026, though at lower levels.

As GM prepares to announce its fourth-quarter results on January 27, the financial effects of these charges will be carefully examined. The company’s future will need precise adjustments to balance short-term gains with the potential for lasting innovation.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt164d06c6aba93641/65143345946cdee2b7fde852/F-150_20Lightning_Platinum_on-road_02.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-09 15:59:48.140676

The mining ban was filed in the Federal Register, which tracks actions by the executive branch, but not the Congressional Record, which tracks legislative moves and serves as an official notice to Congress.
Minnesota Congressman Pete Stauber, a Republican who represents northern Minnesota, planned to introduce legislation by Friday aiming to reject the mining ban.

If the mining ban is lifted, the Trump administration would then be free to reissue mining leases for Chile-based Antofagasta, which has been trying to develop the mine for decades on land controlled by the federal government.","The Trump administration and U.S. Congress are launching a plan this week to overturn former President Joe Biden’s mining ban in northern Minnesota and prevent future administrations from taking similar steps, according to officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.

The move has been in development for much of the past year and involves a complex series of legislative steps that will benefit Antofagasta’s Twin Metals copper, cobalt and nickel project, one of North America’s largest untapped reserves of those critical minerals.

Details of the plan have not previously been reported.

It marks a refocus of sorts by Trump on U.S. domestic mining projects, even as his administration continues to angle for access to minerals in Greenland, Ukraine and elsewhere.

The Minnesota plan is almost certain to further escalate tension over where and how to procure minerals crucial for the electrified economy and national defense. Copper, nickel and cobalt are used to build electric vehicles, AI data centers, wind turbines, weaponry and myriad other devices.

Congressional record omission

Biden in 2023 blocked mining on 225,504 acres in the Superior National Forest for 20 years, citing environmental concerns and a belief that the region’s economy would benefit more from recreational activity than mining.

The mining ban was filed in the Federal Register, which tracks actions by the executive branch, but not the Congressional Record, which tracks legislative moves and serves as an official notice to Congress.

Under a 1976 law known as the Federal Lands Policy and Management Act, a president is required to notify Congress of public land orders that affect more than 5,000 acres.

Because Biden did not file the notice in the Congressional Record, Trump’s Interior Department is doing so now with the expectation that it will be rejected by Congress.

The U.S. House of Representatives was informed earlier this week by the Interior Department. The notice was then sent to Vice President JD Vance, who is head of the U.S. Senate, and is under review by the U.S. Senate parliamentarian.

If approved by the parliamentarian, which was expected by Friday, Congress would have 60 days to approve or reject the plan with a simple majority. That vote would not be subject to a filibuster.

Minnesota Congressman Pete Stauber, a Republican who represents northern Minnesota, planned to introduce legislation by Friday aiming to reject the mining ban. If Congress and Trump approve, which is expected in the Republican-controlled body, a future president could not replicate Biden’s ban because of a provision in the 1996 Congressional Review Act.

Save the Boundary Waters, a conservation group, said Stauber was using an unprecedented approach to try to force the mine’s approval.

“And for what? To benefit a Chilean mining company that sends its minerals to China, will destroy America’s most visited wilderness area and leave the mess up to the American and Minnesotan taxpayers,” said Ingrid Lyons, the group’s executive director.

Mining leases could be reissued

The complex legislative plan came together after efforts failed to include the measure in Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” signed into law last July, congressional staffers said.

“We have industries here in our country that need these critical minerals. We must never rely on foreign adversaries like China for supply,” Stauber, who is also chair of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources, told Reuters.

The White House was not immediately available to comment.

If the mining ban is lifted, the Trump administration would then be free to reissue mining leases for Chile-based Antofagasta, which has been trying to develop the mine for decades on land controlled by the federal government. The mine would still need to undergo an environmental review and obtain permits.

Stauber said he has been told by the Trump administration that it is working on reissuing the leases, but he did not have additional details.

Antofagasta’s Twin Metals unit said it expects to get the leases back in the near future and that it is “very appreciative of Congress for their efforts to overturn an unnecessary and detrimental action that locked out a significant domestic source of critical minerals.”

The leases themselves have been a political hot potato since first issued in 1966. Former President Barack Obama took steps to block their re-issuance, before Trump renewed them in his first term, only to have Biden cancel them.

No mining has taken place at the site.

Tensions between mining, outdoor recreation

The underground Twin Metals mine would, if built, be a major U.S. source of copper, cobalt and nickel. The only existing U.S. nickel mine is set to close later this decade.

The region is visited each year by more than 150,000 outdoor enthusiasts, many of whom have long feared that any mine disaster could pollute rivers and quickly spread through the 1.1 million acres of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and into the Great Lakes.

Antofagasta has long said it would use the most advanced equipment to protect the environment.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2026/01/Mining.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 18:12:45.321776

American Trucking Associations

“The American Trucking Associations applauds House appropriators for including provisions in the Commerce, Justice, and Science funding bill that will directly support 8.4 million hardworking truckers. Specifically, the bipartisan measure taking aim at cargo theft will address a serious and growing threat that is costing our industry $18 million per day,” said American Trucking Associations SVP of Legislative Affairs Alex Rosen. “By empowering federal law enforcement to investigate and unravel complex, multijurisdictional cargo theft cases, this legislation will help safeguard our supply chain and reduce costs for consumers.”

ClearPath Action

“This legislation represents a big win for energy innovation and will help ensure that the United States remains the global leader in advancing breakthrough energy technologies. We are especially excited to see the bipartisan commitment to advanced nuclear energy, better domestic supply chains, and foundational science.”

INCOMPAS

“As our nation races to maintain technological leadership in artificial intelligence and next-generation computing, we cannot afford to fall behind in the energy infrastructure that powers these critical national capabilities. The competitive service providers, hyperscale’s, infrastructure players, start-ups, and investors that INCOMPAS represents are building the critical tools that will define America’s economic future. Still, they require massive amounts of reliable power to operate. China understands this equation and is aggressively expanding its energy capacity to fuel its AI ambitions. We must match and exceed their determination. This legislation’s historic investments in nuclear energy development, including small modular reactors and advanced reactor demonstrations, alongside enhanced grid cybersecurity and resilience measures, directly address the energy demands of our digital economy. The goal of expanding nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050 is precisely the kind of bold vision we need to ensure American companies can compete and win in the global AI race. Furthermore, the bill’s focus on critical minerals extraction and reducing foreign dependencies strengthens the supply chains essential for both energy production and the semiconductor industry that powers our digital infrastructure. Every data center, every 5G cell site, every AI system, and every nascent computing cluster requires secure access to these materials. Our geopolitical competitiveness also depends on it. Coupled with the White House’s AI strategy, this proposal lays the critical foundation for a comprehensive national framework, one that recognizes energy resilience as the bedrock upon which America’s technological leadership must be built. By securing our energy future today, Congress is enabling a sprint toward an integrated national strategy, one that harnesses our federal leadership and the forces of innovation, capital markets, and competitive telecommunications to ensure American AI dominance for decades to come. Ultimately, energy resilience drives digital transformation — they are two sides of the same coin. By unleashing American energy diversification, this legislation ensures that innovative competitors can continue disrupting markets, driving down costs, and delivering world-leading services to American consumers and businesses.”

Louisville Independent Business Alliance

“We appreciate the bipartisan compromise included in the CJS portion of the minibus that allows the Department of Justice Antitrust Division to access merger filing fee collections, consistent with the intent of the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act. This approach helps ensure that antitrust enforcers have stable, user-fee–based resources to keep pace with increasingly complex merger review and enforcement demands. We thank the Committee for recognizing the importance of adequately resourcing competition enforcement to protect a fair and competitive marketplace.”

National Association of Police Organizations

“On behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing some 250,000 sworn law enforcement officers across the nation, I am writing to thank you for safeguarding and continuing an independent Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) within the Department of Justice (DOJ) and for your longstanding support for our nation’s law enforcement community. By directing the DOJ to maintain the COPS Office as “a distinct organizational grantmaking entity within the Department” in the Fiscal Year 2026 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) appropriations measure, you acted to preserve a significant, dedicated resource for state and local law enforcement agencies and officers. The Fiscal 2026 CJS spending bill also sufficiently funds the various programs administered by the COPS Office that are vital to state and local law enforcement’s ability to serve and protect our communities efficiently and effectively. Serving as the lead national law enforcement organization, NAPO worked tirelessly with members of Congress and the Administration to enact the COPS Program in 1994. Since its inception, the COPS Program has been extremely successful in implementing and carrying out its designated objectives.

Ucore Rare Metals targets mid-2026 to begin commercial heavy rare earth processing at its Strategic Metals Complex in Louisiana.

The project is backed by 5,700+ hours of automated RapidSX demonstration operations in Ontario.

The company’s phased 2,000-5,000 tpa ramp strategy aims to build midstream separation capacity—North America’s critical supply chain gap.

Partnerships with Vacuumschmelze, eVAC Magnetics, and Hastings Technology Metals support the strategy.

With $36.3M conditional Canadian government support and a brownfield site approach, Ucore must now prove RapidSX can scale from demonstration success to sustained commercial durability.

After years of pilot work and partnership-building, Ucore Rare Metals (opens in a new tab) is positioning itself to cross a rare threshold in North American rare earths: moving from demonstration to commercial separation. The company now targets 2026 for initial heavy rare earth processing at its Strategic Metals Complex (SMC) in Louisiana (opens in a new tab)—a goal that remains ambitious, but no longer reads as speculative theater.

What's Inside

From Lab Bench to Clock Speed

What’s solid: Ucore reports roughly 5,700 hours of continuous processing since late 2023 using its RapidSX separation technology at its Kingston, Ontario demonstration plant. Operated in an automated, simulated 24/7 environment, the system processed tons of heavy mixed rare earth oxides across a 52-stage separation flow sheet according to an entry in Magnetics Business & Technology (opens in a new tab).

That matters. Separation—not mining—remains the real bottleneck in the global rare earth supply chain. Demonstration hours under quasi-commercial conditions carry more weight than isolated metallurgical claims.

Still, investors should keep the distinction clear: demonstration success is not the same as sustained commercial uptime. The planned mid-2026 installation of RapidSX Machine #1 in Alexandria, Louisiana, is the true proving ground.

Scale With a Seatbelt

Ucore’s phased ramp—2,000 tpa in 2026, rising to 5,000 tpa in 2027—signals discipline rather than bravado. The brownfield site at England Airpark lowers execution risk, and the “one-machine-first” strategy limits capital shock.

This is not a moonshot refinery. It is a measured attempt to industrialize separation inside the United States, where meaningful midstream capacity is still scarce.

Allied Supply Chain, Not Just Optics

The memorandum of understanding with Vacuumschmelze GmbH and eVAC Magnetics is directionally important, linking oxide separation to downstream magnet manufacturing—precisely where Western supply chains tend to fracture.

Likewise, the non-binding agreement with Hastings Technology Metals and Wyloo Gascoyne Pty ties Australian Yangibana concentrate to U.S. midstream processing. These are pathways, not guarantees—but they follow the logic of bankable supply chains.

Public Money, Private Execution

The conditional $36.3M in Canadian government support for samarium and gadolinium refining is a meaningful endorsement, particularly as China tightens restrictions on those elements. Still, conditional funding is not cash flow, and timelines matter.

Why This Matters

Ucore’s story is notable not because it promises scale, but because it targets processing sovereignty. The risk is execution. Can its RapidSX refining technology scale up? The bias to watch is optimism drift between demonstration and durability as the technology still must be validated at scale.

North America does not need another rare earth headline. It needs separators that run.",https://rareearthexchanges.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=17007&type=rare-earth-exchanges&hash=295ad01d2963af28cd3ae284befa6216,N,,2026-01-09 19:01:29.211031

Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) to oppose Republican former New Mexico congressman Steve Pearce’s nomination to lead the nation’s largest land management agency, decrying his “absolute disdain for the 245 million acres of public lands he has now been nominated to administer.”

President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 nominated Pearce to lead the Bureau of Land Management, an agency that oversees public lands, including for recreation, cattle grazing and extraction of oil and natural gas.

Pearce, who founded an oilfield services company before getting into politics, represented New Mexico’s Second Congressional District in the southern part of the state between 2003 and 2009, then again from 2011 to 2019. He was most recently chair of the state Republican Party until late 2024.

His nomination drew swift criticism from environmental groups in New Mexico and across the country, including Thursday in a letter from a coalition of 81 national and local environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, GreenPeace, WildEarth Guardians and the Santa Fe Forest Project.

The coalition sent the letter to Lee, the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Heinrich, the ranking member, asking them to oppose Pearce’s nomination due to what members said is a long history of trying to undermine and privatize public lands.

Sean Patrick Brennan (D-Parma) today issued a statement applauding Vistra’s announcement of long-term power purchase agreements with Meta that will secure more than 2,600 megawatts of zero-carbon nuclear energy, including significant generation from Ohio’s Perry and Davis-Besse nuclear power plants.

The 20-year agreements will keep critical nuclear facilities operating, expand capacity through power uprates, protect existing jobs, create thousands of new project-related jobs, and strengthen Ohio’s position as a national energy leader - all without shifting costs onto taxpayers.

“This announcement is exactly why Ohio must continue to take a pragmatic, forward-looking approach to energy policy,” said Rep. Brennan. “Nuclear energy provides clean, reliable, 24/7 power that supports economic development, grid stability, and national security. These agreements ensure Ohio remains competitive as electricity demand continues to grow.”

Rep. Brennan noted that this investment validates work already done at the Ohio Statehouse to formally recognize nuclear energy’s role in Ohio’s clean energy future.

“During the 135th General Assembly, I was proud to sponsor House Bill 308, legislation that defined nuclear energy as clean energy under Ohio law,” continued Rep. Brennan. “That policy decision sent a clear message that Ohio values reliability, carbon-free power, and long-term private investment. Today’s announcement shows that smart, technology-neutral energy policy works.”

Under the agreements, Meta will purchase more than 2,600 megawatts of power from Ohio’s Perry and Davis-Besse nuclear plants, along with additional capacity from planned equipment upgrades that will increase output and add new generation to the PJM grid. Electricity generated at the plants will continue to flow to the grid for all users while supporting Meta’s growing operations.

While the AI Leadership Council’s focus is correctly on governance, workforce development, and ethical considerations, the physical backbone of AI — data centers, energy supply, water use, and siting policy — remains a critical gap.","Artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing are becoming increasingly central to the modern economy, driving business intelligence, operational efficiency, and data-driven decision-making across industries. From generative AI tools to routine digital services, these technologies depend on an expanding web of physical infrastructure — most notably data centers.

Data centers deliver the computational power, storage, and connectivity that keep digital systems running, but they also place significant demands on energy and water resources. As demand for AI functionality surges, North Carolina has emerged as a prime destination for data center investment, placing the state at the intersection of economic opportunity, infrastructure capacity, and growing community concern.

North Carolina offers a compelling mix of advantages for data centers: relatively affordable land; access to major fiber routes; proximity to leading research universities such as North Carolina State University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Duke University; and a historically business-friendly regulatory climate. These factors have already drawn hyperscale operators supporting cloud computing and AI workloads.

As reported by the News & Observer, the scale of proposed investment is striking: a $6.4 billion hyperscale data center project in Tarboro was projected to generate roughly $11 million annually in local property-tax revenue, while a separate $30 billion proposal in Mooresville — later withdrawn amid rezoning concerns — illustrates both the magnitude of capital at stake and the volatility of local approval processes.

It is understandable why there would be reservations about embracing data center expansion in local communities. Despite the economic promises, reporting from the previously mentioned News & Observer article and from the Charlotte Observer on a proposed data center in Matthews shows mounting resistance at the local level, with residents worried that the costs of hosting massive facilities may outweigh the benefits. In towns such as Tarboro and Matthews, concerns have centered on noise from cooling systems and backup generators, the visual scale of industrial buildings, heavy water use, and — most prominently — the strain placed on local electricity grids.

In Apex, similar anxieties have emerged around a proposed 190-acre data center near the Shearon Harris area. Residents questioned whether the project aligns with the town’s character and infrastructure capacity, particularly with respect to electricity and water demand.

“The people don’t want this,” one resident told ABC11. “The people that know about it don’t want it. And the people that don’t know about it — when they find out — they won’t want it either.”

Others raised concerns about proximity to homes and long-term livability. “I don’t want something that’s going to affect my family two miles from my home,” said Dr. Michelle Hoffner O’Connor, reflecting a broader fear that rapid industrial-scale development could permanently alter nearby residential communities.

These disputes have also exposed a deeper structural challenge in North Carolina’s land-use and permitting system. When developers seek special-use permits, local governments are required to act in a quasi-judicial role — functioning more like courts than legislative bodies. That framework sharply limits officials’ ability to consider public sentiment or broader policy implications.

“You can’t have public input,” Tarboro Town Manager Troy Lewis told the N&O. “You have to base your decision on evidence presented at the meeting.”

Even when elected councils vote to deny permits, developers can — and often do — challenge those decisions in court, introducing legal uncertainty for communities already grappling with the scale of proposed projects.

Rezoning requests, by contrast, allow greater public participation but come with their own volatility. In Mooresville, the proposed $30 billion data center project was ultimately withdrawn after officials signaled opposition, underscoring how political resistance can derail even the largest investments. Together, these cases illustrate a growing mismatch between the pace of AI-driven infrastructure development and the capacity of local governments to manage its impacts—leaving residents feeling unheard and municipalities caught between economic pressure and community trust.

In addition to local sentiments on data centers coming to towns, there are energy-use considerations that have not been made sufficiently transparent to allow communities and policymakers to effectively assess whether existing power supplies can support large-scale data center expansion. As the science journal Nature reports, generative AI models require substantially more electricity than earlier forms of computing, and their rapid growth is driving an unprecedented buildout of data center infrastructure. Unlike many other energy-intensive industries, data centers tend to cluster geographically so they can share power grids, cooling systems, and high-speed data connections — intensifying their localized impact on electricity demand.

From a national perspective, AI-driven data centers still account for a relatively modest share of total US electricity consumption. However, Nature notes that the local impacts can be far more pronounced. In Virginia, for example, data centers already consume more than one-quarter of the state’s electricity. In at least five other US states, electricity consumption by data centers has surpassed 10% — illustrating how geographically concentrated development can place significant strain on regional power grids even when nationwide impacts appear manageable.

A central challenge, according to researchers cited by Nature, is the lack of reliable, transparent data on how much energy AI systems actually use.

“The real problem is that we’re operating with very little detailed data and knowledge of what’s happening,” Jonathan Koomey, an independent researcher who has studied the energy use of computing for more than three decades, told Nature.

Estimates often rely on indirect methods — such as tracking server shipments and extrapolating their power draw — because companies rarely disclose detailed information about their AI workloads or electricity consumption. This lack of transparency complicates attempts to forecast future energy demand with confidence.

Still, the direction of travel is clear. A US Department of Energy–funded report cited in Nature estimates that data centers currently consume about 4.4% of US electricity and could double or even triple that share by 2028. For states like North Carolina — where multiple data center proposals are emerging simultaneously — this uncertainty creates a planning dilemma. Without clearer data on energy requirements, grid impacts, and long-term demand trajectories, communities and regulators are being asked to make high-stakes land-use and infrastructure decisions with incomplete information.

At the state level, North Carolina has begun to grapple with AI’s broader implications. Through an executive order, Gov. Josh Stein established the North Carolina AI Leadership Council, co-chaired by the secretaries of Information Technology and Commerce, to guide the responsible adoption, governance, and advancement of artificial intelligence. The state has also launched an AI Accelerator within the Department of Information Technology and directed agencies to form internal AI oversight teams aimed at improving public services and operational efficiency.

While the AI Leadership Council’s focus is correctly on governance, workforce development, and ethical considerations, the physical backbone of AI — data centers, energy supply, water use, and siting policy — remains a critical gap. In the absence of a coordinated statewide framework, decisions continue to be made piecemeal, community by community, often within legal and procedural constraints that frustrate residents and developers alike. Addressing these realities head-on is not an argument against innovation, but a necessary step toward ensuring that North Carolina’s AI ambitions remain aligned with its communities, infrastructure capacity, and long-term public trust.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nova-amazon-datactr-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 17:00:13.841529

One way we should demonstrate this support is by ensuring that domestic demand for the crops they grow remains strong.
To be fair, some states do allow year-round E15, and for the past two years, the U.S. EPA has granted temporary waivers allowing E15 sales in all states through the summer.
A permanent year-round E15 policy would benefit everyday Americans and strengthen markets by providing predictable demand.
If we’re serious about national energy security, America should help our farmers contribute to it.","Wherever we live in America, sea to shining sea, we owe a debt to the farmers who feed us, fuel us and help clothe us. There is no question: Our nation’s farms and ranches are a big part of what makes this country great, and farmers deserve our unwavering support.

One way we should demonstrate this support is by ensuring that domestic demand for the crops they grow remains strong.

Ethanol made from American corn has been part of this country’s energy mix for decades—today, year-round, the gas in most of our cars is up to 10% ethanol, or E10. A modest 5% increase in this blend rate—that is, moving to E15 year-round—could grow domestic demand by as much as 6.9 billion gallons of ethanol, or roughly 2.4 billion bushels of American corn every year.

In addition to supporting the economic viability of our nation’s farms—and protecting them from geopolitical volatility—this move would also put money back in the pockets of everyday Americans, who would see prices at the pump go down about 18%, according to the American Farm Bureau.

However, federal regulations prevent E15 from being sold during summer months, despite the fact that it offers both emissions and cost savings. To be fair, some states do allow year-round E15, and for the past two years, the U.S. EPA has granted temporary waivers allowing E15 sales in all states through the summer. These are the right steps, but navigating a patchwork of rules and regulations and asking for federal permission every year is no way to run a business—or a farm.

A permanent year-round E15 policy would benefit everyday Americans and strengthen markets by providing predictable demand. This, in turn, would help farmers make informed planting and investment decisions, stabilizing rural economies and strengthening our national agricultural supply chain. The impact on food prices would also be negligible, if there’s any at all, since technological advances have allowed this country to produce more corn than it consumes.

Moving to year-round E15 would also see American energy policy catch up to policy in other countries: Brazil mandates a 27%-30% ethanol blend in gasoline and widely uses flex-fuel vehicles, and India plans to implement a 20% ethanol blend. If we’re serious about national energy security, America should help our farmers contribute to it.

Happily, expanding access to E15 enjoys broad bipartisan support, both in Congress and in our states, so this one important move should be easy to get across the line. That’s why we are calling on Congress to pass legislation allowing E15 sales year-round. By one estimate, this could add as much as $26 billion annually to America’s gross domestic product, supporting more than 128,000 jobs and generating more than $10 billion in revenue.

Most of this would flow straight to America’s heartland, in industries ranging from farming and manufacturing to construction and transportation. At a time when 80% of communities with persistent poverty are found in rural America, this move would result in real and important opportunities for millions of Americans.

Our country this year is celebrating 250 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. As we do so, let’s remember that since the founding of this country, agriculture has been indispensable to our way of life. Americans are fortunate that, thanks to the hard work of our farmers, we have the ability to feed everyone who calls this country home. We have an opportunity today to accomplish something similar in transportation fuel—grown in America, used in America—and support our farmers and rural communities in the process.

Passing year-round E15 is a common-sense action Congress can take, right now, to support American farmers, lower prices at the pump and create a brighter future for this country—including the small towns and communities so many of us call home. We encourage our nation’s policymakers to act on this bipartisan priority.•

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have be shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Companies request CBI claims as to proprietary information or knowledge – such as manufacturing processes and chemical formulas – that could give competitors an advantage if gone unprotected. This expiration date was set in 2016 under the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amended and modernized the TSCA, a mechanism by which the EPA can collect a variety of information relating to health and chemical safety, some of which falls under the CBI qualification.

To account for this need for confidentiality while still achieving one of the primary aims of the Lautenberg Act – increasing public transparency concerning chemical information that could potentially affect Americans’ health and safety – Congress amended the TSCA to, for the first time, have CBI claims expire while still enabling stakeholders to submit CBI claims to the EPA without fear the agency would publicly release the protected information, as it is now legally prohibited from doing. Most CBI claims expire about a decade following their submission.

The expiring CBI claims that are the focus of this week’s announcement were submitted by companies right after the TSCA was amended via the Lautenberg Act in June 2016 and therefore will expire this June.

But for many, these elements of a healthy and safe environment are not guaranteed. Environmental health risk factors like exposure to pollution, heavy traffic, unsafe drinking water, and contaminated soil affect residents’ quality of life and can have serious long-term health consequences.

These hazards pose a threat to environmental justice, which the American Public Health Association describes as “the idea that all people and communities have the right to live and thrive in safe, healthy environments with equal environmental protections and meaningful involvement in these actions.”

In this fourth post in our Equity in Action series, we explore how communities can use local data to promote environmental justice and increase awareness of environmental hazards that disproportionately affect communities of color and those with low incomes. We feature five grantees who are engaging their communities in collecting evidence to fuel advocacy and address threats to community well-being.

Two of the grantees are organizing community members to measure soil contamination caused by industrial pollution. Both grantees will use the data they collect to recommend actionable steps for soil remediation and public health solutions to state and local government agencies. In Buffalo, New York, Open Buffalo is training residents of the predominantly African American East Side community to expand soil testing for lead contamination. Because of its location downwind of a lead smelter that operated in the first half of the 20th century, preliminary testing revealed unsafe levels of lead in the soil. Open Buffalo will guide residents to conduct targeted soil sampling and discuss community-informed solutions to reduce the risks of exposure and advocate for soil remediation.

Toxic Free North Carolina, the North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, and a team of Durham partners are teaching community members to test soil for heavy metal contamination in the neighborhoods surrounding five Durham parks, all located on former municipal incinerator sites in predominantly low-income communities of color. Toxic Free North Carolina is helping residents understand how contaminated soil spread via construction projects and air pollution increase the risk of toxic exposure in their neighborhoods. The project team will analyze soil samples to publish a soil-quality dashboard and share data with residents.

Two other grantees are activating their communities to map sources of pollution. The North Carolina Environmental Justice Network is documenting air and water contamination and public health risks from swine and poultry feeding operations through participatory mapping. They are collaborating with local community activists fighting the concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) industry to identify the locations of biogas infrastructure, poultry CAFOs, and avian influenza outbreaks. Their insights will be used to create a dataset for community advocacy to provide communities information about the highest-priority locations for monitoring air and water quality and increasing transparency on poultry CAFOs.

Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision is working with residents to address the negative effects of high truck traffic on community health by identifying high-truck-traffic areas and documenting impacts on air quality. They will use these insights to collaborate with local leadership on strategies to address the harmful effects of high truck traffic, such as increased air pollution and hazardous conditions for pedestrians and cyclists.

Another grantee is documenting barriers to sewage system access that would reduce pollution. In Puerto Rico, Protectores de Cuencas is surveying residents to identify barriers to municipal sewage system access in the Guánica Bay watershed. The local watershed faces contamination from untreated sewage because the area lacks sewage infrastructure and many households do not have sewer connections. This pollution affects public health, marine ecosystems, and the livelihoods of local communities. Findings from the survey will inform recommendations to reduce the barriers for connecting community members to the system.

What These Communities Can Teach Us

These projects remind us that documenting environmental hazards can be an important first step in advocating for healthy communities for all. Across issue areas, organizations can mobilize their residents through data collection to build evidence that strengthens their advocacy and partner with local leaders to design strategies to redress environmental harms.

“For years, Ohioans were told taxpayer bailouts were the only way to keep nuclear plants running. This announcement proves the opposite. The private sector is stepping up to modernize, operate, and expand nuclear generation without relying on taxpayer dollars or shifting costs onto residential customers.”

AFP-OH also emphasized the importance of House Bill 15 in restoring confidence in Ohio’s energy policy framework and ending the state’s reliance on subsidies to prop up generation.

AFP-OH Legislative Director Hannah Kubbins said:

“House Bill 15 ended the taxpayer-funded subsidies that distorted Ohio’s energy market and sent a clear message that the state would no longer pick winners and losers. By closing the door on those bailouts, lawmakers created the certainty needed for private investment to step in and keep reliable nuclear power online without government support.”

Role: Commercial Junior Sales Executive: Bid & Sales Support

Location: England, UK (Hybrid)

An early-stage, fast-growing business in the UK’s electric fleet and transport decarbonisation sector is seeking a commercially minded Junior Sales Executive to support sales and bid activity. This is a hands-on commercial support role rather than a graduate position, working closely with senior commercial leadership on live opportunities, proposals, and tender submissions.

The role is well suited to someone at an early stage of their career who enjoys structured written work, coordination, and problem-solving. It may particularly appeal to individuals looking to transition from consulting, analysis, or similar roles into a commercial environment.

Key Responsibilities

Support live sales opportunities and bid activity across multiple customers and projects.

Draft, coordinate, and manage bid responses, tenders, pre-qualification questionnaires, and commercial proposals.

Coordinate bid inputs from internal stakeholders, managing timelines and ensuring submissions meet quality and compliance requirements.

Maintain accurate sales pipeline data, opportunity tracking, and internal reporting.

Conduct research into customers, markets, and upcoming commercial opportunities.

Support the preparation of sales materials, presentations, and customer-facing documentation.

Candidate Profile

Commercially focused, well organised, and highly self-motivated.

Comfortable operating in a small, entrepreneurial, and fast-paced environment.

Strong written communication skills with a high level of attention to detail.

Confident working directly with senior stakeholders and experienced professionals.

Proactive, dependable, and capable of managing multiple workstreams simultaneously.

Demonstrates a genuine interest in transport decarbonisation, electric vehicles, and the wider energy transition.

Experience

1–3 years’ experience in a commercial, sales support, bid, consulting, or business development role.

Exposure to bid writing, tenders, or structured written responses is advantageous.

Background or demonstrable interest in infrastructure, energy, transport, or sustainability sectors is beneficial.

This role offers a clear development pathway. In the first year, you’ll build strong commercial foundations through bid coordination, proposal ownership, and exposure to live opportunities. Over time, you’ll progress to owning smaller deals end to end, with direct customer engagement and commercial responsibility. As the business scales, there is strong potential to move into Sales Executive, Business Development, or Commercial Manager roles.",https://piper-maddox.sites.sourceflow.co.uk/og-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 15:59:58.762221

President Donald Trump’s sweeping freeze on offshore wind construction is starting to hurt his own party’s energy ambitions.

Just days before Christmas, the Trump administration halted work on all five large-scale offshore wind farms under construction in the U.S, citing unspecified national security concerns. The order may have come as a shock to the project developers, who received letters from the Interior Department only after Fox News publicly reported on the move, as Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler reported at the time.

All but one of the targeted developers have since sued the Trump administration. Danish developer Ørsted filed two separate suits over pauses to its nearly complete Revolution Wind — which the Interior already halted for a month last fall — and to Sunrise Wind. In another lawsuit, Equinor warned that the freeze would result in the ​“likely termination” of its Empire Wind project off New York, which also suffered a monthlong stop-work order last spring. And Dominion Energy is asking a judge to let construction resume on the utility’s Virginia project, once considered safe because it had the backing of the state’s outgoing Republican governor.

The halts are also sparking backlash on Capitol Hill that could derail some of the White House’s other energy plans. In the weeks leading up to the holidays, Congress had taken up what seemed like the millionth round of negotiations to reform energy-project permitting. Reforms are essential to Republicans’ goal of speeding fossil-fuel construction, and this time around, they’d actually made progress with the House’s passage of the SPEED Act, which had support from a handful of Democrats.

That bill requires 60 votes to clear the Senate, but with Republicans holding just 53 seats, it would need significant Democratic support. That won’t happen while the Interior’s stop-work order remains in place, two high-ranking Senate Democrats say.

“The illegal attacks on fully permitted renewable energy projects must be reversed if there is to be any chance that permitting talks resume,” Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said in a late December statement calling out the offshore wind halts. ​“There is no path to permitting reform if this administration refuses to follow the law.”

Congress reconvened this week, but Whitehouse affirmed that permitting talks won’t go anywhere until offshore wind construction is free to proceed.

More big energy stories

Venezuela is dominating the energy discussion

While the Trump administration used allegations of narcoterrorism to justify its invasion of Venezuela and seizure of leader Nicolás Maduro, pretty much every conversation since has revolved around the country’s oil resources. In his first news conference after Maduro’s capture, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would ​“run” Venezuela and control its oil production, and he has been pressuring American oil companies to reinvest in the South American nation.

But it’s not just oil that the White House is eyeing. An administration official told Latitude Media that Trump and the private sector may also target Venezuela’s critical mineral resources, though experts warn that little reliable data exists on those deposits and that the country’s mining sectors are in disarray.

More delayed coal-plant retirements

The U.S Department of Energy issued a wave of orders in the waning days of 2025 to keep coal power plants running past their retirement dates. The first targeted a plant in Centralia, Washington, which its owner had been planning to close since 2011. Next up came orders to keep two Indiana coal plants open until at least late March. And just before year’s end came another, this one targeting Unit 1 at Colorado’s Craig power plant.

Both the Craig facility and one of the units in Indiana have been out of commission due to mechanical failures since earlier in 2025, meaning their owners will now have to shoulder potentially huge repair costs to comply with the federal mandate, Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports.

And the U.S. EPA may soon throw another lifeline to coal power. The agency plans to let 11 plants dump toxic coal ash into unlined pits years after current federal rules allow, Canary Media’s Kari Lydersen reports. Without the extension, those plants would likely shutter.

Dive Brief:

General Motors recorded $6 billion in electric vehicle-related charges primarily in North America in Q4 2025 as it realigns its strategy to produce more full-size internal combustion engine trucks and SUVs, according to a Jan. 8 securities filing.

The charges include a $1.8 billion non-cash write-down to devalue its EV manufacturing assets and another $4.2 billion in costs to settle related supplier contracts, which were primarily battery supply deals, per the filing.

The automaker cited weakening EV demand and the termination of certain consumer tax incentives, combined with a reduction of more stringent emissions regulations, for its strategic shift from EVs to producing more ICE vehicles.

Dive Insight:

In addition to the $6 billion in charges for North America, GM expects that its total charges in Q4 will be $7.1 billion. It includes an additional $1.1 billion in non-EV-related charges related to the restructuring of its China joint venture, SAIC General Motors, which is primarily related to the company’s share of supplier claims and additional legal accrual, per the filing.

In October 2025, GM’s Audit Committee also approved a $1.6 billion impairment charge as part of a strategic realignment of its electric vehicle manufacturing capacity. It included $1.2 billion in non-cash impairments and $400 million in cash costs for contract cancellations and settlements related to its previous EV investment strategy.

GM said that ramping up production of full-size trucks and SUVs will help it meet “unmet demand.”

“GM proactively reduced EV capacity, including by pivoting the company’s assembly plant in Orion, MI from EV production to the production of full-size SUVs and full-size pickups powered by internal combustion engines,” the automaker wrote in the securities filing.

However, the automaker stated that its realignment will not impact the current retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs already in production, which includes the Equinox, Bolt EV, Lyriq SUV, Silverado EV and Hummer EV. GM said it will continue to make these models available to customers.

Last October, the automaker confirmed to WardsAuto that it is cutting roughly 3,400 jobs at its EV and battery plants as it scales back EV production, including Factory Zero, the former Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly in Detroit, and its Ultium Cells battery plant in Warren, Ohio. The bulk of the layoffs were effective Jan. 5.

GM also warned of additional material cash and non-cash charges in 2026 related to supplier negotiations, but it expects they will be lower than 2025 figures. The automaker also warned that proposed changes to greenhouse-gas standards could devalue emissions credits, potentially leading to further impairments.

Ford Motor Co. is also abandoning its previous EV strategy due to low demand for vehicles such as the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E. In December, the automaker announced a major shift in its electrification plans, which includes ramping up production of ICE F-Series trucks and a pivot to extended-range hybrid vehicles and more affordable smaller EVs.

Language in a recently conferenced appropriations bill that funds the NSF, NASA, and other key science agencies explicitly requires them to continue applying the negotiated indirect cost rates.","EPA proposes limits on perchlorate in drinking water

The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday proposed a rule that would limit the level of perchlorate in drinking water to 20 ppb, the latest development in a 15-year legal battle over the chemical, which is used in the production of solid rocket fuels, explosives, and fireworks, among other items.

In 2016 the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) sued the EPA for failing to implement limits on perchlorate that the agency had first proposed in 2011. In 2023 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit told the EPA that it must regulate perchlorate (PDF). The new rule is a result of that decision.

Perchlorate disrupts thyroid hormone production, which can be especially dangerous for fetal brain development, according to a 2018 technical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

“Perchlorate is not safe and EPA should choose the lowest level,” the organization tells C&EN in an email.

In the proposed rule, the EPA says, “The benefits of this regulation would not justify the costs.” Regulation would cost about $16 million annually, compared with about $8 million in benefits, the rule states.

In a Jan. 5 statement, NRDC senior strategic director for health Erik D. Olson calls the proposed standard “weak,” noting that the EPA initially recommended a limit of 1 ppb. In Massachusetts, the limit is 2 ppb.

Even those low levels may have health effects, though, says Ramji Bhandari, a University of Missouri cell biologist who studies the health effects of chemical exposures.

For example, fish in water dosed with perchlorate at a concentration of 1 ppb had damage to their reproductive organs and lower rates of fertility than controls, Bhandari reported in a study in November.

The chemical “is a big public health concern,” he says.

Federal appeals court blocks NIH indirect cost cap

On Jan. 5, a federal appeals court upheld a district court injunction blocking the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from cutting reimbursement rates that the federal government pays to US institutions for research overhead costs.

The unanimous decision (PDF), made by a three-judge panel, says that the NIH’s attempt to cap the indirect cost rate at 15% violates existing congressional language that prevents federal health agencies from modifying these reimbursement policies.

“We agree with the district court that it had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims and that NIH’s action is unlawful because it violates a statute and regulations,” the judges from the First US Circuit Court of Appeals wrote. “Congress went to great lengths to ensure the NIH could not displace negotiated indirect cost reimbursement with a uniform rate.”

Back in February 2025, the NIH announced it would be capping its indirect cost rate at 15%, substantially lower than many of the rates that institutions have individually negotiated with the NIH, which average around 28%, according to the agency. The policy, which was widely criticized by research and university organizations, would have cut billions of dollars in funding for research-related overhead costs such as lab maintenance, hazardous waste disposal, and salaries of nonresearch personnel.

But the NIH’s policy change was quickly challenged in court, and in April, Judge Angel Kelley of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a permanent injunction blocking the cap. The Donald J. Trump administration appealed the injunction, arguing that the district court didn’t have jurisdiction to rule on the case.

The appeals court ultimately disagreed and upheld Kelley’s original decision.

The ruling “means that fair and necessary support for the real costs of conducting medical research will continue for the benefit of patients and communities across the country,” the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), one of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement following the ruling.

It’s unclear whether the Trump administration will appeal the ruling and petition to send this case to the Supreme Court. The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the NIH, tells C&EN that it does not comment on litigation.

Regardless, the Trump administration has continued pushing for changes to existing indirect cost policies. In an August executive order, the administration directs funding agencies to give preference to institutions with lower indirect cost rates when making funding decisions. This order came despite multiple court rulings blocking attempts to cap the indirect cost rate at other federal agencies, including the US National Science Foundation (NSF).

But Congress is taking steps to support current rates. Language in a recently conferenced appropriations bill that funds the NSF, NASA, and other key science agencies explicitly requires them to continue applying the negotiated indirect cost rates.

The House approved the bill on Thursday, and the Senate is expected to take it up next week. After, it will be sent to President Trump for final approval.

EPA moves to regulate phthalates in workplaces, not consumer uses

The US EPA has announced plans to regulate dozens of industrial and commercial uses of five common phthalate chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

In a Dec. 31 press release, the agency says its final risk evaluations found unreasonable risks primarily to workers—particularly from inhalation during spray applications and manufacturing—as well as to aquatic life from certain industrial releases. For the consumer uses included in the TSCA evaluations, the EPA says it did not identify exposure levels that pose unreasonable risks to consumers or the broader population.

That distinction has drawn scrutiny from public health advocates, who note that phthalates—plasticizers used to make materials such as polyvinyl chloride more flexible and durable—are common not only in industrial settings but also in everyday products. Scientific advisory bodies, including the EPA’s Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals, have long warned that routine exposure to phthalates may pose developmental and reproductive risks to the general public, particularly for sensitive populations.

The EPA’s analyses focused on five high-priority phthalates: butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), all of which have been linked to hormone disruption and developmental effects.

The agency’s findings partly reflect TSCA’s limits: the law directs the EPA to evaluate specific “conditions of use,” which do not include exposures from food packaging, medical devices, cosmetics, and other pathways overseen by other federal agencies.

Agency officials say the evaluations relied on peer-reviewed, “gold standard” science. Critics, however, argue that the approach understates real-world risk. Maria Doa, senior director for chemicals policy at the Environmental Defense Fund, says the EPA’s assessment “is a step backwards” in understanding cumulative health risks from phthalates, noting that evaluating individual uses in isolation fails to capture how people encounter multiple phthalates across workplaces and in everyday life.

With the evaluations complete, the EPA is moving into risk management—including possible engineering controls, exposure limits, or use restrictions—but it remains unclear how far those measures will extend beyond the workplace to communities and consumers.

The EPA also recently announced plans to regulate nearly a dozen uses of 1,3butadiene, another industrial chemical, under TSCA, again centering on worker exposure as the primary driver of risk management measures.

EPA issues new guidance on antimicrobial pesticides and endangered species

The US EPA released final guidance on Dec. 31 on how it will assess the potential effects of antimicrobial pesticides on endangered species. The guidance doesn’t create new requirements for manufacturers applying to register such pesticides, according to the agency. Instead, the guidance is meant to help manufacturers understand what kind of information the EPA considers in its risk assessments.

That information includes how a pesticide may be used and its potential geographic footprint, as well as whether that footprint overlaps with any endangered species’ ranges or critical habitats. The EPA also suggests that manufacturers use this information to inform how they label products to reduce effects on endangered species and their habitats.

Antimicrobial pesticides can include products like disinfectants used in homes as well as commercial and public settings like restaurants or hospitals, chlorine tablets and algicides used in swimming pools, wood preservatives, antifouling coatings used on boats and underwater equipment, and chemicals used to treat water at industrial facilities.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/Jan--9-Policy-Watch---311850:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2026-01-09 14:00:59.900304

Please read our guidelines for opinion pieces before submitting an Op-Ed. Submissions that do not adhere to our guidelines will not be considered for publication.

OPINION – California has long defined what clean transportation leadership looks like. But today, that leadership faces a crossroads – and the direction we take will be determined by the upcoming state budget, which will shape whether California maintains its edge or allows global competitors to outpace us.

California has reached an inflection point, a reality echoed by a broad coalition of companies, labor groups, ports, and clean transportation organizations that recently urged Governor Newsom to prioritize ZEV funding in the 2026–27 budget. They know the stakes: Momentum is not guaranteed.

The world is moving quickly. Countries are investing aggressively in batteries, critical minerals, and next-generation manufacturing capacity. China continues to expand its dominance in clean technology manufacturing, scaling quickly and shaping the markets of the future. If California wants the jobs, innovation, and economic competitiveness of the clean transportation era, it cannot afford to hesitate – especially now.

Automakers, fleets, and transportation providers are still investing in a zero-emission future, but federal uncertainty is slowing key decisions and underscoring the need for strong state leadership. Businesses are now looking to Sacramento for signals that the state intends to stay the course and provide the market certainty needed to unlock further investment.

Clean transportation manufacturing, charging deployment, and innovation already supports tens of thousands of California jobs that position the state as a global hub for next-generation technology. These jobs are not abstractions but high-skilled, good-paying careers that support families, strengthen communities, and make California more competitive in a global marketplace.

California’s decision last year to extend the Cap-and-Invest program to 2045 was a major step forward, providing long-term certainty and generating revenues for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It is critical that these funds support the state’s core zero-emission transportation programs. But ambition alone is not enough.

A multi-year commitment of $1 billion annually for zero-emission trucks, vans, buses, and passenger vehicles and the necessary infrastructure is essential to avoid backsliding, protect California’s global competitiveness, and ensure fleets and consumers have predictable support as the market scales. This includes sustained investments in mobility solutions that expand access to zero-emission transportation in communities that need it most.

California’s existing incentive programs are among the most effective in the world, helping drivers and fleets adopt cleaner vehicles and lowering costs. But with the loss of key federal incentives – especially the consumer tax credit – the state now has an opportunity to consider how best to support consumers and fleets. Any approach must build on what works, protect medium- and heavy-duty progress, and ensure new efforts complement established programs. And with more long-haul electric truck options expected – options that could reach cost parity with diesel for more applications –the coming year is pivotal.

We are entering what many have called the “Industrial Revolution 2.0,” defined by clean energy, advanced manufacturing, digital technologies, and zero-emission transportation. Few places are as well-positioned as California to shape this era and realize the economic fruits that come with being the global hub for clean transportation. The state has the talent, workforce, innovation ecosystem, and economic engine to lead globally. But leadership is not self-sustaining; it requires partnership and a willingness to invest in what works.

California’s industry leaders have made their position clear: They want to keep building, investing, and innovating in California, but they need the policy stability and market certainty that strong state leadership provides. Their recent letter to the governor reflects a shared expectation that California will reinforce its clean transportation leadership in the 2026–27 budget and beyond so companies can continue investing with confidence.

California has led every major clean technology shift of the last half-century, and the upcoming budget is our chance to show the world we intend to finish the work we started.

In a stunning move that reinforces Big Tech’s growing role in underwriting firm, carbon-free generation for artificial intelligence infrastructure, hyperscaler Meta unveiled partnerships with three major players—Oklo, Vistra, and TerraPower—that seek to secure up to 6.6 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2035. The agreements, finalized through Meta’s nuclear request-for-proposals (RFP) process launched in December 2024, mark one of the largest corporate nuclear procurement efforts in U.S. history.

The hyperscaler on Jan. 9 outlined the three separate deals, which span the full nuclear value chain, including long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and uprates at existing reactors, pairing them with early commercial backing for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear deployments.

Under the deals, competitive generator Vistra will support 20-year PPAs covering more than 2.6 GW of nuclear capacity from its Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania, including 433 MW of uprates—the largest nuclear uprates ever backed by a corporate customer—while providing the financial certainty needed to pursue subsequent license renewals and extend plant operations for decades. Advanced nuclear technology firm Oklo will advance development of an up to 1.2-GW Aurora fast-reactor campus in Pike County, Ohio, leveraging Meta-backed prepayments to secure fuel, initiate site work, and enable phased deployment beginning as early as 2030 directly into the PJM market. Nuclear innovation firm TerraPower will accelerate deployment of up to eight Natrium reactors—a combined 2.8 GW of baseload capacity paired with 1.2 GW of integrated energy storage, that will be capable of boosting output to as much as 4 GW. Initial units are targeted for delivery in the early 2030s, TerraPower said.

The projects are expected to preserve and expand existing nuclear capacity, add new firm generation to constrained regional grids, and shift a significant portion of nuclear project risk and early-stage capital requirements onto a single large-load customer—Meta Platforms—at a scale never seen outside utility or federal sponsorship. They build on Meta’s June 2025–announced 20-year deal with Constellation for the 1,121-MW Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, which, as POWER has reported, will keep the nucelar plant operating beyond 2027 and support a 30-MW uprate and potential advanced reactor deployment at the site.

“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history,” said Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer on Friday. “State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone. These projects are going to create thousands of skilled jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania, add new energy to the grid, extend the life of three existing nuclear plants, and accelerate new reactor technologies.”

Meta’s Extraordinary Nuclear RFP: A Structured Push for Clean Firm Power

The deals on Friday stem from a thorough Request for Proposals (RFP) process announced on Dec. 3, 2024, seeking 1 GW to 4 GW of new nuclear generation capacity that it envisioned would be delivered starting in the early 2030s from “developers that can help accelerate the availability of new nuclear generators and create sufficient scale to achieve material cost reductions by deploying multiple units, both to provide for Meta’s future energy needs and to advance broader industry decarbonization.” Meta explicitly sought partners “who will ultimately permit, design, engineer, finance, construct, and operate these power plants will ensure the long-term thinking necessary to accelerate nuclear technology.”

“Compared to renewable energy projects that we continue to invest in, such as solar and wind, nuclear energy projects are more capital intensive, take longer to develop, are subject to more regulatory requirements, and have a longer expected operational life,” Meta said in its December 2024 blog post announcing the RFP. “These differences mean we need to engage nuclear energy projects earlier in their development lifecycle and consider their operational requirements when designing a contract.”​ Meta added that because “scaling deployments of nuclear technology offers the best chance of rapidly reducing cost,” it views multi-project, multi-location partnerships as essential to deploying nuclear power strategically through its structured RFP process.

So far, Meta has backed nearly 28 GW of clean energy projects across 27 U.S. states and has contracted more than 12 GW of renewable energy worldwide, efforts it said have “matched” its global operations, which have used 100% clean and renewable electricity since 2020. But in its September 2025 Sustainability Report, the company pointed to accelerating AI deployment, which it said is reshaping data center infrastructure needs, noting that next-generation facilities are being designed specifically to support “future generations of AI growth.” Future data centers will require larger, more persistent, and higher-density electrical loads than earlier generations, driving Meta to seek clean firm resources capable of delivering round-the-clock power to complement variable renewables, it suggested. However, the company’s recent firm-energy procurements have been of a smaller scale, and include, for example, an August 2024 agreement with Sage Geosystems to supply up to 150 MW of geothermal power beginning in 2027.

On Friday, as it unveiled the three new deals— existing fleet operations and uprates (Vistra), first-mover advanced reactors under construction (TerraPower), and early-stage fast reactor technology (Oklo)— the company outlined its overriding priorities. “These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW of new and existing clean energy by 2035,” it said. “Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.”

As significantly, Meta also noted that the work builds on its “ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational.” It underscored: “We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.” Effectively, it said, the agreements will mean “that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid.” Over time, “this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.”

Vistra Secures Record Nuclear 2.6-GW of Uprates Through 20-Year Meta Partnership

Adding to Meta’s support of Constellation’s Clinton plant, the company’s deal with Vistra will support 20-year PPAs with three Vistra nuclear plants. Specifically, Meta will buy 2,176 MW of nuclear energy and capacity from Vistra’s Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio, while also backing 433 MW of incremental capacity from uprates at Perry, Davis-Besse, and Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania.

According to Vistra, Meta’s purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034, when the full 2,609 MW of power will be online. “More than 15% of the contracted capacity announced today will be new capacity added to the PJM region,” Vistra noted on Friday. “The electricity generated at the plants will continue to go to the grid for all electricity users.”

Perry, a single-unit boiling water reactor (BWR) located on Lake Erie about 40 miles northeast of Cleveland, has a capacity of 1,268 MW and supports more than 600 full-time jobs in the North Perry area. Davis-Besse, a single-unit pressurized water reactor (PWR) in Oak Harbor, Ohio, approximately 35 miles east of Toledo, provides 908 MW of capacity and employs more than 600 workers. Beaver Valley, a two-unit PWR facility about 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, contributes 1,872 MW of capacity and supports more than 750 full-time jobs in western Pennsylvania.

Vistra acquired all three plants as part of its $3.4 billion Energy Harbor transaction in March 2024. All three facilities operate within the PJM Interconnection, which—despite being the nation’s largest regional transmission organization—has been signaling severe supply constraints through consecutive, record-setting capacity auctions.

System stress has become increasingly evident in recent market outcomes. PJM’s 2025/2026 Base Residual Auction cleared at $269.92/MW-day—nearly ten times the prior year’s price—followed by the 2026/2027 and 2027/2028 auctions, both of which hit the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)–approved price cap above $329/MW-day, essentially pointing to tightening reserve margins and growing scarcity of firm capacity across the region.

The grid operator’s long-term outlook underscores the stakes of preserving—and expanding—its nuclear capacity. PJM’s 2025 load forecast projects summer peak demand rising by roughly 70 GW over the next 15 years. Data center load alone is expected to grow by up to 30 GW between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, PJM faces potential generation retirements approaching 40 GW by 2030, an interconnection queue exceeding 150 GW of proposed projects—many of which have withdrawn after receiving multi-billion-dollar network upgrade cost estimates—and transmission constraints that the U.S. Department of Energy estimates will require a 61% expansion of within-region transmission capacity.

“As recently as 2020, before Vistra owned Perry, Davis-Besse, and Beaver Valley, these plants were on a path to retirement,” said Stacey Doré, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of Vistra. “When we signed a deal to acquire these plants in 2023, Vistra saw their tremendous contribution—to the reliability of the grid, to the stability of the region, to their local communities, and to the people who work there. Fast-forward to today, and we’re investing in expanding these same plants, and thanks to our dedicated employees and a committed partner like Meta, this fleet will continue to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to power the grid of the future.”

The Meta-backed uprates will still require regulatory clearance. While each of the three plants has received initial license renewal from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the PPAs “provide certainty for Vistra to pursue subsequent license renewal for each of the reactors, which would extend each license an additional 20 years,” Vistra noted. Currently, Beaver Valley Unit 1 is licensed through 2036; Davis-Besse is licensed through 2037; Perry is licensed through 2046; and Beaver Valley Unit 2 is licensed through 2047.

Oklo to Develop 1.2‑GW Advanced Nuclear Campus in Southern Ohio as Early as 2030

Meta’s deal with Oklo, meanwhile, will underpin the development of a 1.2‑GW Aurora powerhouse campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta’s regional data centers, including its Prometheus AI supercluster, which Meta is building in the Columbus area in New Albany, about 100 miles away.

“This advanced nuclear technology campus—which may come online as early as 2030—is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region,” Meta noted on Friday.

For Oklo, the Meta agreement marks a dramatic scaling-up of a Southern Ohio strategy it has been pursuing with the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative (SODI) since at least 2023, evolving from the two 15‑MWe Aurora powerhouses it first slated for underutilized parcels at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS).

As POWER previously reported in 2023, DOE‑sponsored analyses identified the Portsmouth site—now a DOE cleanup and reuse project (and potentially a nuclear hub)—as one of the most suitable U.S. locations for industrial advanced reactor deployment, citing its existing nuclear infrastructure, experienced enrichment and decommissioning workforce, and formal community reuse organization. SODI has since used successive DOE land transfers and a DOE‑funded early‑site‑permit (ESP) template effort launched in 2020 to advance a “clean energy park” concept that Oklo is now apparently anchoring, with Meta as its first large‑load customer.

As Oklo explained on Friday, the Meta agreement is effectively a funding commitment that “provides a mechanism for Meta to prepay for power and provide funding to advance project certainty for Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse deployment.” Oklo plans to use the funds to “secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of the project—supporting the development of clean, reliable power in Pike County that can scale up to 1.2 GW.”

Ultimately, Oklo expects the agreement will lead to the build out of “multiple Oklo Aurora powerhouses.” For now, “pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030,” it noted. “The plans for the scalable powerhouse facility are expected to expand incrementally to deliver up to the full target of 1.2 GW by 2034.”

“Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality. We have finalized the purchase of over 200 acres in Pike County and are excited to announce this agreement in support of a multi-year effort with Meta to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO.

While the Southern Ohio project has long been a strong prospect for Oklo, the company’s much-watched first project—Aurora-INL—is advancing at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), where it broke ground in September 2025. That 75‑MWe sodium‑cooled fast-reactor demonstration, which directly leverages EBR‑II experience, is one of three awarded to the company under DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, and Oklo is targeting operations start between late 2027 and early 2028, contingent on regulatory approvals and construction progress.

The Aurora design uses metallic fuel, a fast-neutron spectrum, and liquid-sodium coolant to enable inherent and passive safety features that allow a much leaner set of safety‑grade systems than a conventional LWR—and, critically for data center loads, a high-capacity-factor, dispatchable profile.

The company has laid out a three‑pronged strategy built around high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) supply, downblended government stocks of uranium and plutonium‑bearing materials that do not require further enrichment, and, longer term, recycled fuel from its own and today’s LWR fleet.

At INL, Oklo is already progressing its Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility under DOE authorization to fabricate metallic HALEU fuel. The DOE in December 2025 approved the facility’s Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis, and its assembly is now underway.

Structurally, Aurora plants are packaged as standardized, shippable modules—reactor vessel, steam generators, and power conversion system—with Oklo indicating that roughly 70% of powerhouse components are sourced from established non‑nuclear supply chains in the industrial, energy, and chemicals sectors, a strategy DeWitte has highlighted in earnings calls and in interviews with POWER as central to cost and schedule control.

In tandem, Oklo has paired that supply‑chain approach with a master services agreement under which Kiewit provides full‑scope engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services for the Aurora‑INL project and follow‑on Aurora deployments, giving the company a repeatable EPC partner from early design through on‑site assembly. In November 2025, Oklo and Siemens Energy went a step further by signing a binding contract for the design and delivery of the Aurora powerhouse power conversion system—covering a condensing SST‑600 steam turbine, SGen‑100A generator, and auxiliaries—which authorizes Siemens Energy to begin detailed engineering, lock in long‑lead turbine‑generator components, and initiate manufacturing for the first Aurora‑INL unit. Oklo has suggested it may leverage a standardized package across subsequent Aurora projects, including the planned Southern Ohio campus, to de‑risk the supply chain and support parallel builds.

Oklo has also pushed for early regulatory progress.. Oklo was the first advanced reactor developer to submit a custom combined license application (COL) to the NRC for a non‑LWR, and while that initial COL submission was denied “without prejudice” in 2022, the company has since relaunched its NRC pre‑application engagement and in July 2025 completed Phase 1 of the NRC’s formal readiness assessment for a revised Aurora‑INL COL under Part 52. In parallel, DOE’s selection of Aurora‑INL under the Reactor Pilot Program allows the first unit to proceed under DOE authorization—sidestepping the traditional NRC construction/operating license dual-track sequence—using DOE’s exemption authority under the Atomic Energy Act, Oklo, however, continues developing its Part 52 COL as a reusable reference design for follow‑on commercial sites like Southern Ohio and any future advanced reactor fleet scaling.​

TerraPower: Up to 2.8 GW from Eight Natrium Reactor Plants

Finally, under Meta’s new agreement, TerraPower could deploy up to eight Natrium reactor and energy storage system plants in the U.S., which could furnish Meta with as much as 2.8 GW of a flexible additional carbon-free baseload capacity resource. Given that the system integrates a molten salt storage system, the deal could boost total output to as much as 4 GW when dispatched at peak. That could make it Meta’s largest single commitment to advanced nuclear technology to date.​

Specifically, as Meta said on Friday, its agreement with TerraPower is for “funding” to support the development two new Natrium units—a combined 690 MWe of firm power—whose delivery is targeted as early as 2032. But as notably, the Meta–TerraPower agreement will also provide Meta “with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035.”

“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” noted Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO, on Friday. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well-positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”​

For POWER readers who have followed Natrium’s trajectory, the Meta deal effectively scales up the commercial model TerraPower is already demonstrating at Kemmerer 1 in Wyoming—a 345-MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) coupled to a large nitrate molten salt storage system now under construction next to a retiring coal plant. As POWER has reported, Kemmerer 1 is being built as a fully commercial plant under the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. TerraPower has indicated it is targeting fuel loading around 2030 and will seek commercial operation in 2031.​

Technically, the Natrium concept separates the nuclear island—a pool-type SFR operating at atmospheric pressure and cooled by liquid sodium—from the energy island, where sodium transfers heat to a non-radioactive molten salt loop that serves as a high-temperature thermal battery. That architecture eliminates the need for large, high-pressure containment typical of light water reactors and allows the reactor to run at essentially constant thermal power while the storage system flexes electrical output to match grid conditions.​ In practice, stored heat in the molten salt can be drawn down to drive a conventional steam cycle, boosting plant output by about 150 MW above its baseload rating for more than five hours, which allows the facility to become a dispatchable resource that can follow net load swings and firm up high renewable penetrations, while still providing the high-capacity-factor baseload profile prized by AI data centers.​

Meanwhile, on the regulatory front, Natrium remains the most advanced non–light water commercial project in the U.S. The NRC accepted TerraPower’s construction permit application for the Kemmerer Natrium demonstration in March 2024, following several years of pre-application engagement and DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program scoping. In October 2025, the project became the first commercial advanced reactor to receive an NRC‑issued final environmental impact statement for a commercial advanced nuclear power plant, and in December 2025 the NRC completed its final safety evaluation of TerraPower’s construction permit application for Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1, clearing the way for issuance of the construction permit once remaining administrative steps are finalized.

As POWER has detailed, TerraPower has already mobilized substantial non-nuclear construction at Kemmerer—test-and-fill facilities for sodium systems, a training center, and early energy-island works—under EPC contracts led by Bechtel and a reactor supply partnership with GE Hitachi.​

However, TerraPower’s Meta deal effectively plugs into a Natrium pipeline that is already much broader than the Wyoming demonstration. Beyond Kemmerer 1, TerraPower is advancing multiple utility-facing siting efforts (including MOUs in Utah and Kansas and exploratory work with Sabey Data Centers and other load-serving partners) while seeding a global vendor base through repeated Natrium equipment awards and pushing the design into overseas licensing processes in the UK.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/screenshot-2026-01-09-at-114840am.png,N,,2026-01-09 14:00:53.608330

General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

While states cannot weaken federal environmental rules, they can develop rules that are stricter than federal standards.
The PFAS rules would require sampling of water taken into water treatment plants and water discharged by industries.
The 1,4-Dioxane rules are targeted at the industries most likely to discharge it.","North Carolina environmental regulators on Thursday moved toward reducing the amount of several potentially carcinogenic “forever chemicals” being discharged into the state’s ground and surface waters.

Critics say the actions taken by the Environmental Management Commission on PFAS and 1,4-Dioxane fall short because they don’t set specific allowable limits on the chemicals; they rely largely on voluntary compliance; and they don’t establish penalties for industries that continue to pollute.

Commission Chair JD Solomon guided a lengthy discussion during the board’s January meeting in Raleigh and acknowledged there would be more work to do.

“But this is a first step,” he said.

What are ‘forever chemicals’?

There are many thousands of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, created by man to make products non-stick or water-, temperature-, chemical-, oil- or weather-resistant. They help fried eggs slide off a treated skillet or cause spilled red wine to bead up on carpet. They’re in the foam that air tankers drop on big forest fires in rugged terrain and they extend the life of gaskets in car engines. They’re in construction materials, electronics and food packaging.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences says that because they don’t break down easily, if at all, PFAS can accumulate in the bodies of animals and people exposed to them. One study published in 2015 on more than 1,600 people aged 12 to 80 found that more than 97% had PFAS in their blood.

PFAS have been associated with potential health issues such as cancer, immune issues, developmental delays, decreased fertility and high blood pressure among pregnant women and low birth weights in babies, as well as imbalances in thyroid and sex hormones and other concerns.

Ingesting drinking water contaminated with PFAS is the primary way most people are exposed, the state Department of Environmental Quality says.

North Carolina has the third-highest concentrations of 1,4-Dioxane in drinking water of any state in the U.S., more than double the national average, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Another forever chemical, 1,4-Dioxane is an industrial solvent used mostly to make other industrial chemicals. It can be released into the air, water and soil at places where it is produced or used, scientists say. It mixes easily with water and can travel long distances through the soil into the groundwater, where it can take years to degrade.

The EPA found 1,4-Dioxane most frequently in the Cape Fear River Basin during its sampling in North Carolina, which was part of a nationwide effort.

A 2024 report by the state noted the risk of liver cancers North Carolina residents face as a result of 1,4-Dioxane in the drinking water and the lack of water-quality standards governing the chemical.

What action did N.C. regulators take on forever chemicals?

In 2024, the EPA announced national standards for some individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures, and gave public water systems until 2029 to comply with the limits. In May 2025, the EPA announced it would extend the compliance deadline to 2031 on two of the compounds. In September, the agency asked a federal court rescind the standards for the others, in keeping with the Trump administration’s policy to loosen EPA regulations generally.

The EPA’s plan would drop rules on GenX, the trade name of a PFAS made by the Chemours company in Fayetteville, found in the water in the Cape Fear River and linked to cancer of the liver, pancreas and testicles in animals. N.C. State University is studying the health effects of GenX and other PFAS on humans.

The state has prohibited Chemours from discharging contaminated wastewater from its processing plant into the Cape Fear River, which has helped reduce the pollutant, but historic discharges have left significant groundwater contamination, according to DEQ.

Under an agreement with the state, in 2023 the company built an underground wall along the Cape Fear River to block contaminated groundwater from reaching the stream and installed extraction wells to capture the water, which is then treated to remove the chemicals.

Environmental advocacy groups are challenging the EPA’s plan to drop the standards for GenX and other PFAS, which is still in litigation.

While states cannot weaken federal environmental rules, they can develop rules that are stricter than federal standards.

Members of the Environmental Management Commission expressed the need for some urgency in moving forward with the development of statewide rules on Thursday. The group took up two sets of “monitoring and minimization rules”: one for three types of PFAS – PFOS, PFOA and GenX – and another for 1,4-Dioxane.

The PFAS rules would require sampling of water taken into water treatment plants and water discharged by industries.

The 1,4-Dioxane rules are targeted at the industries most likely to discharge it.

Both would require baseline sampling after the rules go into effect, then quarterly sampling to check for amounts of pollutants above the “lowest reporting concentration.”

If pollutants exceed those concentrations, the operation would have to develop a plan to reduce or eliminate the pollutant.

Some board members were frustrated by the lack of specific numerical limits in the proposals and asked to send them back to committee until thresholds could be set.

“If we want to do a ‘monitoring’ rule, I’m for it,” Commissioner Robin Smith said. “But we should not call this a ‘minimization’ rule,” because it lacks pollution level targets.

Still, the board voted to put both proposed rules out for public comment and public hearing.

Solomon repeatedly assured fellow commissioners that the board will later establish specific thresholds for the chemicals along with enforcement plans.

Fuquay-Varina wants to import water from Sanford

The southern Wake County town of Fuquay-Varina now buys its water from the City of Raleigh and Johnston County, both in the Neuse River Basin, and from Harnett County in the Cape Fear River Basin.

But the town, which has been one of the fastest-growing in the state, will lose its purchasing contracts with Raleigh and Johnston County in the next few years and can’t meet its needs by purchasing from Harnett County.

So the town has applied to the state for permission to make an inter-basin transfer, purchasing up to 6.17 million gallons of water a day from the City of Sanford, which lies in the Cape Fear River Basin.

The problem? The town would discharge much of the used water into the Neuse River Basin, resulting in a net loss of water from the Cape Fear.

Operators of several large drinking water systems downstream of where the water would be diverted in Sanford complained during public hearings that the transfer could leave them vulnerable to water shortages during drought and water quality problems because pollutants would be less diluted.

The state is taking public comment on the proposal through April 1.

The Environmental Management Commission would have to approve the transfer request.

Rand, David G. Victor, Amar Bhattacharya",,,,,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/despite-federal-backsliding-us-states-and-municipalities-are-still-planning-for-climate-resilience/,"While climate resilience has become more contested federally as recent administrative actions freeze or claw back resilience grants, at the sub-national level, planning for climate resilience is more common than one may think.
The federal resilience system is unnecessarily complex, and leaves communities underprepared for changing risks In their current form, federal laws and programs for climate resilience are falling short of needs.
Twenty-nine percent of states (15 in total) have resilience and adaptation offices that bear responsibility for climate resilience planning.
Municipal, county, and regional governments across the US have embraced climate resilience planning Many municipalities and county governments, as well as regional coalitions, are in the process of implementing climate resilience plans.
In other states, such as Florida, resilience planning has followed a more regional approach, with municipalities and counties forming coalitions to advance climate resilience.","In an increasingly unstable climate, a community’s capacity to reduce the impacts of disasters and extreme weather and bounce back when they occur—what’s known as “resilience”—is vital to saving lives and money. Put simply, lawmakers’ consistent failure to reduce, plan for, and adapt to the impacts of climate change is imposing an implicit tax on Americans. And while they can’t pass legislation to stop storms and wildfires, elected officials across levels of government have the power to reduce this tax by instituting policies that contribute to an evidence-based, bipartisan national climate resilience system.

Disasters and extreme weather are economic disruptors, preventing Americans from going to work and drawing a paycheck. Since 1980, there have been over 400 disasters in which damage exceeded $1 billion, causing a combined $2.9 trillion in economic impacts. In 2024 alone, a major disaster was declared every four days, causing 568 total deaths and billions of dollars in damages to homes and community lifelines such as hospitals, businesses, roads, and other major infrastructure. These events destroy public infrastructure, straining municipal and state budgets; they erode aspirations of homeownership, causing more regular damage to homes and increasing insurance premiums; and they can raise household costs, spiking energy prices as heatwaves and cold snaps occur more frequently.

Indeed, many of the most disaster-prone regions are locked in cycles of disaster response and recovery. While federal policies and programs for resilience exist, they have largely sprawled out of the federal emergency management system, creating a patchwork of laws and policies with little overarching national strategy. This hodgepodge of programs manages to underfund climate resilience while also unevenly allocating funding such that states and municipalities—which are more highly resourced, and thus better placed to respond to risks—tend to receive the lion’s share of funding. Importantly, the absence of a federal system is limiting our capacity to respond to new threats that are posing an increasing risk to people and infrastructure, including sea level rise, heatwaves, droughts, and cold snaps.

By exploring federal programs as well as state and local planning for climate resilience, this report poses a simple question: How are decisionmakers responding to climate risks? Starting at the national level, the report discusses the federal programs that provide funding for state and local investments in resilient infrastructure and technical assistance, as well as the limitations with the current federal system.

Then, drawing on Brookings analysis of data from the Georgetown Climate Center, the report charts the rise of resilience planning at the sub-national level—mapping which states, municipalities, and regional coalitions are implementing resilience plans. While climate resilience has become more contested federally as recent administrative actions freeze or claw back resilience grants, at the sub-national level, planning for climate resilience is more common than one may think. Municipal planning in particular has become more comprehensive and widespread, demonstrating that planning for climate impacts continues to be normalized as a function of governance.

This report is the first in a new series on climate resilience. Future reports will examine how federal and state policies and innovations in governance, insurance, housing, and other areas can bolster community-level climate resilience, and in so doing, reduce the costs that climate change is placing on American lives and livelihoods

What is climate resilience?

Climate resilience refers to a community’s ability to bounce back from a sudden shock (such as a hurricane) or a chronic shock (such as sea level rise) in ways that reduce climate risks over the long term by facilitating learning and transformation.

But how do the actions of government help reduce climate risks and build climate resilience? Because climate risks are not only a product of physical events such as temperature extremes, but are also due to socioeconomic factors such as poverty (which can amplify impacts), building resilience takes changes in social and economic policies as well as the built environment. As Figure 1 shows, climate risks result from at least three distinct factors:

Hazards: The physical events themselves, such as hurricanes, storms, and wildfires

Exposure: How susceptible human structures such as roads and homes are to being impacted by hazards

Vulnerability: The social and economic circumstances of communities and individuals, including wealth and access to health care, that can moderate the impacts of hazards

Because policies and infrastructure can’t themselves reduce the occurrence of hazards, bolstering resilience occurs through changes in either exposure or vulnerability. For example, alterations in the built environment such as fortifying roofs and building sea walls can help reduce exposure to coastal storm surges, while new social and economic programs such as subsidizing affordable housing can reduce vulnerability by decreasing the likelihood that a hazard will cause chronic financial stress.

Resilience policies are most effective when they target exposure and vulnerability together. For example, a community where flooding is infrequent may still have high climate risks if homes are in flood zones and most residents are low-income renters without flood insurance. Similarly, a community with frequent flooding may be low risk if housing is raised and robust social and economic programs are available to aid families that are displaced or temporarily unemployed.

The federal resilience system is unnecessarily complex, and leaves communities underprepared for changing risks

In their current form, federal laws and programs for climate resilience are falling short of needs. Unlike 87% of countries globally, the U.S. has no federal legal or policy structure to facilitate and coordinate nationwide resilience planning. Instead, a complex, fragmented, and piecemeal national structure has evolved, spreading across numerous laws, departments, and programs with complex statutory authority and responsibilities. In terms of dollars spent, this system is over-indexed toward disaster recovery rather than resilience—and in some cases, is leading to unequitable outcomes.

Many policies that target climate resilience are connected to the sprawling federal disaster and emergency management system, which itself spans multiple agencies and laws. For example, programs to reduce community-level exposure to disasters through building more resilient infrastructure—such as the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Assistance Grants, and the 2021 STORM Act—were all enacted through amendments to the 1988 Stafford Act (the foundational law for federal disaster response). Meanwhile, the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) programs, including CDBG-Mitigation, which explicitly funds resilience, were enacted through the statutes associated with the 1974 Housing and Community Development (HCD) Act.

Further still, other laws that largely provide funding for more resilient public infrastructure—such as provisions under the 2014 Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation (WIFIA) Act, which provides resilience dollars for municipal water management, and the 1976 Energy Conservation and Production (ECPA) Act, which authorizes grants under the Department of Energy for fortifying homes—are disconnected from the Stafford Act and the other laws that govern most emergency response functions.

Arguably more influential than statutory regulations are indirect contributors that shape the fiscal and municipal planning environment. These include rules under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which governs how federal agencies plan public infrastructure, and the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) insurance requirements, which set the rules around home and property insurance as well as risk-reporting standards.

To provide an indication of the complexity of the federal system, Figure 2 shows a non-exhaustive list of federal programs that provide funding to bolster climate resilience at the state and/or local level, as well as the agencies responsible for coordinating those programs. These programs are sorted into four domains of resilience planning: 1) reducing exposure through changes in the built environment; 2) reducing exposure through changes in the natural environment; 3) reducing vulnerability through social and economic programs; and 4) providing technical assistance and research services to improve state and local adaptive capacity. While not exhaustive, the figure shows the diversity of program types, functions, and—as discussed later in this report—the current status of funding. Several programs whose primary function is not resilience but that nevertheless bolster resilience through providing a financial safety net for households are also listed under the “reducing vulnerability” function, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), the National Flood Insurance Program, and post-disaster aid such as FEMA’s Individual Assistance.

Figure 2 shows that major programs span at least 10 agencies, with 39 separate programs—although the true number is likely higher, as the figure excludes programs that indirectly contribute to climate resilience. Many of these programs are managed by three agencies: FEMA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Their functions span from managing competitive grants processes for new infrastructure to providing technical assistance and research services for local and state agencies to conduct vulnerability assessments. While many of these programs, such as U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ public works and the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s CDBG program are geared toward reducing exposure through changes in the built environment or ecosystem restoration, few programs target reductions in social vulnerability, particularly in terms of pre-disaster risk reduction.

These laws and programs are an imperfect fit as a foundation for a comprehensive climate resilience system. Overall, the funding available to states, regions, and municipalities to build climate resilience is small compared to both the funding available for disaster response and recovery as well as the demand from communities. From 2019 to 2023, FEMA spent an average of $39.5 billion in annual and supplemental appropriations for disaster response and recovery. A recent Government Accountability Office report found that by 2050, the federal government could spend between $26 billion and $134 billion annually (in 2021 dollars) on disaster response and recovery.

While FEMA does set aside funds for risk mitigation, the majority is only available to states and communities after a disaster strikes. Between FY 2010 and FY 2018, 88% of FEMA grants that target resilience (delivered primarily through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program and Public Assistance) were only available after a federal disaster declaration was given. With the passing of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act in 2018, and later the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Congress has increased the funding available for resilience before a disaster occurs. However, post-disaster funding still dwarfs pre-disaster funding.

States and municipalities have been quick to make use of available funds, particularly where federal dollars are more flexible and allow grantees to set their own priorities for resilience. For example, requested funds for the BRIC program, which started granting in 2020, have increased each year of the program’s existence, reaching $5.7 billion in 2023—yet the funds available have hovered around $1 billion annually (although spiking in 2022 at $2.4 billion). Programs such as Promoting Resilient Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving Transportation (PROTECT) Formula Program, implemented under the IIJA to provide funding to make surface transportation more resilient to hazards, has a larger annual spend ($1.5 billion in 2025), but more limitations in how funds can be spent.

While more flexible funding such as BRIC has increased federal spending on climate resilience, these programs have not been without problems. Recent research shows that funding under BRIC has consistently benefited wealthier communities over disadvantaged ones where funding is needed most. In 2023, 78% of BRIC funding went to East Coast and West Coast states, where local government agencies tend to be better resourced and have a greater capacity to apply for funding. Part of the problem is that the tools developed to support grant distribution, such as the National Risk Index, consistently underestimate the role of vulnerability and overestimate exposure in assessing disaster risks. This can lead to communities with higher private and commercial property values—and thus, higher expected losses from disasters—being prioritized for funding over communities where social factors such as high poverty rates and rental precarity are driving vulnerability.

Once a bipartisan issue, resilience planning at the federal level has been caught in political battles

Despite these limitations, there is a larger issue looming. The current system is breaking down under the growing impacts of climate change as they become more widespread; for example, deaths from heatwaves (which are not eligible for federal disaster declarations) now contribute to more deaths annually than all other disasters, including hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires combined. Yet calls for climate resilience have become politically contentious. A clear tension has developed between the reality that climate change is impacting more communities and infrastructure on one hand, and polarization over climate action on the other. Recently, this tension has had real consequences, stripping communities of access to federal resources and limiting the availability of public data and decision-support tools.

In 2022, planning for a federal climate resilience system began in earnest. The Biden administration introduced the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a spending program to modernize infrastructure, which included $369 billion to spur climate adaptation and decarbonization. The climate dollars authorized under the IRA—and to a lesser extent under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)—were intended to subsidize consumers to purchase greener technologies, help state and local governments build capacity, develop a financial ecosystem to fund adaptation and decarbonization projects, and fund more resilient infrastructure at the state and local level as well as for Tribes. Some of this funding emphasized justice and racial equity as a policy goal, including the development of new data tools to help identify historically underfunded and highly vulnerable communities for prioritized investments. Republicans fiercely opposed these efforts, portraying them as frivolous spending that was advancing economically destructive and unfair policy.

Then, in 2023, the administration developed the first National Climate Resilience Framework—a policy guide detailing the responsibilities and expectations for federal, state, and local government, as well as philanthropy and the private sector, in tackling the impacts of climate change on individuals and communities. On January 10, 2025, 10 days before the inauguration of the Trump administration, the Biden administration quietly released the National Adaptation and Resilience Planning Strategy—the nation’s first real scaffold for a national resilience system.

Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration has rescinded large portions of the IRA, including curbing spending on renewable energy generation and revoking policies for environmental justice. While the focus has been on dismantling regulations and policies supporting decarbonization, climate resilience planning has been caught in the crosshairs. Figure 2 shows that over the course of 2025, the Trump administration has frozen or clawed back over $5 billion in funding for climate resilience and adaptation that was allocated under the IRA. Within that total, the administration has terminated the bipartisan BRIC program, which would have provided around $582.8 million in federal funds for climate resilience in 2025, and cancelled an estimated $882 million in previous BRIC awards from 2020 to 2023. The Trump administration has also made it harder for states and regions to plan for climate impacts by disbanding the National Climate Assessment and defunding functions of NOAA to monitor disaster impacts and provide research services.

There is an argument that the Trump administration was given a mandate to take these actions, and they are not necessarily misaligned with voters’ preferences either. Indeed, voters’ concerns over climate change have become more polarized over the last 15 years. In 2024, an estimated 47% of moderate Republicans and 24% of conservative Republicans said they were somewhat or very worried about climate change, compared to 94% of liberal Democrats and 87% of moderate Democrats. This is despite the fact that a larger number of Americans have been impacted by extreme weather, disasters, or sea level rise over the same period. However, voters don’t always connect disasters and extreme weather to climate change, even when they themselves are impacted. For this reason, voters may be unwilling to support climate action even when the intended outcome is resilience rather than shuttering oil and gas facilities.

The Trump administration does seem to understand this dynamic, being opposed neither to the concept of resilience nor to the goal of reducing the risks of natural hazards. For example, a March 19 executive order, “Achieving Efficiency Through State and Local Preparedness,” establishes a process for developing a “National Resilience Strategy.” Avoiding the term “climate change,” the executive order connects resilience to national security, cyber threats, extreme weather, and disaster response. Yet despite a commitment to publish before late June, this strategy has yet to publicly materialize. To be clear, the Trump administration has taken actions that have reduced the availability and accessibility of resilience funds. However, at least in words, the administration has signaled its commitment to resilience even if it’s not willing to use the term “climate.”

While it’s difficult to assess the ultimate aims of the administration, a January 24, 2025, executive order and FEMA’s recent slow-walking of federal disaster declarations appear to make one position clear: State, regional, and municipal governments, rather than the federal government, should bear most costs for disaster recovery and risk reduction.

At the state and local level, resilience planning is more comprehensive and widespread

In this increasingly politicized federal system, it would be easy to assume that climate resilience planning in the U.S. has stalled or is even moving backward. However, exploring the sub-national level reveals that many states and municipal governments are making tremendous progress.

Map 1 shows that most states (33 in total) have undertaken some form of resilience planning since 2008, including publishing a state resilience plan, launching a state resilience or adaptation agency, appointing a chief resilience officer, or launching a resilience or adaptation taskforce. Twenty-four states have published resilience or adaptation plans, with 58.3% (14) of the plans published or updated within the last five years, and 87.5% (21) published or updated within the last 10 years. Twenty-nine percent of states (15 in total) have resilience and adaptation offices that bear responsibility for climate resilience planning. A further four states are in the process of developing a resilience plan, having organized resilience or adaptation task forces.

These plans vary in their comprehensiveness and implementation. For example, Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan, updated from an earlier plan from 2008, responds to a limited range of natural hazards (sea level rise, coastal erosion, and flooding), and adopts a strategy to bolster resilience largely through reducing the exposure of coastal infrastructure and housing. Meanwhile, California’s Climate Adaptation Strategy—and recent updates, including the Safeguarding California Plan—target a wider range of hazards and social and economic policy changes, guided through progressive principles including economic justice and racial equity.

Thirteen states have made climate resilience a priority by appointing a chief resiliency officer (CRO) tasked with overseeing resilience planning across the state. The earliest of these came in 2014, after Virginia passed a state statute to appoint a CRO, and as late as 2023, with the appointment of a CRO in Maryland under Governor Wes Moore. While these positions are relatively new (and in most cases have only held planning authority rather than control over state resources), the adoption of CROs is an indication that a growing number of states recognize the importance of resilience planning.

At the state level, not only is climate resilience planning more common than might be expected given the fraught federal policy environment, it also isn’t necessarily correlated with political affiliation. Almost all coastal states—including predominately Republican-voting states such as Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, and South Carolina, but excluding Georgia, Texas, and Alabama—have adopted state resilience plans or appointed CROs. These states have fewer voters than the national average who believe that climate change is affecting the weather, so this likely reflects the reality of disasters in these states. The earliest plans, such as those adopted in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina, focused on regions that were already more disaster-prone, aiming to reduce exposure to hurricanes, floods, and coastal erosion. Indeed, this pattern breaks down in interior red states, with few of them having resilience plans despite the increasing risks of droughts, heatwaves, and cold snaps.

Municipal, county, and regional governments across the US have embraced climate resilience planning

Many municipalities and county governments, as well as regional coalitions, are in the process of implementing climate resilience plans. Implementation is taking place across all states and the District of Columbia, with a wave of planning having started as early as 2010.

Updating data originally compiled by the Georgetown Climate Center from 2005 to 2022, Figure 4 captures the total number of cities, counties, and regions that have published resilience plans, and also tracks how those plans have changed over time. The figure excludes instances where plans have been updated, and also tracks how resilience is articulated—moving from a purely physical concept that focuses on exposure in earlier plans to a physical and social concept that also considers inequity and injustice in more recent plans.

Figure 4 shows that 272 sub-national entities have undertaken some form of climate resilience or adaptation planning since 2005. Fifty-five government entities—including major cities such as Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago, as well as uniquely exposed cities such as New Orleans, Norfolk, Va., and Miami—have undertaken two or more rounds of planning, with 347 plans published in total. Brookings analysis of these plans demonstrates that over time, municipal resilience plans have become more complex—responding to a wider variety of hazards, and involving a greater emphasis on social vulnerability, justice, and equity as core components of climate resilience.

The rise of resilience planning—and the content of the plans themselves—have followed international and U.S. policy trends. Arguably the largest influence came between 2013 and 2019, with the launch of the multibillion-dollar philanthropic project 100 Resilient Cities—an international program to help cities across the world plan for and adapt to the impacts of climate change. In the U.S., these cities included New York, Boston, Norfolk, Va., Los Angeles, Berkeley, Calif., Dallas, New Orleans, and Atlanta. While the program was dissolved in 2019, it was influential in repositioning cities, rather than nations, as important drivers of climate resilience. Visible in Figure 4, the program also helped to normalize vulnerability reduction through social programs as an aspect of resilience. To a lesser extent, justice and equity were also normalized as targets for municipal climate resilience planning. Between 2013 and 2016, for example, 75 plans were published or updated in the U.S., and 22 included social equity as a metric to measure progress toward climate resilience (though how equity was framed varied considerably across cities).

A further set of plans was developed in response to funding made available under the IRA. The act created the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant, managed by the EPA, which provided funding for states, local governments, and Tribes to develop greenhouse gas emissions reduction plans (named Priority Climate Action Plans, or PCAPs, and Comprehensive Climate Action Plans, or CCAPs), which most municipalities took as an opportunity to plan for climate resilience. These were required for municipalities to apply for further funding under the IRA, and mostly published in 2024 and 2025, with a number of plans still undergoing public review.

In some states, such as California and Massachusetts, developing municipal- or county-level resilience plans has been required by state law and supported by state funding. In part due to these state laws that have spurred planning, municipalities in California and Massachusetts represent over 24% of all plans that exist nationally. In other states, such as Florida, resilience planning has followed a more regional approach, with municipalities and counties forming coalitions to advance climate resilience. The Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, for example, which has existed since 2009, presents a consolidated vision for climate resilience across Miami-Dade, Broward, Monroe, and Palm Beach counties.

While planning and implementation is happening in many municipalities, there are some important caveats. First, the depth and rigor of planning can vary considerably, including the definition of basic terms such as “justice” and “equity.” According to recent research, of the 58 out of the 100 largest cities with climate action plans, 40 included the term “justice” either as an aspiration or a focus of planning, while only 20 explicitly planned for improvements in justice. Importantly, this report has not assessed how plans were developed, including their mechanisms for engaging communities during plan development or throughout implementation, nor the extent to which planning reflects constituents’ attitudes and preferences. Neither does this report review progress in implementation or the extent to which planning has so far delivered actual outcomes. These are all critical questions for further research.

Municipal and state activity show there is a clear demand for bipartisan climate resilience, but new policies are needed to create durable action

The actions taking place in states and local governments, as well as creative financing being trialed in regions across the U.S., demonstrate that elected officials realize that resilience is too important to be used as a political wedge. The impacts of climate change are undermining traditional pathways to economic mobility, including homeownership, small business creation, and affordability. Because of these impacts, building resilience isn’t just a strategy to reduce risks—it can also be a driver of growth and economic innovation, and contribute to securing a future where more Americans can reach the ladders of opportunity they’ve been promised.

This is not to say that states, municipalities, and regions can advance climate resilience alone. These governments would still benefit from federal laws and policies that clarify objectives, set standards, and incentivize action by providing clear and consistent funding. Moreover, federal support can help guarantee fairness, ensuring that implementation unfolds in response to risks and needs rather than local governance capacity or market trends.

New policies are needed. Future reports in this series will build on the data presented here by exploring the types of policies and innovations that could be scaled to provide federal and state policies that are more durable to political challenges. Importantly, this will include policies that articulate climate resilience not only as a goal in itself, but also as a mechanism to advance broader objectives such as regional economic development, economic mobility, and affordability.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/rescue-operation-flooding-hurricane-debby.jpg?quality=75,N,,2026-01-09 17:13:53.437177

In late December, the U.S. EPA informed the judge overseeing a case related to the Renewable Fuel Standard that it was aiming to finalize 2026 fuel volume obligations sometime in the first quarter. The delay could trigger a shift in compliance deadlines for refiners expected to purchase renewable fuels, creating new uncertainty for producers.

In a letter sent Thursday to the EPA, Clean Fuels Alliance America said the delay is creating “intolerable uncertainty,” especially for growers of crops used to create biomass-based fuels. Elsewhere, Argus Media reported that “the market is at a standstill” because final volume requirements that EPA will impose are still unclear.

When the EPA proposed its update to the Renewable Fuel Standard last year, it included volume obligations for 2025, 2026 and 2027 that biogas groups found to be disappointingly low. But having the certainty of multiple years of volume obligations would still send clear market signals, especially in comparison to EPA’s relative silence as it works to finalize the proposed update.

Last year, the Trump administration introduced a series of policy changes that affected the biofuels market from all sides. Among those changes is a plan to limit the amount of foreign fuels that can enter the RFS market, which would shrink supply and boost prices for domestically produced renewable fuels. But the administration is also granting a large number of exemptions from the program to small fuel refineries, reducing demand.

Despite those conflicting signals, experts predict the market will improve in 2026. D3 RIN prices, those used for cellulosic biofuels like RNG, began to trend upward in the second half of 2025, and may average around $2.50 to $2.60 per RIN in 2026, according to an investor note from Jefferies.

Vanguard Renewables opens digester and depackager in Wisconsin

Private equity-backed Vanguard Renewables commenced operations at its anaerobic digestion and depackaging facility in River Falls, Wisconsin, last month. The site is processing food and beverage waste from manufacturers, retailers and processors in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region.

The new facility already has more than 30 customers, Vanguard reported. It can process up to 275 tons of food and beverage waste per day and generate up to 289,000 mmBtus of RNG annually. The facility is also part of a major deal Vanguard struck with AstraZeneca in 2023 to supply RNG for the company’s U.S. pharmaceutical operations.

Vanguard has been pursuing an aggressive nationwide growth strategy with its facilities.

WM and Denver to collaborate on RNG facility

The Denver Arapahoe Disposal Site, a landfill owned by the city of Denver, will get Colorado’s first landfill-gas-to-RNG facility thanks to a new agreement with WM. Approved by the city council on Dec. 1, the agreement allows WM to finance, build and operate the facility and pay the city royalties on revenue generated.

The landfill currently captures about a third of its gas and converts it to electricity, while the rest is flared. The project partners expect construction will begin later this year, and operations will begin in 2027.

WM has made steady progress on its goal to build 20 new RNG facilities between 2022 and 2026. It plans to deliver the final five facilities by the end of this year, according to the company’s most recent sustainability report. Combined, the 20 new facilities are projected to generate approximately 25 million mmBtus of RNG.

Clean Energy Fuels brings large dairy RNG project online

Public company Clean Energy Fuels completed work on an RNG facility at the South Fork Dairy plant in Dimmitt, Texas. The company broke ground on the $85 million project in July 2024 and is now injecting gas into the interstate natural gas pipeline.

The facility, which Clean Energy Fuels describes as one of the country’s largest, has capacity to process up to 300,000 gallons of manure each day. It’s expected to produce 2.6 million gallon-equivalents of RNG annually.

“The requirements to reach production and injecting milestones were extremely stringent and we are incredibly proud of the team for getting our seventh RNG facility online, on time and on budget. It’s no small feat,” Clean Energy Fuels Senior Vice President Clay Corbus said in a statement.

The company worked with T Diamond Bar and Montrose Environmental to develop the facility.

Noble Environmental sells $34.8 million in tax credits

Pennsylvania-based Noble Environmental closed the 34.8 millionsale of tax credits generated by two RNG facilities. The company said the facilities are part of a portfolio of three landfill-gas-to-RNG plants that came online last year.

The transaction is enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allowed developers of alternative energy assets to sell the tax credits that their investments generated to other entities looking to reduce their tax liability. Investment tax credits have historically been used to incentivize the development of clean energy technology, according to Crux Capital.

In September, Noble Environmental announced the closing of a $100 million bond backed by the Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority. The company pursued the financing to improve its landfill gas facilities across the state, Noble Executive Chairman Nick Stork said at the time.

Longtime RNG producer Aemetis secured $17 million from an unnamed buyer of tax credits related to its RNG production at the end of last year. The company has sold about $95 million worth of investment tax credits to date as its dairy biogas and alternative energy facilities come online.

The newest sale includes $12 million in proceeds from investment tax credits and $5 million in clean fuel production credits. It’s the first time Aemetis reported selling the latter type of credit.

Aemetis began generating the clean fuel production credits, known in the U.S. tax code as Section 45Z, on Jan. 1, According to its most recent annual report. Aemetis expects to generate an increasing amount of those credits as RNG production ramps up, and it will continue to sell them to improve liquidity.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jR4sVjTSt6IMB3qPBBJFYFj8O2fhNOVFOiB589LwClA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9WYW5ndWFyZF9SZW5ld2FibGVzX05ld19SaXZlcl9GYWxsc19GYWNpbGl0eS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-09 12:58:48.787505

Zacks Investment Research","U.S. legacy automaker General Motors GM is taking a financial hit as it slows down its aggressive electric vehicle (EV) push. The company notified that it will record about $6 billion in special charges in fourth-quarter 2025 due to its EV rollback. These one-time expenses will drag down net income but won’t affect adjusted earnings.

A major part of this burden comes from $1.8 billion in unused EV equipment and about $4.2 billion in supplier settlements, contract cancellations and other related costs. This follows a $1.6 billion EV-related charge it absorbed in the third quarter, pushing GM’s total EV-linked hit for 2025 to $7.6 billion.

Notably, GM will also book another $1.1 billion tied mostly to restructuring a Chinese joint venture.

Why GM Stepped Back From EVs

General Motors is scaling back its EV plans amid a shift in U.S. policy and consumer demand. Under the Trump administration, several EV-friendly incentives and stricter emission rules introduced during the Biden era have been rolled back. This resulted in slower EV adoption, weaker demand and fading tax benefits for buyers.

General Motors had gone all-in on EVs during the Biden years. CEO Mary Barra set bold goals, including selling only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. But with consumer demand cooling and incentives fading, GM decided to “right-size” its EV plans to match real demand instead of chasing volumes that no longer look achievable in the near term.

The company has made several operational changes as part of this pivot. The Orion plant, originally planned for EVs, will now build profitable pickup trucks like the Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. GM is also reducing battery production exposure by selling part of its stake in Ultium Cells to LG Energy Solution. It cut shifts and laid off workers at its Factory Zero EV plant as demand softened.

The slowdown is already visible in the numbers. After federal EV tax credits expired, GM’s EV sales fell 43% year over year in fourth-quarter 2025 to just over 25,000 vehicles.

GM also warned that more costs could come in 2026 as it continues negotiations with suppliers, though those are expected to be smaller than the EV-related charges recorded in 2025.

By scaling back EV capacity that no longer matches demand, GM is basically shifting resources toward higher-margin vehicles and proven revenue drivers. While the $7.6B charge hurts 2025 results, the pivot is intended to improve capital efficiency and near-term profitability.

GM Isn’t Alone in Retreating

General Motors is not the only automaker hitting the brakes on its EV ambitions.

Its closest peer, Ford F, is also stepping back from its once-aggressive EV narrative. After pouring billions into EVs, Ford is now shifting toward what makes financial sense — profitable gas vehicles, hybrids and lower-cost EVs instead of expensive flagship programs. The company expects around $19.5 billion in special charges, mostly in the fourth quarter, as it restructures its U.S. EV strategy. Importantly, about $5.5 billion of this will hit cash flows, mainly through 2026 and 2027.

Italian-American automaker Stellantis STLA is also realigning its EV vision in the United States. Its RAM brand discontinued its planned all-electric pickup and delayed the Ramcharger EREV to late 2026. The company has acknowledged that strategic changes will lead to meaningful one-time costs as it pivots back toward hybrids and a more balanced lineup. Even though Stellantis hasn’t disclosed exact charge amounts, the message is clear — plans built during a different policy and demand environment won’t work now.

Final Thoughts

Together, these moves show that legacy automakers are no longer racing blindly toward an EV-only future. They are prioritizing flexibility, profitability, and a consumer-led strategy. Having said that, EVs remain a long-term priority, but automakers are now moving more cautiously, balancing ambition with financial discipline.

Congress may make it worse. | Grist,Tik Root,,,,,https://grist.org/energy/mobile-homes-already-have-huge-utility-bills-congress-may-make-it-worse/,"Advocates say the changes will streamline the regulatory process and keep the upfront costs of manufactured homes down.
But the Energy Department, which oversees national energy policy and production, didn’t always have a say over these standards.
But HUD last updated the relevant energy efficiency standards in 1994, and they have long lagged behind modern insulation and weatherization practices.
It still took 15 years and a lawsuit before President Joe Biden’s administration finalized new rules in 2022 that were projected to reduce utility bills in double-wide manufactured homes by an average of $475 a year.
“The paralysis is because you have two different agencies that have been tasked with creating energy standards,” Gooch said.","On Friday morning, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that would get the Department of Energy out of the business of energy standards for mobile homes — also known as manufactured homes — and could set the efficiency requirements back decades.

Advocates say the changes will streamline the regulatory process and keep the upfront costs of manufactured homes down. Critics argue that less efficient homes will cost people more money overall, and mostly benefit builders.

“This is not about poor people. This is not about working people,” said Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), who grew up in a manufactured home, on the House floor before the vote. “This is about doing the bidding of corporations.”

The average income of a manufactured home resident is around $40,000 and they “already face disproportionately high energy costs and energy use,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of the Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy at Environment America. That, she said, is why more stringent energy codes are so important. But the Energy Department, which oversees national energy policy and production, didn’t always have a say over these standards.

Starting in 1974, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, became tasked with setting building codes for manufactured homes. But HUD last updated the relevant energy efficiency standards in 1994, and they have long lagged behind modern insulation and weatherization practices. So, in 2007, Congress assigned that task to the Department of Energy. It still took 15 years and a lawsuit before President Joe Biden’s administration finalized new rules in 2022 that were projected to reduce utility bills in double-wide manufactured homes by an average of $475 a year. Even with higher upfront costs taken into account, the government predicted around $5 billion in avoided energy bills over 30-years.

At the time, the manufactured housing industry argued that DoE’s calculations were wrong and that, regardless, the upfront cost of the home should be the primary metric of affordability. Both the Biden and now Trump administrations have delayed implementation of the rule and compliance deadlines, which still aren’t in effect.

This House legislation would eliminate the DoE rule and return sole regulatory authority to HUD. Lesli Gooch, CEO of the Manufactured Housing Institute, a trade organization, describes it as essentially a process bill aimed at removing bureaucracy that has stood in the way of action. “The paralysis is because you have two different agencies that have been tasked with creating energy standards,” Gooch said. “You can’t build a house to two different sets of blueprints.”

Jake Auchincloss, a democrat from Massachusetts, agreed and called the move “common-sense regulatory reform” in a letter urging his colleagues to support the bill. Ultimately 57 democrats joined 206 republicans in voting for the bill — and it now moves to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain.

If the bill becomes law, however, the only operative benchmark would be HUD’s 1994 code and it could take years to make a new one. While more than half of the roughly 100,000 homes sold in the U.S. each year already meet or exceed the DoE’s 2022 efficiency rules, ACEEE estimates that tens of thousands are still built to just the outdated standard.

“Families are struggling,” said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director at the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, and he does not expect HUD, under Trump, to move particularly quickly on a fix. “I have not seen this administration lowering energy bills.”

For now, though, it’s the Senate’s turn to weigh in.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1248101209.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-09 12:58:31.528399

JB Pritzker signs sweeping Illinois energy law - Chicago Tribune,Jeremy Gorner,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/08/pritzker-signs-new-illinois-energy-law/,"But whether the new law will meaningfully reduce electric bills remains uncertain.
The new law authorizes the Illinois Commerce Commission to sign long-term contracts and allows for funding of pilot programs for geothermal energy networks.
The batteries that comply with the law would work with wind and solar to make the electricity they supply more consistent.
In total, by 2031, the batteries would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $3.90 to $8.28 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $1.85 per month, according to the agency.
Including all its other provisions, the IPA has said, the energy law would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $4.49 to $10.59 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $2.03 per month by 2031.","Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday signed into law sweeping energy-related legislation that promotes battery storage and makes wind and solar power more effective, among other initiatives, with the goal of reducing electricity prices amid rising utility bills for consumers.

“This was one of the most comprehensive responses to the energy crisis that we’re in in the entire nation because it was important to us,” the governor said during a ceremony at Joliet Junior College, flanked by a group of Illinois lawmakers and the law’s advocates. “There’s no time to waste in the race to make electric bills more affordable.”

Dubbed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, the new measure comes as state officials have warned that Illinois may face energy shortages and higher bills as data centers and artificial intelligence needs drive a surge in demand.

But whether the new law will meaningfully reduce electric bills remains uncertain. When the law was passed in the fall, it pitted Democrats against Republicans, who noted the massive battery installations would be partly backed by a surcharge on consumers’ monthly bills.

GOP lawmakers on Thursday criticized the measure, which received no Republican votes in the legislature.

“The Governor has signed a bill that weakens consumer protections, expands regulatory authority, and locks Illinois into costly policies,” state Sen. Sue Rezin, a Republican from Morris, said in a statement. “This law will fundamentally reshape how energy decisions are made in Illinois, and the consequences will be felt for years.”

GOP state Sen. Terri Bryant of Murphysboro said Republicans have warned that previously approved green-energy mandates in Illinois have driven up costs and weakened energy reliability, and that the 1,000-plus-page legislation Pritzker signed Thursday didn’t address either issue.

“When those warnings became reality, the Governor and his party did not course correct,” Bryant said in a statement.

Pritzker, who is running for a third term and is considered a potential 2028 presidential contender, blamed President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress for higher electricity prices across the nation, accusing them of taking action that “abruptly and arbitrarily canceled major clean energy projects that expand the supply of energy.”

State Sen. Bill Cunningham, a Chicago Democrat and a co-sponsor of the new law, said it will allow Illinois to increase the supply of energy to the power grid and reduce its price by making it easier to develop renewable energy. The law will also lift an existing moratorium on new large-scale nuclear construction and add battery storage.

“That’s what we’re doing with this bill,” he said. “That’s all going to bring more supply onto the grid and that will help hold the line on our electrical bills.”

The law was a result of negotiations between lawmakers, organized labor, environmental interests and other groups in response to an especially high demand for electricity in the last couple of years.

That high demand is partly due to the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which aims to promote greater use of renewable energy by 2030 and eventually phase out fossil fuels, as well as the prevalence of data centers that have taken up a significant share of the electrical supply due to the emergence of AI technology. The policy shift also stems from the state’s plan to retire 28 gigawatts of coal- and natural-gas generating capacity by 2045 to improve air quality.

The new law authorizes the Illinois Commerce Commission to sign long-term contracts and allows for funding of pilot programs for geothermal energy networks. It also increases subsidies to retrofit homes to use less energy.

The batteries that comply with the law would work with wind and solar to make the electricity they supply more consistent. They require billions of dollars in upfront investment to be financed by battery developers and secured through the utility bill surcharges.

But according to an estimate released in the fall by the Illinois Power Agency, the batteries would reduce average residential electricity bills by a few dollars per month by 2031 by lowering anticipated rate increases for future capacity on regional electricity grids.

The cost of deploying 3 gigawatts of batteries on the grid by 2031 would add 58 to 68 cents per month to the average residential bill for Ameren customers in mostly downstate Illinois and 40 to 48 cents for Commonwealth Edison customers in the Chicago region, according to the IPA analysis.

But the batteries would pay for themselves by reducing the anticipated rate increases for future space on regional transmission grids, the agency said. In total, by 2031, the batteries would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $3.90 to $8.28 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $1.85 per month, according to the agency.

Including all its other provisions, the IPA has said, the energy law would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $4.49 to $10.59 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $2.03 per month by 2031.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CTC-L-pritzker-presser10257636020.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-09 14:00:36.713951

Federal lawmakers can either vote to uphold a 20-year mining ban in an area just outside the protected wilderness — or opt to overturn that rule and bar similar policies in the future.

“The Boundary Waters is the nation’s most visited wilderness area. About 150,000 people from around the world visit it each year to navigate its waters and they want to see bears, beavers, lynx, moose and many more of Minnesota’s most beloved species,” said Katelynn Rolfes, conservation advocate for Environment Minnesota. “Pollution from the proposed mine would likely contaminate the waters that run into the Boundary Waters’ interconnected waterways, permanently damaging this beautiful wilderness. That’s something no one wants to see.”

If Congress rescinds the ban, it would open the door to restoring mining leases belonging to Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of the giant Chilean mining company, Antofagasta. The Boundary Waters and other nearby parts of the Superior National Forest sit on deposits of copper, nickel and other metals. This type of mining often contaminates the surrounding ecosystem with toxic metals, sulfates and other hazardous chemicals.

Given the short timeline for Congress to vote, state officials may have the best opportunity to protect the Boundary Waters.

“The State Legislature and Governor Tim Walz may be the last line of defense for this special place that has nourished the souls of so many Minnesotans and visitors to our great state for generations,” said Rolfes. “We need them to act quickly to preserve the wilderness for generations to come.”

For a decade, China has owned the global EV price war, churning out electric vehicles so cheap they’ve made Western automakers look like they’re bringing a knife to a battery fight. Ford, however, thinks it has found a way to flip the script, not by copying China’s playbook, but by tearing it up.

The automaker says it can build the world’s cheapest electric motors and sell a $30,000 electric pickup truck by doing something almost radical in today’s industry: building it in America, with Detroit-born manufacturing muscle, not California-style excess.

China makes the world’s cheapest electric vehicles. Everyone in the auto industry agrees on that — except Ford, apparently.

The company now claims it can undercut Chinese EV costs with a $30,000 electric pickup truck, provided it’s built the old-fashioned way: in the American industrial heartland, not in a high-cost, over-engineered California ecosystem. The revelation comes from Doug Field, Ford’s chief of EVs, digital and design, in an interview with MotorTrend this week

Beating China at cheap EVs isn’t supposed to be possible. China builds EVs fast, cheap, and at terrifying scale, and everyone else just tries to keep up. Ford, though, has come to the realization that the problem isn’t China at all. It’s where and how American automakers build their cars.

The company now says, by designing smarter motors, cutting the fat from production, and leaning on Detroit’s manufacturing DNA instead of Silicon Valley’s expense-heavy habits, it can deliver a $30,000 electric pickup.

The China Challenge — and Ford’s Answer

For years, Chinese automakers like BYD and others have dominated the low-cost EV segment globally thanks to massive economies of scale, lower labor costs, and highly automated factories. They’ve managed to put EVs on the road with price tags Western automakers find hard to match. According to industry analysts, Chinese brands account for a large share of EVs under $35,000 worldwide. That’s a price bracket where Western brands are barely present.

Yet Field insists Ford’s newest skunkworks (the Blue Oval’s secretive group of roughly 500 engineers mostly working out of Long Beach, California) is on track to build motors cheaper than anything Ford could source abroad, including Chinese-made units. That’s a remarkable claim for a company whose manufacturing costs have traditionally lagged behind Asian competitors.

The secret sauce, according to Field, isn’t some new magic alloy or moonshot physics breakthrough. It’s people — highly experienced engineers recruited from Tesla, Rivian, Apple and other Silicon Valley outposts, assembled in a nimble team removed from traditional Ford operations. Field argues these hires are the kind that deliver “20x” results, capable of driving down costs through smarter design and engineering choices. It’s time to show China.

Beyond China: Rethinking Ford’s Playbook

Ford’s plan is part of a broader rethink of how vehicles get designed and built. The so-called Universal EV Platform that underpins the $30K truck will require 25 percent fewer fasteners, a 22-pound lighter wiring harness, and drive as many simplifications as possible in pursuit of affordability; all designed to cut thousands of dollars in per-unit cost.

The pickup itself (a four-door crew cab) will be offered in rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive versions, with multiple battery choices that let buyers trade price for range.

Perhaps the most interesting twist in this story is that Ford doesn’t plan to throw automation at the problem. In Louisville, Kentucky, where the truck will be assembled, Ford says it will eliminate tasks entirely, reducing workstations by up to 40 percent and shaving assembly time by about 15 percent compared with traditional methods.

Rather than a high-tech robotic extravaganza, this is lean production that a human can do fast. It spotlights a sort of modern American assembly process that takes its cues from the Model T’s legendary affordability but updated for the 21st century.

Made in Detroit — Not California?

Here’s where a deeper geopolitical angle emerges. With global supply chains, rare-earth magnets still largely controlled by China, and battery production concentrated in a few geographies, Ford’s strategy is more than an industrial gambit. It’s a sovereignty play, but it’s not without contradictions.

On paper, Field’s team operates outside of Detroit, and Detroit is a hub of legacy costs and union structures that some believe would stifle innovation. Yet the vehicle itself will be put together in Louisville, drawing on the heartland’s manufacturing backbone and a deeply domestic supply of parts and labor.

This dichotomy — designed on the West Coast, built in the Midwest — reflects Ford’s bet that the intellectual work of beating China cost-wise can come from nimble, high-priced talent, while the muscle of production still thrives where it always has: in American factories.

But Does This Fix the China Problem?

Many are skeptical because they do not believe China’s advantage is about headcount but about control over the entire EV supply chain, from rare earth processing to battery gigafactories. Even if Ford’s motors are cheaper, they still require materials dominated by Asian producers. That’s a gap technology alone won’t close anytime soon.

Still, war isn’t new to the Blue Oval, and the industry has come to the point where America feels a tightening noose requiring a battle for freedom. Ford beat the Italians at the Le Mans; can Farley beat the Chinese at electrification? As many U.S. automakers recalibrate their EV ambitions due to weak demand and high costs, Ford is doubling down on the notion that the future of affordable electrification must be built at home. Like the victorious GT40.

Whether that belief will pay off in a marketplace where Chinese EV mastery is as much about volume as it is about price remains to be seen, but it’s clear Ford is tired of watching from the sidelines. The $30,000 EV pickup — slated for 2027 — may well be America’s most litmus test yet in the global EV economy.

Picture an electric car that could go 600, 700 or even 1,000 miles on a single charge. That’s much farther than the longest-range electric vehicles on the U.S. market, according to Car and Driver magazine – and twice as far the official rating for the long-range, rear-wheel-drive Tesla Model 3, which has a maximum rated range of 363 miles.

Current EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which are also found in smartphones, laptops and even large-scale energy storage systems connected to the power grid. A standard for decades, these batteries have been tweaked and improved by generations of scientists and are now close to their physical limits. Even with the best materials and most optimized designs, there is only so much energy that can be packed into a lithium-ion battery.

I’m a materials engineer who studies these batteries and seeks alternatives with better performance, improved environmental sustainability and lower cost. One promising design uses sulfur, which could boost battery capacity significantly, though some key roadblocks remain before it can be widely used.

Lithium-sulfur vs. Lithium-ion

Any battery has three basic components: a positively charged region, called the cathode; a negatively charged region, called the anode; and a substance called the electrolyte in between, through which charged atoms, also known as ions, move between the cathode and anode.

In a lithium-ion battery, the cathode is made of a metal oxide, typically containing metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt, bonded with oxygen. The materials are layered, with lithium ions physically between the layers. During charging, lithium ions detach from the layered cathode material and travel through the electrolyte to the anode.

The anode is usually graphite, which is also layered, with room for the lithium ions to fit between them. During discharge, the lithium ions leave the graphite layers, travel back through the electrolyte and reinsert into the layered cathode structure, recombining with the metal oxide to release electricity that powers cars and smartphones.

In a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium ions still move back and forth, but the chemistry is different. Its cathode is made of sulfur embedded in a carbon matrix that conducts electricity, and the anode is made primarily of lithium itself, rather than graphite layers with lithium in between.

During discharging, the lithium ions travel from the anode, through the electrolyte to the cathode, where – rather than sliding in between the cathode layers – they chemically convert sulfur in sequential steps to a series of compounds called lithium sulfides. During charging, the lithium ions separate from the sulfide compounds, leave the cathode behind and travel back to the anode.

The charging and discharging process for lithium-sulfur batteries is a chemical conversion reaction that involves more electrons than the same process in lithium-ion batteries. That means a lithium-sulfur battery can theoretically store much more energy than a lithium-ion battery of the same size.

Sulfur is inexpensive and abundantly available worldwide, meaning battery manufacturers do not need to rely on scarce metals such as nickel and cobalt, which are unevenly distributed on Earth and often sourced from regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has limited worker safety regulations and fair labor practices.

Those advantages could deliver batteries with far more capacity and that are cheaper and more sustainable to produce.

Why aren’t lithium-sulfur batteries widely used yet?

The biggest obstacle to mass production and use of sulfur-based batteries is durability. A good lithium-ion battery, like those in an electric vehicle, can go through thousands of cycles of discharging and recharging before its capacity starts to fade. That amounts to thousands of car rides.

But lithium-sulfur batteries tend to lose capacity much more quickly, sometimes after fewer than 100 cycles. That’s not very many trips at all.

The reason lies in the chemistry. During the chemical reactions that store and release energy in a lithium-sulfur battery, some of the lithium sulfide compounds dissolve into the liquid electrolyte of the battery.

When that happens, those amounts of both sulfur and lithium are removed from being used in any remaining reactions. This effect, known as “shuttling,” means that with each round of discharging and recharging, there are fewer elements available to release and store energy.

In the past couple of decades, research has produced improved designs. Earlier versions of these batteries lost much of their capacity within a few dozen discharge–recharge cycles, and even the best laboratory prototypes struggled to survive beyond a few hundred.

New prototypes retain more than 80% of their initial capacity even after thousands of cycles. This improvement comes from redesigning the key parts of the battery and adjusting the chemicals involved: Special electrolytes help prevent the lithium sulfides from dissolving and shuttling.

The electrodes have also been improved, using materials such as porous carbon that can physically trap the intermediate lithium sulfides, stopping them from wandering away from the cathode. This helps the discharge and recharge reactions happen without so many losses, making the reactions more efficient so the battery lasts longer.

The road ahead

Lithium-sulfur batteries are no longer fragile laboratory curiosities, but there are significant challenges before they can become serious contenders for real-world energy storage.

In terms of safety, lithium-sulfur batteries have a less volatile cathode than lithium-ion batteries, but research is continuing into other aspects of safety.

Another problem is that the more energy a lithium-sulfur battery stores, the fewer cycles of charging it can handle. That’s because the chemical reactions involved are more intense with increased energy.

This trade-off may not be a major obstacle for using these batteries in drones or grid-level energy storage, where ultrahigh energy densities are less critical. But for electric vehicles, which demand both high energy capacity and long cycle life, scientists and battery researchers still need to sort out a workable balance. That means the foundation for the next generation of lithium-sulfur batteries is likely still a few years down the road.

Federal agencies collectively finalized $129.7 billion in net regulatory cost savings and 50.9 million hours in paperwork reductions in 2025, making it the most deregulatory calendar year recorded in RegRodeo.

While only two actions accounted for most of those totals, the renewed regulatory budget program under Executive Order (EO) 14192 largely constrained new costs; that EO and proposed rulemakings currently under development are set to bring even more dramatic cost reductions over the next year or so.

The first year of the second Trump term also brought a nearly unprecedented level of EOs and an aggressive push to re-orient typical regulatory procedures – the implications of which remain largely unknown.

INTRODUCTION

The change-over in administrations, even just across a single year, could not be more apparent. In 2024, federal agencies under the Biden Administration had the costliest year of regulations on record. In 2025, with the return of the Trump Administration’s deregulatory agenda under Executive Order (EO) 14192, federal agencies had the highest level to-date of regulatory cost reductions. Final rules accounted for nearly $130 billion in net savings (and nearly 60 million hours annually in paperwork reductions) while $4 billion in additional reductions came from Biden-era rules repealed under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), with hundreds of billions more still in the offing from currently proposed rules. A deeper examination reveals, however, that much of that final rule total is attributable to just two rulemakings. Nevertheless, this past year in regulation – or rather, deregulation – lays claim to a significant record. There’s also plenty to suggest the current administration is poised to make even more profound changes to the administrative state in the coming year.

SNAPSHOT OF FINAL RULES WITH ESTIMATED ECONOMIC IMPACTS

MOST SIGNIFICANT FINAL RULES OF THE YEAR

The following tables include the top five final rules published this past year across a series of categories:

Top 5 Costliest Rules

Agency Rule Cost ($ billions) Justice Preventing Access to U.S. Sensitive Personal Data and Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern or Covered Persons 4.1* Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Standards To Protect Aquatic Life in the Delaware River 2.3 Homeland Security Cybersecurity in the Marine Transportation System 1.2* Homeland Security Enhanced Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) 0.9 Health & Human Services Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2026 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly 0.8

Top 5 Cost-cutting Rules

Agency Rule Savings ($ billions) Treasury Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Requirement Revision and Deadline Extension -84.0 Health & Human Services Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Repeal of Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities -55.1 Environmental Protection Agency Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category-Deadline Extensions -1.4 Environmental Protection Agency Extension of Deadlines in Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review Final Rule -1.4 Health & Human Services Medicare Program; FY 2026 Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities Prospective Payment System-Rate Update -0.3

*Denotes Biden Administration rule

The main conclusions to draw from the above rules are that 2025: A) saw relatively restrained new burden-adding rules, and B) had a cost-cutting topline largely propped up by two very significant rulemakings. The top five costliest rules add up to roughly $9.3 billion in overall costs. This represents roughly two-thirds of the total from all cost-additive final rules for the year: approximately $14 billion. For historical context, per RegRodeo data, the only calendar years with lower net totals than $14 billion were 2018 (the only other net-deregulatory year), 2005, and 2006. As such, the impact of final regulatory actions this past year was relatively restrained.

The cost-cutting top five is largely dominated by two rulemakings: the roll-back of the beneficial ownership rule and the effective repeal of the long-term care rule. The American Action Forum (AAF) covered the further implications of each here and here, respectively. Note that without these two rules , 2025 would clock in at roughly $9.4 billion in net total costs across all final regulatory and deregulatory rules. Even taking into account the cost reductions from CRA repeals (see below), this past year would have still been net-regulatory if not for these two specific rules.

CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT

The past year also saw some significant developments under the Congressional Review Act, the law that allows a new Congress and administration to repeal certain rules issued by the preceding administration via an expedited process. As of year’s end, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 70 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in estimated compliance costs. Of these, 22 have been signed into law. By way of comparison, across the entire history of the CRA, there had only been 20 successful resolutions of disapproval before this term. These resolutions repealed a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs. The Trump Administration estimates that the repeal of this rule yields an additional $936 million in savings. Full details of the rules affected can be found here at AAF’s CRA Tracker.

REGULATORY BUDGET ASSESSMENT

Similar to AAF’s examination of the administration’s EO 14192 progress at the six-month mark, the closing of the calendar year provides an opportunity to take a closer look at where agencies stand in terms of regulatory budget implementation. Across all the final rules recorded in RegRodeo for 2025, AAF has identified 67 that include some discussion of their relationship to EO 14192. The following table provides a breakdown of those rules:

Designation # of Rules Total Costs/Savings Total Paperwork Deregulatory 40 $-143.1 billion -54 million hours Regulatory 3 $3.1 billion 0.6 million hours Exempt 8 $2.4 billion 5.8 million hours Not Applicable/Ambiguous 16 $0.7 billion -5.3 million hours

The primary takeaway here is that, for rules that had a clear designation as either regulatory or deregulatory, federal agencies were successful at a top-line level in meeting the 10 deregulatory actions for every one regulatory action ratio as well as producing $140 billion in net savings. In a late-December announcement, the administration claimed to have achieved a 129-to-1 deregulatory-to-regulatory ratio with net savings of nearly $212 billion. That statement did not include much in the way of supporting documentation of those claims beyond highlighting a handful of actions. The main discrepancy between AAF’s figures here and those in the administration’s announcement is likely due to AAF’s analysis focusing on published rulemakings that contain some kind of measurable economic effect, whereas the administration’s appears to include less formalized actions (such as ending the “shoes-off” policy for airport screening) to which it ascribes an ad hoc estimate.

As the other two lines in the above table make clear, there are also some rulemakings that include a discussion of EO 14192, but do not fall neatly into the deregulatory versus regulatory breakdown. Eight of these claim the EO’s exemption for “regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or immigration-related function of the United States.” One of the novel aspects of EO 14192 compared to its spiritual predecessor, EO 13771, is the inclusion of an immigration policy exemption. Given the aggressive nature of this administration’s immigration policies, it is not surprising to see such rules add more costs – regardless of whether the administration cares to account for them in its regulatory budget math.

Additionally, there are rules for which the agency does not make a clear EO 14192 designation one way or another, despite the rule’s language suggesting that it could or should have. For instance, this Department of Health and Human Services rule contains the following passage regarding the EO in its section responding to public comments: “Regarding Executive Order 14192, we refer stakeholders to section IX.J. of this final rule for a discussion of the rule’s interaction with this order.” Yet when one goes to the relevant section, the agency simply includes a rote restatement of the EO’s primary objective with no actual determination on where the rule falls. Interestingly enough, if one were to include the rules that either explicitly claim an exemption or are otherwise indeterminate, that would essentially double-up the net cost and paperwork totals of those designated as regulatory under the EO.

PROPOSED RULES HEADING INTO 2026

Top 5 Costliest Proposed Rules

Agency Rule Cost ($ billions) Homeland Security Trade and National Security Actions and Low-Value Shipments 71.9* Food & Drug Administration Tobacco Product Standard for Nicotine Yield of Cigarettes and Certain Other Combusted Tobacco Products 58* Health & Human Services HIPAA Security Rule To Strengthen the Cybersecurity of Electronic Protected Health Information 32* Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation: Controlled Unclassified Information 15.9* Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program: Standards for 2026 and 2027, Partial Waiver of 2025 Cellulosic Biofuel Volume Requirement, and Other Changes 12.2

*Denotes Biden Administration rule

The main trend that jumps out in examining the most significant proposed rules of the year is simply the increase in order of magnitude across the board. For final rules, outside of the two big deregulatory measures discussed above, many of the actions were substantial, if not earth-shattering. The 2025 headliner proposed rules, however, play in the realm of the tens and even hundreds of billions of dollars.

The other main dichotomy comes in how the respective administrations are represented in each of these above lists. All but of one of the top regulatory proposals came during the waning days of the Biden Administration, whereas all but one of the deregulatory standouts comes from the current administration. It is worth pointing out, however, that while the costliest proposal here is one of the very last rulemakings attributable to the Biden Administration, the Trump Administration has largely implemented it via its own trade policy maneuvers.

Turning to the cost-cutting rules, the clear implication is that, assuming the top four listed above come due in largely the same form as their proposed versions, 2026 is set to be an even more dramatic year in terms of deregulatory efforts. Led by the monumental proposed rule seeking to rescind the EPA endangerment finding – and subsequent rules like tailpipe emissions standards – the coming year could see at least $1 trillion in total cost reductions. That figure may very well be the floor, too.

OTHER ASPECTS OF TRUMP 2.0 REGULATORY POLICY

Executive Orders

In contrast to the administration’s overall emphasis on limiting new regulatory requirements, there is one aspect of the administrative state where it – and more specifically the president, himself – stood out historically: the issuance of EOs. Per Federal Register data on the matter, President Trump issued 225 EOs last year– which is the most in a calendar year since 1942 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This one-year total is also greater than the amount issued during the entirety of the following presidential terms:

Biden (162)

Trump 1 (220)

W. Bush (166)

Ford (169)

Kennedy (214)

Granted, outside of areas where a president exerts direct control (such as national security concerns or organizational decisions), EOs typically direct subordinate officials and/or agencies to undertake a given action or set of actions over some window of time. As such, the immediate policy impact of EOs can often be quite limited.

Nevertheless, the historically high level of EOs issued suggests that President Trump has found a preference for such actions as a policy vehicle. Additionally, even if the EO document itself does not immediately affect policy provisions, it can spur agencies to act expeditiously on a given matter. One notable example from this past year that demonstrates this – albeit in a somewhat legally dubious way – is EO 14264. That EO, titled “Maintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads,” directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to repeal a Biden-era rule on “Energy Conservation Program: Definition of Showerhead.” Less than a week after the president signed the EO, DOE obliged and declared the rule in question repealed without the typical rulemaking process. The main authority the agency cites for such an action is EO 14264. It remains unclear whether that claim to policymaking authority is legitimate.

Changes to Rulemaking Process

The showerhead EO and repeal rule happen to also be one of many examples from the past year of the Trump Administration trying to increase the White House’s direct control over regulatory policy decisions and to side-step the usual rulemaking procedures. Last spring, through a series of EOs, the administration:

Extended its purview over regulatory review to agencies previously understood to be “independent”;

Broadened the range of issues agencies ought to consider in examining existing regulatory provisions for possible repeal; and

Directed agencies to, where possible, utilize “enforcement discretion” as a means of providing regulatory relief while developing more substantial rulemakings.

Later in the fall, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs issued a memo on “Streamlining the Review of Deregulatory Actions” that, among other things, instructed agencies to find existing provisions that contravene a series of Supreme Court decisions and repeal them directly under the “good cause” exception. There has yet to be much action under the auspices of this memo, but one can expect rulemaking under that memo to be another development that picks up the pace in the coming year. In sum, all of these policy directives taken together point to an administration that seeks to grease the skids on its regulatory policy agenda.

CONCLUSION

The second iteration of the Trump Administration certainly left a mark in 2025 on the regulatory front – however it got there. With nearly $130 billion in final net cost reductions plus another roughly $4 billion in CRA savings, this past year was clearly the most deregulatory on record. It was not the deepest set of policy actions, however, with most of the credit going to just a couple rulemakings. All the same, there’s plenty in terms of both rules currently in the proposed stage and other policy actions outside of just rulemakings to suggest that this administration is only getting started in its efforts to upend the regulatory state in rather consequential ways.",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/alexander-grey-8lnbXtxFGZw-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 12:00:52.580118

Peters said. “It also holds the Trump Administration accountable by reasserting Congress’s power of the purse and taking steps to end their slash-and-burn approach, ensuring no one is above the law. I hope the Senate gets this bill over the finish line without delay so we can deliver real results for San Diego and communities across the country.”

Highlights of the package include:

Addresses high electricity costs by investing $375 million in our electric grid, which Rep. Peters helped secure, tackling a major point of rising electricity costs and strengthening reliability.

Supports $1.8 billion in clean, affordable, and secure energy programs to lower energy bills, including nuclear energy activities—a bipartisan effort led by Rep. Peters to strengthen America’s nuclear energy sector.

Curtails the reckless abuses of the Trump Administration by restricting efforts to dismantle entire agencies without Congressional authorization, blocking wasteful spending on useless vanity projects, and diminishing the Administration's ability to wipeout Congressionally approved spending.

Supports federal programs to support a wide range of criminal justice program areas, ensuring cities like San Diego have the tools to strengthen public safety, expand mental health crisis intervention programs, and invest in prevention efforts that keep our neighborhoods safe.

Repudiates the Trump Administration’s anti-science agenda by providing strong funding for scientific and technological research. Rep. Peters led a bipartisan effort to secure $58 million for NASA’s Space Grant College and Fellowship Program, supporting STEM education and research through a network of colleges and universities, including the University of California, San Diego.

Invests $2.8 billion in our nation’s water infrastructure, including drinking water, wastewater, and storm water management projects in San Diego, and across the country.

Also included in the package were six Community Project Funding requests led by Rep. Peters for FY 2026 funding, totaling more than $6.3 million.

“These investments will help prepare San Diego for the future, from safer water to stronger infrastructure to more opportunities for students to gain the skills that power our local economy,” Rep. Peters continued. “I’m proud to deliver targeted federal funding that improves the quality of life for my constituents and delivers real, tangible benefits for San Diegans.”

Community Project Funding requests made by Rep. Peters include:

San Diego City College CyberLab — $1,031,000

This funding would be used for modern computers, high-end laptops, and cyber range access to support students in the Cyber Defense and Analysis programs. It will address a critical gap in national security by preparing students to enter the cybersecurity workforce and counter evolving cyber threats.

Coastal Ocean Pathogen Pollution Forecast Model — $1,031,000

This funding would be used to develop, deploy, and maintain real-time monitoring stations of oceanographic conditions within the Tijuana estuary. It will help better manage beach contamination events, which in turn will minimize public health risks and economic damage.

Engineering and Computer Science Capacity Building Project — $1,031,000

This funding would be used to for laboratory and teaching equipment to expand California State University San Marcos’s systems, electrical, and computer engineering programs. This would address critical workforce needs, drive regional economic growth, and foster long-term societal benefits.

City of Coronado Stormwater Mitigation Project — $1,092,000

This funding would be used for the protection of surface and groundwater quality and assist with the minimization of pollutants entering waterways, preventing flooding during heavy rain events and enhance water quality.

Pump Station Component D Upgrade — $1,092,000

This funding would be used to increase the community’s drainage system's capacity by providing electrical, structural, and mechanical improvements to the pump station. This is essential to mitigate flood risks, lower costs, and ensure the pump’s power reliability.

Famosa Slough Alley Slope Restoration — $1,092,000

This funding would be used for the construction phase of a storm drain infrastructure project to address severe erosion in an alleyway that floods during rain events, preventing further damage to nearby streets and residential neighborhoods.

Community Project Funding enables Members of Congress to advocate directly for local priorities, ensuring transparency and accountability. To see more about Rep. Peters’ FY26 requests, click here.

For nearly 40 years, this 1.7-million-acre watershed has been protected by large conservation easements, boasted untouched environmental resources, and maintained the rural character cherished by residents.

This legacy of conservation is under threat due to a new Colleton County ordinance that makes it easier for data centers to be built in rural areas.

There is no universe where this should be allowed anywhere near the ACE Basin.

Jennifer Singleton, Colleton County resident

That’s why SELC just filed a lawsuit to stop this zoning change, and the first data center project to take advantage of it—a proposed 859-acre, 1,000-megawatt complex that would be one of the largest in the country.

New data center development would degrade rural nature of the area

On behalf of two Colleton County residents, SELC filed a complaint this week over the recently passed zoning ordinance that creates a special exception for data centers and makes it easier for them to locate in rural areas of the county. The lawsuit argues that the county’s new ordinance violates state law, the county’s comprehensive plan, and the county’s zoning code.

“This zoning ordinance opens up a treasured and rural part of our state to industrial development and all the pollution and degradation that comes with it. Data centers don’t belong in the rural ACE Basin,” said Emily Wyche, SELC Senior Attorney. “Colleton County should be continuing the legacy of conservation in this area, not selling it to the highest bidder.”

Shortly after the zoning ordinance passed, the public learned that Eagle Rock Partners had filed an application to construct a massive data center campus in a rural part of Colleton County.

Data centers not only use large quantities of energy, but they can also:

adversely impact water quality,

contribute to noise and light pollution,

and degrade the character of rural communities.

Residents, including those named in the lawsuit, say that the ACE Basin is the last place a data center should be built. These impacts would threaten the ACE Basin’s many threatened and endangered wildlife species, cultural and archaeological resources, and untouched swaths of land.

“I did my due diligence and specifically chose to move to an area that was zoned for rural agricultural use,” says resident Jennifer Singleton. “Now with Colleton County passing this ordinance, opening the door for this 9-building data center campus, this entire pristine and vulnerable area is under attack undermining decades of conservation.”

Colleton County residents strongly oppose massive data center proposal

In December, the Colleton County Zoning Board of Appeals held a public meeting to discuss Eagle Rock Partners’ data center application.

Over 450 residents and many environmental nonprofits attended to raise concerns and oppose the proposal.

Speakers touched on:

environmental impacts,

low quality jobs,

preservation of the area’s rural nature, and

who will pay for the extra power needed to run the complex.

“As a lifelong Colleton County resident, I’m seriously concerned about the harm the data center construction would have on our rural community, local wildlife, and the environment,” says resident Miles Crosby. “We cannot allow this ordinance to threaten our star-filled night skies, natural quiet, and enjoyment of landscapes with light, water, and noise pollution.”

An online petition to stop the data center has over 7,000 signatures.

This is not the first time Eagle Rock Partners faced opposition to their data center proposals. In Twiggs County, Georgia, a group of local landowners sued the county for a rushed rezoning process and approval of another proposed Eagle Rock data center despite extreme local opposition to the project. In Jones County, Georgia, Eagle Rock recently cancelled a proposed data center in response to significant local push back.

In Colleton County, Ken Loeber, representative for Eagle Rock Partners, was the only speaker who voiced support for the proposal.

Considering the public outcry over the application, the Colleton County Zoning Board of Appeals said that Eagle Rock Partners will need to reapply for the special exception to zoning requirements. So far, the reapplication has not come through.

Data center demand is driving methane gas generation proposals

As a report SELC released last year found, there is a national overestimation of data center demand, causing utilities to scramble to build new power generation. Much of that proposed generation includes polluting methane gas power plants like the Canadys gas plant in Colleton County proposed by utilities Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy.

This gas plant, which would require a massive new pipeline, has a $5 billion price tag and would generate 2,200 megawatts of energy. If the new data center in Colleton County gets built, it would need almost half of that generation. By comparison, other large data centers in the state operated by tech giants, such as Google and Meta, use about 200 megawatts each and are sourcing and building clean energy for some of their power.

As a Walterboro resident and a Climate Campaign Associate with SELC, Robby Maynor has voiced many concerns about the proposed data center and gas plant.

“South Carolina is at a crossroads. Do we want to open up to big data centers, polluting gas plants, pipelines that go through private property, and the industrial development that will result from that? Or do we want to preserve the rural and natural character and high quality of life here for generations to come?” said Maynor.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image-26.jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 12:13:51.513140

The writedown, disclosed in an SEC regulatory filing, is a reflection of the automaker's reduced EV production expectations and the subsequent downstream impact on GM’s supplier network.

Cancelling contracts and settlements with suppliers that had tooled up for much higher EV volumes will cost GM $4.2 billion in cash. The automaker said the expense will be recorded as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings and warned that there are likely to be additional, albeit smaller charges throughout 2026 as negotiations with suppliers continue.

GM also said the writedown will not change its current U.S. EV lineup, which still has a rough dozen battery-electric models across Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, and Buick.

GM had been among the most aggressive legacy automakers in its EV ambitions, at one point even planning to phase out internal-combustion vehicles by 2035, which was on par with the most aggressive plans from Volkswagen—and look how well that's working out.

While GM's target has not been formally abandoned, actions speak louder than words—the company has already slowed or paused battery production at joint-venture plants, cut EV output at its Detroit Factory Zero facility, and redirected a planned Michigan EV plant to build full-size pickups and Cadillac Escalades instead.

If it sucks to be a GM shareholder, things look even worse across town at Ford. The Blue Oval recently disclosed nearly $20 billion in EV-related writedowns after canceling or delaying multiple programs, including killing the F-150 Lightning.

Both decisions come against the backdrop of policy changes under the Trump administration, including the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September, which triggered a sinkhole that swallowed EV demand after a brief pre-deadline buying surge—a dead cat bounce if there ever was one.

Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet.
“We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium.
He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.
At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects.
Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.","Amid warnings of impending energy shortages, Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday signed a wide-ranging energy reform package into law aimed at bolstering the state’s power grids after years of negotiations.

Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — will fund battery storage, grant greater authority to state utility regulators, create new options for “virtual power plants” and lift a longtime ban on new large-scale nuclear power plants.

“We’re making it easier to develop renewable energy,” bill sponsor Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet. “We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium. That’s all going to bring more supply onto the grid, and that will help hold the line on our electrical bills.”

The Illinois Power Agency, an independent body responsible for planning and procuring cost-effective energy for Illinoisians, found that the law will save utility customers in the state $13.4 billion over the next two decades. But opponents question those projections, pointing to increased subsidies for battery storage that will eventually be reflected via a new charge on consumers’ bills beginning in 2030.

The bill signing took place less than a month after state regulators projected energy shortfalls would likely drive up costs in the next three to five years and force Illinois to import more power from out of state absent action from lawmakers and grid operators.

Shortfalls, Pritzker said, would be exacerbated by actions at the national level, including the Trump administration’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phased out renewable energy tax credits and froze federal funding for energy projects. He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.

“All of that raises prices in the short term, while threatening our long-term ability to meet growing electricity demand,” Pritzker said.

CRGA, he said, will allow Illinois to forge its own path.

What's in the new law?

At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects. It will result in new charges to ratepayers, though supporters of the bill say that those costs would be offset by cost savings from greater energy efficiency, storage and planning.

The law grants new authority to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state body responsible for regulating utilities. The ICC will now have the power to set long-term plans for managing energy supply and demand in the state through approval of an integrated resource plan.

It additionally adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at electric and natural gas utilities and places new air regulations on backup generators used by data centers.

It also secures new labor protections by closing a loophole for community solar projects that has allowed some developers to avoid hiring union labor, a major priority for organized labor groups involved in negotiating the bill.

CRGA also lifts a longstanding ban on constructing new large-scale nuclear power plants, while at the same time increasing fees for nuclear plant operators. It outlines new programs for geothermal and thermal energy network projects, using naturally occurring heat from underground and transferring it via water-filled pipes to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel heating.

The law also creates new “virtual power plant,” or VPP, programs. That’s not virtual as in occurring via the internet or virtual reality, but rather as a program that allows homes and businesses with solar panels or wind turbines to pool energy together, acting “virtually” like a power plant despite not physically existing as one.

The idea is that the energy stored in residential and business batteries can be contributed to the electrical grid when the state’s primary electric delivery companies, like ComEd and Ameren Illinois, face high supply prices during peak hours of use, especially during the summer.

Homes and businesses who contribute energy to the grid via VPPs will be paid for their energy. The law also mandates that electric utilities offer optional “time-of-use” pricing, allowing customers to save money by using less energy during periods of high demand.

ComEd already offers time-of-use pricing, as approved in an ICC ruling in January 2025, but CRGA enshrines the requirement for both Ameren and ComEd into law.

Path to passage

The legislation passed during the legislature’s veto session in late October with support from environmental, labor and utility oversight advocates. Business groups and Republicans criticized the bill for its reliance on a new ratepayer charge to fund new battery storage and for yielding what they said was too much power to the ICC.

“Senate Bill 25 is a guaranteed rate increase that does nothing to increase energy production,” Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.

Rep. Norine Hammond, R-Macomb, also denounced energy sources like wind and solar as unreliable in a statement, saying that the state “should focus on preserving reliable energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power that actually work when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.”

Supporters, though, say that ratepayer charges will be offset with savings from increased energy supply and grid reliability. They argue the investment in battery systems allows the state to store extra energy generated on bright sunny days or windy days and deploy it at night and when other energy supply is low.

Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of Citizens Utility Board and champion of the bill, said CRJA was the state’s response to market signals sent by regional grid operators.

“To me, CRGA is really about us here in Illinois, together as a state, deploying the tools we have here at our disposal to defend the promise of clean and affordable power for Illinois,” Moskowitz said.

Organized labor advocates also supported the bill, which is expected to generate up to 100,000 jobs according to statements from multiple House Democrats. AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Pat Devaney and LiveWire Construction CEO Shon Harris joined Pritzker on stage at the signing ceremony.

“By expanding access to pre-apprentice programs, lowering thresholds for project labor agreements, ensuring that wind, solar and thermal energy projects are built by skilled Illinois workers, this bill clearly says the future of clean energy in Illinois will be union built,” Devaney said.

The bill prioritizes grants to historically underserved contractors and projects in communities that would most benefit from investments to combat discrimination. Harris said that legislation keeps the doors open for businesses like his.

“CRGA ensures equity remains a part of Illinois’ clean energy future,” Harris said. “That means that companies like mine can keep building projects, training workers and creating good-paying jobs all across Illinois.”

How Ford's even larger writedown compares GM's $6 billion EV charge, whilst substantial, appears modest compared to the $19.5 billion writedown announced by Ford in December.
Ford's larger hit stems partly from killing entire programme generations, whilst GM appears to be moderating volumes whilst maintaining its current model range.","General Motors has disclosed a $6 billion charge related to unwinding portions of its electric vehicle (EV) investments, marking one of the industry's starkest acknowledgements that ambitious battery-powered production forecasts have collided with market realities. The 'writedown', announced in a regulatory filing, forms part of a broader $7.1 billion fourth-quarter charge that includes a further $1.1 billion tied to restructuring the automaker's Chinese joint venture.

The numbers lay bare the manufacturing challenges confronting Detroit's largest automaker. Of the EV-related charge, $4.2 billion represents cash payments to suppliers who had tooled up and expanded capacity based on GM's earlier, more aggressive volume projections. A further $1.8 billion reflects non-cash impairments on assets that no longer align with revised production plans. This massive retraction demonstrates the tangible cost of industrial overcapacity built on demand assumptions that failed to materialise.

The scale of retreat from electric ambitions

The magnitude of GM's retrenchment becomes evident when examining the production adjustments already under way. Factory Zero, the automaker's dedicated EV assembly plant in Detroit, has shifted from two-shift to single-shift operation. The move placed approximately 1,200 workers on indefinite layoff whilst reducing output of the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. These are precisely the vehicles that were meant to demonstrate GM's manufacturing prowess in the battery-electric segment.

Battery production has faced even more dramatic curtailment. GM halted operations at its two Ultium Cells joint-venture facilities in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee for a six-month period beginning in January. The Ohio plant placed 850 workers on temporary layoff whilst Tennessee affected 700 employees. These facilities, developed in partnership with LG Energy Solution, represented cornerstone investments in GM's vertical integration strategy for battery cell production. Their idling until mid-2026 signals a fundamental mismatch between installed capacity and actual market absorption.

New alliances and innovative factory upgrades for US auto industry

GM and Hyundai form a wide-ranging new partnership, and Toyota reinvents its Kentucky plant to pioneer global manufacturing standards

The carmaker's Orion Assembly plant in Michigan exemplifies the strategic pivot. Originally slated for electric pickup production following a $4 billion investment that included $480 million in state grants, the facility will instead begin manufacturing the internal combustion-powered Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups in early 2027. Battery module production will continue at the site, but the shift toward traditional powertrains reflects where management now sees sustained demand and acceptable margins.

Supplier settlements expose the real cost of strategy pivots

The $4.2 billion earmarked for supplier commercial settlements and contract cancellations represents the most immediate manufacturing impact. These payments also acknowledge a fundamental truth about automotive supply chains. Suppliers invested heavily in equipment, tooling and expanded capacity predicated on volume commitments that are no longer viable. The settlements are not penalties but rather the cost of maintaining relationships whilst extracting the industry from contracts written when the regulatory and market environment looked markedly different.

This supplier dimension deserves particular attention from a manufacturing standpoint. Component manufacturers typically operate on thin margins and make capital investments years in advance of production. When an original equipment manufacturer scales back dramatically, the ripple effects extend through multiple tiers of the supply base. Unused capacity, idle tooling and stranded investments create financial stress that can destabilise smaller suppliers. GM's decision to absorb these costs through negotiated settlements rather than protracted disputes suggests recognition that maintaining supplier viability matters for future production flexibility.

The carnmaker has indicated additional charges will emerge in 2026 as negotiations continue, though management expects these to be substantially lower than 2025's impairments. This phased approach to unwinding commitments reflects the complexity of automotive supply arrangements and the time required to renegotiate contracts across a global supplier network.

Tariffs, trade shifts, and EV turbulence: How Trump’s second term is reshaping North American auto manufacturing

North American vehicle manufacturing is undergoing major changes. These are in response to political actions, wider market factors and some interesting decisions by major vehicle companies

Production footprint undergoes dramatic transformation

Beyond the immediate financial impact, GM's manufacturing footprint is undergoing restructuring that will define its capabilities for the remainder of the decade. The elimination of a planned Michigan facility initially designated for EV production, which will now build the Escalade and full-size pickups, demonstrates how quickly strategic priorities have shifted. Factory Zero in Detroit-Hamtramck remains the sole dedicated assembly location for the Silverado EV, Sierra EV, Escalade IQ and Hummer EV, consolidating electric truck and SUV production rather than dispersing it across multiple sites as originally envisioned.

The reduction to single-shift operation at Factory Zero carries implications beyond workforce numbers. It affects throughput rates, quality metrics and the ability to achieve economies of scale. Single-shift manufacturing can actually improve certain quality parameters by allowing more thorough maintenance during off-hours, but it fundamentally alters the cost structure and makes it harder to amortise tooling and facility investments across sufficient unit volumes.

GM maintains it will continue offering roughly a dozen EV models in the United States, which remains the industry's broadest battery-electric portfolio amongst traditional automakers. The OEM stated it plans to ""continue to make these models available to consumers"" despite the production adjustments. This creates an interesting manufacturing dynamic where the automaker maintains model diversity whilst constraining volume, essentially operating a portfolio strategy rather than the volume-production approach that characterised earlier plans.

How Ford's even larger writedown compares

GM's $6 billion EV charge, whilst substantial, appears modest compared to the $19.5 billion writedown announced by Ford in December. Ford's charge reflected the wholesale cancellation of multiple EV programmes, including the fully electric F-150 Lightning and additional truck and van projects planned as second-generation offerings. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Reuters in a December interview that ""when the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call."" The comparative scale of these writedowns reveals different strategic positions and degrees of exposure.

Ford's larger hit stems partly from killing entire programme generations, whilst GM appears to be moderating volumes whilst maintaining its current model range. This suggests GM may have built in more production flexibility or chosen to preserve optionality at the expense of achieving maximum scale efficiencies. The approaches reflect different manufacturing philosophies on how to navigate market uncertainty.

Both automakers now confront the reality that sales of battery-powered vehicles dropped 43% in the fourth quarter following elimination of the $7,500 federal tax credit on 30 September. Industry-wide EV sales increased just 1.2% in 2025 according to research firm Omdia, a dramatic deceleration from previous years' growth rates. Automotive data provider Edmunds expects EVs to account for approximately 6% of overall US vehicle sales in 2026, down from 7.4% in 2025. These figures frame the manufacturing environment both companies must navigate.

Market dynamics force fundamental reassessment

The manufacturing implications extend beyond immediate production adjustments. GM had at one point planned to invest $30 billion in EVs, targeting dozens of new models and substantial battery production capacity. The company previously stated ambitions to essentially phase out internal combustion passenger cars and trucks by 2035. Whilst that target officially remains in place, recent operational decisions point toward a more measured transition timeline.

The policy environment has shifted dramatically. Elimination of consumer tax credits, relaxed emissions regulations and reduced urgency around fuel economy standards have removed much of the regulatory impetus that originally drove aggressive electrification timelines. Manufacturing strategies built on one regulatory scenario now operate under fundamentally different conditions.

Analysts have noted GM's limited exposure to hybrid vehicles represents a potential vulnerability. Competitors including Toyota have maintained robust hybrid portfolios that provide fuel efficiency without requiring customers to commit fully to battery-electric powertrains. CFRA Research equity analyst Garrett Nelson observed that ""GM's lack of hybrid exposure could partially reverse recent market share gains.""

This creates a manufacturing challenge. Developing hybrid variants requires engineering resources and production capacity allocations that GM has thus far directed primarily toward pure electric and traditional internal combustion options.

The company's October disclosure of a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge foreshadowed the larger fourth-quarter writedown, suggesting management recognised the scale of adjustments required but needed time to complete supplier negotiations and finalise restructuring plans. The sequential disclosure approach has allowed the market to absorb the impacts incrementally rather than as a single shock.

GM's shares gained more than 50% during 2025, leading all major publicly traded automakers, though they declined approximately 2% in after-hours trading following the writedown announcement. The stock's strong annual performance reflected optimism about the OEM's operational turnaround and EV potential. The charge now introduces uncertainty about whether the core business can generate sufficient cash to offset these writedowns whilst funding future growth without additional debt or dilution.

From a financial perspective, the company will record these charges as special items in its fourth-quarter earnings, meaning they will not affect adjusted results that investors often use to evaluate ongoing operational performance. This accounting treatment acknowledges the one-time nature of the supplier settlements whilst still recognising the real cash impact on the balance sheet.

The 'writedown', announced in a regulatory filing, forms part of a broader $7.1 billion fourth-quarter charge that includes a further $1.1 billion tied to restructuring the automaker's Chinese joint venture.

The numbers lay bare the manufacturing challenges confronting Detroit's largest automaker. Of the EV-related charge, $4.2 billion represents cash payments to suppliers who had tooled up and expanded capacity based on GM's earlier, more aggressive volume projections. A further $1.8 billion reflects non-cash impairments on assets that no longer align with revised production plans. This massive retraction demonstrates the tangible cost of industrial overcapacity built on demand assumptions that failed to materialise.

The scale of retreat from electric ambitions

The magnitude of GM's retrenchment becomes evident when examining the production adjustments already under way. Factory Zero, the automaker's dedicated EV assembly plant in Detroit, has shifted from two-shift to single-shift operation. The move placed approximately 1,200 workers on indefinite layoff whilst reducing output of the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. These are precisely the vehicles that were meant to demonstrate GM's manufacturing prowess in the battery-electric segment.

Battery production has faced even more dramatic curtailment. GM halted operations at its two Ultium Cells joint-venture facilities in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee for a six-month period beginning in January. The Ohio plant placed 850 workers on temporary layoff whilst Tennessee affected 700 employees. These facilities, developed in partnership with LG Energy Solution, represented cornerstone investments in GM's vertical integration strategy for battery cell production. Their idling until mid-2026 signals a fundamental mismatch between installed capacity and actual market absorption.

New alliances and innovative factory upgrades for US auto industry

GM and Hyundai form a wide-ranging new partnership, and Toyota reinvents its Kentucky plant to pioneer global manufacturing standards

The carmaker's Orion Assembly plant in Michigan exemplifies the strategic pivot. Originally slated for electric pickup production following a $4 billion investment that included $480 million in state grants, the facility will instead begin manufacturing the internal combustion-powered Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups in early 2027. Battery module production will continue at the site, but the shift toward traditional powertrains reflects where management now sees sustained demand and acceptable margins.

Supplier settlements expose the real cost of strategy pivots

The $4.2 billion earmarked for supplier commercial settlements and contract cancellations represents the most immediate manufacturing impact. These payments also acknowledge a fundamental truth about automotive supply chains. Suppliers invested heavily in equipment, tooling and expanded capacity predicated on volume commitments that are no longer viable. The settlements are not penalties but rather the cost of maintaining relationships whilst extracting the industry from contracts written when the regulatory and market environment looked markedly different.

This supplier dimension deserves particular attention from a manufacturing standpoint. Component manufacturers typically operate on thin margins and make capital investments years in advance of production. When an original equipment manufacturer scales back dramatically, the ripple effects extend through multiple tiers of the supply base. Unused capacity, idle tooling and stranded investments create financial stress that can destabilise smaller suppliers. GM's decision to absorb these costs through negotiated settlements rather than protracted disputes suggests recognition that maintaining supplier viability matters for future production flexibility.

The carnmaker has indicated additional charges will emerge in 2026 as negotiations continue, though management expects these to be substantially lower than 2025's impairments. This phased approach to unwinding commitments reflects the complexity of automotive supply arrangements and the time required to renegotiate contracts across a global supplier network.

North American vehicle manufacturing is undergoing major changes. These are in response to political actions, wider market factors and some interesting decisions by major vehicle companies

Production footprint undergoes dramatic transformation

Beyond the immediate financial impact, GM's manufacturing footprint is undergoing restructuring that will define its capabilities for the remainder of the decade. The elimination of a planned Michigan facility initially designated for EV production, which will now build the Escalade and full-size pickups, demonstrates how quickly strategic priorities have shifted. Factory Zero in Detroit-Hamtramck remains the sole dedicated assembly location for the Silverado EV, Sierra EV, Escalade IQ and Hummer EV, consolidating electric truck and SUV production rather than dispersing it across multiple sites as originally envisioned.

The reduction to single-shift operation at Factory Zero carries implications beyond workforce numbers. It affects throughput rates, quality metrics and the ability to achieve economies of scale. Single-shift manufacturing can actually improve certain quality parameters by allowing more thorough maintenance during off-hours, but it fundamentally alters the cost structure and makes it harder to amortise tooling and facility investments across sufficient unit volumes.

GM maintains it will continue offering roughly a dozen EV models in the United States, which remains the industry's broadest battery-electric portfolio amongst traditional automakers. The OEM stated it plans to ""continue to make these models available to consumers"" despite the production adjustments. This creates an interesting manufacturing dynamic where the automaker maintains model diversity whilst constraining volume, essentially operating a portfolio strategy rather than the volume-production approach that characterised earlier plans.

How Ford's even larger writedown compares

GM's $6 billion EV charge, whilst substantial, appears modest compared to the $19.5 billion writedown announced by Ford in December. Ford's charge reflected the wholesale cancellation of multiple EV programmes, including the fully electric F-150 Lightning and additional truck and van projects planned as second-generation offerings. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Reuters in a December interview that ""when the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call."" The comparative scale of these writedowns reveals different strategic positions and degrees of exposure.

Field Editor

Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is an emerging building material that could open new opportunities for Texas’ forestry economy.

CLT is a type of mass timber that is created by bonding multiple layers of kiln-dried lumber like 2x4s and 2x6s. The lumber is glued or nailed together to make a modern version of heavy timber that gives the panels strength and stability.

The panels are manufactured off-site in controlled factory settings and are then transported to construction locations where they can be assembled quickly, reducing build times for projects.

CLT panels can be used for flooring, walls and roofs.

“Mass timber systems like CLT are particularly compelling because they lend themselves to offsite manufacturing, which is ideal for both rural housing and dense urban projects,” James Michael Tate, an associate professor at Texas A&M University, said.

Tate also noted that CLT’s high strength-to-weight ratio allows for lighter foundations and faster construction, while its natural wood appearance becomes a visible design feature.

CLT offers an alternative to traditional steel and concrete construction and is gaining significant traction driven by a surplus of timber in East Texas.

“Across East Texas, we’re growing nearly double the amount of timber we’re harvesting,” Dr. Aaron Stottlemyer, department head of Forest Analytics at Texas A&M Forest Service, said. “That surplus creates a need for new markets. Mass timber, including CLT, is one of the most promising avenues for utilizing that excess in a sustainable way.”

Stottlemyer’s team monitors forest growth and harvest rates across Texas and provides data for land management and economic development. He sees CLT as a key component in building a circular economy that supports private landowners, the forest industry, conserves working forests and reduces carbon-intensive construction.

With Texas’ already robust forest industry, mass timber would be an opportunity to bring new markets to Texas.

“Texas is 95% privately owned, and when markets slump, you often start to see forests converted to non-forest uses like shopping malls, subdivisions, things made with concrete,” Stottlemyer said. “Strong timber markets encourage landowners to keep their land forested and invest in stewardship. That’s good for the environment and the economy.”

By the end of this decade, the job of batteries and power electronics at large facilities will shift from break-glass insurance to weekly or almost daily operations. This is part 1 of a two-part series.

Many experts are skeptical that the mission for critical power equipment could shift so soon, but this prediction is based on basic supply and demand: demand is rising, firm electricity supply is retiring, and aging equipment will be required to cycle in ways it was never designed for. The result will be more curtailments, more calls to run on-site power and price swings that make energy shifting with the assets you already own too valuable to ignore.

A short look ahead

Picture late summer in 2030: Rolling outages are now routine in several metros. Even where the lights stay on, generators and UPS systems at data centers and industrial campuses run dozens of times a year to ride through thin reserves and local constraints. Faced with massive demand growth, grid operators require large loads to make their backup generators available for dispatch during grid emergencies. This is already law in Texas.

Meanwhile, time-of-use rates swing from negative to punishing peaks. Finance leaders expect facilities to discharge storage batteries during expensive hours and recharge when prices dip, then ask again the next week. What used to be “standby” is now in the critical path.

That future comes from forces already in motion.

Why is this happening?

Load growth is no longer flat

For nearly a decade, U.S. electricity demand barely moved. That is no longer the case. Hyperscale AI campuses, a rebound in domestic manufacturing, electrification of heat and transport, and population growth are lifting both average load and peaks. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) estimates that U.S. power demand will increase more than 50% over the next 25 years.

According to Grid Strategies, the projection for peak demand growth in early 2024 was 67 GW. Later in the same year, however, their estimate nearly doubled to 128 GW—5% annually. By any measure, these load growth estimates are massive.

Grid planners have revised peak forecasts upward more than once in the past two years. New load arrives in clusters, so the impact concentrates in Northern Virginia, Texas, the Northeast corridor, and parts of California. Local transmission and distribution were not built for this ramp.

Dispatchable capacity has been retiring faster than it is being built

From the mid-2010s through the early 2020s, the U.S. retired nearly twice as much dispatchable capacity as it commissioned, as Thomas Popik of the Foundation for Resilient Societies shared in his address to the Electrical Generating Systems Association 2025 spring conference. Roughly 177 GW of coal, oil, older gas, and some nuclear units left the fleet; yet only 97 GW of firm capacity came online in return. Coal still supplied about 17 percent of U.S. electricity as recently as 2025, yet many units are old and expensive to maintain.

New firm capacity is not filling the gap quickly and the one gigawatt of nuclear capacity built recently was a decade under construction. New combined-cycle gas can be faster, but many projects face permitting, pipeline constraints, and long equipment lead times. Gas turbine manufacturers are swamped with orders, with delivery backlogs that stretch past 2029 already leading to project cancellations, like Engie pulling out of two gas plant projects in Texas earlier this year. Another source, Heatmap, says rather than pushing for massive expansion, gas turbine manufacturers are cautiously increasing capacity to protect high margins and guard against overcapacity should the present boom turn bust as it did post Enron.

Aging assets are being cycled hard

Large thermal plants were designed for steady baseload, yet many are now asked to cycle daily to deliver power when renewables don’t. Thermal stress stacks up, forced outages increase, and owners defer expensive life-extension on units with uncertain futures.

Distribution transformers, many already far beyond design life, fail more often as stresses rise. Replacement wait times have stretched. Two years for some distribution units is now common, and 400-ton generator step-up transformers can take three years or more. When restoration hinges on parts that take years, operators plan for more interim curtailments.

Why the usual “fixes” will not land fast enough

Transmission. Moving remote wind and solar to coastal load centers sounds simple until rights-of-way, litigation, and local opposition add years. Even with approvals in hand, extra-high-voltage transformers required for new transmission lines are built in small numbers and have very long lead times.

Utility-scale batteries. Grid batteries are effective for peak shaving and fast reserves, but today’s utility projects are commonly designed for four hours of discharge. This is too little runtime to ride through multi-day wind and solar droughts that still require firm generation. A simple thought experiment from Minnesota shows why: average daily consumption is 179 GWh. With 50% renewables penetration, covering this load for three days takes 269 GWh of storage, or three times the entire US installed BESS capacity in 2024. Extrapolated nationally, the energy required is a staggering 16,000 GWh – well beyond current manufacturing and financing capacity.

Nuclear. Nuclear reactors provide steady, carbon-free power. Long term, the nuclear fleet will grow. But nuclear will not scale in time to solve mid-decade shortfalls. The last U.S. large reactors took roughly 15 years from start to service and far exceeded early cost estimates. New technologies like small modular reactors are promising, but most designs still face first-of-a-kind licensing and fuel supply questions.

Gas. Most new firm capacity in interconnection queues is gas-fired. Many projects will still take several years from permit to operation, and pipeline capacity is tight in the very corridors that need the plants. Meanwhile OEMs report years-long backlogs, yet are cautious about adding factory capacity until demand is proven.

What it means inside the fence line

Industrial facilities cannot control build rates for new generation or transmission. They can, however, control how their sites ride through tight supply.

More interruptions and more requests to self-supply. Grid operators are already asking large users to curtail or run on-site power to protect stability. Data centers in particular are signing interruptible service agreements that put them first in line for curtailment when reserves thin.

Price volatility becomes an engineering problem. When off-peak prices go negative and peaks spike, the economics of shifting energy with storage become too large to ignore. Idle standby capacity gets pulled into daily or weekly duty cycles.

“Standby” batteries and power electronics become operational assets. Designs built for float service and rare discharges will be replaced by systems that cycle frequently, synchronize with the grid, and can both charge and export on command.

The role of standby generators. When reserves thin, operators will ask large sites to self-supply. That pulls standby generators into routine duty alongside storage. Expect more starts per year and more coordination between ATS/paralleling gear, batteries, and price signals. Generators carry the long events; batteries cover fast response and price shaping.

What this shift implies for design

Once standby becomes weekly duty, the design changes. You must specify storage for thousands of cycles and a long calendar life. And size it for two missions: holding a state-of-charge floor to ensure critical applications run during blackout, and adding enough energy above it for time-shifting. Replace one-way chargers with bidirectional, grid-synchronized converters sized to recharge quickly.

At higher power, DC bus must increase to 800 volts or more to keep conductor size manageable. Lower voltages are, in turn, supplied by DC-DC converters. Fault protection equipment and procedures are required by the new high voltage DC bus voltages. A subsequent article summarizes requirements for new power conversion and energy storage systems.

From standby to weekly duty

By the end of this decade, electricity shortages and blackouts will become more frequent, longer, and more widespread than at any time since the inception of the U.S. electric grid. During scarcity, the price of electricity will reach staggering heights. At other times, businesses will be paid to consume. As grid disruptions and volatile prices affect bottom lines, many C&I enterprises will add or repurpose stationary batteries.

While this will be a challenging time for America, suppliers of critical power equipment will see increased opportunities. Conventional designs will be replaced by more capable products. New suppliers will arise from within and from outside the industry. Legacy suppliers will need to adapt if they don’t want to be left sitting on the sidelines.

For us, the old ways of thinking are facing unprecedented challenges. As an industry, we will need to adapt or make way for those who do.

If standby power is going to work every week or more, equipment and operations must evolve. Upcoming Part 2 outlines the new requirements for critical power equipment across storage life and sizing, bidirectional conversion and controls, site infrastructure, and how to run the asset safely and profitably.

They emphasized permitting timelines, land access, and long-term power availability as key determinants of competitiveness.

Speaking during a CES panel on Thursday, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) said the state is reducing its dependence on gaming revenue, which he said once dominated state finances and left Nevada constrained as casino development proliferated nationwide.

Lombardo said Nevada now marketed itself around regulatory simplicity, a stable tax environment, and workforce alignment aimed at logistics, manufacturing, and technology investment.

Lombardo said permitting speed and predictability had become decisive factors for businesses siting major projects. About 80 percent of Nevada’s land is federally controlled, he noted, making federal permitting timelines central to energy and infrastructure development.

Solar generation supplies roughly 50 percent of Nevada’s electricity, much of it on federal land, and Lombardo said the state was negotiating with the Trump administration over solar policy amid federal pullbacks, to match the state’s data center capacity as power demand grows.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) presented a different case, centering his argument on scale, natural resources, and organized labor. He said about 60 percent of Alaska is federally controlled, and cited the state’s 65 percent share of the nation’s wetlands, more than 50 percent of the country’s freshwater, and large contiguous land areas as structural advantages unavailable elsewhere.

Alaska also has more than 150 volcanoes, which Dunleavy said offered long-term potential for the geothermal industry .

Dunleavy said Alaska’s economic trajectory had been constrained by federal permitting and regulatory actions, even though the state was once a major oil and gas producer. He pointed to a proposed 800-mile natural gas pipeline, designed to move gas to tidewater for export, with a projected capacity of 20 million tons per year and throughput of about 4.2 billion cubic feet per day.

Dunleavy said the project could support long-duration electricity for data centers, industrial facilities, and energy-intensive uses such as cryptocurrency mining.

On labor, Dunleavy said Alaska remained highly unionized - third highest by state - and argued that organized labor played a role in maintaining wage standards as automation and artificial intelligence expanded. He said the state faced demographic decline and shortages of skilled trades, including pipefitters and truck drivers, making workforce development as critical as capital investment.

Both governors said businesses were prioritizing energy cost, reliability, and regulatory certainty over incentives, with Lombardo emphasizing speed and predictability and Dunleavy emphasizing scale, power availability, and labor capacity.",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-7.12.32---PM-1.png,N,,2026-01-09 16:00:34.716806

General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards, according to a report from Yahoo Finance. Shares slid about 2% before the opening bell Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power. The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic. GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025. Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations. China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles. Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the worlds largest EV automaker, replaced by Chinas BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Introduction

As the global energy transition accelerates into the second half of the decade, few companies have managed to maintain as strategic a ""fortress"" position as First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR). Once a niche player in a market dominated by silicon-based semiconductors, the Tempe, Arizona-headquartered firm has emerged as the definitive champion of American solar manufacturing. In early 2026, First Solar finds itself at the intersection of two of the decade's most powerful secular trends: the re-industrialization of the United States and the voracious electricity appetite of Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centers.

While the broader solar industry has faced headwinds from high interest rates and global oversupply, First Solar has insulated itself through a unique thin-film technology stack and a multi-year backlog that stretches toward the end of the decade. At PredictStreet, our AI-driven analysis indicates that the company’s recent manufacturing expansions in the American South have fundamentally altered its margin profile, making it less of a commodity manufacturer and more of a high-value infrastructure provider.

Historical Background

The First Solar story is one of American ingenuity and patient capital. It began in 1990 as Solar Cells, Inc. (SCI), founded by Harold McMaster, a legendary inventor known as the ""Glass Genius"" of Toledo, Ohio. McMaster’s breakthrough was the use of Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) for thin-film solar cells, an alternative to the traditional crystalline silicon (c-Si) path. His vision was to manufacture solar panels as efficiently and continuously as glass sheets on a float line.

However, the transition from lab to commercial scale was fraught with financial peril. In 1999, the company was recapitalized and rebranded as First Solar, LLC, following an acquisition by True North Partners—a venture capital firm funded by John Walton, son of Walmart founder Sam Walton. The Walton family’s involvement provided the long-term capital necessary to survive the ""Valley of Death"" in hardware innovation.

Since its 2006 IPO, the company has undergone several major transformations. The most significant occurred in 2016 under current CEO Mark Widmar, when the company made the bold decision to bypass its ""Series 5"" module and move directly to the ""Series 6"" large-format module. This pivot, combined with the exit from its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) business to focus purely on manufacturing, set the stage for the explosive growth seen in the 2020s.

Business Model

First Solar operates a vertically integrated manufacturing model that is unique among the world’s top solar companies. While rivals like JinkoSolar or Canadian Solar rely on a complex global supply chain for polysilicon, wafers, and cells, First Solar’s CdTe process converts raw materials into a finished module in a single, continuous automated line in under four hours.

Revenue Sources

The company generates revenue almost exclusively from the sale of solar modules to utility-scale project developers and independent power producers.

Utility-Scale Modules: This is the core business, focusing on large-scale solar farms that feed the grid.

Service and Warranties: While a smaller percentage of revenue, the company provides long-term performance guarantees for its modules.

Segments and Customer Base

First Solar’s customer base is increasingly dominated by large tech conglomerates (Google, Microsoft, Meta) looking to power their data centers with 100% renewable energy, as well as traditional utilities. Geographically, the U.S. remains its primary market, though it maintains a significant manufacturing and sales presence in India and Southeast Asia.

Stock Performance Overview

Over the last decade, FSLR has evolved from a volatile, sentiment-driven stock to a cornerstone industrial asset.

1-Year Performance: In 2025, the stock consolidated gains after a massive run in 2024, trading in a range between $210 and $285. As of early 2026, the stock sits near $272, reflecting a resilient market position despite broader sector volatility.

5-Year Performance: Looking back to 2021, the stock has nearly tripled. The primary catalyst was the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provided the regulatory certainty needed to justify billions in capital expenditure.

10-Year Performance: From 2016 to 2026, FSLR has outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, transitioning from a $40-60 range-bound stock to a utility-scale powerhouse. Notable peaks occurred in mid-2024 as the ""AI energy trade"" took hold, with investors betting on solar as the fastest-to-deploy power source for new data centers.

Financial Performance

PredictStreet’s latest AI-generated estimates for the fiscal year 2025 suggest a company that is hitting its operational stride.

Revenue: Estimated to finish FY 2025 between $4.95 billion and $5.20 billion, up from $4.2 billion in 2024.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): 2025 estimates range from $14.00 to $15.00. While this was a slight downward revision from earlier ""blue sky"" projections due to glass supply constraints, it still represents a massive jump from 2023 levels.

Margins: Gross margins remain the envy of the industry, consistently hovering near 40% (inclusive of Section 45X tax credits).

Balance Sheet: First Solar maintains a ""fortress balance sheet"" with a net cash position of approximately $1.5 billion, providing a buffer against cyclical downturns and the capital needed for its next-gen tandem cell R&D.

Leadership and Management

The management team, led by CEO Mark Widmar and CFO Alex Bradley, is widely regarded by analysts as one of the most disciplined in the clean energy sector. Widmar’s strategy has been characterized by ""saying no"" to low-margin residential markets and ""saying yes"" to long-term, fixed-price contracts that provide visibility through the end of the decade.

The board’s governance has been particularly focused on navigating the complex geopolitical landscape. Their decision to stay away from Chinese silicon supply chains has been vindicated by the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and subsequent trade disputes that have hamstrung many of their competitors.

Products, Services, and Innovations

The ""Series 7"" module is the current flagship of the First Solar fleet. Produced primarily in the new Alabama and Louisiana facilities, the Series 7 is designed specifically for the U.S. utility-scale market, offering a larger form factor and higher efficiency than previous generations.

The Perovskite Frontier

In 2023, First Solar acquired Evolar AB, a European leader in perovskite technology. As of January 2026, the company is operating a pilot line at its R&D innovation center in Ohio, developing a Perovskite-on-CdTe tandem cell. This ""tandem"" approach aims to stack two different light-absorbing layers to break the efficiency ceiling of traditional modules, with commercial deployment targeted for 2027-2029.

Competitive Landscape

The solar market is a tale of two technologies: Crystalline Silicon (c-Si) vs. Thin-Film (CdTe).

The Rivals: Chinese giants like LONGi and JinkoSolar dominate the c-Si market, benefiting from massive economies of scale and low labor costs.

The FSLR Advantage: First Solar’s CdTe technology is immune to the ""polysilicon cycle."" Furthermore, because First Solar modules are manufactured in the U.S., they help project developers qualify for the 10% Domestic Content Bonus under the IRA—a premium that Chinese imports cannot easily replicate.

Industry and Market Trends

Three macro drivers are currently favoring First Solar:

AI Power Demand: The surge in AI data centers requires ""giga-scale"" power plants. Solar-plus-storage is currently the most scalable solution to meet these corporate 24/7 carbon-free energy goals.

Reshoring: There is a bipartisan consensus on reducing dependence on Chinese supply chains for critical energy infrastructure.

Decarbonization: Despite political cycles, corporate mandates for green energy are increasingly ""locked in"" by long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).

Risks and Challenges

No investment is without risk, and First Solar faces several significant hurdles:

Policy Volatility: While the IRA has long-term bipartisan support in many ""red"" states where manufacturing is located, any changes to tax credit monetization (Section 45X) would significantly impact the bottom line.

Contractual Headwinds: In late 2025, the company saw roughly 6.9 GW of contract cancellations from BP-affiliated projects, highlighting that even a strong backlog can be subject to project-level delays or financing issues.

Supply Chain: The company relies on specific materials like Tellurium, which is a byproduct of copper mining. Any disruption in tellurium supply or a massive spike in glass prices could pinch margins.

Opportunities and Catalysts

South Carolina Expansion: The upcoming 3.7 GW ""finishing line"" in South Carolina will allow First Solar to onshore the final assembly of modules from its international factories, potentially qualifying more of its fleet for U.S. tax incentives.

Tandem Cell Breakthroughs: Any positive data from the Perovskite-on-CdTe pilot line could serve as a major valuation re-rating catalyst.

M&A Potential: With a strong cash position, First Solar is well-positioned to acquire smaller technology firms in the power electronics or energy storage space to offer a more holistic ""solar plant in a box.""

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Institutional sentiment remains robust, with roughly 98% of shares held by institutions like Vanguard and BlackRock.

Bull View: Analysts at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley maintain ""Buy"" or ""Overweight"" ratings, citing the ""sold out"" position through 2026 as a unique safety net in a volatile market.

Bear View: Some analysts, such as those at Jefferies, have expressed caution regarding ""limited visibility"" into new bookings for 2027 and potential downward pressure on American module prices if global silicon prices continue to crash.

Retail Vibe: On social platforms, the sentiment is currently ""Neutral to Bullish,"" with investors viewing FSLR as a safe-haven asset within the clean energy sector.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Geopolitics is First Solar’s ""invisible moat."" The company is the primary beneficiary of:

Anti-Dumping/Countervailing Duties (AD/CVD): Tariffs on solar cells from Southeast Asia help maintain the price premium for U.S.-made panels.

UFLPA: Rigorous enforcement of forced labor laws effectively bars many low-cost Chinese competitors from the U.S. market.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules: These rules make it difficult for companies with significant Chinese state ownership to access U.S. tax credits, further narrowing the field in First Solar's favor.

Conclusion

First Solar enters 2026 as a uniquely positioned industrial powerhouse. By decoupling itself from the Chinese silicon supply chain and leaning into the ""Made in America"" narrative, it has transformed from a solar module manufacturer into a critical infrastructure provider for the 21st century.

For investors, the key will be watching the execution of the Louisiana and Alabama capacity ramps and the stability of the contract backlog. While policy risks and global pricing pressures remain, First Solar’s ""fortress"" model provides a margin of safety rarely seen in the renewable energy space. As AI continues to drive an unprecedented need for electrons, the ""Glass Genius"" legacy of Harold McMaster looks more relevant than ever.

Challenges such as student protests, blows to economic megaprojects, and the failure to win hoped-for favoritism with President Trump put the Serbian leader in an uneasy position. This new year will be characterized by what we might term a Waiting for Godot strategy characterized by political damage control.

Internally, problems are not merely looming; they are so serious that they may represent the first nails in the government’s political coffin. The protests may have been student-led, but they encompassed a remarkably

heterogenous segment of Serbian society all year long. Popular unrest was triggered by the Novi Sad station canopy collapse in November 2024 that killed 16 people. Showing no signs of exhaustion, protesters are still firmly committed to their goals of greater accountability and transparency, a freer judiciary and media, and the holding of snap elections.

The masks are now off. Tactics often employed by the government, such as smear campaigns against activists and academic staff, distractions through self-generated crises in the north of Kosovo, and blaming neighboring or unnamed Western countries for interference, have failed to break the protesters’ spirit and support.

The more violent the government and its hooligans became in efforts to crack down on peaceful demonstrators, the more determined the demonstrators became. Their immunity to these tactics is a worrying sign for Vučić. How he finds a grip on this large, grassroots movement will remain a central question in 2026, too.

Although the power of the protesters speaks for itself (one rally in March attracted more than 300,000 demonstrators), it does not mean that the government — Vučić, in particular — will go quietly. A political standoff has emerged: any concession would either mean the end of the protests or the possible collapse of the system. This deadlock is likely to persist throughout the year.

Vučić was also forced to bid farewell to major economic projects. In November, the British-Australian mining company Rio Tinto announced the indefinite suspension of its proposed lithium mine investment in Serbia. A few weeks later, the American investment firm Affinity Partners, founded by President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, withdrew its Belgrade-based luxury development project. The lithium mining project would have brought around $3bn in badly needed foreign investment and the hotel construction about $500m.

For Vučić, losing these “pet projects” not only damages Serbia’s economy but also cuts deeply into his political ego. Additionally, the political benefits — namely, garnering extra votes through announcements of large-scale investment projects — remain an unfulfilled dream for the coming year.

The most pressing economic challenge Serbia will continue to face this year concerns its sole oil refinery. NIS, majority-owned by Russia’s Gazprom Neft, has been under US sanctions since March, with full enforcement effective from October 2025. Although OFAC, the Department of the Treasury’s responsive body, granted NIS a special license to continue operations until January 22, this does not change the requirement that Russian ownership must be reduced to exactly zero percent. Negotiations must also be finalized by mid-March — most likely with Hungary’s MOL purchasing the Russian shareholding — but the transaction still requires US approval.

The firm US stance on NIS demonstrates that Washington’s primary concern is not the interests of Serbia’s government but the removal of Russian energy influence and the expansion of American energy interests — such as liquefied natural gas, or LNG, and small nuclear power plants — across Europe, including the Balkans. This goal leaves little room for Vučić, despite his strong pro-Trump alignment.

These strict demands and deadlines caught Vučić off guard. He had hoped that Trump’s return to the White House would pave the way for the golden age of bilateral relations, bringing political and economic benefits to Serbia. Like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Republika Srpska’s Milorad Dodik in Bosnia, Vučić had high expectations of Trump’s presidency. Instead, the US administration has so far remained pragmatic, prioritizing its broader strategic interests over personal affinities in the Balkans.

The US continues to support mutual recognition as the desired outcome of the Serbia-Kosovo normalization talks, despite Vučić’s hope for a more “pro-Serbian” stance. Moreover, the bipartisan Western Balkans Democracy and Prosperity Act, part of the National Defense Authorization Act, reiterates the importance of mutual recognition, and also names Serbia as a country where democracy is deteriorating and electoral conditions are unfair.

There is still a strong bipartisan support for maintaining existing borders, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, and for regional stability. This position has even been echoed by Trump himself, who counts Serbia and Kosovo among the eight wars he claims to have ended in 2025.

In the European context, Serbia’s EU accession prospects have never been bleaker. A more outspoken European Commission and vocal member states have begun to challenge the government, despite acknowledging Serbia’s geopolitical importance for the region. Apart from rule-of-law issues, Serbia’s reluctance to align with the EU’s common foreign and security policy has become particularly costly. Until 2022, Vučić could get away with his balancing strategy, but Russia’s war against Ukraine has made foreign policy alignment a key criterion also for candidate countries.

Meanwhile, Serbia’s neighbors are slowly but steadily advancing on their EU accession paths, with Montenegro and Albania being prime examples. Serbia under Vučić can further expect the same stagnation in its EU accession effort as last year.

Under Vučić’s rule, Serbia has developed a system of state capture marked by rule-of-law deficiencies and a sharp decline across all major democratic indices. The long-standing balancing act between East and West — maintaining the façade of EU aspirations while deepening ties with Russia and China — is increasingly difficult, especially under global shifts and US foreign policy interests.

The problems of last year have not faded; they have only intensified. Internal pressures — especially the student-led protests — may force Vučić to call snap elections by the end of 2026 as a last-ditch effort to cement his reign.

At the same time, disappointment with US foreign policy toward Serbia — marked by self-interest and pragmatism rather than favoritism — has further weakened his position. Amid internal challenges and miscalculations about global political shifts working in his favor, the Serbian strongman may continue doing what he has done for most of the past year: pursue a wait-and-see policy, in hopes of ensuring his own survival.

The portfolio consists of two flagship projects—Beekman Solar and Hollis Creek Solar—which secured a combined financing package of approximately $809 million in early January 2026.
Treaty Oak has tapped Blattner Energy as the primary EPC contractor for the PV portion.
Treaty Oak anticipates the creation of approximately 300 jobs during peak construction activity, with a focus on local hiring for site preparation and assembly.
“Breaking ground on Beekman and Hollis Creek is a pivotal moment for Treaty Oak and the state of Louisiana,” said a spokesperson for Treaty Oak Clean Energy.","Treaty Oak Clean Energy, a portfolio company of Macquarie Asset Management, has officially broken ground on a 385 MWac solar portfolio in Louisiana, marking a major milestone for the state’s renewable energy infrastructure. The portfolio consists of two flagship projects—Beekman Solar and Hollis Creek Solar—which secured a combined financing package of approximately $809 million in early January 2026. This development is strategically designed to support the massive energy requirements of Meta’s (formerly Facebook) burgeoning AI data center operations in Richland Parish. With construction now underway, the projects are set to become pillars of the Gulf Coast’s clean energy transition, with a targeted commercial operation date in the first half of 2027.

The portfolio is split into two distinct, high-capacity facilities located in northern and western Louisiana:

Beekman Solar (185 MWac): Located in Morehouse Parish, this project secured $410 million in senior secured credit facilities. Treaty Oak has tapped Blattner Energy as the primary EPC contractor for the PV portion. Dashiell will manage the high-voltage electrical infrastructure. The site will feature advanced First Solar thin-film modules.

Hollis Creek Solar (200 MWac): Situated in Sabine Parish, this project is backed by a $399 million financing package. Primoris Renewable Energy is leading the PV construction, with Beta Engineering handling the high-voltage facilities.

Both projects will utilize state-of-the-art single-axis trackers from Nextpower to optimize energy capture across Louisiana’s landscape.

Fueling the AI Revolution

A defining feature of this portfolio is its direct link to the technology sector. Both Beekman and Hollis Creek are backed by long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Meta. The clean energy generated will be funneled into the regional grid. This will offset the immense power consumption of Meta’s data center in Richland Parish.

As tech giants race to expand their Artificial Intelligence capabilities, projects like these—mirroring the renewable operational success as Consumers Energy flips the switch on the 250MW Muskegon Solar Center—are becoming essential “green engines” that allow for industrial growth without a corresponding spike in carbon emissions.

Economic Uplift and Regional Impact

The construction phase is expected to be a major economic catalyst for Morehouse and Sabine Parishes. Treaty Oak anticipates the creation of approximately 300 jobs during peak construction activity, with a focus on local hiring for site preparation and assembly. Over their operational lifetimes, the two projects are projected to contribute more than $100 million in state and local tax revenue. This fiscal injection will support critical community services, including public schools and local infrastructure.

“Breaking ground on Beekman and Hollis Creek is a pivotal moment for Treaty Oak and the state of Louisiana,” said a spokesperson for Treaty Oak Clean Energy. “By partnering with industry leaders like Meta and Macquarie, we are proving that utility-scale solar can meet the rigorous demands of the modern digital economy while providing tangible benefits to local communities.”

The biggest part of the package is a permanent extension of the temporary tax rates established under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).
Most IRA clean energy credits repealed, including EV and residential credits, with various effective dates.
Additionally, it repeals the Energy Efficiency Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit.
Typically, after large tax packages are signed into law, decisions by the various Departments and agencies greatly impact the implementation.","As the new year begins, regulatory drafting, implementation process approval, and legislative oversight and review are now at a fever pitch for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025. The sweeping package provides tax law changes to individuals and businesses, while cutting various programs and credits. Most of these new tax changes start in 2026, with some affecting 2025 taxes filed in 2026 and some becoming effective later. The biggest part of the package is a permanent extension of the temporary tax rates established under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).

Holland & Hart has been advising clients on the law for over six months, as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury), and the White House develop regulations and implementation policies. The Administration’s earliest efforts focused on political efforts such as Trump Accounts for children, “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime,” and the new emphasis on rural Opportunity Zones. More matters are still to be finalized, such as foreign-entity-of-concern restrictions on clean energy credits, the status of Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program tied to 45Q and 45Z credits, and (as recently announced) guidance to resolve conflicts arising after the OBBBA passage to allow for retroactive application of the new international tax transition rules. After IRS and Treasury efforts, the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) will weigh in. Congress, meanwhile, is engaged in oversight and hearing from constituents on the effects of the law. The relevant Committees will be preparing for a potential technical corrections bill, either bipartisan or through the same partisan reconciliation process the OBBBA passed under last year.

Key Takeaways:

TCJA individual tax rates made permanent.

Tips and overtime premium pay deductible through 2028 with income caps.

Qualified Small Business Stock capital gain exemptions revised.

Most IRA clean energy credits repealed, including EV and residential credits, with various effective dates.

Opportunity Zones permanent with stricter rules and 30% rural basis step-up.

Permanent bonus depreciation, R&D expensing, and EBITDA business interest expense limitation.

Individuals

The law generally makes the seven rates created by the TCJA permanent.

Itemized Deductions

The temporary increase in the basic standard deduction passed in 2017 is made permanent in the OBBBA. The standard deductions are for married filing jointly $31,500, heads of household $23,625, and single filers and married filing separately $15,750. The itemized deduction limit for state and local taxes was raised temporarily to $40,000 for married and individual filers ($20,000 for married filing separately) beginning in 2025 and phases out above certain income levels. In 2030, the cap reverts to $10,000.

No Tax on Tips

Beginning with 2025 and continuing through 2028, workers in both traditional employment and self-employment arrangements can claim a deduction for qualifying tips earned in job categories identified as customarily tip-receiving positions, which categories the IRS proposed on September 19, 2025. This deduction applies to tips documented on W-2 forms, 1099 forms, other qualifying tax statements provided to the worker, or those self-reported using Form 4137.

No Tax on Overtime

From 2025 to 2028, workers earning qualifying overtime wages can deduct the premium portion of their overtime compensation. Specifically, the additional pay above their standard hourly rate (for example, the extra ""half"" in time-and-a-half pay) as mandated by Fair Labor Standards Act requirements and documented on W-2s, 1099s, or other qualifying tax forms. The deduction is capped at $12,500 annually for individual filers and $25,000 for married couples filing jointly. And the deduction phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).

Business

Holland & Hart has been advising clients on the tax changes since OBBBA enactment. The new and extended business rates include revival and permanency of the 100% bonus depreciation for equipment; revival and permanency of domestic R&E expensing along with some retroactive R&D expensing back to 2021 in certain cases; new international tax rates and rules; allowing the expensing of factories through 2028; extending and modifying the Clean Fuel Tax Credit; and enhanced Low-Income Housing Credit and New Markets Tax Credit.

The other side of the ledger is primarily from restricting and phasing out tax credits for clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced manufacturing and energy production enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), but also includes new floors for charitable deductions; sunsetting duty-free “de minimis” treatment for imports; and expanded reach of the executive compensation deduction limit.

Clean Energy

The changes to the IRA tax credits can be split into three categories: 1) repeals to consumer-focused credits related to electrifying vehicles and buildings; 2) more complex phaseouts and restrictions for power generation and other business-related credits; and 3) expansions to the clean fuel and carbon oxide sequestration credits.

The OBBBA permanently eliminated the new and used Clean Vehicle Credit. Additionally, it repeals the Energy Efficiency Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit. The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit is terminated for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

With January 1, 2025 behind us, many tax credit projects that “begin construction” under IRS rules from here on will be required to prove that their projects do not have material assistance from prohibited foreign entities. While President Trump ordered Treasury to provide guidance in this area within 45 days of July 7, 2025, IRS and Treasury continue work on these new foreign-entity-of-concern provisions. (Holland & Hart continues to advise clients on the statutory rules and is available to potentially influence the ongoing development of the guidance.)

Qualified Opportunity Zones

The law made the Opportunity Zones (OZ) program a permanent part of the tax code, tightened eligibility criteria and reporting rules, and added new incentives for rural areas. The current 8,764 OZ designations in the U.S. will end on December 31, 2026. All 50 governors will select new OZs starting July 1, 2026 (and every 10 years thereafter), and designations will take effect at the beginning of 2027.

New OZ eligibility requirements include a necessity for lower median incomes and elimination of the “contiguous tracts” exception. Opportunity Funds must now disclose total assets held, investment amounts, and data on employment and housing. Treasury will also now publish annual reports on OZ investments and economic performance. Rural Zones will now receive a 30% step-up in basis benefit (the standard is 10%) and require a lower level of improvement.

What’s Next?

Typically, after large tax packages are signed into law, decisions by the various Departments and agencies greatly impact the implementation. Congress often continues to make adjustments and technical corrections.

TerraPower in Mega Deal with Meta for Eight 345 MW Natrium Advanced Nuclear Plants

TerraPower, a nuclear innovation company, and Meta, which owns and operated multiple social media platforms, announced an agreement to develop up to eight Natrium reactor one and energy storage system plants.

This agreement supports the early development activities for two new Natrium units with rights for energy provided to Meta for up to six additional Natrium units. Each Natrium reactor provides 345 MW of baseload power, with built-in energy storage that can ramp up to 500 MW for over five hours. A dual Natrium reactor site can provide 690 MW of reliable 24/7 365 power, and up to 1 GW of dispatchable electricity. Each site selected by Meta is expect to host twin Natirum reactors for a total of 690 MW at each site.

Under this commercial agreement, Meta will provide funding to support the deployment of the Natrium plants, with delivery of initial units as early as 2032. This is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date and is the firm’s first direct investment in a new nuclear build.

At a hypothetical cost of $6,000/kW, each Natrium reactor will cost about $2.1 billion and eight of them would require about $17 billion. The size of the deal supports significant economies of scale for TerraPower’s supply chains as well as for the manufacturing of the reactors.

Power Will Support Meta Data Centers

Each reactor site will provide power for Meta’s data centers. Meta owns and operates several prominent social media platforms and communication services, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Threads. According to official Meta statistics, the combined user community world-wide is 3.9 billion users a month.

The companies will target identification of a specific site for the initial dual reactor unit later this year. The press materials did not indicate whether all sites would be limited to the U.S. Also, it was not indicated whether Meta would connect these sites to local/regional grids or select some or all of them as private wire installations for its data centers which would by pass the current multi-year backlog of FERC approvals of new grid connections.

The eight 345 MW advanced sodium cooled reactors would provide Meta with up to 2.8 GW of carbon-free, baseload energy. Each reactor comes with the Natrium technology’s innovative built-in energy storage system providing the capacity to boost total output to 4 GW of power.

Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO said, “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well-positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”

Urvi Parekh, director of global energy, Meta, said, “This agreement with TerraPower, the result of Meta’s nuclear RFP process, which identified leading developers of nuclear energy to help us advance our energy goals, marks a significant step forward in advancing next-generation nuclear technology. Supporting new nuclear energy generation spurs job growth, drives innovation in our local communities, and reinforces America’s leadership in energy technology.”

TerraPower began construction on the first commercial-scale, advanced nuclear project in the United States, which is expected to be complete in 2030. The Natrium plant is the only commercial advanced nuclear technology with a complete environmental impact statement and final safety review as part of a construction permit application pending with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Betting on HALEU Fuel

Meta and TerraPower are betting that sufficient supplies of HALEU uranium metal fuel will be available to fuel the reactors by the early 2030s. In October 2022 Global Nuclear Fuel–Americas (GNF-A), a GE-led joint venture, and TerraPower announced an agreement to build the Natrium Fuel Facility at the site of GNF-A’s existing plant site near Wilmington, NC. The product will be enriched uranium metal fuel based on TerraPower’s specifications and ready to be fabricated into the form use in the Natrium reactor.

The Natrium Fuel Facility will be jointly funded by TerraPower and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, which aims to speed the demonstration of advanced reactors through cost-shared partnerships with U.S. industry. The facility represents an investment of more than $200 million.

The process, technologies, and expertise used to produce metal from depleted uranium can be used with uranium at the higher enrichment levels required to power TerraPower’s advanced reactor design. Production of HALEU metal is a crucial part of the fuel fabrication process which allows uranium to transform into a metallic feedstock that is used to fabricate fuel for advanced reactors.

In November 2025 Framatome and TerraPower achieved a key milestone in uranium metallization for advanced reactor fuel commercialization, producing successful elements of uranium metal. These metallic uranium ‘pucks’ represent a critical component in advancing the fuel supply chain for TerraPower’s Natrium reactor. The metallization fabrication line was completed at Framatome’s Richland, Washington, nuclear fuel manufacturing facility.

The input feed stock form is metallic fuel with sodium bonding up to 19.75% enriched feed material. Metallic fuel fabrication – Feed material cast with melted zirconium to form a slug, processed into a rod up to 19.75% enriched fuel rods. Each Natrium reactor requires refueling outages every 24 months. The outages can be scheduled to occur staggered with two refueling outages every second year and one refueling outage between. For two unit sites, one unit can be operating while another is being refueled. (TerraPower briefing on fuel for the Natrium reactor – PDF file)

Big Tech Rivals Also Looking To Nuclear Power

(NucNet) Meta’s big tech rivals are also looking to nuclear power to help fuel their AI work. Meta, Amazon and Google signed a pledge in March supporting the tripling of global nuclear energy production by 2050. All three companies have signed deals related to the development and use of nuclear power.

In June, Meta announced a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy so it could purchase purchase nuclear power from the company’s Clinton nuclear power station in Illinois beginning in 2027.

In 2024 Google said it will back the construction of seven SMRs from Kairos Power, becoming the first tech company to commission new nuclear power plants to provide low-carbon electricity for its energy-hungry data centres. Google has also agreed with electric utility NextEra to support the restart of the Duane Arnold nuclear power station in Iowa.

Microsoft announced that it would commit to buying 20 years’ supply of electricity from the mothballed Three Mile Island nuclear power plant – now renamed Crane – if Constellation restarted one of the two plants at the Pennsylvania site.

Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of the online retail giant founded by Jeff Bezos, acquired US power producer Talen Energy’s Cumulus data centre campus at the Susquehanna nuclear power station in Pennsylvania.

In October Amazon unveiled updated plans for an SMR facility in Washington that have 12 reactors producing a maximum of 960 MW of electricity.

The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility will be constructed in three phases, each with four of X-energy’s 80-MW, high-temperature gas-cooled reactors.

DOE Awards $2.7 Billion for Uranium Enrichment

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $2.7 billion to strengthen domestic enrichment services over the next ten years. The historic investment expands U.S. capacity for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and jumpstarts new supply chains and innovations for high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) to create American jobs and usher in the nation’s nuclear renaissance.

Enrichment Task Orders

Last year, DOE signed contracts with a total of six companies for LEU and HALEU enrichment that allowed them to bid on future work. Today, the Department announced task order awards with three companies that will transition the United States away from foreign sources of uranium and diversify the nation’s domestic fuel supply.

Developing this new domestic production capacity for LEU and HALEU ensures an adequate fuel supply is available to maintain operations of the nation’s 94 commercial reactors and builds a strong base to supply future deployments of advanced nuclear reactors. To ensure accountability, these awards will be distributed to the companies under a strict milestone approach.

The following companies were awarded task orders totaling $2.7 billion to provide enrichment services for LEU and HALEU:

American Centrifuge Operating ($900 million) to create domestic HALEU enrichment capacity

General Matter ($900 million) to create domestic HALEU enrichment capacity

Orano Federal Services ($900 million) to expand U.S. domestic LEU enrichment capacity

Innovative Technology Funding Opportunities

DOE also awarded an additional $28 million today to Global Laser Enrichment to continue advancing next generation uranium enrichment technology for the nuclear fuel cycle. The award is the result of a competitive solicitation issued last December.

Oklo, Meta Plan 1.2 GW Nuclear Energy Development in Southern Ohio

Meta’s agreement with Oklo highlights growing market demand for advanced nuclear energy and commitment to clean power

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) an advanced nuclear technology company, announced an agreement with Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) that advances Oklo’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW power campus in Pike County, OH, to support Meta’s data centers in the region. The agreement provides a mechanism for Meta to prepay for power and provide funding to advance project certainty for Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse deployment.

Oklo will use the funds to secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of the project—supporting the development of clean, reliable power in Pike County that can scale up to 1.2 GW. Meta’s commitment enables Oklo to pursue development in southern Ohio.

Oklo seeks to develop the project on 206 acres of land in Pike County owned by the company and formerly owned by the Department of Energy. The land purchase was facilitated in part by the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative (SODI), a nonprofit working to reuse the land for regional development.

The agreement is expected to lay the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora powerhouses, creating thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs, expanding Ohio’s clean energy workforce, and generating new local and state tax revenues through investment in energy infrastructure.

Pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030. The plans for the scalable powerhouse facility are expected to expand incrementally to deliver up to the full target of 1.2 GW by 2034.

Ohio’s location within the PJM interconnection—one of the nation’s largest grid systems—and its strong transmission network position it as a strategic hub for America’s clean energy growth as demand for artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure accelerates.

The project aligns with the broader redevelopment efforts led by SODI to transform thousands of acres at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant—a symbol of national strength where local families played a key role in America’s national security efforts—into a hub for advanced manufacturing and clean energy.

“The project brings into focus the potential for the transformative impact the redevelopment of this site can have on our energy infrastructure and the reinvigoration of our community,” said Kevin Shoemaker, General Counsel at SODI. “We appreciate our strong partnership with Oklo and look forward to continuing to work with them to bring more jobs and economic opportunity to the region.”

Oklo and DOE Partner to Deploy Radioisotope Pilot Facility

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), an advanced nuclear technology company, announced that it has signed a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to support the design, construction, and operation of a radioisotope pilot plant under the DOE Reactor Pilot Program (RPP). Signing the OTA is a major milestone which marks the transition from project selection and planning into active execution under DOE authorization.

Atomic Alchemy Inc., an Oklo subsidiary, is using the Radioisotope Pilot Facility to lay the groundwork for future commercial plants that make medical and research radioisotopes in the United States. These radioisotopes are essential for diagnosing cancer, treating disease, powering medical research, and supporting national security. Today, many are produced overseas or in aging facilities. By first operating a pilot plant, Oklo can then scale into reliable, domestic production that helps ensure hospitals, researchers, and patients have consistent access to these lifesaving materials.

With the OTA now in place, Atomic Alchemy will focus its near-term resources on building the Radioisotope Pilot Facility under DOE authorization. As part of this learn-first-then-scale strategy, Atomic Alchemy has withdrawn its previously submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction permit application for the Meitner-1 commercial radioisotope production facility at Idaho National Laboratory to focus on the Radioisotope Pilot Facility.

Oklo views the RPP as an enabler and accelerator to deliver advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen U.S. energy security, healthcare infrastructure, and industrial leadership.

Oklo Developing an Plutonium Fueled Fast Test Reactor

The “Pluto” Reactor Project is a plutonium-fueled fast test reactor. Its purpose,unlike Oklo’s primary commercial product (the Aurora powerhouse), is designed as a test reactor to qualify surplus plutonium as a “bridge fuel” for commercial use. The Pluto project was selected under the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Reactor Pilot Program (RPP).

The strategic goal of the test reactor is to establish the technical basis for converting surplus U.S. government plutonium into HALEU fuel. This data will eventually support the licensing and operation of Oklo’s commercial Aurora reactors using recycled or alternative fuel sources.

In December 2025, Oklo and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) successfully conducted a series of “fast-spectrum plutonium criticality experiments” at the Nevada National Security Site. These tests demonstrated negative reactivity feedback, a critical safety feature where the reactor naturally shuts itself down as temperatures increase, providing the benchmark data needed for Pluto’s formal design and safety basis.

It is important to note that Pluto is distinct from Aurora. Aurora is Oklo’s flagship commercial powerhouse (intended for data centers, industrial sites, etc.). Pluto is the pilot/test reactor platform specifically focused on the plutonium fuel cycle and R&D.

Terrestrial Energy Executes DOE Agreement Under the Advanced Reactor Pilot Program

The OTA agreement provides for construction and operation of Project TETRA, Terrestrial Energy’s pilot reactor using Integral Molten Salt Reactor technology

Terrestrial Energy now positioned to move quickly from design to operation under DOE authorization, laying the groundwork for swift commercialization of IMSR plants

Terrestrial Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: IMSR), a developer of small modular nuclear power plants using its Generation IV reactor technology, announced that it has executed an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for Project TETRA, an initiative to construct and operate a pilot reactor which will support Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) plant development.

This announcement marks an important milestone in Terrestrial Energy’s engagement with the Advanced Reactor Pilot Program, established by Executive Order 14301, under which the Company is targeting IMSR plant deployment facilitated by the DOE’s accelerated authorization of pilot TETRA reactor operation.

The agreement establishes a direct, streamlined collaboration with the DOE to review and authorize the design and safe operation of the TETRA reactor, a molten salt-fueled, graphite-moderated reactor that uses standard assay, low-enriched UF6-based fuel (SALEU) containing less than five percent U-235.

This agreement enables Terrestrial Energy to move quickly from design to operation under DOE authorization. Executed under DOE’s authority at 42 U.S.C. § 7256(g), the OTA enables the Company to operate outside traditional federal contracting constraints, providing a flexible and agile framework designed for swift advanced reactor innovation.

Terrestrial Energy’s commercial IMSR plant is designed to produce 822 MWth (390 MWe) of flexible low-cost clean firm energy for electricity generation and industrial heat applications. Its high-temperature molten salt fuel design supports electricity generation at superior efficiency and direct thermal delivery for manufacturing, data center operations, and other industrial heat end users.

The reactor’s use of readily available SALEU fuel eliminates substantial obstacles from high assay low-enriched (HALEU) fuel dependency, strengthening supply security and enabling rapid scalability with existing U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. With IMSR technology, Terrestrial Energy is creating a short and practical path to low-cost clean firm nuclear energy at scale.

The Advanced Reactor Pilot Program, established under Executive Order 14301, enables the DOE to authorize privately built reactors outside its national laboratories. The program provides a streamlined pathway to regulatory authorization for operation, bridging the gap between pilot reactor operations for system testing, and licensing for commercial plant operation, advancing U.S. leadership in the advanced reactor sector. In September 2025, Terrestrial Energy was separately selected for the DOE Fuel Line Pilot Program.

ZettaJoule Targets Industrial Uses of Advanced Nuclear HTGR Technology

The new design is based on Japan’s R&D work on the HTTR, a 30 MWt HTGR.

ZettaJoule, Inc., an advanced small modular reactor company, says that a major focus for the first commercial application for its ZJ advanced nuclear technology is to provide heat and power to an oil and gas operation. With an emphasis on production of heat and power, a refinery site is a potential location for the firm’s first planned commercial units.

However, in the near term the firm is planning to develop a 30MWt research reactor. With all the activity at Texas university sites for new nuclear technologies, any one of them might welcome the project. ZettaJoule has not yet publicly named the specific university partner for its Texas site, though it has confirmed it is transitioning its headquarters to Houston, Texas to support its initial project at an “as-yet-unnamed Texas university” and its first industrial commercial project in the state.

While the initial research reactor will be at a university in Texas, one possible commercial focus for ZettaJoule in Texas is the oil and gas refineries. While the first proposed ZettaJoule reactor is designed to produce 30 MWt, commercial units may approach may approach 300MWe.

ZettaJoule’s proposed ZJ research reactor (non-power) is designed with the unique ability to operate operate up to 950 C, which is 600° C higher than conventional water-cooled reactors.

ZettaJoule’s ZJ reactor will be developed by modernizing proven, publicly available, safety-tested technology derived from the Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s HTTR, which began operating in 1998 and reached full power capacity in 2001.

About the Reactor Technology and Fuel

The ZettaJoule ZJ reactor is a High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) based on modernized technology derived from the Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s HTTR (High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor). The target for a construction permit for the modernized design is projected by ZettaJoule to be within the next two to three years (by 2028-2029).

Power Ratings: While the initial ZJ reactor is designed to produce 30 MWt, ZettaJoule’s roadmap includes scaling future commercial units to higher capacities approaching, such as 300 MWe from a 600 MWt source.

Heat Transfer System: It uses gas cooling (helium) to produce high-grade process heat.

Fuel Type: The ZJ reactor will use TRISO fuel which consists of uranium particles individually encapsulated in multiple protective layers of pyrocarbon and silicon carbide. They retain fission products even at temperatures as high as 1600° C. The ZJ reactor is expected to use LEU+ fuel, which is at 5-10 percent enrichment, to ensure commercial availability. The possible use of HALEU fuel may be considered at a later time. Most advanced reactors being developed in the U.S. use much higher levels of enrichment, e.g., up to 19.75% U235.

Investors, MOUs and Expected Uses

Aramco Support: ZettaJoule has received formal support from Aramco Services Company (an affiliate of Motiva Enterprises). Aramco is evaluating applications for its upstream and downstream operations.

Major Investors: Globis Capital Partners (GCP) is a known early investor, having participated in a seed round in December 2024. Significant in addition to Globis Capital Partners (GCP) are, Coral Capital, Archetype Ventures, HAX, and SOSV.

Regulatory Affairs: The firm has a dedicated regulatory leadership team, including Rumina Velshi, formerly President and CEO of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (Regulatory Affairs) and Andrea Veil, formerly Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation at the NRC (SVP Regulatory Strategy). However, the firm has not yet announced its plans to submit a regulatory engagement plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Hydrogen Production: While the primary focus mentioned is high-temperature process heat for industrial sectors, HTGRs capable of reaching 950°C also provide efficient ways to produce hydrogen. Industry analysis continues to highlight hydrogen production as a key expected use for such high-heat technologies.

VISTRA Inks 20-Year PPA with Meta; Uprates Planned at Three Nuclear Plants

Vistra (NYSE: VST) announced it has entered into 20-year PPAs to provide more than 2,600 MW of zero-carbon energy from a combination of three different Vistra nuclear plants to support Meta’s operations in the region.

The agreements include 2,176 MW of operating generation and an additional 433 MW of combined power output increases, which will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the United States. Vistra will now begin planning for subsequent license extensions at all three plants, which would extend operations of these carbon-free assets for another 20 years. Meta’s purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034, when the full 2,609 MW of power will be online.

Through the agreements:

Meta is purchasing 2,176 MW of nuclear energy and capacity from the operating Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio;

Meta is also purchasing 433 MW of incremental nuclear energy and capacity from equipment upgrades to increase generation output (called uprates) at the Perry (Ohio), Davis-Besse (Ohio), and Beaver Valley (Pennsylvania) plants – more than 15% of the contracted capacity announced today will be new capacity added to the PJM region;

the electricity generated at the plants will continue to go to the grid for all electricity users.

Each of the three plants has received initial license renewal from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The PPAs provide certainty for Vistra to pursue subsequent license renewal for each of the reactors, which would extend each license an additional 20 years. Currently, Beaver Valley Unit 1 is licensed through 2036; Davis-Besse is licensed through 2037; Perry is licensed through 2046; and Beaver Valley Unit 2 is licensed through 2047.

Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology

As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.

These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.

TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology

Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium® units capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.

“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”

Oklo: Adding New Nuclear Energy in Ohio

Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.

This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. Oklo Aurora powerhouses are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.

“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio.”

Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy

Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our first nuclear energy agreement helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.

Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.

Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.

“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”

While Illinois is promoting solar and storage, California is eyeing the rental population for plug-and-play systems.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA), paving the way for the state to deploy 3 GW of grid-scale battery storage by 2030. It will also boost solar and virtual power plants (VPP) in the state.

Under the act, utilities will be required to create VPP programs that pay homes and businesses for letting their smart devices – like solar panels, batteries, EVs, and smart thermostats – help supply or save electricity.

It increases the maximum size of community solar projects to 10 MW and establishes a Solar Bill of Rights that allows municipal and cooperative utilities to install rooftop solar panels. The Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) will be able to expedite renewable energy projects before federal tax credits expire.

The state expects the CRGA to lower monthly utility bills and save consumers $13.4 billion over the next 20 years.

“Under this law, we'll end price gouging by private grid owners and begin to bring down costs here in Illinois, starting with people’s utility bill,” said Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton. “Energy prices will come down without sacrificing our other priorities — Illinois will continue to be a leader in renewable energy and grid reliability.”

The CRGA builds upon the Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) and the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA). It has installed over 6 GW of renewable energy since the passage of CEJA, while an additional 6 GW is currently under development in the state.

The state has also lifted the moratorium on new, large nuclear reactors to promote new, carbon-free energy resources.

Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has welcomed the development. SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said, “This landmark law is a model for how states can secure their energy future and lower costs for families and small businesses. A 21st-century economy requires a 21st-century grid, and solar, storage, and Virtual Power Plants are made for this moment.”

Sarah Cottrell, SVP of State affairs at American Clean Power Association (ACP), added that this act will improve reliability and create clean-energy and manufacturing jobs in the state.

Efforts to boost clean energy are also ongoing in another Democratic Party-governed state, California. Senator Scott Wiener of San Francisco has introduced the Clean Homes and Energy Affordability Package (CHEAP). It comprises SB 868, The Plug And Play Solar Act, to promote the use of small-scale mobile solar systems – also called balcony solar – that can lower energy costs for renters, apartment dwellers and homeowners. California has around 14 million rental units, making it a ready market for such installations.

Electricity generated by plug-and-play systems can be used directly to power refrigerators, air conditioners, or other home appliances, reducing grid load.

California aims to follow in the footsteps of the Utah market, which passed a law enabling the use of these systems, said Wiener.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2026-01-09%2Fm92ok8dg%2FBalcony-Solar.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-09 14:00:41.145473

“Our goal in the Zeng Research Lab is to create better materials for storing energy, which ultimately affects everyday technologies,” Zeng said.
Sodium-ion batteries, on the other hand, show promise as an eco-friendly and affordable alternative.
However, sodium is heavier than lithium, which means sodium-ion batteries provide less energy than lithium-ion batteries of the same weight and size.
“I am most inspired by the possibility of discovering entirely new materials that could transform energy technologies,” Zeng said.","A Florida State University researcher has been honored for her work developing new materials that enable more efficient energy storage and produce cleaner energy for daily use, ranging from phones and laptops to electric cars and renewable energy systems.

Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Yan Zeng has earned a 2025 Materials Today Rising Star Award in recognition of her contributions to the field of energy conversion and storage, including her work in designing sodium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. This year, she is one of nine researchers worldwide to receive this distinction and is the first-ever honoree from FSU.

“It is an honor to be recognized by the community, and I feel thankful to everyone who has supported my work,” Zeng said. “It is especially meaningful because it recognizes our early efforts in energy conversion and storage research; the award encourages me to keep pushing this work forward and continue to grow as a researcher.”

First granted by the Materials Today Family of Journals in 2018, the Materials Today Rising Star Awards recognize early career researchers who are poised to become future leaders in the fields of materials science and engineering, highlighting the exceptional potential of their works’ real-world impact.

“Our goal in the Zeng Research Lab is to create better materials for storing energy, which ultimately affects everyday technologies,” Zeng said. “Even though the chemistry is complex, the goal is simple: make energy safer, cleaner, and more reliable for everyone.”

In early 2024, Zeng joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s $50 million Low-cost Earth-abundant Na-ion Storage Consortium, or LENS Consortium, which aims to discover, develop, and demonstrate a new class of sodium-ion batteries for use in electric vehicles.

Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries. While these cut down on emissions, lithium poses several risks, both environmental and economic. Mining lithium often requires large amounts of water in arid areas; this process not only damages ecosystems, but manufacturing lithium-ion batteries is also energy intensive and produces considerable greenhouse gas emissions. These challenges, among others, contribute to the supply chain risks associated with lithium.

Sodium-ion batteries, on the other hand, show promise as an eco-friendly and affordable alternative. By swapping sodium for lithium, Zeng’s research hopes to reduce reliance on critical elements, or chemicals that are in high demand but limited supply. However, sodium is heavier than lithium, which means sodium-ion batteries provide less energy than lithium-ion batteries of the same weight and size. Zeng aims to push past this barrier by designing brand-new element and structure combinations that will allow sodium-ion batteries to not only compete with but outperform their lithium-ion counterparts.

“I am most inspired by the possibility of discovering entirely new materials that could transform energy technologies,” Zeng said. “The combination of creative chemistry, data-driven tools, and curiosity-driven exploration keeps the work exciting every day. My lab leverages artificial intelligence and automation to accelerate discovery and optimization, opening up opportunities to uncover design principles and innovations.”

Zeng’s approach to creating and optimizing new materials is unique for its integration of automation and AI to accelerate the research process. For example, an automated robotic arm is used to complete some of the lab’s repetitive work, such as carrying out individual chemical reactions. After each successful synthesization, or creation of a new substance, Zeng employs AI as a springboard for new ideas, considering what types of tweaks could optimize the new material.

“Designing solid-state materials has been challenging due to chemical complexity, and gaining empirical knowledge via human repetitive work is very costly and time consuming,” said Wei Yang, chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. “Dr. Zeng is a pioneer in her field for integrating AI with robotics, a method that has attracted tremendous national and international attention.”",https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Zeng_TW.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:02:19.732169

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2% in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.","General Motors said Thursday it would take a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments, the latest car company to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration’s policies and fading demand.

The charge stems from reducing its planned EV production and the fallout on the supply chain, GM said in a regulatory filing, and comes weeks after rival Ford Motor announced a similar but much bigger charge.

Most of GM’s writedown – a $4.2 billion cash charge – is related to contract cancellations and settlements with suppliers, who had planned for much higher production volumes before the market turned.

GM said the writedown would not affect its US lineup of roughly a dozen EV models, which is the industry’s broadest offering of battery-powered vehicles. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,” it said in its filing.

The company will record the charge as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings report. It expects to incur additional charges in 2026 as a result of negotiations with its supply base, but expects them to be less than its 2025 EV charges.

GM placed a big bet on EVs

Many automakers, including GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, have been dialing back factory work on EVs since last summer, when President Trump’s massive tax and spending package darkened the outlook for the EV market. Sales of battery-powered vehicles have cratered following the elimination on September 30 of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

Ford in December said it would take a $19.5 billion writedown over several quarters as it canceled several EV programs, including the fully electric version of its F-150 Lightning truck and an additional electric truck and van.

GM, the largest US automaker by sales, made one of the biggest bets on EVs among global automakers, at one point vowing to essentially phase out internal-combustion cars and trucks by 2035.

While the company has not publicly walked back the 2035 goal, analysts have sharply cut the industry’s EV sales forecast into the next decade for the US, GM’s largest and most profitable market. GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will respond to customer demand.

GM’s EV sales had started gaining traction in late 2024 after years of manufacturing setbacks. The company rolled out more lower-cost offerings, helping it reach No. 2 in sales behind Tesla.

The company also said on Thursday that it would record a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its ongoing restructuring of its China joint venture.

The automaker began writing down some EV-related investments last year, including a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge. This month, GM halted production of EV batteries at two joint-venture plants for six months and cut production to one shift at an EV-only factory in Detroit.

The company also pivoted away from plans for another Michigan factory that was slated to build EVs, and instead will build the Cadillac Escalade and full-size pickups, it has said.

EV sales are down industrywide

GM’s EV sales dropped 43% in the fourth quarter after the loss of the consumer tax credit. Sales hit record highs in the previous three months, when customers rushed to buy EVs before the credit ended.

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2% in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.

Automotive data provider Edmunds expects EVs to account for about 6% of overall US vehicle sales in 2026, down from 7.4% in 2025.

Ford’s shift, in which it essentially killed off its entire planned second generation of EVs, resulted in a much higher charge. Ford CEO Jim Farley said it was a painful but necessary move as the market cooled.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Farley told Reuters in a December interview.

Ford is now setting its EV hopes on a brand-new architecture that will enable the production of affordable models, starting with a $30,000 electric pickup in 2027.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gm-electric-vehicles.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1767889561&w=1200,N,,2026-01-09 11:03:52.810365

25%: GM Takes A $7.1 Billion Hit As It Trims EV Plans

Throughout the 2020s automakers moved fast and spent big on EVs. Billions of dollars flowed into retooling factories, developing new models and locking in battery manufacturing contracts.

After the Trump administration and Congress targeted pro-EV policies last year, that momentum began to sputter. Automakers embarked on an expensive retreat as they unwound some of their EV investments and refocused on combustion.

The must-read auto and tech roundup, delivered every morning.

For General Motors, that pullback has come with a hefty price tag. The company booked $7.1 billion in charges in the fourth quarter of last year, according to a Thursday SEC filing, much of it a result of reversing EV plans.

The automaker attributed $1.1 billion to costs associated with the restructuring of its China joint venture, where it operates under the SAIC-GM banner. The bulk of the hit, about $6 billion, had to do with pumping the brakes on EVs in North America. That’s on top of a $1.6 billion charge it took last year, also due to a slowdown in EV sales.

Here’s how GM explained the move:

With the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, industry-wide consumer demand for EVs in North America began to slow in 2025.

As a result, GM proactively reduced EV capacity, including by pivoting the Company’s assembly plant in Orion, MI from EV production to the production of full-size SUVs and full-size pickups powered by internal combustion engines, where we believe we have unmet demand, and we proactively reduced battery cell capacity, including by selling our interest in Ultium Cells LLC’s Lansing, MI facility to LG Energy Solution.

The $6 billion includes $1.8 billion in non-cash charges and $4.2 billion that will have a cash impact, including contract cancellation fees. Crosstown rival Ford made a similar announcement last month, though on an even larger scale. It expects an over $19 billion hit to profits due to its own restrategizing, which saw the cancellation of the F-150 Lightning.

General Motors was the second highest-selling EV automaker last year in the U.S. behind Tesla. And its EV portfolio is among the strongest in the industry, with about a dozen models across the Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC brands.

But the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit and a major rewrite of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations, which now no longer carry any penalties, changed the math for automakers. EV sales plunged in the fourth quarter, and it’s not clear how quickly they’ll rebound.

GM made clear that its deep lineup isn’t impacted by Thursday’s announcement, however.

“Our strategic realignment of EV capacity does not impact today’s retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs in production,” GM said. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers.”

50%: China Seeks To Tighten Screws On Battery Production Overcapacity

The Chinese government summoned the country’s largest battery makers for EVs and energy storage systems to a closed-door meeting to mitigate price wars and curb battery production overcapacity, the state-run China Daily reported Thursday.

Some 16 companies including CATL, BYD, Gotion, Svolt and Eve Energy attended the session, as Chinese regulators pledged to tighten oversight in the market, enforce more strict rules around pricing, improve quality and crack down on intellectual property violations, the outlet reported.

According to research firm BloombergNEF, China is grappling with a significant oversupply of batteries. In other words, the country has built far more battery capacity than the world can currently absorb, even before factoring in the next wave of projects already in the pipeline.

That oversupply has helped to drive down battery prices to new lows, but unchecked growth clearly presents issues too.

Global automakers will roll into this weekend’s Brussels Motor Show with a broad lineup of futuristic EVs. The spotlight will be firmly on Europe-focused models. The region is far ahead of the U.S. on the EV adoption curve, though it still trails China.

EVs worth watching, as compiled by Automotive News, include the upcoming Kia EV2, Citroën’s Elo Concept electric utility van, the battery-powered version of Hyundai’s Staria van, Mazda’s second Europe-only EV following the 6e sedan and Renault’s reborn electric Twingo.

BYD, meanwhile, will be there with as many as nine models on display. Tesla will also be present, bringing its lower-priced Standard trims of the Model 3 and Model Y, according to the outlet.

Shares slid about 2% before the opening bell Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power. GM operates Fort Wayne Assembly which makes Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have be shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

Greenfield City Council member Dan Riley noted the pharmaceutical industry is a competitive one to land.
“Project Crossroads — as we have called the West project — is an exciting addition to our manufacturing, distribution and commercial portfolio,” he said.
“”I look forward to the relationship the City of Greenfield will have with West,” Greenfield Mayor Guy Titus said.

West Pharmaceutical Services — a century-old pharmaceutical company that manufactures self-injection devices, syringe components and seals for injectable packaging systems — announced Thursday morning it plans to expand its network by adding a manufacturing site in Greenfield.

West will occupy the warehouse at 989 Opportunity Parkway, which housed BWI Group from 2019-2024. Company leaders hope to create over 300 high-paying job in manufacturing, quality, engineering, automation and support functions at the future Greenfield location.

“Indiana offers an ideal environment for growth — with a strong manufacturing base, a talented workforce and a welcoming community,” said Aileen Ruff-Patry, president of West Contract Manufacturing. “We’re excited to be expanding here, creating new jobs, and partnering with local organizations to make a positive impact in the region.”

West has locations in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, plus its global headquarters in Pennsylvania. West’s expansion into Indiana represents the company’s focus on its Midwestern operations.

Greenfield City Council member Dan Riley noted the pharmaceutical industry is a competitive one to land.

“Project Crossroads — as we have called the West project — is an exciting addition to our manufacturing, distribution and commercial portfolio,” he said. “Pharmaceutical manufacturing is an innovative field that communities compete fiercely to land, and Greenfield is proud to be a destination for a company building the future of global health.

“West is a community-minded company that wants not to just have a facility here, but be a part of the city as we continue on our path of quality growth. We look forward to their coming to 989 Opportunity Parkway in 2026.”

Under the Project Crossroads code name, Greenfield City Council approved a letter of commitment affirming the body’s support for the project at a November meeting. In the letter, the company would invest $48 million in machinery and equipment between 2025 and 2028, and an additional $42 million in capital investment between 2029 and 2035.

When West first moves in, according to the letter, there will be 90 jobs with an average salary of $75,000. Between 2027 and 2030, the number of jobs at the facility will grow by 210 employees, “subject to customer demands and solutions.”

The letter also states Greenfield City Council would consider a granting a 15-year personal property tax abatement to the company, with potential tax savings of $5.5 million.

“”I look forward to the relationship the City of Greenfield will have with West,” Greenfield Mayor Guy Titus said. “Having this first-class company become a part of our community will be a tremendous opportunity for us. West makes products people depend on while creating cutting-edge jobs, and we are thrilled to be recognized as a place where pioneering, life-changing industries want to invest and grow.

“Our economic development team has done a great job securing another high-profile company providing positive development and growth for Greenfield’s future.”

Greenfield has had a long history of involvement in the pharmaceutical industry. The Lilly Biological Laboratories on U.S. 40 was built in the 1910s and was a laboratory complex for Eli Lilly and Co. until Lilly sold it in 2008. That property is now home to toxicology and developmental and reproductive toxicology facilities for Labcorp.

In 2007, Elanco, a pharmaceutical company focused on drugs for animals, moved its global headquarters to a dedicated campus located at Interstate 70 and Ind. 9 to Greenfield. Last year, Elanco vacated its Greenfield campus to move into a new headquarters complex in Indianapolis.

Indiana has emerged as a major pharmaceutical hub in the United States and worldwide, with companies such as Lilly, Roche, Zimmer Biomet and Elevance Health either being headquartered or having a significant base of operations in the Hoosier State. A 2024 report by the Biotechnology Industry Organization showed the Indianapolis metropolitan area as fourth in the nation for number of employees in the pharmaceutical industry.

“This investment will bring more than 300 high-paying jobs to a state that leads the nation in advanced manufacturing, life sciences and logistics,” Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said in the press release. “Indiana’s capable workforce and strong business environment continue to attract world-class companies like West. I am glad to see West join the Hoosier economy and look forward to witnessing their long-term success here.”",https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/135885587_web1_20220628dr-BWI.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:13:33.544021

This is evident regarding our renewable energy technologies. Take wind turbines, for example. The global installed wind capacity at the end of 2025 was predicted to surpass 1,320 GW and reportedly offset nearly 1.3 billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually. Yet, turbines triggered a reaction no one expected, but a certain U.S. technology could make the difference.

Wind turbines triggered a reaction no one expected

Wind energy and its associated technologies have significantly grown in both popularity and capacity. According to the World Wind Energy Association, wind power is now responsible for almost 12% of the global power supply. However, conventional turbine designs have been found to trigger a reaction that no one expected before, until now.

The UN Environment Programme has found that millions of bat fatalities occur on an annual basis due to wind turbines. It added that these fatalities occur globally, as bats are on every continent, excluding Antarctica. For example, the approximate number of annual bat fatalities due to turbines in the following countries is:

50,000 in Canada

More than 200,000 in Germany

More than 500,000 in the U.S.

Global bat populations are rapidly declining, especially considering their slow reproduction rates and their long gestation period, as per the Animal Diversity Web. Now, a U.S. technology could save nearly 800,000 bats annually. But why exactly do wind turbines lead to bat fatalities? Find out below.

Now, a U.S. technology could save 800,000 bats

A CNN Science report found that the most recent evidence indicates that the majority of bat fatalities are due to direct impact with fast-moving turbine blades. Another cause of death in bats due to turbines is barotrauma. Turbine barotrauma is a low-pressure area near the blades that can rupture bats’ lungs and cause internal bleeding.

One of the current methods to prevent bat fatalities is called “blanket curtailment.” This entails halting wind turbines during low wind speeds, as this is when bats will most likely be present. This reduces bat fatalities by nearly 60%, but it also decreases annual wind energy output by more than 10%. The latest solution? A U.S-based company called EchoSense believes the answer is “smart curtailment.”

Sensors are added to the turbine blades that detect echolocating signals of bats. Once the signal is detected, the turbine is halted to allow bats to pass in a timely manner. This also reduced the amount of lost energy. Unfortunately, bats are not the only wildlife that are impacted by wind turbines. Recent studies have found that offshore wind turbines negatively affect marine mammals.

Other disadvantages of wind turbines that must be addressed

The chief scientist at Bat Conservation International believes that the only way to protect wildlife is to increase focus on wind turbine operation and displacement to keep risks to a minimum. In a statement, he added:

“We want to find ways in which we can maximize energy production, but do that in a way that is ecologically responsible and not causing biodiversity loss.”

Besides wildlife mortality and habitat disruption, other disadvantages of wind turbines that must also be addressed include:

Visual impact

Noise pollution

Radar interference

Transmission challenges

Difficulty recycling the blades

GM will record about $6 billion in EV-related charges tied to reduced production and supplier contract settlements.

The writedown reflects weaker EV demand following the end of federal tax credits and shifting policy priorities.

GM will maintain its current EV lineup but continue adjusting production and investments to match market conditions.

General Motors will record roughly $6 billion in charges tied to its pullback from electric vehicle investments, reflecting weaker EV demand, policy changes under the Trump administration and reduced production plans across its supply chain.

The Detroit automaker disclosed the writedown in a regulatory filing Thursday, confirming it will be recorded as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings. When combined with a $1.1 billion charge related to restructuring a China joint venture, GM’s total fourth-quarter special charges will reach $7.1 billion.

Most of the EV-related charge, about $4.2 billion, is expected to have a cash impact and is tied to supplier contract cancellations, settlements and other commercial adjustments. The remaining portion consists of non-cash impairments related to scaled-back EV production plans.

GM said the writedown will not affect its U.S. lineup of roughly a dozen electric models, which remains the broadest EV portfolio among legacy automakers. The company said it plans to continue offering those vehicles while adjusting production levels to better align with current market demand.

The automaker expects additional EV-related charges in 2026 as negotiations with suppliers continue, though it said those costs should be lower than the impairments recorded in 2025.

GM’s decision follows similar moves across the industry. Ford Motor in December announced plans to take about $19.5 billion in charges after canceling multiple EV programs. Automakers have been scaling back EV investments since mid-2024, when changes to federal policy darkened the outlook for electric vehicle adoption.

EV sales momentum slowed sharply after the Trump administration ended a $7,500 federal consumer tax credit on Sept. 30. GM’s EV sales dropped 43% in the fourth quarter as buyers rushed purchases earlier in the year before the incentive expired.

GM has already paused battery production at two joint-venture plants, reduced shifts at an EV-only factory in Detroit and pivoted a planned Michigan EV facility toward producing full-size pickups and SUVs.

Oklo will use the funds to secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of the project—supporting the development of clean, reliable power in Pike County that can scale up to 1.2 GW. Meta's commitment enables Oklo to pursue development in southern Ohio. Oklo seeks to develop the project on 206 acres of land in Pike County owned by the company and formerly owned by the Department of Energy. The land purchase was facilitated in part by the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative (SODI), a nonprofit working to reuse the land for regional development.

""Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality. We have finalized the purchase of over 200 acres in Pike County and are excited to announce this agreement in support of a multi-year effort with Meta to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio,"" said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo's co-founder and CEO. ""Meta's funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward.""

The agreement is expected to lay the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora powerhouses, creating thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs, expanding Ohio's clean energy workforce, and generating new local and state tax revenues through investment in energy infrastructure.

Pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030. The plans for the scalable powerhouse facility are expected to expand incrementally to deliver up to the full target of 1.2 GW by 2034.

Ohio's location within the PJM interconnection—one of the nation's largest grid systems—and its strong transmission network position it as a strategic hub for America's clean energy growth as demand for artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure accelerates.

Oklo's business model allows large energy users to fund their own generation and add new clean power to the grid supported by private capital investment. The agreement provides Oklo with the commercial support needed to advance the development of power infrastructure to support future data center capacity for Meta. This means that Meta is paying to help add more power to Ohio, which will support a reliable grid for all energy customers in the region. This project will also add local jobs to build and operate the nuclear facilities.

""Our agreement with Oklo enables the development of 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear energy in Southern Ohio, supporting Meta's operations in the region—including our AI supercluster in New Albany. This project will create jobs, spur local innovation, and advance American leadership in energy technology. By investing in baseload nuclear energy, we're helping build a resilient and sustainable future for our communities,"" said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy, Meta.

The project aligns with the broader redevelopment efforts led by SODI to transform thousands of acres at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant—a symbol of national strength where local families played a key role in America's national security efforts—into a hub for advanced manufacturing and clean energy.

""The project brings into focus the potential for the transformative impact the redevelopment of this site can have on our energy infrastructure and the reinvigoration of our community,"" said Kevin Shoemaker, General Counsel at SODI. ""We appreciate our strong partnership with Oklo and look forward to continuing to work with them to bring more jobs and economic opportunity to the region.""

Tony Evers recently announced $14 million in funding for charging stations across the state which are supported by the national electric vehicle infrastructure program.
“I feel like there’s a lot more charging stations in other areas compared to here,” she said.

She bought her new Volkswagen ID4 Pro electric vehicle at the end of September, just days before federal tax credits on the vehicles ended.

“I thought with maintenance it would be easier. You don’t have the oil changes,” Forst said about her decision to buy an EV. “It’s better for the environment.”

The switch to an EV has also meant finding a place to charge up in the Green Bay area. She said many of the charging stations are on Green Bay’s west side with a smattering of locations on the east side.

“I would think there would be more coming up in the future. There are more electric cars becoming available,” Forst said about future access to charging in the state. “A lot of the new (EVs) are coming up in 2026. I drove quite a few before I decided on what vehicle I was going to get. Hopefully we get more because it would be convenient to have them at more spots.”

Earlier this year, the Trump administration attempted to block federal funding for EV infrastructure projects after the ability to use that money was passed by the state with bipartisan support in 2024.

The paused federal program was restarted in August after 16 states — including Wisconsin — filed a lawsuit.

Gov. Tony Evers recently announced $14 million in funding for charging stations across the state which are supported by the national electric vehicle infrastructure program. It includes locations in both urban and rural areas.

Logan Burrows is living in the Green Bay area while going to school in Grand Chute. A charging station in at a Meijer in Howard is preferred place to plug in his Ford F-150.

“This charger in particular is the fastest one I’ve found in the area,” he said. “I charge about once a day.”

A native of Fence in northern Wisconsin, Burrows said he’d like to see similar charging options in smaller communities.

“Up north, you’ve got Crivitz that has one that takes hours. There’s one in Wausaukee that’s about as fast as this one,” he said. “In Iron Mountain (Mich.) there’s one that also takes hours, six hours. Iron Mountain should have one that’s faster than that. I’d love to see more fast ones.”

Twenty-six charging locations are included in the latest announcement from the state.

Forst said her farthest trip so far has been Appleton, but she’s open to a longer road trip to other cities like Minneapolis.

“I feel like there’s a lot more charging stations in other areas compared to here,” she said.

Her vehicle will also lend a helping hand.

Treaty Oak has long-term agreements in place with Meta Platforms, under which the Facebook owner will purchase the facilities’ environmental attributes, while the projects’ electricity will be delivered to the local grid.

Treaty Oak CEO Chris Elrod said: “Closing the financing for these two projects during a challenging economic year for renewable energy projects underscores our strong business model and commitment to bringing energy independence to states like Louisiana.

“I am incredibly proud of our teams and grateful to our financing partners, suppliers, and vendors for their collaboration in making these projects a reality while supporting our commitment to build a US-based supply chain for our customers.”

The Beekman project secured $410m in non-recourse senior secured credit facilities, including a construction-to-term loan, letter of credit facilities and a tax credit bridge loan.

CIB, Crédit Agricole, ING Capital, MUFG, National Australia Bank and SMBC acted as coordinating lead arrangers, with each of them serving as bookrunner, green loan coordinator and hedge provider.

Death penalty cases are the only ones that are appealed directly to the state Supreme Court.

Nazneen Ahmed, spokeswoman for the state attorney general’s office, declined to comment, citing pending litigation.
Mumma said this process has been brutal for Banner and Cauthen, whose mother had prepared for their return to their Winston-Salem home.","State prosecutors filed a petition this week asking the North Carolina Supreme Court to review a judge’s order exonerating four men convicted as teenagers of murdering NBA star Chris Paul’s grandfather.

Prosecutors concede they are asking the state’s highest court to do something out of the ordinary in bypassing the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which initially hears the majority of criminal appeals. Death penalty cases are the only ones that are appealed directly to the state Supreme Court.

But Heidi M. Williams, special deputy attorney general, said the case demands immediate review by the state Supreme Court for several reasons, including the high-profile nature of the case and because it involves “legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the state.”

Williams argues that any “delay in final adjudication poses a risk of substantial harm” and that the appeal is “important in overseeing the integrity of the court system.”

Two decades ago, five teenagers—Nathaniel Cauthen, Rayshawn Banner, Christopher Bryant, Jermal Tolliver, and the late Dorrell Brayboy—were convicted in two separate trials of murdering 61-year-old Nathaniel Jones, who was believed to have been the proprietor of the first Black-owned service station in North Carolina. Winston-Salem police said Jones was attacked soon after he arrived at his East Winston-Salem home on November 15, 2002, beaten in the head and face, and left to die of a cardiac arrhythmia. Jones was found lying face-down in his carport near his Lincoln Town Car. His hands were tied behind his back with black tape, and his mouth was taped shut. His wallet was missing.

Five days later, Paul, a high school senior who had just signed to play basketball at Wake Forest University, scored 61 points in his grandfather’s honor. The moment catapulted the teenager into the national limelight. Paul went on to play for several NBA teams, most recently the Los Angeles Clippers.

The men have long maintained their innocence, alleging that police used harsh interrogation techniques to coerce them into making false confessions. No definitive physical evidence, including fingerprints, tied them to the crime scene. New questions were raised after the N.C. Innocence Inquiry Commission started investigating and discovered that the key witness, Jessicah Black, recanted. The commission also ordered DNA testing on some of the physical evidence in the case, which found none of the DNA matched the five men or Black.

Black’s recantation partially led Superior Court Judge Robert Broadie to issue a 33-page ruling exonerating the four living men (Brayboy was murdered a year after his release from prison) and dismissing charges against them with prejudice last August. That meant they could not be retried and made prosecutors’ ability to appeal Broadie’s ruling more difficult.

But within hours, prosecutors sought to appeal. They also asked the Court of Appeals to temporarily prevent Cauthen and Banner, who are serving life sentences for first-degree murder, from being released. The court granted the temporary stay but denied a more permanent stay in September, saying that prosecutors had not “meritoriously” argued that any errors existed in Broadie’s ruling and had “failed to articulate a clear right to appeal.”

State prosecutors appealed to the state Supreme Court, which blocked the brothers’ release.

This latest move comes after attorneys for the men sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Jackson on October 6, saying all four men would agree to be retried in exchange for Banner and Cauthen being released on bond. The attorney general’s office declined the offer on November 24, saying it needed Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill to agree.

If prosecutors retried the case, they’d likely have difficulty securing a conviction. The defense has new evidence about the men’s intellectual disabilities at the time they were interrogated. Their statements at the time of their arrest, which were inconsistent with each other and with the physical evidence, would likely be suppressed. And without Black’s original testimony, there are no eyewitnesses who could testify they saw the five teenagers at Jones’ house the night he died.

Prosecutors also would have no clear right to appeal to the state Supreme Court if they lost at the Court of Appeals. It is a possibility that Williams alludes to in her petition: “The State recognizes, however, that if the trial court’s order is affirmed on appeal, Defendants are entitled by the terms of that order to have their convictions vacated and, in the cases of Defendants Banner and Cauthen, to unconditional release from prison.”

Christine Mumma, the attorney representing Banner and Cauthen, said state prosecutors are trying to bypass the Court of Appeals because they will likely lose there and won’t have a chance to have the top court review the case.

Polestar's Sales Growth and Market Strategy

STOCKHOLM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - EV maker Polestar reported a sharp rise in fourth‑quarter vehicle sales on Friday, helped by its recent strategy of focusing on Europe.

Sales Performance Overview

The company's sales rose 27% to 15,608 vehicles sold in the fourth quarter. It sold 60,119 cars throughout the year.

Challenges in the U.S. Market

Over the last year, Polestar has increasingly leaned on Europe, which now accounts for around 78% of its sales, as demand in the U.S. softened because of tariffs, the expiry of EV tax credits and intensifying competition.

Financial Support from Geely

Polestar has also scaled back its emphasis on online, direct‑to‑consumer sales in favor of a traditional dealer‑led model, expanding its sales network, although the company shut all of its 30 retail sites in China.

Future Plans and Product Updates

U.S. tariffs have hurt the carmaker's margins, forcing it to rejig supply chains and shift production to Europe.

""For retail sales volumes, 2025 has been the best year ever for Polestar, despite continued external headwinds and challenging market conditions,"" said Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller.

High debt loads, persistent losses, and financial difficulties have also led to a weak share price, prompting the company to avoid a NASDAQ delisting by conducting a reverse stock split, mechanically lifting the price from below $1 to $18.

Polestar has relied heavily on Chinese carmaker and majority-owner Geely Holding to help fund its loss-making operations. In December, it got up to $900 million in fresh financing and loan deals made with Geely and two European banks.

Like Swedish automaker Volvo Cars that is also owned by Geely, Polestar increasingly depends on the Chinese group's platforms and supply chain to cut costs, reduce development spending and improve efficiency.

Polestar said it plans to provide key product updates and financial outlook on February 18.

That sounds like a silly thing to say, but what it means is that what the entire economy of China is set up to do — scale up high-tech manufacturing businesses — is something that only one man in America knows how to do. Only Elon has built China-like manufacturing businesses in America, and he has done it twice now — SpaceX and Tesla. When something like that happens twice, it wasn’t a coincidence.

Just to give you an example of how important this is, note that without SpaceX, China would be leaving America in the dust when it comes to space launches. But with SpaceX, it’s America leaving China in the dust:

One implication of this is that America needs to make it a lot easier to set up and scale a manufacturing business, so that our entire high-tech manufacturing sector isn’t dependent on one slightly kooky right-wing billionaire. But that’s a topic for another post.

A second implication is that if we want to know about the future of physical technology, we should listen to Elon Musk. In fact, Elon has a great track record of seeing and entering manufacturing industries that China zeroes in on later:

This is a good list, but it omits the most important items. The three industries that Elon zeroed in on very early, which made him much of his fortune — and which China has subsequently gone all-in on — are batteries, electric vehicles, and solar power. In fact, he still thinks these technologies are some of the most important in the world. In a recent interview, Elon said:

It seems like China listens to everything I say, and does it basically— or they’re just doing it independently. I don’t know, but they certainly have a massive battery pack output, they’re making a vast number of electric cars, and [a] vast amount of solar…

These are all the things I said we should do here [in America].

Elon didn’t go for batteries, EVs, and solar power because he was a climate-obsessed liberal; he correctly understood that there was a revolution underway in the technologies that humans use to produce, store, transport, and harness energy. He knew that whoever mastered that technological revolution would attain a dominant position in a bunch of different, seemingly unrelated industries.

In other words, Elon understood — and still understands — the importance of the Electric Tech Stack.

I’ve written a lot about electric technology, and why it’s the key to the future of every nation and every industry on Earth. In a post back in 2024, I argued that what we’re seeing is a wholesale shift away from combustion, toward technologies that harness electricity directly:

For a more in-depth explanation, I strongly recommend this very long post by Packy McCormick and Sam D’Amico:

Basically, electricity is more controllable than combustion; pushing electrons through a wire simply offers you much finer control over where the energy goes than blowing up hot gases to turn some gears. For a long time, electric technology was limited by low energy density, low power density, and weak magnetic field strengths — combustion gave us the oomph that electricity just couldn’t give us.

But then in the late 20th century, we invented three things that utterly changed the game. These three inventions were the lithium-ion battery, the rare-earth electric motor, and power electronics. A little over a year ago, I wrote a post about why these three inventions were such game-changers:

Basically, these three things allow electric motors to replace combustion engines (and steam boilers) over a wide variety of applications. Batteries make it possible to store and transport electrical energy very compactly and extract that energy very quickly. Rare-earth motors make it possible to use electrical energy to create very strong torques — for example, the torque that turns the axles of a Tesla. And power electronics make it possible to exert fine control over large amounts of electric power — stopping and starting it, rerouting it, repurposing it for different uses, and so on.

With these three technologies, combustion’s main advantages vanish in many domains. Whether it’s cars, drones, robots, or household appliances, electric technology now has both the power and the portability that only combustion technology used to enjoy.

Elon Musk understood this decades before people like me ever did, which is why he entered the electric car business very early. And over time, Elon’s vision for the car industry has increasingly been proven correct. Sales of internal combustion cars peaked almost a decade ago and have been declining ever since, while sales of electric cars have only grown:

This shift isn’t just being driven by Europe subsidizing EVs at the urging of climate activists, nor by China incentivizing its citizens to buy its companies’ cars. Much of the world, from Asia to Latin America, is beginning to make the switch:

As of 2025, more than a quarter of total global car sales were EVs.

This shift is likely to accelerate rather than slow down. As I wrote back in 2024, now that the basic problems of energy density, power density, and torque have been solved, EVs are simply a superior technology:

They have many fewer moving parts, meaning they’re a lot easier and cheaper to maintain. They’re a lot more energy-efficient. You can charge them at night at your house, meaning you rarely have to go to a charging station. They’re quieter, and they have faster acceleration. There are a number of popular arguments against EVs, and all of those arguments are wrong — EVs now have very long range, EV batteries last for many years, charging stations can charge your car very quickly, there are plenty of minerals to give everyone in the world an EV, batteries are easy to recycle, and so on.

EVs are going to win, and there will be a tipping point — different in each country — where the whole market just flips from combustion to electric. One reason that tipping point comes very fast is that gas stations have a network effect — when enough consumers switch to EVs, there aren’t enough gasoline-powered cars on the road to make gas stations profitable, so they start closing down, which makes EVs even more attractive.

Elon Musk understood all this long ago, and it made him the world’s richest man. China caught on a little bit later, and now dominates global auto exports as a result. Europe is starting to understand it as well.

But apart from Elon, the rest of America doesn’t yet understand it. The Trump administration has canceled subsidies for electric vehicles, and most of the U.S. auto industry (except for Tesla) is shifting away from EVs:

U.S. automakers are shifting production from electric vehicles to gas-powered vehicles and are reducing spending, laying off workers, and repurposing EV battery plants to energy storage plants due to reduced consumer interest in electric vehicles and fewer government incentives…The Trump administration rolled back financial incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles…and is modifying automobile efficiency standards…to eliminate the requirement for EV purchases…

Ford is writing down $19.5 billion, with additional EV losses of $13 billion since 2023. The EV transition has cost the company $32.5 billion. Ford plans to switch production at a new factory in Tennessee to gas-powered pickup truck models from electric models, cancel an electric commercial van model, remake the F-150 Lightning vehicle into a hybrid from a pure electric vehicle, and convert its Kentucky EV-battery factory into a battery-storage business for utilities, wind- and solar-power developers, and AI data centers.

The main reason America is missing the EV transition is that we’ve insisted on thinking of EVs in terms of climate — as a “green” technology whose purpose is to save the environment, rather than a superior technology whose purpose is to save you time and money. Trump canceled EV subsidies because he associates them with the environmental movement and the political left.

American consumers are avoiding EVs because of this, and also because of a lack of charging stations. The Biden administration promised to build a vast network of EV charging stations, but managed to build almost zero, largely because the initiative was larded up with unrelated contracting requirements. So many Americans still think they won’t be able to charge their EV on a long trip, and are sticking with gas cars as a result.

The ramifications of this failure will go far beyond the auto market. The reason is that the components that go into making EVs — the batteries, the motor, and the electronics — are increasingly the same components that go into making a vast array of other high-tech products. I have a video interview with Sam D’Amico where he explains this, and Sam’s long post with Packy McCormick also explains it in detail. But for a shorter explanation, let me recommend this recent post by Ryan McEntush of a16z:

Ryan explains that when the components that go into electronics are the same as the components that go into cars, drones, robots and tons of other stuff. This allows Chinese manufacturers like BYD and Xiaomi to leverage truly awesome economies of scale:

Once [the iPhone] existed, everything else started to look the same. Your laptop, smart TV, thermostat, doorbell camera, refrigerator, industrial robot, drone: all of them follow the same basic recipe. Even an electric vehicle, once you peel back the sheet metal, relies on the same ingredients — batteries, sensors, motors, compute, and software, just in a different skin. We no longer live among truly distinct technological paradigms, but within a world of variations on one single idea: the smartphone, endlessly turned inside and out and scaled across every domain. Everything is a smartphone…

Consumer electronics is about scale…Unlike legacy internal-combustion vehicles, electric vehicles draw heavily on components and device primitives shared across many other industries…Much of today’s most important technology rests, almost inadvertently, on the foundations built by [the consumer electronics] ecosystem…An electric vehicle is a smartphone with wheels. A drone is a smartphone with propellers. A robot is a smartphone that moves…

BYD, the global leader in batteries, builds cars, buses, ships, and trains. DJI makes drones, but also cameras, radios, and robotics hardware. Even Dreame, a Chinese vacuum company, just debuted an electric supercar. These firms are not “diversifying” in the traditional sense. Rather, they are…repeatedly assembling the same electro-industrial stack — batteries, power electronics, motors, compute, and sensors — into new permutations.

This means that China’s Everything Makers can make not just cars and electronics more cheaply than America can, but almost everything else as well — because almost everything is being eaten by the Electric Tech Stack. Even the software industry is being eaten by the Electric Tech Stack — AI is eating software, and AI requires huge amounts of electric power and battery stabilization in order to run its data centers.

Currently, China generates much more electricity than the U.S. does — partly because it’s willing to build out solar power, where in the U.S. solar is often blocked by local NIMBYs, “environmental” permitting laws, and a hostile Trump administration. But China also builds most of the world’s batteries, meaning that American AI is going to be dependent on Chinese batteries as well.

On top of all that, America desperately needs the Electric Tech Stack for its national defense. I pointed this out in a post back in September, and Ryan talks about it a lot as well. Drones are taking over the modern battlefield, and drones require batteries and rare-earth electric motors — the same components that go into the EVs that America is now refusing to build.

Thus, America’s weakness in EVs, batteries, and rare earths threatens to become a weakness in everything — a weakness in AI, a weakness in drones, a weakness in robots, and so on. Because we collectively decided that EVs are hippie-dippy climate bullshit, we ignored the key physical technologies that increasingly underlie all of manufacturing, including defense manufacturing.

Throughout America’s history, we have been at or near the forefront of every single major technological revolution. We were leaders in railroads, mechanized agriculture, industrial chemistry, electricity, mass production, internal combustion/automobiles, aviation, plastics/polymers, nuclear, space, telecommunications/TV, genetics, semiconductors, computing, the internet, mobile, and AI. This technological leadership enabled us to remain the world’s leading nation for over a century.

But now we are missing the big one. We are missing the Electric Tech Stack. We treated it as a climate issue instead of an issue of raw national power and industrial might, and we allowed it to become a political football. As a result, China is mastering this crucial technological revolution, and America is forfeiting it. Our entire existence as a leading nation is under threat from this remarkable failure of vision and leadership.

We should have listened to Elon Musk about the importance of the Electric Tech Stack. We should still listen to him now.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KwNT!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e42627c-73f9-444e-a7f5-bd6e25f1ef68_980x653.jpeg",N,,2026-01-09 11:04:04.065850

Our industry-leading data centers are the backbone of these breakthroughs — they provide the infrastructure that drives innovation and brings transformative technologies to life. Innovation at this scale requires more electricity, and that’s where nuclear energy comes in. It provides clean, reliable, and firm electricity that helps power America’s economy and communities.

That’s why today, we’re proud to announce agreements with three companies — following our nuclear RFP process — that will help add clean, reliable energy to electric grids, preserve continued investment in operating nuclear power plants, and support the nuclear fuel supply chain, American jobs, and AI innovation.

Our commitments to Oklo and TerraPower support the next generation of American developers creating safer, advanced nuclear reactors and accelerating the development of nuclear technologies. Through our partnership with Vistra, we’re providing financial support for operating nuclear power plants, extending the operational lifespan, and increasing energy production at the Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. The projects we’re announcing today will deliver power to the grids that support our operations, including our Prometheus supercluster in New Albany, Ohio.

These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW of new and existing clean energy by 2035. Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.

This work builds on our ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational. We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.

Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology

As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.

These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.

TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology

Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium® units capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.

“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”

Oklo: Adding New Nuclear Energy in Ohio

Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.

This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. Oklo Aurora powerhouses are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.

“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio.”

Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy

Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our first nuclear energy agreement helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.

Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.

Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.

“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”

The company reached an agreement with the New Mexico Economic Development Department to build the new facility in Santa Teresa, and will receive support from a number of state policies to assist in the construction of the facility.

These include US$5 million through the Local Economic Development Act (LEDA), which provides grants to “stimulate economic development and produce public benefits”, and US$4.6 million through the Job Training Incentive Program (JTIP), which reimburses up to 90% of employee wages for classroom and on-the-job training for up to six months.

GreenPower will also benefit from over US$5 million in tax credits through the state’s Rural Jobs Tax Credit (RJTC) and High-Wage Jobs Tax Credit programmes. The company noted that further legislative support, namely the designation of Santa Teresa as a “foreign trade zone”, which grants access to “streamlined customs and cost-effective trade”, was an important motivating factor in deciding where to build the facility.

IRVING, Texas, Jan. 9, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Vistra (NYSE: VST) today announced it has entered into 20-year PPAs to provide more than 2,600 megawatts of zero-carbon energy from a combination of three different Vistra nuclear plants to support Meta's operations in the region. The agreements include 2,176 MW of operating generation and an additional 433 MW of combined power output increases, which will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the United States. The agreements will also grow the local tax base, foster economic development in the region, and protect existing jobs while creating new ones. With today's announcement, Vistra will now begin planning for subsequent license extensions at all three plants, which would extend operations of these carbon-free assets for another 20 years.

""This is a unique and exciting collaboration, and Vistra is proud to partner with Meta on these long-term power purchase agreements, which ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of Vistra's Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse, and Perry nuclear power plants for decades to come while providing a competitive solution for our customer to support its sustainable operations,"" said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. ""Importantly, this commitment from Meta provides Vistra the certainty needed to invest in these plants and communities and bring new nuclear generation online for the grid – through uprates at our existing plants.""

""At Meta, we are investing in nuclear energy because it provides clean, reliable power that is essential for advancing our AI ambitions and strengthening American leadership in energy innovation. By supporting nuclear power, we ensure that our operations – and the communities we serve – benefit from energy solutions that drive both technological progress and economic growth,"" said Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta.

Through the agreements:

Meta is purchasing 2,176 MW of nuclear energy and capacity from the operating Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio;

Meta is also purchasing 433 MW of incremental nuclear energy and capacity from equipment upgrades to increase generation output (called uprates) at the Perry (Ohio), Davis-Besse (Ohio), and Beaver Valley (Pennsylvania) plants – more than 15% of the contracted capacity announced today will be new capacity added to the PJM region;

the electricity generated at the plants will continue to go to the grid for all electricity users.

""As recently as 2020, before Vistra owned Perry, Davis-Besse, and Beaver Valley, these plants were on a path to retirement,"" said Stacey Doré, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of Vistra. ""When we signed a deal to acquire these plants in 2023, Vistra saw their tremendous contribution – to the reliability of the grid, to the stability of the region, to their local communities, and to the people who work there. Fast-forward to today and we're investing in expanding these same plants, and thanks to our dedicated employees and a committed partner like Meta, this fleet will continue to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to power the grid of the future.""

Meta's purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034, when the full 2,609 MW of power will be online.

Each of the three plants has received initial license renewal from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The PPAs provide certainty for Vistra to pursue subsequent license renewal for each of the reactors, which would extend each license an additional 20 years. Currently, Beaver Valley Unit 1 is licensed through 2036; Davis-Besse is licensed through 2037; Perry is licensed through 2046; and Beaver Valley Unit 2 is licensed through 2047.

Economic Engine for Local Economies

Vistra's nuclear plants have been significant contributors to local economies since their construction. The PPAs continue that commitment, including tens of millions of dollars in state and local taxes each year, substantial charitable giving, community involvement, and volunteerism by the company and its employees.

These three plants provide thousands of permanent, well-paying jobs. Over the life of the uprate projects, which span approximately nine years, approximately 3,000 project-related jobs across engineering, construction, and planned outage work are expected, adding to the economic impact around these plants.

Support for Today's Announcement

""Bringing new nuclear generation online is key to Ohio and our nation's growth and security, and Vistra's significant investment is a huge win for Ohio,"" said U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio).

Rather than increasing electricity prices, new data center projects present an opportunity to lower prices — if handled the right way.
Meta’s investment also provides Entergy with more resources to strengthen the grid against storms at a lower cost to current customers.","At Power for Tomorrow, we track how U.S. utilities adapt to challenges like artificial intelligence and data centers — sharing what works to keep power reliable and affordable. That’s why we’re closely watching the emerging data center hub in the Gulf South, including Louisiana, where Meta is building what may become the world’s largest AI facility in Richland Parish.

Louisiana securing the historic Meta project wasn’t luck — it was leadership. State officials saw the opportunity and worked across party lines to solve a tough problem: how to power massive data centers without raising rates or hurting reliability. Louisiana figured it out — and proved that smart growth can benefit everyone.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, “When people say, ‘AI is going to drive up my price of electricity,’ it’s actually the opposite. The way to get electricity prices down is to produce more electricity.”

The Trump appointee has emphasized that building new infrastructure to support data centers and manufacturing will ultimately lower average electricity prices. In fact, one of the nation’s leading science labs — the same one that Congress selected last year to prepare a report on data center energy usage — recently identified that, in many instances, large customers like data centers can help stabilize or even lower electric bills for homes and small businesses.

In October, The Washington Post published an article titled “There's a reason electricity prices are rising. And it's not data centers,” which noted that the recent trend in the national conversation of making data centers the scapegoat for rising electricity prices simply doesn’t hold up when you examine the facts. The article pointed out that “the biggest factors behind rising rates were the cost of poles, wires and other electrical equipment — as well as the cost of safeguarding that infrastructure against future disasters.”

The article goes on to explain that electricity markets don’t follow the typical economic model where more demand tends to result in higher prices — on the contrary, electrical utilities operate on an economy of scale, where more customers mean more ways to spread out the impact of fixed system costs, like physical infrastructure. Rather than increasing electricity prices, new data center projects present an opportunity to lower prices — if handled the right way.

The key is to ensure that these giant customers are paying their way and that the cost of their growth isn’t being passed on to other customers’ bills. That’s where Louisiana is getting it right: The utility powering Meta’s Richland Parish data center, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission built safeguards into Meta’s agreement so other customers don’t foot the bill. In fact, many grid upgrades tied to the project will benefit all customers — at no extra cost.

For example, to meet the data center’s needs without straining the state’s grid, Meta is funding three new Entergy power plants. These modern, more fuel-efficient facilities will serve all Entergy customers and save them money on bills by producing more power at lower cost for decades.

Meta’s investment also provides Entergy with more resources to strengthen the grid against storms at a lower cost to current customers. That means fewer outages and real bill savings, including reducing what other customers pay for grid upgrades and future storm repairs by 10%. All told, Meta’s participation in the Entergy Louisiana grid is projected to save other customers upward of $650 million over their 15-year agreement.

Louisiana is proving that data centers don’t have to mean higher power bills for residents. On the contrary, strategic infrastructure investments tied to industrial growth can be used to improve grid reliability, boost economic growth and lower costs for everyone.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/7f/f7f43957-a6f2-5120-8da2-19d0d48e2a6f/685ef5ffe1e0c.image.jpg?crop=1467%2C770%2C0%2C321&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-09 08:00:40.056772

Environmental advocates say they are concerned many of the EPA’s rollbacks will jeopardize the health of Hoosiers who live in a state that already has a precarious relationship with environmental health.
“The strategy is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts kind of approach,” said Gabriel Filippelli, a biochemist and the executive director of the Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute.
In August the EPA issued interim final rules to delay complying with the previous administration’s pollution standards until 2027.
Cuts to EPA affect Indiana In May President Donald Trump announced his intention to cut the EPA budget by 55%.","The EPA under President Donald Trump has rolled back several rules initially designed to protect the environment and people's health.

While these changes will impact the country as a whole, the effect here in Indiana could be particularly acute, environmentalists say.

The changes apply to a number of industries, including automotive, power plants and coal and gas.

The Trump administration has steered the federal agency tasked with protecting human health and the environment in an unusual direction over the last 12 months: The Environmental Protection Agency has deregulated and delayed swaths of industrial rules designed to protect the environment and human health, reversed course on climate policy and axed much of its own research arm.

The effect on Indiana will be acute, environmental advocates say. Environmental advocates say they are concerned many of the EPA’s rollbacks will jeopardize the health of Hoosiers who live in a state that already has a precarious relationship with environmental health. Many of the state's largest polluters such as coal plants, chemical factories and steel mills have received exemptions from the federal government this year.

In a 2025 U.S. News report, Indiana ranked last in the ""natural environment"" category, which ranks states based on air and water quality as well as pollution threats. The report cited the state’s nearly 3,000 pounds of industrial toxins per square mile — the national average is closer to 900.

The state also has an above average number of polluted waterways and more coal ash ponds — small, toxic water bodies near coal plants where poisonous refuse is discarded — than any other state.

On March 12, 2025, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced the rollback of 31 different policies, calling regulations like those designed to regulate hazardous air pollutants “suffocating.”

""Today, the green new scam ends as the EPA does its part to usher in the golden age of American success,” Zeldin said in a press video. “President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living. We at EPA will do our part to power the great American comeback.”

Zeldin’s positioning the EPA to lower the cost of fossil fuel production and promote industry is a new look for the agency that has historically been tasked with protecting environmental health. And as the federal agency rolls back and deregulates one policy at a time, scientists say it's difficult to get the complete picture of the impact on human and environmental health outcomes, making it trickier to fight back.

“The strategy is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts kind of approach,” said Gabriel Filippelli, a biochemist and the executive director of the Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute.

By sawing off small policies here and big policies there, he said, the EPA is minimizing the appearance of the environmental regulation overhaul, but the intent is “actually a very, very concerted plan to eliminate all of them.”

Fighting such changes in court also becomes more difficult, he said.

“You can’t just have one lawsuit, you are actually having to fight against 20 different policy changes at the same time,” Filippelli said. “It just overwhelms the ability of the normal checks and balances.”

The EPA has the ability to repeal and amend its own regulations. It's this process that local environmental advocates are worried about.

Here are some of the EPA's changes from the last year that could have the greatest impact on Indiana.

Unraveling climate change policies

In late July, Zeldin and U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced perhaps the most consequential of EPA rollbacks.

Speaking at an Indianapolis auto dealership alongside Gov. Mike Braun and Indiana Energy Secretary Suzanne Jaworowski, Zeldin said he intended to repeal air pollution guidance. This so-called ""endangerment finding"" has set the stage for greenhouse gas standards and regulations since 2009.

Zeldin said that if the finding successfully makes it through the agency's repeal process and is revoked, it would “be the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

After a years-long legal battle ending at the Supreme Court, the endangerment finding gave the EPA the authority to manage six greenhouse gases as threats to human health. The finding led to several regulations on vehicles, power plants and the oil and gas industry — policies Zeldin said he would also like to undo.

Repealing this could exacerbate the negative effects of climate change, endanger public health and potentially slow the economy, local environmental advocates told IndyStar in July.

Rep. Sue Errington, D-Muncie, the ranking minority member of the House Environmental Affair Committee, said that summers in Indiana are already “hotter, longer and more dangerous than they were a decade ago."" Eliminating greenhouse gas standards, she added, will accelerate climate change and harm public health.

The EPA has also proposed eliminating the ""burdensome"" Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, enacted in 2008. In a Sept. 12 news release, the agency said that clawing back the program would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs.

The program requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers across the United States to record and submit their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA each year. The EPA proposed to remove all of these requirements.

Janet McCabe, a former EPA deputy under President Joe Biden and current visiting professor at Indiana University, recognized it might not seem like eliminating a recording program would increase emissions. But, McCabe said, it actually does.

""Reporting programs are often the first step to people recognizing what they emit, how much they emit, and realizing that there are ways that they can emit less,"" she said. ""It's very well in ingrained into how people do business, and it's hugely helpful to the country understanding and the industries themselves understanding and the public understanding where we are in terms of emissions.""

Delays, delays, delays

The EPA under Biden worked to reduce pollution across the United States with a series of regulations, but over the past year Trump's EPA has given companies more time to comply with those policies.

In some of these cases, McCabe said, it seems like the EPA is giving companies extensions to meet pollution standards because they plan to eventually rescind the Biden-era rules.

""He's telling industry, 'You don't need to comply with this because we're going to change it anyway,'"" she said.

In Gary, Indiana, this delay means that residents living near the steel industry will continue to deal with dirty air.

In August the EPA issued interim final rules to delay complying with the previous administration’s pollution standards until 2027. Interim rules are typically used to address natural disasters or public health emergencies, not to provide industry with more time to comply.

The EPA issued a report saying the timeline the Biden Administration had set was too short and would cost too much for the industry.

The delay could have long-term health impacts, especially for young children who live near these polluters, Annie Fox, a law clerk with the Clean Air Council, told IndyStar in September. Clean Air Council is one of many environmental organizations suing the EPA over the interim rules.

The Biden EPA also updated a series of hazardous air pollution rules for multiple manufacturing sectors, giving facilities a deadline to meet compliance. In 2025, Trump issued a series of executive orders, giving these facilities ""regulatory relief"" by extending the deadlines in an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on “foreign control over materials critical to national resilience.” The targeted industries include energy, national defense, agriculture and health care.

Two Indiana facilities received extensions: the chemical manufacturing plant SABIC Innovative Plastics in Mount Vernon and Cook Medical's medical equipment sterilization facility in Ellettsville. EPA previously listed both plants as high-risk to human health after considering the amount of chemicals released on site.

Cuts to EPA affect Indiana

In May President Donald Trump announced his intention to cut the EPA budget by 55%. Later that month Zeldin announced further agency budget reductions, totaling $300 million.

Zeldin said in a written statement in July that the cuts would save the U.S. $748.8 million and help the EPA become “responsible stewards of [American’s] hard-earned tax dollars.”

One $130 million program on the chopping block called Solar for All aimed to help nearly 7,000 low-income Hoosiers lower electric bills and reduce their homes’ reliance on fossil fuels for energy.

Indiana’s program director for Solar United Neighbor Zach Schalk called the cut a “huge gut punch” in an August IndyStar interview.

In a written statement Zeldin said spending money on programs such as Solar for All were like “throwing gold bars off the Titanic” and the EPA under him and Trump would not condone “frivolous spending in the name of ‘climate equity.’”

Hoosiers adapt to changing priorities

In November, the EPA announced plans to redefine ""Waters of the United States"", which could leave Indiana's dwindling wetland habitats with even fewer protections. The EPA is also greenlighting pesticides that contain chemicals environmental advocates worry contain PFAS, commonly known as ""forever chemicals."" In addition, the agency is trying to loosen regulations that control heavy metal emissions, like mercury, from some coal and oil-fired electric plants, and has begun to remove the term climate change from certain webpages.

Filippelli said he's concerned about the future of health and the environment in Indiana and the country oversall.

""We already have a lot of environmental burdens,"" Filippelli said, referencing the state's poor air quality and the high number of Superfund sites across the state. ""All of that just leads us to be particularly vulnerable when they start relaxing some of these protections that have been very hard fought.""

Despite the federal government's disinvestment in renewable energy and environmental protections this past year, Filippelli said he still hears from communities across Indiana who have an appetite for a clean, healthier future; many Hoosiers still want an electric vehicle or solar on their property. Funding is often the issue.

Filippelli said people are finding clever ways to navigate state level funding and local philanthropies will still finance some projects, but much of the Biden-era federal funding for such initiatives is gone.

""Certainly these transitions that people were hoping to see happen really quickly are much slower now, there's no greenwashing that. We're stepping backwards,"" Filippelli said. ""But community appetite is still there and we are committed to serving that appetite with good solutions.""

Row crop farmers in the Midwest and Great Plains have a better idea of how much money they can expect from one-time federal aid payments announced last month.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently released per-acre rates for 20 crops included in the $11 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance Program. The dollars aim to help farmers impacted by tariffs, high production costs and low crop prices until stronger farm safety nets go into effect in October.

“President Trump committed to increase certainty in the farm economy, and farmers can count on these payment rate calculations when going to the bank as they plan for the spring planting season,” Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins stated. “Farmers who qualify for the FBA Program can expect payments in their bank accounts by February 28.”

Details have not been released for an additional $1 billion allocated for specialty crops and sugar.

The USDA based its “bridge” payment rates on the number of acres planted in 2025, along with estimated production costs and losses.

An analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation projected payments at the state level will be highest in Texas at $1.1 billion, followed by Iowa, Kansas and Illinois. Corn, soybeans and wheat are expected to account for over three-quarters of the program dollars.

DeDe Jones, a risk management economist for the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service in the Amarillo District, said the grain and cotton farmers she works with are struggling. Many are entering the 2026 growing season with high interest rates, high input costs, low crop prices and significant amounts of debt.

“This bridge of assistance will definitely provide some relief, both to the farmer and then also to the lender, and some reassurance that they will be able to pay off some of that carryover debt and continue to farm for another year,” Jones said. “It is nowhere near enough to cover all their losses that they've dealt with in the last couple of years, but anything helps.”

Over half of the farmers surveyed by the Purdue/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer this fall said they would use potential government aid to pay down debt.

Nicholas Paulson, professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program is designed to distribute financial aid quickly. The tradeoff is that payment rates, based on national averages, may not reflect the financial realities for individual farms.

“There will be farms where the bridge payments are maybe more than sufficient to cover the financial stress that they're experiencing on their own farm. There will be farms where the bridge payment is insufficient to cover it,” Paulson said. “It will be helpful, but it won't completely cover the losses that they're experiencing in the 2025 crop year.”

For example, he said soybean yields in southern Illinois were much lower last year than in the central and northern parts of the state.

Paulson and his colleagues estimate the average returns for southern Illinois soybean farmers will remain in the red, even with the bridge payment, commodity programs and crop insurance. But soybean farmers in central and northern Illinois are more likely to break even or come out ahead.

Factors contributing to a bleak farm economy

Production costs were more than 50% higher in October 2025 compared to 2011, while the prices farmers received were roughly 21% higher, Investigate Midwest reports. That’s created one of the widest gaps in a decade between what farmers are paying and what they earn.

Over the past five years, fertilizer, labor and interest expenses have risen 37%, 47% and 73%, respectively.

High corn and soybean prices in 2021 and 2022 – in part due to China rebuilding its swine herd, global market disruptions from the Ukraine-Russia war and lower yields in the U.S., Brazil and Argentina – helped offset higher production costs. But then prices fell as supply and demand shifted again.

“We have had some really, really good growing seasons, especially with the grain crops,” Jones said. “When you have these bumper yields … then we're going to need not just average demand, but better than average demand to offset that supply and keep those prices high, and we just don't have that.”

Trade disruptions in 2025 decreased demand and contributed to an oversupply of some U.S. commodities, said Chad Hart, an agriculture economics professor at Iowa State University. Cotton, rice and soybeans experienced more significant market impacts due to retaliatory tariffs compared to corn and wheat, he said.

“Even though there's been a lot of discussion of deals with China, and we have seen some sales coming in … soybean trade is still lagging behind where it usually is,” Hart said.

Reactions from national soy, corn associations

After the USDA released its payment rates, the American Soybean Association said in a news release that it “appreciates the administration’s focus on the economic downturn in the U.S. agricultural industry” but the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program “falls short.” The association pointed to damage caused by the trade war with China.

“Due to significant trade losses this year, the payment rate for soybeans will likely not be enough for soybean farmers to keep their operations financially solvent as we move into the next planting season,” the group’s president Scott Metzger said in the release.

Metzger urged the administration to strengthen domestic markets for soybeans, in part by incentivizing soy-based biofuels through the 2026-2027 Renewable Volume Obligations and finalizing rules for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

The National Corn Growers Association also called for more long-term solutions.

“Corn growers have been sounding the alarm about the fact that farmers have been faced with multiple consecutive years of low corn prices and high input costs,” President Jed Bower said in a news release. “We urgently need the administration and Congress to develop markets in the United States and abroad that will provide growers with more long-term economic certainty.”

Ad hoc assistance

The Farmer Bridge Assistance Program comes on the heels of other economic aid.

In December 2024, Congress passed legislation allocating $20 billion for producers impacted by natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 and $10 billion to offset economic losses from low crop prices and high production costs.

The Farmer Bridge Assistance Program and its payment rates largely mirror the last economic aid program.

Paulson described the ad hoc assistance programs as Band-Aids to the challenges row crop producers are facing.

“Prices for most row crops have not significantly improved from what farmers are currently dealing with for their 2025 crop, and we don’t see production costs declining to the extent needed to get farmers back into the black,” Paulson said.

Half of the participants in the December Ag Economists’ Monthly Monitor expect the farm economy to stay the same over the next year. Nearly 40% predicted improvement while 15% expect conditions to worsen.

In the coming months, Hart said he’ll closely watch what happens with China and other countries that have agreed to buy more U.S. agriculture products, especially soybeans and cotton.

“That's going to influence whether these payments can truly be that one time bridge or whether that bridge will need another extension,” Hart said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7471bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1700x893+0+133/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fd4%2F821c4ea84cd993bef8aab34e7801%2Ffarming-harvest-agriculture-fall-4.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:02:44.981889

“Families shouldn’t have to choose between paying their utility bill or putting food on the table,” Grasse said. “I’m pleased we got this measure to the governor’s desk quickly, so families can start seeing dollars back on their bill as early as this month.”

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket due to increased power demand and Washington’s massive tax bill—resulting in $9.5 billion in increased state energy costs.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) puts Illinois on better footing to counteract rising energy prices, both immediately and in the long-term, by:

Capturing clean energy: By capturing and redistributing energy already being produced, including from home solar panels, Ameren and ComEd customers can see immediate relief on monthly costs.

Increasing battery storage: By building out our grid to increase the state’s battery storage, power systems will become more reliable and affordable to power millions of Illinois homes.

Investing in energy efficiency programs: Senate Bill 25 directly expands energy efficiency programs for residents and improves equity by allocating a minimum amount of funds to support low-income customers.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill— including over 50,000 lost manufacturing jobs in Illinois.

“This legislation further cements Illinois’ status as a national leader in clean energy initiatives,” Grasse said. “When we can take steps to cut costs for consumers, boost our state’s manufacturing industry and extend a huge favor for our planet, it’s a win-win-win for all involved.”

Complicating matters further is that the required repairs may not even be feasible to complete within the 90-day window covered by the DOE orders.
“Coal plants — and in particular the plants DOE has targeted — are these clunky old jalopies that, out of nowhere, just fail,” said Michael Lenoff, a senior attorney at nonprofit law firm Earthjustice, one of several environmental groups challenging the must-run orders.
Fixing up coal plants to comply with the DOE mandates could also put utilities in a legal bind.
Some plan to convert the facilities to run on fossil gas, as is the case with the Schahfer plant and the coal plant in Washington state.","The Trump administration’s campaign to force aging coal plants to keep running has entered a new phase: ordering broken-down units to come back online. Repairing those polluting plants could take months and cost tens of millions of dollars — all just to comply with legally questionable stay-open mandates that last only 90 days at a time.

In December, the Department of Energy ordered four coal plants — two in Indiana and one each in Colorado and Washington state — that were set to retire by year’s end to continue generating power for 90 days. Two of them have units that have been out of commission because of mechanical failure: Colorado’s Craig Generating Station Unit 1 has been down for three weeks and Indiana’s R.M. Schahfer Unit 18 has sat idle since July.

This means the utilities that own those plants must now race to bring them into working order, even though they’ve long ago deemed the facilities uneconomical to operate. Customers already grappling with skyrocketing electricity rates are likely to shoulder the costs of fixing and running the equipment. Complicating matters further is that the required repairs may not even be feasible to complete within the 90-day window covered by the DOE orders.

“Coal plants — and in particular the plants DOE has targeted — are these clunky old jalopies that, out of nowhere, just fail,” said Michael Lenoff, a senior attorney at nonprofit law firm Earthjustice, one of several environmental groups challenging the must-run orders. ​“DOE forcing these things to be available, and in some instances to run, actually creates reliability risk to the grid.”

The Trump administration claims that keeping the plants online is the only way to prevent blackouts in the near future. Last month’s must-run orders, as well as earlier ones forcing a Michigan coal plant and an oil- and gas-fired plant in Pennsylvania to stay open, were issued under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which lets the DOE compel power plants to operate to forestall immediate energy emergencies.

Critics say the Trump administration has weaponized this authority to prop up the U.S. coal industry, which provided about half the country’s generation capacity in 2001 but now supplies about 15%. None of the plants that the DOE has forced to stay open is needed for near-term reliability, according to the utilities, state regulators, and regional authorities responsible for maintaining a functioning grid. And despite its claims of an energy crisis, the federal government is throwing up roadblocks to wind, solar, and battery projects that are a fast and cheap way to add electrons to the grid.

The costs of the Trump administration’s coal interventions are mounting. The Sierra Club estimates that the price tag of keeping those six power plants running under the DOE’s orders has added up to more than $158 million as of this week.

And utilities that have to repair units before starting to generate power again will face a new set of costs.

In Indiana, Schahfer’s Unit 18 has been offline since July because of a damaged turbine. Vincent Parisi, president of Northern Indiana Power Service Co., the utility that owns and operates the plant, told Indiana state regulators in December, ​“It can take six months or longer for us to ultimately be able to get that unit back to where it would need to be to operate for an extended period of time.” Parisi did not provide cost estimates for those repairs or for extending operations at the Schahfer plant, and a NIPSCO spokesperson declined to provide an estimate to Canary Media.

In Colorado, Craig Unit 1 has been offline since Dec. 19 because of mechanical failure, according to Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the electric cooperative that operates and holds a partial ownership stake in the plant. ​“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in a December press release. ​“There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”

Tri-State spokesperson Mark Stutz said the co-op and its partners don’t have firm cost estimates for repairs or for compliance with the order, ​“which will likely require additional investments in operations, maintenance, and potentially fuel supply.”

Consultancy Grid Strategies has estimated that keeping Craig 1 running for 90 days would cost at least $20 million, and that running it for a year could add up to $85 million to $150 million. Those costs do not include repairs of the equipment that failed and caused it to go offline.

Fixing up coal plants to comply with the DOE mandates could also put utilities in a legal bind. State attorneys general and environmental groups are already challenging many of the agency’s Section 202(c) orders, saying those orders are based on false premises and violate the law’s strictures for the agency to use its authority only to prevent immediate grid emergencies.

These arguments may soon see their day in federal court. In December, a coalition of environmental groups, including Earthjustice, filed a legal brief with the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the DOE’s use of Section 202(c) authority to force the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan to keep running. The brief asks the court to ​“put an end to the Department’s continued abuse of its authority, which has imposed millions of dollars in unnecessary costs and pollution on residents of Michigan and the Midwest.”

Nor does the DOE have authority to order utilities to undertake repairs or alterations to power plants under Section 202(c), Earthjustice, Sierra Club, and Indiana-based environmental and consumer advocates argued in a December letter to NIPSCO. The groups warned the utility that they plan to legally challenge any repair costs it tries to pass on to customers.

“The authority does not exist within Section 202(c) for DOE to force upgrades or major investments in energy-generating facilities. The authority only extends to operational choices,” said Greg Wannier, senior attorney for the Sierra Club. ​“I do think that at some point, regulated utilities do bear some responsibility for not taking illegal actions to comply with illegal orders.”

NIPSCO spokesperson Joshauna Nash told Canary Media that compliance with the DOE’s order is ​“mandatory.” The utility is ​“carefully reviewing the details of this order to assess its impact on our employees, customers, and company to ensure compliance,” Nash said. ​“While this development alters the timeline for decommissioning this station, our long-term plan to transition to a more sustainable energy future remains unchanged.”

The Trump administration seems set to continue using Section 202(c) authority. The DOE has issued three consecutive 90-day must-run orders for both the J.H. Campbell plant and the Eddystone plant in Pennsylvania. It has also issued a report that appears to lay the groundwork for justifying federal action to prevent any fossil-fueled plant from closing, citing data that critics say has been cherry-picked and misrepresented to paint a false picture of a power grid on the verge of collapse.

If the DOE continues to prevent fossil-fuel plants from closing, the costs could reach into the billions of dollars. Grid Strategies has estimated that forcing the continued operations of the nearly 35 gigawatts’ worth of large fossil-fueled power plants scheduled to retire between now and the end of 2028 could add up to $4.8 billion over that period.

Financial concerns aside, forcing utilities to react to successive 90-day emergency orders amounts to ​“sticking a wrench in the spokes of how utilities and their state regulators have planned their systems,” said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity at think tank Energy Innovation.

The utilities under DOE must-run orders have developed plans to retire workers at those plants or move them to other jobs, he said. They’ve ended long-term coal-delivery contracts and procured alternative resources to make up for the lost power from the shuttering units. Some plan to convert the facilities to run on fossil gas, as is the case with the Schahfer plant and the coal plant in Washington state. Those projects will likely be delayed if the coal units must keep running, he said.

Earthjustice’s Lenoff agreed that the DOE’s intrusion into those plans is ​“creating uncertainty that harms investment, raises costs, and disrupts orderly planning by experts and authorities who know what they’re doing. The Department of Energy has shown that it is just blundering into markets and processes that it doesn’t understand with flimsy arguments that don’t withstand scrutiny. And other people are bearing the costs.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/2048px-Schaffer_2105.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a31e6a45ff2e33e53c8713be8057d191,N,,2026-01-09 05:12:41.085304

But under the proposed extension, ​“the plants will continue to burn coal, thus creating additional air pollution,” and contamination from coal ash.
The ruling led to an April 2021 deadline to start closing unlined coal ash ponds.
Schahfer plant in Indiana is violating the coal ash rules by failing to file the required groundwater monitoring reports and other documents for a retired coal ash pond, which she and Earthjustice attorneys discovered in reviewing maps and images of the site.
Illinois is one of the states with the highest number of coal ash sites, according to data filed by power companies.","The Environmental Protection Agency plans to let 11 coal plants dump toxic coal ash into unlined pits until 2031 — a full decade later than allowed under current federal rules.

The move tosses a lifeline to the polluting power plants. If the facilities were barred from dumping ash into unlined pits, they would be forced to close, since they can’t operate if they don’t have a place to dispose of the ash, and the companies say finding alternative locations for disposal would be impossible.

These 11 plants have already circumvented the 2021 deadline to close such pits, through a 2020 extension offer from the first Trump administration. By filing applications for that extension through 2028, the plants were allowed to keep running even though the EPA has yet to rule on the applications.

On January 6, the EPA held a virtual public hearing on its proposal to give the plants an additional three years to stop dumping coal ash in unlined pits. Attorneys, advocates, and people who live near the plants called the plan illegal, a threat to public health, and another tactic by the Trump administration to prolong the lives of polluting coal plants.

In recent months, the Department of Energy has ordered coal plants scheduled for retirement to continue operating, saying their electricity is needed — an argument the EPA echoed in its proposal. Some state regulators, grid operators, and energy experts have pushed back on the notion that it is necessary to force these power plants to stay online. At the hearing, critics of the EPA’s proposed extension said reliability concerns are outside the agency’s coal ash mandate to protect human health and the environment.

“If the proposal is not finalized, the plants would have to close their [coal ash] impoundments and cease burning coal by 2028,” said Lisa Evans, a senior attorney for the environmental law firm Earthjustice. But under the proposed extension, ​“the plants will continue to burn coal, thus creating additional air pollution,” and contamination from coal ash.

Coal ash dumped in unlined pits can leach into groundwater, potentially contaminating drinking water wells with carcinogens and other dangerous elements. In 2018, the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 2015 federal regulation on Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) must be strengthened to better deal with such sites. The ruling led to an April 2021 deadline to start closing unlined coal ash ponds.

Through a 2020 extension offer from the first Trump administration, the EPA invited power companies to apply for the extension through 2028 if they had no other way to deal with the ash and were otherwise in compliance with the rules for disposal.

The EPA made a final decision in only one case, denying an extension to the troubled James M. Gavin plant in Ohio in 2022. But any company that filed an application has been able to keep its plant running while the EPA considers the case, something critics say is an obvious loophole.

The latest proposal would let three such plants in Illinois, two in Louisiana, two in Texas, and one each in Indiana, Ohio, Utah, and Wyoming operate until 2031.

“That [2021] deadline was established to stop ongoing contamination and protect communities,” said Cate Caldwell, senior policy manager of the Illinois Environmental Council, which represents 130 groups in the state. ​“By expanding a loophole created during the first Trump administration, EPA would allow coal plants to delay closure for at least three more years and potentially much longer.”

An illegal proposal?

The EPA’s previous and proposed regulations say that an extension for unlined pits can be granted only if the site is in compliance with the federal coal ash rules, including those involving cleaning up groundwater contamination.

At the hearing, experts argued that the 11 plants are not in compliance. Groundwater monitoring data that the companies are required to provide shows that all the sites eligible for the extension have elevated levels of contaminants linked to coal ash.

“EPA never reviewed these demonstrations,” Evans said. ​“If they did, I am confident that they would likely find that each of the plants are ineligible for an extension.”

In the virtual hearing, Indra Frank, coal ash adviser to the citizens group Hoosier Environmental Council, told the EPA that the R.M. Schahfer plant in Indiana is violating the coal ash rules by failing to file the required groundwater monitoring reports and other documents for a retired coal ash pond, which she and Earthjustice attorneys discovered in reviewing maps and images of the site.

“That impoundment is subject to the federal CCR rule, but it has not met any of the requirements of the rule. To qualify for the extension offered in 2020, utilities were required to be in full compliance,” Frank said at the hearing. ​“Since Schahfer was not in compliance, Schahfer did not qualify for the extension in 2020 and should not receive the additional proposed extension.”

Schahfer’s two coal-fired units were scheduled to close in December, but the Department of Energy ordered the plant to keep running — though one unit has actually been offline since July in need of repairs. In an August email to the EPA, an official with the plant’s parent company said the coal ash extension would be necessary to justify spending money to get the plant back online.

Serious concerns

Locals are dismayed that Schahfer may continue to run and say that no more coal ash should be placed in its unlined pond. Arsenic, molybdenum, cobalt, and radium have been found in groundwater near the pond, and the coal ash is held back by a dam with a high hazard rating, meaning its failure would be likely to cause death.

“We just see this proposed rule as a downright unlawful, reckless attempt by the Trump EPA to let polluters keep polluting,” said Ashley Williams, executive director of the advocacy organization Just Transition Northwest Indiana. She called the coal ash at the Schahfer site a ​“largely silent crisis that we’ve had to continue to sound the alarms on.”

Colette Morrow, a professor at an Indiana public university, told the EPA during the hearing that she suffers from an autoimmune disease and fears for her health if the Schahfer plant is allowed to keep running.

“This is unconscionable that the U.S government would put its own people at risk to such a high degree, only in order to enhance profits of these utility providers,” Morrow said.

Retired chemistry teacher Mary Ellen DeClue said she was shocked to learn about the contaminants that could be leaching into Illinoisans’ drinking water — since many rural residents tap private wells.

“This is not acceptable,” she said, imploring the EPA not to ​“rubber-stamp” the extension.

The three Illinois plants seeking the extension — Kincaid, Newton, and Baldwin — are owned by Texas-based Vistra Corp. The plants have already benefited from leniency under the Trump administration: Last year the company accepted the administration’s offer of an extension on complying with federal air pollutant limits.

Illinois is one of the states with the highest number of coal ash sites, according to data filed by power companies. Illinois coal plants will have to shut down by 2030 under state law, but each extra year of operation places residents at risk, local advocates say.

“Many of these communities rely on groundwater for drinking water and lack the resources to address widespread contamination on their own,” Caldwell of the Illinois Environmental Council told the EPA. ​“The agency should not be asking coal companies how long they would like to continue dumping toxic waste. It should be enforcing closure requirements that are already long overdue.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Virginia-coal-ash-pond_GettyImages-506680852.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=993a4ce93f367505c941eb8688d4995b,N,,2026-01-09 05:59:39.213338

Health protections from chemicals are under attack in Congress EPA’s announcement comes amid mounting concern that chemical industry lobbyists wield outsized influence over federal chemical policy.
Banning unnecessary toxic chemicals like phthalates and advancing safer solutions is one of the most effective ways we can protect the health of Americans.
EPA’s announcement falls far short of that goal and represents a missed opportunity to protect health, workers, and the environment.","We are all tired of being told everything is fine while our kids get sicker, chronic diseases rise, and toxic exposures increase.

So when EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on December 31, 2025 that EPA intends “to regulate dozens of uses of five phthalates”—hormone-disrupting chemicals commonly used in everyday plastic products—some may have thought this was a good thing for the health of Americans.

It wasn’t.

Instead, EPA’s announcement follows a familiar and troubling pattern: chemical industry science and corporate profits prioritized over the health of our families.

Despite overwhelming evidence of harm, the EPA does not plan to regulate phthalates in consumer products, even though children and women of childbearing age are among the most vulnerable to their hormone-disrupting effects. Buried in the EPA’s press release was this startling admission:

“For the consumer uses that are part of this TSCA risk evaluation, EPA found no products with exposure levels that are causing unreasonable risk to the general population.” (emphasis added)

That’s right. EPA is recommending no action to safeguard consumers from hormone-disrupting phthalates under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

It’s hard to see how the EPA’s decision protects anyone’s health. It does, however, protect the big chemical corporations that make and use these chemicals.

Phthalates: the “everywhere chemicals” in consumer products

EPA’s conclusion runs counter to the growing body of science showing that families, especially children, are regularly exposed to phthalates from many everyday products like vinyl flooring and wall coverings, wiring, children’s toys, and baby products. Exposure happens through indoor air and household dust, as well as through direct contact—touching and chewing on PVC plastic products.

If EPA were truly relying on “gold standard science,” it would follow the lead of states and companies that have already banned phthalates in consumer products and switched to safer alternatives. We have been working for decades to eliminate this old chemistry in favor of safer solutions, including reducing unnecessary plastic use altogether.

States from Washington to Maine, along with major retailers like Walmart and The Home Depot, have adopted common-sense policies to ban phthalates to protect people’s health, especially children and pregnant women. Congress did the same in 2008, when bipartisan federal law restricted eight phthalates in children’s toys and baby products—yet those same hormone-disrupting chemicals remain unregulated across other consumer products.

Why this matters

Nearly every American has measurable levels of phthalates in their body. These chemicals have been linked to serious health problems on the rise, from birth defects and infertility to ADHD, asthma, and early puberty in children.

Exposures to these chemicals are regular, repeated, and can be avoided by removing these chemicals from products. This is exactly the kind of common-sense action Congress intended EPA to take when it reformed TSCA in 2016.

Is EPA’s announcement good news for workers?

Probably not.

EPA said that all five phthalates evaluated “pose unreasonable risks to workers and the environment,” but signaled no intention to ban the chemicals. Instead, it will most likely rely on personal protective equipment (PPE), which has proven woefully inadequate. Relying on PPE to control toxic chemicals has repeatedly failed workers, especially in real-world conditions where equipment isn’t properly used, workers are inadequately trained, or protective gear is unavailable. Workers deserve protections that eliminate hazards at the source, not policies that shift the burden onto individuals.

Health protections from chemicals are under attack in Congress

EPA’s announcement comes amid mounting concern that chemical industry lobbyists wield outsized influence over federal chemical policy. At the same time, Big Chem is pushing Congress to weaken TSCA itself.

That’s why, in December, Toxic-Free Future organized a letter signed by more than 250 public health, consumer, and environmental organizations to urge Congress to reject efforts to further erode chemical safety protections.

The survey focused on areas where residents live near large biomass plants, including a facility in Northampton County, North Carolina.

Wood pellet plants process trees into fuel pellets that are exported overseas, primarily to Europe and Asia, where they are burned to generate electricity.

While often described as a renewable energy source, the manufacturing process produces dust and emissions that residents say affect air quality and daily life.

The survey was carried out by local residents working alongside environmental organisations, students and legal advocates.

Participants visited households near pellet plants to gather information about health concerns, environmental conditions and quality-of-life impacts associated with nearby industrial activity.

According to the survey findings, residents reported respiratory problems, persistent dust, noise and increased industrial traffic.

These concerns were most frequently recorded in rural communities and in areas with lower-than-average household incomes.

Environmental justice advocates note that heavy industrial facilities are often sited in communities with limited political influence, where residents may face barriers to raising concerns or accessing regulatory processes.

Companies operating such facilities frequently cite economic benefits and job creation, though residents surveyed said they saw limited long-term community investment.

The organisers of the survey say the data supports long-standing community complaints and will be used to inform public awareness efforts and policy discussions related to biomass energy production and environmental regulation.

Because USMCA is the first U.S. FTA to undergo a joint review, the scope and process of the review remain unclear.
The parties also may choose to discuss certain bilateral or trilateral issues separately from the joint review process.","Introduction

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a trilateral free trade agreement (FTA) that outlines rules for duty-free trade among the eponymous three countries as well as commitments on non-tariff issues, including labor, environment, investment, digital trade, and services. USMCA entered into force on July 1, 2020, replacing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).1 The USMCA Implementation Act (P.L. 116-113), which was signed into law on January 29, 2020, approved and implemented the agreement. Congress, in both its legislative and oversight capacities, was active in numerous trade policy issues related to the negotiations and conclusion of USMCA, and continues to be active in overseeing its implementation.

A key issue for the 119th Congress is a scheduled July 2026 ""joint review"" of USMCA. The joint review is specified within the ""review and term extension"" provision2 (sometimes referred to as a ""sunset clause"")—the first time such a provision has been included in any U.S. FTA. USMCA is scheduled to terminate 16 years after its entry into force (July 1, 2036) unless all three member countries confirm that they wish to continue the agreement through a ""joint review"" process. The parties committed to begin the first joint review on the sixth anniversary of the agreement's entry into force (July 1, 2026).

The establishment of a USMCA joint review provision was controversial. In hearings that took place during USMCA negotiations, Members of Congress expressed doubts about adding a mandatory review clause to USMCA, arguing that such a provision would create uncertainty that could discourage private investment and harm U.S. businesses.3 Some Members questioned whether the sunset clause provision may circumvent congressional authorities related to trade agreements.4 Then-U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer argued that the USMCA joint review process allows Congress to exert greater oversight than ""eternal"" FTAs that lack a mechanism for periodic review of an agreement.5

The USMCA Implementation Act includes congressional consultation requirements related to the joint review process.6 Congress may consider whether, and if so, how, to shape U.S. priorities for and approaches to the USMCA joint review. If there are significant revisions to USMCA resulting from the joint review, Congress may have a role in approving a revised agreement.

USMCA Joint Review Provision (Article 34.7)

While negotiating the USMCA terms, officials in the first Trump Administration proposed a five-year ""sunset clause"" and stated that the President would decide whether or not to continue the agreement five years after the agreement went into effect.7 An Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) official at the time argued that such a sunset clause would prevent agreements from becoming ""out of date"" and that ""it takes a fair amount of political pressure in order to get nations to come together and work on these agreements.""8 Canadian and Mexican officials opposed the initial U.S. ""sunset clause"" proposal, maintaining it would create uncertainty for investment and other economic activity.9

The three parties eventually agreed on a 16-year term for USMCA, with a required joint review to decide whether to renew the agreement.10 As described below, USMCA broadly outlines certain aspects of the joint review related to timeline and procedure Because the scheduled July 2026 joint review of USMCA is the first time that the United States is conducting such a process in relation to an FTA, there is no precedent for how the President or Congress may approach the scope of the review and the U.S. domestic process and trilateral process for conducting it.

According to Article 34.7 of USMCA, the parties are to meet on the sixth anniversary of the USMCA's entry into force (i.e., on July 1, 2026) for the first joint review.11 If a party wishes to make changes to the agreement, it is to provide recommendations for action at least one month before the joint review.12 If a party wishes to extend the agreement, it ""shall confirm, in writing, through its head of government.""13 If all parties agree to an extension, USMCA would ""automatically"" be extended for another 16 years. Subsequently, another joint review would be held ""no later than at the end of the next six-year period"" to discuss further extension of USMCA.14

If a party does not agree to extend USMCA, the agreement requires the parties to conduct additional annual joint reviews until all parties agree to extend the agreement for another 16-year period (after which the parties will return to a six-year joint review cycle15) or until USMCA terminates.16 The joint review process is separate from USMCA's withdrawal provisions, which allow any party to withdraw from the agreement with six months' written notice to the other parties.17

The Role of Congress in the Joint Review

The USMCA Implementation Act (P.L. 116-113), requires the President to consult with certain congressional committees (i.e., the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee), and other stakeholders before each joint review with respect to ""any recommendation for action to be proposed"" at the joint review, and ""whether or not to confirm that the United States wishes to extend"" USMCA.18 The law also instructs USTR to issue a notice in the Federal Register at least 270 days before a joint review to solicit public comments and to hold a public hearing for a presentation of views.19 Ahead of the scheduled July 2026 review, USTR issued a Federal Register notice on September 17, 2025, and held a public hearing from December 3 to December 5, 2025.20

At least 180 days before a six-year joint review, USTR must report to the appropriate congressional committees its 1) assessment of the operation of USMCA; 2) recommendations for actions to be proposed at the joint review; 3) the U.S. position on whether to extend USMCA; 4) what, if any, prior efforts have been made to resolve concerns underlying such recommendations and position; and 5) the views of trade advisory committees regarding such recommendations/position.21 USTR also is required to engage with Congress following a joint review, including in the case that not all USMCA parties agree to extend the term of the agreement.22

On December 16 and 17, 2025, USTR Jamieson Greer reported to the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee and asserted that these meetings held by USTR fulfilled aforementioned consultation requirements.23 Some Members of Congress sought a written report on the proceedings. In USTR Greer's publicly available opening remarks to the committees during the closed-door briefings, he assessed USMCA, recommended action on bilateral and trilateral issues, described efforts undertaken to resolve concerns, and presented views of the trade advisory committees, which include representatives from the private sector, labor unions, nongovernmental organizations, and other U.S. stakeholders.24 USTR Greer stated that ""the shortcomings [of USMCA] are such that a rubberstamp of the Agreement is not in the national interest"" and indicated that the nature of the joint review will depend on the ""successful resolution"" of various bilateral and trilateral issues (see ""Issues for Congress"").25

Issues for Congress

Congress may consider whether and how to engage on the 2026 USMCA joint review, including on oversight of U.S. trade relations with Canada and Mexico. Congress also may investigate and assess how proposed changes to the agreement might impact the U.S. economy and broader U.S. relations with Canada and Mexico. Congress also may consider to what extent the Administration is satisfying its statutorily required consultation requirements, or whether to seek more or less consultation with the Administration.

Because USMCA is the first U.S. FTA to undergo a joint review, the scope and process of the review remain unclear. The parties may choose to address longstanding and/or new bilateral and trilateral issues, which may require revising some USMCA provisions or adding new language on areas not currently addressed in USMCA. The parties also may choose to discuss certain bilateral or trilateral issues separately from the joint review process. Congress may consider whether and how to weigh in on the issues to be discussed at the review. In his December 2025 meetings with Congress, USTR Greer highlighted some potential topics for the joint review, including

Bilateral trade issues such as dairy, digital services, and provincial bans on the distribution of U.S. alcohol (Canada); and agriculture, labor, and energy (Mexico);26 and

Potential revisions to the rules for duty-free trade among USMCA partners (""rules of origin"");27

Congress may also debate whether the USMCA joint review is the appropriate forum for some issues, particularly longstanding bilateral disputes or discussions related to tariffs implemented by the United States in 2025, such as

Tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. §§1701 et seq.) ;28 and

Global national security tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. §1862, as amended) that affect key Canadian and Mexican sectors.29

Congress is the branch constitutionally authorized to regulate commerce with foreign nations and may decide whether revisions to USMCA require congressional approval.30 Revisions to the agreement that would require changes to U.S. law would require Congress to enact implementing legislation. Congress approved USMCA and enacted its implementing legislation under rules set out in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (TPA-2015, P.L. 114-26), which expired in 2021.31 Under TPA, Congress specified negotiating objectives and consultation requirements and allowed expedited consideration of implementing legislation for FTAs that sufficiently addressed those objectives and requirements. Congress could consider legislation adopting similar requirements, or, in the absence of TPA, may consider whether and how to set priorities for the Administration in preparation for and during the joint review, and how any required implementing legislation may be voted on.

In preparation for the joint review, some Members of Congress have written letters to the Administration that contain recommendations for issues to be addressed during the joint review.32 Congress also could consider amending the USMCA implementing legislation to clarify or strengthen Congress's role in the joint review process, such as whether to add congressional reporting requirements or specify whether reports should be submitted orally, in writing or both and whether USMCA revisions should require congressional approval and whether additional negotiating authority should be delegated to the executive branch.",https://www.EveryCRSReport.com/reports/R48787.png,N,,2026-01-09 11:02:48.544985

U.S. policy toward data center environmental impacts has so far been piecemeal.
Texas, California, Michigan, Minnesota, and other states are now drafting an increasing number of state regulations to limit local environmental impacts.
Beijing is keenly aware of this surge and has launched major initiatives to shape where and how data centers operate.
Many data center operators now face new regulations to purchase a certain percentage of green power credits.","As artificial intelligence rapidly expands, the United States and China face similar sustainability challenges, but their responses differ starkly — shaping AI’s long-term environmental footprint.

In Part 1 of my series on environmental AI governance, we identified that energy and water are at risk of data center overusage and could be competing with local communities for electricity and water. A polling from AP-NORC center for public affair research says that 4 in 10 Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the environmental impacts of AI. How do authorities in the U.S. respond to the resource intensive demand and environmental impacts of AI data centers?

U.S. policy toward data center environmental impacts has so far been piecemeal. There are largely no federal regulations specifically capping data centers’ energy or water use; instead, market forces and local state authorities are playing the key roles. China, which now makes more profit selling green technology than America makes from selling fossil fuels, is “baking in” their renewable technologies into their national data center initiatives.

The U.S. environmental AI push is largely from bottom-up – relying on local state, civic engagement, and market forces

In recent years, local state’s tax exemption incentives have attracted large tech corporations to bring in high tech jobs into their cities. A report by CNBC business found that as many as 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data center projects or have no state sales tax at all. Environmental concern was not on the front docket until air pollution and water reserves for citizens were in question.

Some tech companies are striking their own deals to secure cleaner energy. For example, Meta recently inked a landmark 20-year purchase agreement for the entire output of a 1.1 GW nuclear power plant in Illinois. At the same time, Meta’s expansion in the southern region of the U.S. powered by fossil fuels seems to be double-faced. Louisiana’s Entergy Corp. has proposed building three new gas-fired power plants exclusively to feed Meta’s data centers. This project is now under legal scrutiny for its potential climate impacts, which are forecasted to burn 3 times as much electricity as the city of New Orleans at any given day. Microsoft, Google, and other hyperscalers are also attempting to find a green AI path by signing wind and solar deals.

Today, most data center policies are centered around local grievances for energy and water overusage. Local grassroot community organizers are protesting the negligence and carelessness of corporations. In response, an array of state policymakers in recent months have formed frameworks around data center development. Texas, California, Michigan, Minnesota, and other states are now drafting an increasing number of state regulations to limit local environmental impacts.

Some U.S. states are stepping up with incentives and requirements for greener data centers. For instance, in 2024 Virginia’s proposal bill for Data Center Efficiency stipulating Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) efficiency targets for tax breaks, and in June 2025 Oregon now mandates water reporting for large cooling users. Another tactic local governments are using is third-party verification systems such as LEED to incentivize green sustainable data development.

In the end, America’s regulatory approach to AI data centers remains a patchwork—driven by corporate deals and local politics rather than national coordination. States set the pace as Washington lags behind. Without a cohesive strategy, the AI gold rush risks overwhelming both the power grid and the environmental safeguards for improving urban sustainable development.

China’s Sustainable AI development is ahead of building the Eco and Efficient AI – an existing Chinese industrial policy top to bottom approach

Unsurprisingly, China, by contrast, is taking a more centralized, policy-driven path to manage AI’s environmental footprint. Chinese analysts project data centers will consume 400 TWh annually, around 3.2% of China’s total electricity supply – roughly quadrupling in a decade. Beijing is keenly aware of this surge and has launched major initiatives to shape where and how data centers operate.

A signature policy is the “East-West Computing Resources Transmission” (EWCRT) or “东数西算” unveiled in 2022, which directs new supercomputing, data centers, and cloud facilities to be built in China’s western and northern regions. Because these regions – Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia – are home to cooler climates and abundant wind and solar resources, they can facilitate greener energy build out, enhance supply and demand optimization, and better balance compute resourcing. In comparison to the populous eastern provinces, energy demand is strained, and expanding energy capacity means burning more coal. This national EWCRT strategy is a highly coordinated effort across multiple Chinese provinces demonstrating Beijing’s ambitious top to bottom approach to achieving sustainable AI governance.

By relocating AI data centers closer to regions with abundant renewable energy sources and cooler temperatures, China aims to use less water for cooling and improve the carbon profile of its AI hardware infrastructure. Some research claims that the East-West Data Project can result in a reduction of 11,500 metric tons (Mt) of CO2 between 2020 and 2050 – the equivalent of reducing 30,000 barrels of oil. In addition, Beijing has set new goals to cut the average PUE down and with the use of green electricity in these data centers.

Equally important, Chinese authorities recently have mandated the use of clean energy not only for industrial manufacturers but also for data centers – a move which further integrates its complex energy policy with its AI industrial policy. March 2025, China’s National Development and Reform Commission issued guidelines pushing the country’s big data hubs to further increase their share of renewable electricity. Many data center operators now face new regulations to purchase a certain percentage of green power credits.

China’s provincial governments have rolled out complementary policies. Inner Mongolia offers incentivesfor data centers to directly pair with local wind and solar farms to reduce carbon emission. Another example, the local Shanghai government and China Telecom collaborated on a partnership to build the Lin-gang Special Area, which has become home to what the country calls the world’s first underwater data center. The $226 million project combines renewable energy with deep-sea cooling to improve efficiency and sustainability.

While the U.S. relies on market-led innovation and decentralized governance, China pursues state-led coordination and strategic regional planning. Whether China’s efforts will fully offset the emissions growth remains unclear – China’s grid is still ~60% coal-fired, so a jump to serve the enormous demand of data centers could add significantly to CO₂ emissions. Unless renewables scale even faster, the AI race will still run the risk of developing AI infrastructure powered by coal or natural gas in the near future

Balancing both AI ambitions and environmental constraints is not an easy task for a tight AI race. Their divergent models—bottom-up adaptation versus top-down orchestration—illustrate different strengths: American flexibility drives technological experimentation, while Chinese centralization enables systemic efficiency. Both nations ultimately should aim to reconcile AI’s rapid growth with environmental stewardship.",https://www.chinausfocus.com/d/file/202601/9a141e39dc2412919a5adcf6061faef4.png,N,,2026-01-09 02:13:43.166096

Doing so would be an effective declaration that a permanent five-year farm bill is on indefinite hold.","With Congress back in session, legislators will take up a set of issues they haven’t comprehensively addressed since 2018 – the year the last farm bill passed.

Farm bills are massive pieces of legislation that address a diverse constellation of topics, including agricultural commodities, conservation, trade, nutrition, rural development, energy, forestry and more. Because of their complexity, farm bills are difficult to negotiate in any political environment. And as the topics have expanded since the first iteration in 1933, Congress has generally agreed to take the whole thing up once every five years or so.

However, the most recent farm bill’s provisions expired in 2023. They have been renewed one year at a time ever since, but without the comprehensive overhaul that used to accompany farm bills.

As former federal employees handling agriculture policy who now study that topic, it’s unclear to us whether a comprehensive, five-year farm bill can be passed in 2026, or ever again.

The July 2025 enactment of the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the Trump administration’s budget priorities in the tax and spending bill, revised funding levels for many programs that were historically handled in the farm bill. For instance, that law included a 20% cut in funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which helps low-income families buy food. And it doubled support for the largest farm subsidy programs.

Those changes and current divisions in Congress mean the nation’s food and agriculture policy may remain stuck in limbo for yet another year.

Cuts to SNAP used for farm subsidies

For decades, political conventional wisdom has held that sweeping federal farm bills are able to pass only because farmers seeking subsidies and anti-hunger advocates wanting increased SNAP dollars recognize the mutual advantage in working together. That’s how to build a broad, bipartisan consensus strong enough to garner the 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to avoid a filibuster and actually pass a bill.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending law did not create a compromise between those competing interests. It slashed SNAP spending by $186 billion over the next decade. At the same time, it boosted price support for farmers who grow key crops like corn, soybeans and wheat by $60 billion, in addition to a $10 billion economic relief package passed at the end of 2024 to address high costs of seeds, fertilizer and other farming supplies.

Supporters of anti-hunger programs are furious that these funds for farmers are being paid for by cutting SNAP benefits to families.

In addition, about one-third of the SNAP cuts came by shifting the program’s cost to state budgets. States have always carried some of the costs to administer SNAP, but they have never before been required to fund billions of dollars in benefits. Many states will be unable to cover these increased costs and will be forced to either reduce benefits or opt out of SNAP altogether, dramatically cutting the help available to hungry Americans.

Groups that support SNAP are unlikely to help pass any bill relating to food or farm policy that does not substantially reverse the cuts to SNAP.

And farmers who receive money under the two largest farm subsidy programs are not even required to grow the specific crops those programs are meant to support. Rather, they must simply own farmland that was designated in 1996 as having grown that crop in the early 1980s.

Farmers have repeatedly said they would prefer federal farm policies that support markets and create conditions for stable, fair commodity prices. And evidence shows that spending more money on farm subsidies does little to actually improve underlying economic conditions affecting the costs of farming or the prices of what is grown.

And yet, in early December 2025, the Department of Agriculture released an additional $12 billion to help offset losses farmers experienced when Trump’s tariffs reduced agricultural exports. In mid-December, the National Farmers Union said that money still wasn’t enough to cover losses from consistently low commodity prices and high seed and fertilizer costs.

A regular five-year farm bill may be out of reach

The success of any bill depends on political will in Congress and outside pressure coming together to deliver the required number of votes.

Some leaders in Congress remain optimistic about the prospects of a farm bill passing in 2026, but major legislation is rare with midterm elections looming, so meaningful progress appears unlikely. It seems to us more likely that the ongoing stalemate will continue indefinitely.

In September 2025, Politico reported that instead of a complete five-year farm bill, the House and Senate committees on agriculture might take up a series of smaller bills to extend existing programs whose authorizations are expiring. Doing so would be an effective declaration that a permanent five-year farm bill is on indefinite hold.

Prospects for sustainable farm policy

By using financial incentives cleverly, Congress has shifted farming practices over time in ways that lawmakers determined were in the public’s interest.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, allocated $20 billion over four years to encourage farmers to reduce or offset carbon emissions, which the Agriculture Department calls “climate-smart agriculture.” Those funds, along with a separate Department of Agriculture initiative with similar aims, were well received by American farmers. Farmers applied for far more money than was actually available.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending law cut those funds and repurposed them for traditional Agriculture Department programs for farmers who want to implement conservation practices on their land.

But unexpectedly, the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, agenda contains some ideas that climate-smart advocates have previously advanced. These include scathing indictments of the effects of conventional agriculture on Americans’ health, including concerns over pesticide use and the so-far-undefined category of “ultra-processed foods.”

The MAHA agenda could be an opportunity for organic farmers to secure a boost in federal funding. In December, the Agriculture Department committed $700 million toward “regenerative” practices, but that’s a trifling amount compared with the billions commodity farmers received in 2025.

And the administration’s allies who support conventional agriculture have already expressed concerns that MAHA efforts might reduce the nation’s agricultural productivity. The administration may end up caught between the MAHA movement and Big Ag.

Overall, in this new political environment, we believe advocates for changes in agriculture and food aid will likely need to rethink how to advance their agendas without the promise of a farm bill coming anytime soon.

WASHINGTON — In the fallout of President Trump’s extraordinary rendition of the president of Venezuela, the administration’s obsession with developing the uneconomic oil resources in the country raises the likelihood of massive U.S. taxpayer subsidies and financial guarantees to Big Oil, according to a new report from Public Citizen.

The report, Congress Must Stop Trump’s Venezuelan Oil Takeover, highlights ways Congress can conduct much-needed oversight over potential conflicts of interest and corporate favors stemming from Trump’s Venezuelan oil grab.

While Trump claims he will rely on U.S. companies to exploit Venezuela’s oil resources for years to come, due to decrepit Venezuelan infrastructure, the low quality of Venezuelan crude, and political instability, most Big Oil corporations are hesitant to invest without a guarantee of profits. Trump’s solution appears to be U.S. taxpayer subsidies and guarantees for Big Oil.

The report identifies key vehicles, including the U.S. International Development Finance Corp and the Export-Import Bank, poised to subsidize Big Oil.

The report also spotlights international oil majors who may be in line for payouts in longstanding litigation against the Venezuelan government and highlights Gulf Coast refineries, including Valero Energy, Phillips 66, and Marathon Petroleum as potential beneficiaries. These refiners already import Venezuelan heavy and dirty crude and would likely be in a position to import and refine more.

“Handing over Venezuela’s oil industry to Big Oil will do nothing to lower prices at the gas pump, but will burden American taxpayers with billions in new subsidies for oil executives,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “Rebuilding Venezuela’s battered oil industry in the long term will require a massive influx of capital. The fossil fuel industry is unwilling to take on this risk without some sort of taxpayer-backed guarantee. ”

The report calls on Congress to stop any federal government guarantee to Big Oil that would force American taxpayers—or use the proceeds from purloined Venezuelan oil—to cover all or some of the risk of investment in Venezuela. Further, lawmakers must prevent the Trump administration from using federal programs like the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to provide risk insurance and other subsidies for Big Oil.

Public Citizen’s report comes ahead of a Friday White House meeting between the president and representatives of major fossil fuel companies, including leaders from Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Exxon Mobil, according to the Wall Street Journal.

“The Trump administration’s shocking actions to use force to exploit Venezuela’s oil resources echo the imperial arrogance of the United States after the invasion of Iraq and a century of military intervention in Central and South America,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen. “But at no time in post World War II history has the United States ever so blatantly claimed a right to control other countries’ natural resources or to use military force to obtain them. Along with blocking further military action against Venezuela, Congress must act to ensure U.S. taxpayers don’t subsidize Big Oil’s exploitation of Venezuela’s oil resources.”

The Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment appropriations bills passed the House today with bipartisan support. Sewell secured the inclusion of $750,000 for the City of Brighton and key funding for historic preservation.

""After failing to pass a single appropriations bill last year, I'm glad that House Republicans are working with Democrats and returning to the normal appropriations process,"" said Rep. Sewell. ""In these three bills, Democrats successfully rejected more than $163 billion in proposed cuts and made important investments to lower costs for hard working families.""

""I'm excited to announce that the funding bills passed today include $750,000 that we secured for the City of Brighton,"" continued Sewell. ""This funding will improve public safety by giving local law enforcement the tools they need to serve and protect the community. As Congress finalizes the remaining spending bills for FY26, I will continue advocating for additional projects in our district.""

The funding bills passed today include $750,000 that Rep. Sewell secured to strengthen public safety in the City of Brighton. The funding would support materials and equipment to enhance the Department's capacity to respond to emergencies, prevent crime, and foster a sense of security among residents.

Sewell also helped secure hundreds of millions in funding for historic preservation, including:

$205,059,000 for the National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund

$24,000,000 for competitive grants to preserve the sites and stories of the Civil Rights Movement

$11,000,000 for grants to HBCU’s for historic preservation projects

The bills now head to the U.S. Senate for consideration.

Announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the partnership introduces the first application of its kind by a global consumer packaged goods (CPG) company, marking a shift in how facilities are designed, simulated and managed.

As demand grows and the need for faster and more adaptable production rises, PepsiCo is taking steps to digitally overhaul its plants and warehouses in the US.

The process involves piloting digital twins – digital replicas of real-world facilities – before making any changes to physical infrastructure.

These virtual models allow the company to simulate, test and validate new setups with speed and precision.

Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and CEO at PepsiCo, explains: ""The scale and complexity of PepsiCo's business, from farm to shelf, is massive – and we are embedding AI throughout our operations to better meet the increasing demands of our consumers and customers.

""Our work with Siemens and Nvidia will help accelerate our continued journey of becoming a future-fit company, operating with agility and foresight.""

Using digital twins to model, test and build smarter

PepsiCo is now adopting a digital-first strategy for facility planning.

Using physics-based digital twin simulations, the company is able to co-design operations with AI agents that help to test and refine layout choices before making any on-site changes.

These simulations are powered by Siemens’ Digital Twin Composer software, which is built using Nvidia’s Omniverse platform – a set of tools that creates real-time 3D simulations with physically accurate behaviour.

The technology enables PepsiCo to digitally reconstruct all machines, conveyor systems, operator paths and pallet flows with a high level of detail.

This helps the company identify system flaws and performance improvements virtually, eliminating the need to build or modify physical infrastructure until every variable has been tested.

According to early trial outcomes, PepsiCo improves throughput by 20% while achieving almost full design validation and reducing capital expenditure by 10% to 15%.

Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang sees digital twins as the foundation of AI adoption across physical industries: ""Physical industries are entering the age of AI. For companies with real-world assets, digital twins are the foundation of their AI journey.""

""Working with Nvidia and Siemens, PepsiCo is re-architecting its operations – using physically-accurate digital twins and AI to reinvent how it designs, optimises and runs its global operations,"" he adds.

The new approach will allow PepsiCo to spot up to 90% of operational issues in simulation before changes are made in the real world.

That efficiency is already visible in initial pilot sites, where PepsiCo uses AI and computer vision to optimise the end-to-end supply chain.

Building a global, intelligent supply chain

At the heart of the transformation is Siemens’ new software solution, which supports large-scale industrial metaverse environments.

These environments merge 2D and 3D data from digital twins with real-time physical information – all within a managed, high-fidelity 3D interface.

The system enables manufacturers to view and test every aspect of a facility – both virtual and physical – throughout its operational lifecycle.

Roland Busch, CEO at Siemens, says: ""We are proud to partner with PepsiCo and Nvidia to digitally transform their manufacturing facilities using physics-based digital twins and AI from design to engineering to operations.

""The Digital Twin Composer is a cornerstone in enabling PepsiCo to transform manufacturing and warehousing.

""Siemens is powering the industrial AI revolution – with an unmatched industrial AI technology stack, deep domain knowhow and world-class partners.

""This collaboration sets a new standard for all industries. Customers can turn ideas into real-world impact with greater speed, quality, and efficiency.""

With a clear strategy in place, PepsiCo is embarking on its digital transformation in select US locations, but has confirmed it aims to scale the approach across its global operations.

The digital twins simulate not only machinery and facility layouts but also the end-to-end supply chain, helping to establish a performance benchmark for each site.

Using AI tools, PepsiCo teams can test new layouts and system changes to refine operations and boost capacity without costly physical upgrades.

Designing plants that anticipate and adapt

In addition to creating flexible and responsive facilities, PepsiCo wants to design a new type of intelligent supply chain that predicts and adapts to changes automatically.

Athina Kanioura, CEO for Latin America and Global Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer at PepsiCo, adds: ""We are deploying the first digital blueprint that reimagines how the supply chain is designed, built, and scaled, a first for the industry.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/218a6775ebb754908e902aa03cb433a9:161f7f84e45111bbc51ae32cfcb4e9c4/pepsico-x-siemens-x-nvidia-6.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:13:26.190161

IN Agency Fails to Hold US Steel and BP Whiting to Standards Needed to Minimize Air Pollution

Environmental, community groups ask US EPA to compel Indiana agency toughen steel facilities’ air permit renewal requirements

Environmental and community groups submitted two petitions to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asking it to object to two inadequate air permit renewals the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) recently issued to a steel plant and oil refinery in Northwest Indiana. A petition was filed on January 2 in connection to a permit renewal for BP Whiting and a separate petition was filed on December 23, 2025 in connection to a U.S. Steel Midwest Plant in Portage permit renewal. The permits fail to include many basic provisions of the Clean Air Act, including clear and enforceable monitoring, testing and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements.

The U.S. Steel Midwest Plant petition was filed on behalf of the Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC), Gary Advocates for Responsible Development (GARD), Just Transition Northwest Indiana (JTNWI), Northern Lake County Environmental Partnership (NLCEP), National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), Abrams Environmental Law Clinic, and Faith in Place. The groups contend that IDEM disregarded key concerns that U.S. EPA and other Commenters raised about the permits during the public comment period, specifically the permit’s failure to include requirements that ensure compliance with emission limits and federal regulations.

The BP Whiting petition was filed on behalf of ELPC, GARD, Environmental Integrity Project, Save the Dunes, JTNWI, NLCEP, and Faith in Place. The groups contend that, among other shortcomings, BP’s air permit fails to include an emissions limit on particulate matter that is required by Indiana’s federally-approved State Implementation Plan.

Kerri Gefeke, ELPC Associate Attorney, said:

“U.S. EPA should object to these permits because they’re inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and The Region’s Hoosiers should not feel like they are living in a sacrifice zone. Numerous studies show that residents living near these facilities already suffer from some of the highest rates of air pollution in the nation – resulting in high rates of asthma, cancer, and other diseases. And recent reporting identifies Indiana’s natural environment as ranked dead last based on air and water quality as well as pollution threats.

“IDEM needs to do better and ensure that BP Whiting and U.S. Steel Midwest Plant are operating in a way that is not only economically lucrative but also protective of human health. IDEM can do that by simply ensuring that the permits it issues follow the law and include the necessary monitoring provisions to ensure that these plants – and similar facilities – are not polluting more than what’s allowable in their permits.”

Dorreen Carey, President of Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, said:

“For over 100 years Northwest Indiana residents have been continuously exposed to the daily, monthly, and yearly air pollution from the iron and steelmaking process including particulate matter, NOx, SO2, and hazardous air pollutants like mercury and lead. Upgrades in air pollution monitoring and control at these plants are long overdue. The outdated and insufficient requirements for U.S. Steel and BP Whiting air emission monitoring contained in the IDEM Title V Permit Renewals do not allow for continuous real time information, timely intervention, and the corrective action needed to assure compliance and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

“EPA must object to this deficient IDEM Permit Renewal and require revisions to the air monitoring methodology that will include updated and supplemental monitoring of emissions and opacity limits to ensure permit compliance and current and ongoing protection of nearby residents’ health and environment.”",https://elpc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/original-12757EB9-7B67-4C29-A676-DC2F37384BE12.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 23:58:10.612661

When Compliance Shapes the Clock Regulatory factors now dictate schedules as much as engineering timelines, complicating supply chain risk management in energy.","For decades, supply chains in the power sector have operated steadily behind the scenes. They were the quiet backbone: essential, dependable, and rarely acknowledged unless something went wrong.

That dynamic has changed. As the energy landscape grows more complex, supply chain considerations are increasingly center stage. While supply chain planning has always been critical, it is now playing a greater role in shaping project feasibility, cost, and timing. Securing capacity has become more competitive and more consequential: for the first time in decades, customers are paying reservation fees to hold their place in production queues.

The industry is adjusting in real-time, rethinking how supply chains are managed under tighter timelines and higher stakes. Building energy supply chain resilience now depends on greater visibility, flexible sourcing, and closer collaboration, not just within procurement teams.

Utilities that understand these dynamics and align early with OEMs on compliance, logistics, and design are best positioned to protect costs, stay on schedule, and maintain reliability as they plan for what comes next.

What’s Reshaping Supply Chain Complexity?

The growing complexity reflects the sector’s momentum, and the widening set of actors now involved in supply chain decisions. As power demand surges from data centers, manufacturing onshoring, and the electrification of everything from vehicles to factories, utilities, OEMs, developers, and EPCs are increasingly pulled into conversations once handled almost exclusively by supply chain teams.

To keep pace with the demand for electricity, some forecast that developers plan to add a total of roughly 36.4GW of gas capacity by 2028. This level of planned capacity requires utilities to work with partners to plan earlier, more proactively, and more efficiently, ensuring resources are aligned and available across the supply chain before constraints occur.

AI and automation are also reshaping utilities’ operations, speeding some processes, straining others, and creating new dependencies on technology and skilled labor. At the same time, workforce dynamics are shifting, making it harder to attract, retain, and support the people needed to keep projects moving.

On the global and policy stages, rising risks from tariffs, trade tensions, uncertain regulations, cost inflation, and competition are adding pressure on the energy sector’s supply chains. Cancellations and delays have become far more common, underscoring the need for adaptability and resilience across the power generation ecosystem.

When Compliance Shapes the Clock

Regulatory factors now dictate schedules as much as engineering timelines, complicating supply chain risk management in energy. One example of this is that global tariffs require utilities and OEMs to evaluate multiple pathways that balance design, timing, and cost.

“We are constantly evaluating the tariff impact and having discussions both internally and externally to figure out the best course of action,” says Vincent Leonard, VP of Supply Chain Management at Mitsubishi Power Americas.

Customers must work with OEMs to determine whether to pivot to a different equipment style to avoid tariff impacts or maintain the standardized design, knowing it may require paying a premium. Flexibility often hinges on contractual structures like change-in-law provisions, making early collaboration across legal, engineering, and procurement teams essential.

Country of origin and local content rules now dictate timing as much as cost.

Federally funded projects may require OEMs to “Buy American,” under the Build America, Buy America Act(link is external), which can apply to both equipment and transportation.

“If it's a project that has certain funding through DOE, they may also have a requirement to use a U.S. flag vessel, once again with impact on capacity and cost,” says Agustin Harriague, VP of Logistics and Supply Chain Operational Excellence at Mitsubishi Power Americas.

Because compliance requirements vary by project, utilities benefit from evaluating them early. Recognizing these impacts upfront helps teams select pathways that remain feasible as timelines, costs, and regulations evolve.

Capacity Has Become Currency

Capacity has become a scarce commodity in the sector across gas turbines, steam turbines, and generators, impacting both single and combined-cycle builds. According to McKinsey(link is external), the industry is now seeing sustained load growth for the first time in nearly two decades. That backdrop demands a new level of coordination among OEMs, utilities, developers, and EPCs.

To meet customer needs, OEMs are shifting from reactive acceleration to proactive protection of manufacturing capacity earlier in the planning cycle.

Securing production slots has become strategic. Reservation agreements with auxiliary equipment suppliers, often prepaid, are used to guarantee a place in the queue. Supplier diversification adds further protection when certain vendors face constraints.

The implication for utilities is clear: projects track to the pace of secured capacity. Those who plan ahead with OEM partners gain predictability and, by extension, priority.

Regional Manufacturing and Digital Logistics Provide Agility Under Pressure

OEMs must stay nimble in a volatile global environment, monitoring risks and developing alternative plans to preserve resiliency for customers. Companies are reducing their dependence on inventory buffers, according to McKinsey’s 2024 analysis on supply chain strategies(link is external), with 34% of companies relying on them in 2024, down from 59% in 2023.

Mitsubishi Power’s cross-region manufacturing footprint helps strengthen compliance, reduces transit risks, and supports on-time delivery. To accommodate customer requests for “Buy American” sourcing, the company is expanding U.S. manufacturing through its Savannah Machinery Works facility, increasing capacity for gas, steam, and hydrogen-ready turbine technologies.

Regional manufacturing helps shorten lead times, balances compliance with cost, and provides capacity closer to demand. Proximity is valuable during both equipment manufacturing and deployment, especially for modular power generation projects. Regionalization offers a buffer against geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, and global logistics disruptions.

Mitsubishi Power’s integrated supply chain model gives the flexibility needed to support customers’ evolving needs.

“Integration has allowed us to select the best, high-quality suppliers, which is helping drive quality and on-time delivery,” says Leonard.

Integration also allows Mitsubishi Power to pool and bundle volumes. “As an integrated company, you come with more volume and with a longer pipeline business,” says Harriague.

That scale broadens the supply base, allowing Mitsubishi Power to pivot sourcing faster, helping customers avoid tariff impacts and mitigate delays.

Digital logistics are one example of integration in action, and Mitsubishi Power has been investing in digital solutions that enable further visibility and control, from vendor management to freight booking and routing.

“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the entire United Nations climate-fighting apparatus takes America's environmental isolation to another level and is likely to damage both the United States and the world as the planet flirts with ecological tipping points, experts say.

Leaders from around the world say the United States will be left behind as more than 190 other nations join in what they call a blossoming green economy that is transitioning from polluting coal, oil and gas to cleaner and cheaper solar, wind and other renewable energies.

Wednesday's action starts the process to pull the U.S. out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It's the main way nations negotiate, monitor and enforce agreements to curb worsening climate change, and is a bigger step than Trump's 2017 and 2025 withdrawals from the bedrock 2015 Paris Agreement aimed at limiting warming.

The framework was negotiated in Brazil in 1992, championed by Republican U.S. President George H.W. Bush and ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate. It's what Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden used to justify signing and reactivating the Paris deal without needing Senate approval. The Trump administration also withdrew Wednesday from a United Nations climate science panel, a biodiversity-saving effort and the Green Climate Fund to help poor nations as well as many other international collaborations.

“It is a more serious step definitely. The world loses a lot and it is very damaging,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “The U.S. turns its back against science, against global collaboration, against any kind of action on climate change. So, yes, in that sense, it's more fundamental and more damaging” than earlier efforts.

“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in announcing the U.S. withdrawal, said the Trump administration “has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.”

Since 1850, the United States has put more than 480 billion tons (440 billion metric tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. That accounts for nearly one-quarter of the world's historic emissions of a gas that stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, according to the scientists at the Global Carbon Project.

Under the Paris agreement, countries voluntarily pledge to curb emissions by various amounts, but each year global emissions continue to rise. The United States, under the Biden administration, had promised to cut its emissions by 61% to 66% by 2035.

“It will mean more warming because the U.S. is not going to be fulfilling its obligations of reducing their emissions,” said Adelle Thomas, climate adaptation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council and also a vice chair of the U.N. climate science panel that Trump is quitting.

And it comes at a critical time as Earth is approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times — the internationally agreed warming threshold established in Paris, Thomas and Rockstrom said.

“We need to start reducing emissions globally by 5% per year,” Rockstrom said. “It’s our last chance. And exactly at that moment, the biggest player in the world steps out of the game.”

The world is perilously close to several “tipping points' of irreversible change, such as coral reef loss, said former Ireland president Mary Robinson, a tireless climate change advocate for the group of retired leaders called The Elders.

”We really have no time and it is so unbelievably stupid at one level and reckless for the Trump administration to be taking the steps that they are taking,"" she said.

In past international climate negotiations, especially when Democrat John Kerry was secretary of state or America's top climate envoy, the United States kept oil countries, such as Saudi Arabia, from watering down deals too much, experts said. But that was missing last November in Brazil's negotiations, which the U.S. skipped under Trump.

Kerry called Trump's action “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which represents industries that emit much of the heat-trapping gases, said “removing the U.S. from the U.N. climate framework will accelerate a positive shift towards abandoning the destructive global climate framework.”

Thomas, Rockstrom and Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who helped fashion the Paris agreement, said the United States is leaving itself behind in a new, cleaner world of cheaper energy and more jobs.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said Trump's move will hurt the U.S.

“It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport and insurance for American households and businesses, as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses and infrastructure harder each year,"" he said.

Some environmental advocates have feared that future presidents won't be able to easily reinstate the U.S. to the climate convention in an era when Senate approval would likely be far harder.

But Sue Biniaz, a former State Department lawyer and deputy chief negotiator who now teaches at Yale, said the next president would have the power to undo Trump's action.

“I wouldn’t want to say any sort of damaging action or inaction is irreversible,"" Biniaz said. ""I imagine a future U.S. government would work with other countries to revive as much as possible. We did that in 2021 after the first Trump administration.’’

Small Michigan communities are weighing over a dozen data center projects this year, according to mapping done by the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance.

If elected, El-Sayed said he’s unlikely to be able to get data center legislation passed until President Donald Trump is out of office.","U.S Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed released a framework Thursday for evaluating data center proposals in Michigan communities that looks to ensure resident input and protections for water, energy reliability and affordability, and clean energy laws.

The candidate, who is running in the 2026 Democratic primary for the Senate seat vacated by retiring Sen. Gary Peters, told Planet Detroit he wants these priorities to serve as a guidepost for local decision-making and federal legislation.

“I think it’s important for forward-thinking, future legislators to be talking about what it looks like to actually stand up for communities and protect them,” El-Sayed said. He previously worked as Wayne County’s health director and as executive director of the Detroit Health Department.

El-Sayed’s “terms of engagement” for data centers outline community protections for ensuring projects don’t result in electric rate hikes, harm energy reliability, pollute local waterways, and undermine clean energy laws. It also calls for assurances around transparency, community benefits, and job creation promises.

Small Michigan communities are weighing over a dozen data center projects this year, according to mapping done by the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. Developers have said these projects could create hundreds of temporary construction jobs and bring in significant tax revenue.

Many Michigan residents and some lawmakers oppose data center projects in their communities. Data centers’ often massive water and energy demands raise concerns the facilities could harm water resources, pass on costs to other electric ratepayers, and imperil state climate goals.

Data centers’ energy demands risk triggering an “off ramp” provision in the state’s climate law, allowing fossil fuel generation to stay online if there’s a capacity shortage.

U.S. voters support banning data centers near where they live by a margin of 41% to 36%, according to a November Morning Consult poll.

McMorrow: Legislation needed to ensure community safeguards

Environmental and ratepayer protections already exist for data centers receiving state tax breaks, but legislation is needed to codify community safeguards, Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) told Planet Detroit in a statement. McMorrow is another candidate for the Democratic nomination in the U.S. Senate race.

Energy experts previously told Planet Detroit that language in the tax break legislation provides insufficient detail to ensure ratepayers are protected from data center costs, and the facilities’ power demands could undermine Michigan’s renewable energy law.

McMorrow said any data center legislation should include ratepayer and environmental protections, and assurances that data centers are built with union labor and “pay their fair share in taxes to fund our schools, roads, and communities.”

“I’m against any data center that hurts Michiganders’ energy bills, our water, or fails to create good jobs and revenue for our communities,” she said, adding the facilities could also bring in “generational investment.”

McMorrow voted to pass tax breaks for large data centers in 2024.

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham); and Republicans Mike Rogers and Bernadette Smith, who have been identified as competitive candidates in the primary field, did not respond to questions about their positions on data centers.

Data centers raise corporate donation questions, El-Sayed says

The targeting of small townships by large tech companies for data centers makes federal legislation necessary, El-Sayed said.

Such communities are often unprepared to move as quickly as well-resourced corporations, and codifying the framework into law could protect communities from being steamrolled, he said.

If elected, El-Sayed said he’s unlikely to be able to get data center legislation passed until President Donald Trump is out of office.

Data centers raise the “foundational question” of the influence large corporations have over U.S. politics, he said.

El-Sayed said has not accepted campaign donations from DTE Energy. DTE is a major contributor to Michigan political campaigns, and its shareholders could benefit significantly from the electric load growth created by data centers.

DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said the utility “is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and complies with all applicable laws regarding corporate donations and political contributions.”

El-Sayed said it’s problematic that Michigan data center tax breaks enjoy bipartisan support.

“One of my biggest frustrations with my own party has been that Democrats are too often bought off by the very same corporations that buy off Republicans.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AlSayedDec3-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 19:59:49.617273

Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet.
“We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium.

At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects.
Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.","CHICAGO — Amid warnings of impending energy shortages, Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday signed a wide-ranging energy reform package into law aimed at bolstering the state’s power grids after years of negotiations.

Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — will fund battery storage, grant greater authority to state utility regulators, create new options for “virtual power plants” and lift a longtime ban on new large-scale nuclear power plants.

“We’re making it easier to develop renewable energy,” bill sponsor Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet. “We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium. That’s all going to bring more supply onto the grid, and that will help hold the line on our electrical bills.”

The Illinois Power Agency, an independent body responsible for planning and procuring cost-effective energy for Illinoisians, found that the law will save utility customers in the state $13.4 billion over the next two decades. But opponents question those projections, pointing to increased subsidies for battery storage that will eventually be reflected via a new charge on consumers’ bills beginning in 2030.

The bill signing took place less than a month after state regulators projected energy shortfalls would likely drive up costs in the next three to five years and force Illinois to import more power from out of state absent action from lawmakers and grid operators.

Shortfalls, Pritzker said, would be exacerbated by actions at the national level, including the Trump administration’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phased out renewable energy tax credits and froze federal funding for energy projects. He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.

“All of that raises prices in the short term, while threatening our long-term ability to meet growing electricity demand,” Pritzker said.

CRGA, he said, will allow Illinois to forge its own path.

What’s in the law?

At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects. It will result in new charges to ratepayers, though supporters of the bill say that those costs would be offset by cost savings from greater energy efficiency, storage and planning.

The law grants new authority to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state body responsible for regulating utilities. The ICC will now have the power to set long-term plans for managing energy supply and demand in the state through approval of an integrated resource plan.

It additionally adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at electric and natural gas utilities and places new air regulations on backup generators used by data centers.

It also secures new labor protections by closing a loophole for community solar projects that has allowed some developers to avoid hiring union labor, a major priority for organized labor groups involved in negotiating the bill.

CRGA also lifts a longstanding ban on constructing new large-scale nuclear power plants, while at the same time increasing fees for nuclear plant operators. It outlines new programs for geothermal and thermal energy network projects, using naturally occurring heat from underground and transferring it via water-filled pipes to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel heating.

The law also creates new “virtual power plant,” or VPP, programs. That’s not virtual as in occurring via the internet or virtual reality, but rather as a program that allows homes and businesses with solar panels or wind turbines to pool energy together, acting “virtually” like a power plant despite not physically existing as one.

The idea is that the energy stored in residential and business batteries can be contributed to the electrical grid when the state’s primary electric delivery companies, like ComEd and Ameren Illinois, face high supply prices during peak hours of use, especially during the summer.

Homes and businesses who contribute energy to the grid via VPPs will be paid for their energy. The law also mandates that electric utilities offer optional “time-of-use” pricing, allowing customers to save money by using less energy during periods of high demand.

ComEd already offers time-of-use pricing, as approved in an ICC ruling in January 2025, but CRGA enshrines the requirement for both Ameren and ComEd into law.

Path to passage

The legislation passed during the legislature’s veto session in late October with support from environmental, labor and utility oversight advocates. Business groups and Republicans criticized the bill for its reliance on a new ratepayer charge to fund new battery storage and for yielding what they said was too much power to the ICC.

“Senate Bill 25 is a guaranteed rate increase that does nothing to increase energy production,” Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.

Rep. Norine Hammond, R-Macomb, also denounced energy sources like wind and solar as unreliable in a statement, saying that the state “should focus on preserving reliable energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power that actually work when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.”

Supporters, though, say that ratepayer charges will be offset with savings from increased energy supply and grid reliability. They argue the investment in battery systems allows the state to store extra energy generated on bright sunny days or windy days and deploy it at night and when other energy supply is low.

Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of Citizens Utility Board and champion of the bill, said CRJA was the state’s response to market signals sent by regional grid operators.

“To me, CRGA is really about us here in Illinois, together as a state, deploying the tools we have here at our disposal to defend the promise of clean and affordable power for Illinois,” Moskowitz said.

Organized labor advocates also supported the bill, which is expected to generate up to 100,000 jobs according to statements from multiple House Democrats. AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Pat Devaney and LiveWire Construction CEO Shon Harris joined Pritzker on stage at the signing ceremony.

“By expanding access to pre-apprentice programs, lowering thresholds for project labor agreements, ensuring that wind, solar and thermal energy projects are built by skilled Illinois workers, this bill clearly says the future of clean energy in Illinois will be union built,” Devaney said.

The bill prioritizes grants to historically underserved contractors and projects in communities that would most benefit from investments to combat discrimination. Harris said that legislation keeps the doors open for businesses like his.

“CRGA ensures equity remains a part of Illinois’ clean energy future,” Harris said. “That means that companies like mine can keep building projects, training workers and creating good-paying jobs all across Illinois.”",https://i0.wp.com/capitolnewsillinois.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BATTERY-STORAGE-AA.jpg?fit=1140%2C712&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-08 19:59:37.578585

International Motors detailed plans for its upcoming S13 integrated powertrain designed to comply with Environmental Protection Agency emissions requirements for 2027 model-year trucks, a deadline it and other manufacturers must hit despite some uncertainty surrounding details on the final rule.

“We are marching forward as though this emissions regulation lands at the beginning of 2027,” Dan Kayser, executive vice president of commercial operations at International, said during a Jan. 7 media roundtable. “We haven’t altered our plans there at all. We’re marching [on] as though this happens January of 2027. We have no reason to believe that won’t be the case.”

American Trucking Associations in August 2025 asked EPA to delay by four years implementation of the rules’ stricter nitrogen oxide limits, citing “substantial compliance costs and operational burdens at a time when the trucking industry is already contending with historically difficult market conditions.” The federation in November notified members that EPA had rejected that request, but said the agency through an ongoing rulemaking may make other adjustments. Among them are the possible elimination of extended warranty periods set to take effect in 2027, along with revisions to “useful life standards” and other technical changes.

Lingering uncertainty over the rule’s future driven by EPA statements from March 2025 about stalling certain pending regulations compelled Cummins in August to delay the launch of its 2027-compliant X15 diesel engine.

EPA told ATA it will leave in place a Biden-era requirement that NOx emissions for heavy-duty trucks drop to 35 milligrams per horsepower-hour from 200 mg/horsepower-hour. The agency is expected to publish an updated rule in March or April.

Availability for the updated S13 powertrain is likely a few months away, Kayser said.

“My best estimate is probably mid-2026 as a rough estimate, but it’s just a rough estimate at this point in time as to what I would expect,” he told Transport Topics. A full understanding of the regulations is needed before the order book opens, and the same is true for pricing, he noted.

“There are costs associated with the new emission standard that aren’t just the products — they’re useful life, warranty, and so forth and so on,” Kayser said. “We don’t have great clarity yet on those pieces, which makes it a little bit hard to really lean in.”

Analysts and OEMs had expected a robust so-called “pre-buy” of 2025 and 2026 model-year trucks from fleets in the lead-up to the 2027 rules, but a persistently weak freight market has kept customers on the sidelines.

Powertrain Enhancements

The S13 integrated powertrain was initially launched in August 2022.

Enhancements for the updated powertrain include:

Variable valve timing for the S13 engine, enabling variable valve braking for improved braking performance.

A 24-volt transmission control module for the T14 transmission with predictive shifting using GPS/topography data.

A standardized 24-volt electrical architecture across the powertrain platform, which can enhance cold-crank performance. A 12-volt cab and chassis electrical system is retained.

“[Exhaust gas recirculation] is fully eliminated,” said International VP of Integrated Sales David Hillman. “The compression release brake performance is going to be noticeably better because of the variable valve technology that we’re bringing to the market. The transmission gets the benefit of even faster and smoother shifts with the electronic clutch actuator because we’re running on 24 volts.”

Kayser noted that service training at dealers will begin in late 2026. “We’ve been preparing for EPA 2027 for years. Our customers won’t face surprises, only the same proven powertrain,” he said in a statement.

Kayser noted that the engine upgrades are part of wider changes at International. The company unveiled a revamp of its HV series of vocational Class 8 trucks in September 2024.

Kayser stressed that the market outlook for trucks with the new powertrain remains murky.

“The market’s still very weak, and we expect ’26 to at least start out in a fairly weak position, and then we’ll see where it goes,” he said. “It’s very hard right now to predict what order intake will be. It’s been quite hard throughout 2025.”

He noted, however, that December showed some hopeful signs.

“December was certainly, from a historic perspective, strong,” Kayser said. “We think that a little bit of further clarification on sort of tariff impacts and [possibly] allowed people to think a little bit more openly about releasing [capital expenditures] now. The big question is: Is this a blip on the radar screen? In January, I’m going to be looking with a very close set of eyes to see if we see any carryover.”

December’s preliminary North America Class 8 net orders totaled 42,700 units, a jump of 16% year over year, according to ACT Research data released Jan. 5.

In contrast, November orders slumped 47% year on year to 19,700, ACT said. The 10-year average for the month is 28,910, according to FTR Transportation Intelligence. Truck makers’ order books for the coming calendar year typically open in September.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2026-01/International-1200.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 23:58:14.442325

“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.
The United States, under the Biden administration, had promised to cut its emissions by 61% to 66% by 2035.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the entire United Nations climate-fighting apparatus takes America’s environmental isolation to another level and is likely to damage both the United States and the world as the planet flirts with ecological tipping points, experts say.

Leaders from around the world say the United States will be left behind as more than 190 other nations join in what they call a blossoming green economy that is transitioning from polluting coal, oil and gas to cleaner and cheaper solar, wind and other renewable energies.

Wednesday’s action starts the process to pull the U.S. out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It’s the main way nations negotiate, monitor and enforce agreements to curb worsening climate change, and is a bigger step than Trump’s 2017 and 2025 withdrawals from the bedrock 2015 Paris Agreement aimed at limiting warming.

The framework was negotiated in Brazil in 1992, championed by Republican U.S. President George H.W. Bush and ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate. It’s what Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden used to justify signing and reactivating the Paris deal without needing Senate approval. The Trump administration also withdrew Wednesday from a United Nations climate science panel, a biodiversity-saving effort and the Green Climate Fund to help poor nations as well as many other international collaborations.

“It is a more serious step definitely. The world loses a lot and it is very damaging,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “The U.S. turns its back against science, against global collaboration, against any kind of action on climate change. So, yes, in that sense, it’s more fundamental and more damaging” than earlier efforts.

“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in announcing the U.S. withdrawal, said the Trump administration “has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.”

Since 1850, the United States has put more than 480 billion tons (440 billion metric tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. That accounts for nearly one-quarter of the world’s historic emissions of a gas that stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, according to the scientists at the Global Carbon Project.

Emissions keep rising despite Paris agreement

Under the Paris agreement, countries voluntarily pledge to curb emissions by various amounts, but each year global emissions continue to rise. The United States, under the Biden administration, had promised to cut its emissions by 61% to 66% by 2035.

“It will mean more warming because the U.S. is not going to be fulfilling its obligations of reducing their emissions,” said Adelle Thomas, climate adaptation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council and also a vice chair of the U.N. climate science panel that Trump is quitting.

And it comes at a critical time as Earth is approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times — the internationally agreed warming threshold established in Paris, Thomas and Rockstrom said.

“We need to start reducing emissions globally by 5% per year,” Rockstrom said. “It’s our last chance. And exactly at that moment, the biggest player in the world steps out of the game.”

The world is perilously close to several “tipping points’ of irreversible change, such as coral reef loss, said former Ireland president Mary Robinson, a tireless climate change advocate for the group of retired leaders called The Elders.

”We really have no time and it is so unbelievably stupid at one level and reckless for the Trump administration to be taking the steps that they are taking,” she said.

Another step in U.S. shift away from leading on climate

In past international climate negotiations, especially when Democrat John Kerry was secretary of state or America’s top climate envoy, the United States kept oil countries, such as Saudi Arabia, from watering down deals too much, experts said. But that was missing last November in Brazil’s negotiations, which the U.S. skipped under Trump.

Kerry called Trump’s action “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which represents industries that emit much of the heat-trapping gases, said “removing the U.S. from the U.N. climate framework will accelerate a positive shift towards abandoning the destructive global climate framework.”

Thomas, Rockstrom and Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who helped fashion the Paris agreement, said the United States is leaving itself behind in a new, cleaner world of cheaper energy and more jobs.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said Trump’s move will hurt the U.S.

“It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport and insurance for American households and businesses, as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses and infrastructure harder each year,” he said.

Some environmental advocates have feared that future presidents won’t be able to easily reinstate the U.S. to the climate convention in an era when Senate approval would likely be far harder.

But Sue Biniaz, a former State Department lawyer and deputy chief negotiator who now teaches at Yale, said the next president would have the power to undo Trump’s action.

“I wouldn’t want to say any sort of damaging action or inaction is irreversible,” Biniaz said. “I imagine a future U.S. government would work with other countries to revive as much as possible. We did that in 2021 after the first Trump administration.’’

The Trump administration also withdrew Wednesday from a United Nations climate science panel, a biodiversity-saving effort and the Green Climate Fund to help poor nations as well as many other international collaborations.

“It is a more serious step definitely. The world loses a lot and it is very damaging,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “The U.S. turns its back against science, against global collaboration, against any kind of action on climate change. So, yes, in that sense, it’s more fundamental and more damaging” than earlier efforts.

“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in announcing the U.S. withdrawal, said the Trump administration “has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.”

Since 1850, the United States has put more than 480 billion tons (440 billion metric tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. That accounts for nearly one-quarter of the world’s historic emissions of a gas that stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, according to the scientists at the Global Carbon Project.

Emissions keep rising despite Paris agreement

Under the Paris agreement, countries voluntarily pledge to curb emissions by various amounts, but each year global emissions continue to rise. The United States, under the Biden administration, had promised to cut its emissions by 61% to 66% by 2035.

“It will mean more warming because the U.S. is not going to be fulfilling its obligations of reducing their emissions,” said Adelle Thomas, climate adaptation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council and also a vice chair of the U.N. climate science panel that Trump is quitting.

And it comes at a critical time as Earth is approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times — the internationally agreed warming threshold established in Paris, Thomas and Rockstrom said.

“We need to start reducing emissions globally by 5% per year,” Rockstrom said. “It’s our last chance. And exactly at that moment, the biggest player in the world steps out of the game.”

The world is perilously close to several “tipping points’ of irreversible change, such as coral reef loss, said former Ireland president Mary Robinson, a tireless climate change advocate for the group of retired leaders called The Elders.

”We really have no time and it is so unbelievably stupid at one level and reckless for the Trump administration to be taking the steps that they are taking,” she said.

Another step in U.S. shift away from leading on climate

In past international climate negotiations, especially when Democrat John Kerry was secretary of state or America’s top climate envoy, the United States kept oil countries, such as Saudi Arabia, from watering down deals too much, experts said. But that was missing last November in Brazil’s negotiations, which the U.S. skipped under Trump.

Kerry called Trump’s action “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which represents industries that emit much of the heat-trapping gases, said “removing the U.S. from the U.N. climate framework will accelerate a positive shift towards abandoning the destructive global climate framework.”

Thomas, Rockstrom and Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who helped fashion the Paris agreement, said the United States is leaving itself behind in a new, cleaner world of cheaper energy and more jobs.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said Trump’s move will hurt the U.S.

“It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport and insurance for American households and businesses, as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses and infrastructure harder each year,” he said.

Some environmental advocates have feared that future presidents won’t be able to easily reinstate the U.S. to the climate convention in an era when Senate approval would likely be far harder.

But Sue Biniaz, a former State Department lawyer and deputy chief negotiator who now teaches at Yale, said the next president would have the power to undo Trump’s action.

“I wouldn’t want to say any sort of damaging action or inaction is irreversible,” Biniaz said. “I imagine a future U.S. government would work with other countries to revive as much as possible. We did that in 2021 after the first Trump administration.’’

I will keep working closely with Northwest Washington leaders to bring home federal dollars that improve the communities I represent.”

Larsen’s Requested Funding for Local Projects Included

Last year, Rep. Larsen requested $1.6 million for two Whatcom County community projects. Funding for those projects is included in the FY26 spending package.

$1,031,000 for Western Washington University’s (WWU) Shannon Point Marine Center Research Vessel: This funding will support acquisition of a new research vessel for WWU marine and coastal science educational and research activities.

$600,000 for Whatcom County Sheriff Office’s Portable Radio Replacement Project: This funding will support the purchase of new portable radios to replace outdated radios that are failing, allowing deputies to communicate clearly with dispatch and each other.

“Congressional support from Representative Rick Larsen for a new research vessel at Western Washington University’s Shannon Point Marine Center is a vital investment in the Salish Sea,” said WWU President Sabah Randhawa. “This vessel will expand hands-on learning for students, create new research opportunities for faculty, and strengthen partnerships with Tribal nations and state agencies advancing critical research and restoration in the North Puget Sound. We are deeply grateful to Representative Larsen for his leadership and support.”

Larsen Priorities for Environment, Economic Development, Law Enforcement Included

The final package also provides funding for several Northwest Washington priorities, including:

$65 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, which supports state and Tribal habitat restoration projects to reverse the decline of Pacific salmon and steelhead and support conservation efforts in Washington and the Pacific Northwest.

$1.285 million for Washington’s Regional Fisheries, restoring funding the Administration refused to allocate in Fiscal Year 2025. In August, Rep. Larsen and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) led Washington state’s Democratic Congressional delegation in sending a letter to Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum urging him to reverse the Trump administration’s disastrous decision to eliminate funding for Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups (RFEGs).

$40 million for the National Estuary Program (NEP), which is a non-regulatory program that supports locally driven efforts to restore and protect the environmental and economic health of 28 estuaries of national significance, including Puget Sound. In June, Rep. Larsen introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the NEP through 2031.

$56 million for EPA’s Puget Sound Geographic Program, which supports restoration and research projects.

$3.473 billion for Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund projects, which will help support ports in the Puget Sound region.

$1 million to establish a new Northwest Regional Commission that will coordinate economic development opportunities in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.

$329 million for the Weatherization Assistance Program that helps families reduce home energy bills.

$964 million for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program, which provides funding for regional drug task forces that help Washington state communities fight the opioid epidemic.

$800 million for Community Oriented Policing Services Grants, which awards funds to hire community policing professionals, develop and test innovative policing strategies, and provide training and technical assistance to community members, local government leaders, and all levels of law enforcement.

Accessing energy is essential for the Reserve’s resilience, and Pitts plays a major role in ensuring the Reserve’s energy resilience.
Melissa Johnson, REM program manager said Pitts’ position is unique to the REM program.
“She is the Army Reserve go-to person, central point to all USAR, to assist within Enterprise Building Control System (EBCS), Facility Related Control Systems (FRCS) and the Reserve Army Metering Program,” Johnson said.
“Army Reserve Centers are located across a wide geographic footprint, and some sites are located in more remote or out-of-the-way locations,” Pitts said.","REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. –Maintaining and documenting numbers for Army Reserve’s growing network of automated, data-driven facilities is a daunting mission.

A contractor serving as a resource efficiency manager (REM) under the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville’s Energy Division is turning that mission into reality.

Alexandra Pitts, a Lindahl Reed, Inc. contractor working under the management of the Center’s REM Program, is the technical link powering the Reserve’s unified energy control system.

Energy data collection and facility automation are becoming essential to military readiness, and the Army Reserve’s digital modernization efforts are bringing thousands of facilities together under one secure, unified system.

With over 200 thousand Soldiers and Civilian employees operating within more than 40 million square feet of building space spread across the nation, the Army Reserve is a major energy consumer. Accessing energy is essential for the Reserve’s resilience, and Pitts plays a major role in ensuring the Reserve’s energy resilience.

Prior to entering the federal facilities sector, Pitts worked with a residential heating and air conditioning company, where she gained early exposure to HVAC systems, field operations, and the importance of efficiency and proper system performance.

That experience helped build a practical foundation that later supported her transition into the commercial and federal facilities environment.

In 2011 Pitts began working with Johnson Controls Federal Systems as part of the integration team embedded into the Directorate of Public Works at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She worked closely with project teams and government personnel to help organize workflows, documentation, and coordination for building integration projects as they were brought online. As the program expanded, Pitts’ role evolved into a project coordination position supporting building automation and integration projects across multiple facilities.

Following a reduction in force at Johnson Controls in 2018, Pitts took the opportunity to formalize and expand my technical background. Within weeks, she began the process of returning to school (her academic background was originally in speech pathology) and was accepted into Bismarck State College’s National Energy Center of Excellence within the Energy Management program.

She enrolled in early 2019 and focused on coursework related to energy efficiency, building systems, utilities and facility optimization and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in energy management, in 2020.

Melissa Johnson, REM program manager said Pitts’ position is unique to the REM program.

“She doesn't have the normal REM focus, nor does she cover one garrison or even a region; she is the REM for all of Army Reserve locations,” Johnson said.

Johnson said Pitts’ experience and knowledge with controls systems and troubleshooting issues is valuable USAR installations to have properly running systems, which allows them to have accurate system controls and reporting building information.

“She is the Army Reserve go-to person, central point to all USAR, to assist within Enterprise Building Control System (EBCS), Facility Related Control Systems (FRCS) and the Reserve Army Metering Program,” Johnson said.

“She came onboard with Huntsville Center in 2024 and is exactly what we are looking for in the REM program.”

Pitts currently supports the Army Reserve’s EBCS program by helping simplify and improve how facilities manage their energy use across widely scattered locations.

Her role involves coordinating and implementing JACE software updates, module installations, ensuring the devices are functional, compliant, and reporting properly within the EBCS platform to support secure remote monitoring and enhanced operational visibility.

Coordinating software updates, installing new system components, and making sure the equipment in each building operates correctly, meets program standards, and sends accurate information into the EBCS platform, her work ensures secure remote monitoring and gives Army Reserve leadership clearer insight into how their facilities are performing.

“I serve as a technical liaison between USARC Headquarters and the Readiness Division REMs, helping ensure consistent EBCS implementation across all divisions,” Pitts said.

As part of her fieldwork, Pitts often conducts site visits to Army Reserve centers across multiple Readiness Divisions depending on project needs or field-level troubleshooting requests related to the JACEs.

Travel is a regular part of Pitts’ role as an REM. Under normal circumstances, Pitts said site visits are typically planned every couple of months as needed, depending on system conditions, project activity, and facility support requirements.

“Army Reserve Centers are located across a wide geographic footprint, and some sites are located in more remote or out-of-the-way locations,” Pitts said.

“While my travel to date has been within the continental United States, the dispersed nature of Reserve facilities requires coordination across regions and locations.”

These visits involve general facility walkthroughs to assess the presence, status, and connectivity of JACE devices and utility meters, including water, gas, and electric, within the EBCS framework.

Pitts said coordinating travel to Reserve Centers isn’t nearly as difficult as the coordination required managing the complexity that comes with supporting buildings when there are many moving parts involved.

She said working with multiple stakeholders, including different contractors, technical teams, and local site personnel, is often quite complex.

“These groups often operate with different processes, timelines, and levels of system familiarity,” she said.

“Ensuring everyone is aligned and informed before work is performed is critical, since even well-intended changes can unintentionally impact other efforts if communication is not properly coordinated.”

Pitts said maintaining clear points of contact, understanding site-specific conditions, and ensuring that work is properly sequenced helps prevent duplication or conflicting changes.

Bridging those gaps, Pitts said, keeps efforts aligned across locations is a key challenge, but an important one.

“The most gratifying aspect of the work is seeing those efforts come together successfully,” Pitts said.

When Pitts is in the field, a lot of her focus is on ensuring the JACE is properly installed, physically connected, and actively communicating with the building’s control system so data can be transmitted to the centralized EBCS platform.

Pitts also verifies whether meters are present and correctly wired into the system.

If meters are missing or not visibly located, she documents those findings so they can be flagged for follow-up or considered for inclusion in future integration projects.

Pitts also supports troubleshooting efforts for energy managers and HVAC teams by assisting with JACE connectivity issues, offline devices, platform/station access, and verifying proper communication between JACEs and the EBCS system.

Additionally, when requested, she reviews system trend data and meter performance. This includes tasks such as verifying pulse counts from water meters and pulling historical point data to support troubleshooting efforts and ensure accurate reporting within EBCS platform.

Since Joining Lindahl Reed and becoming part of the REM program, she earned her Certified Energy Manager (CEM) credential and completed both the Niagara N4 and Reflow certifications—tools essential to the EBCS platform.

“These certifications have strengthened my ability to support system-level operations and ensure accurate, real-time data visualization through customized graphical interfaces,” Pitts said.

For Pitts, job satisfaction comes from assisting technicians, helping troubleshoot issues, or providing clarity around how systems are designed to function.

“Seeing a project reach completion and knowing it was implemented correctly and adds real operational value is what makes the work meaningful to me,” she said.",https://api.army.mil/e2/c/images/2026/01/08/225c1f53/max1200.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:12:42.401657

Companies request CBI claims as to proprietary information or knowledge – such as manufacturing processes and chemical formulas – that could give competitors an advantage if gone unprotected. This expiration date was set in 2016 under the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amended and modernized the TSCA, a mechanism by which the EPA can collect a variety of information relating to health and chemical safety, some of which falls under the CBI qualification.

To account for this need for confidentiality while still achieving one of the primary aims of the Lautenberg Act – increasing public transparency concerning chemical information that could potentially affect Americans’ health and safety – Congress amended the TSCA to, for the first time, have CBI claims expire while still enabling stakeholders to submit CBI claims to the EPA without fear the agency would publicly release the protected information, as it is now legally prohibited from doing. Most CBI claims expire about a decade following their submission.

The expiring CBI claims that are the focus of this week’s announcement were submitted by companies right after the TSCA was amended via the Lautenberg Act in June 2016 and therefore will expire this June.

The EV fee hikes are expected to generate about $12 million a year in new revenue — a small fraction of the larger road funding deal signed into law by Gov.
The nonprofit Ecology Center estimates that Michigan EV owners were already paying about $20 more than gas-powered vehicle owners annually in transportation-related taxes.
“This deal, one that many said couldn’t be done, repairs our local roads and gives stability to road funding for the future.
“We’ve continued to hear over decades that road funding is a major priority for the Legislature,” Binoniemi said.","Michigan’s roughly 122,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle owners are in for some sticker shock the next time they renew their plates.

Their annual vehicle registration fees have skyrocketed to the nation’s highest in 2026, the result of a road funding package passed last fall that had little financial impact on gas-powered vehicle owners.

While critics of the EV fee hike call it an unfair tax on a user group that’s already paying more to maintain Michigan’s roughly 120,000 miles of paved public roadways, proponents contend it fairly charges EV drivers for their use of the roads.

“The goal was not to nick or punish anyone. We don’t want an undue burden on anybody,” state Rep. Tom Kunse, R-Clare, told Bridge Michigan on Tuesday. “But, if we look at the math, I think it’s right where it should be.”

Under the formula triggered by last year’s road funding deal, annual registration fees for light-duty EVs are increasing from $160 to $267, while plug-in hybrid fees are going from $60 to $113. That’s on top of the state’s base registration fees, which apply to all vehicles and vary depending on the vehicle’s value.

The fee hike makes Michigan the most expensive among 40 states that charge a special EV registration fee, according to nationaldatabases maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures and the Tax Foundation. Hawaii and South Dakota have the lowest fees at $50 per vehicle, while the national average is a little over $100.

“The thinking in the EV community is that this is way beyond what EV drivers should be made to pay,” said Karl Bloss, a longtime EV owner in Muskegon.

But efforts to undo the change are unlikely to gain traction in the Legislature.

How we got here

Like other states, Michigan has long used gas taxes and vehicle registration fees to fund its road system. But lawmakers and advocates have long complained that it’s not generating enough money, leaving Michigan with among the most pothole-riddled roads in the nation.

Last fall, lawmakers struck a funding deal that is expected to eventually generate more than $1.8 billion a year for roads, including about $1 billion this fiscal year. The deal relies in part on abolishing Michigan’s 6% sales tax on gas – which funds things other than roads – while raising Michigan’s fuel tax from 31 cents to 52.4 cents a gallon.

While internal combustion engine drivers will see virtually no change in their price at the pump, the newly enacted plan triggered a 2015 law that ties EV registration fees to the cost of the gas tax, resulting in the spike in EV fees.

Michigan lawmakers in 2015 authorized a special registration surcharge for EVs and plug-in hybrids that took effect in 2017. It’s meant to ensure EV drivers help pay for road upkeep despite the fact that they don’t buy gas.

The law triggers an increase of $5 for EVs and $2.50 for hybrids for every cent that Michigan’s gas tax rises above 19 cents.

The EV fee hikes are expected to generate about $12 million a year in new revenue — a small fraction of the larger road funding deal signed into law by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer that also includes more than $400 million a year from a new wholesale marijuana tax.

But EV advocates are crying foul, arguing the fee hike is unfair. The nonprofit Ecology Center estimates that Michigan EV owners were already paying about $20 more than gas-powered vehicle owners annually in transportation-related taxes.

Proponents of the fee hike dispute that math.

“We still don’t even think, with this increase, that they’re still paying their fair share,” said Lance Binoniemi, vice president of government affairs for the Michigan Infrastructure & Transportation Association.

What next?

Sen. Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, last fall proposed a bill aiming to lessen the blow to EV drivers by lowering the fee increase to a respective $1.88 and 94 cents for every penny increase to the gas tax.

That would have meant a $63 fee hike for EV owners this year, as opposed to $107 under the enacted road funding deal, and a $32 fee hike for plug-in hybrid owners, down from $53.

The Senate Appropriations Committee held a hearing on the bill in November but did not vote on it. Even if approved by the full Senate this year, House Speaker Matt Hall has made clear he does not plan to take up the EV fee reduction proposal.

“I negotiated this historic roads deal with the governor, and the Legislature, including Senator Singh, voted for it,” Hall, R-Richland Township, said Tuesday in a statement provided to Bridge. “This deal, one that many said couldn’t be done, repairs our local roads and gives stability to road funding for the future. His bill would be going back on the deal we all agreed to, and that’s not how deals work.”

Singh, however, said this week he thinks EV fees are still a topic worth discussing, noting that lawmakers stressed throughout the road funding conversation that any change to sales tax at the pump would be revenue neutral for drivers.

“We had obviously tried to bring the issue up during negotiations,” he said, referring to his own legislation. “I think, unfortunately, there were so many moving pieces that this is one of the pieces that got left behind.”

Although the road funding deal represents an historic investment in Michigan’s roads, some say it’s still not enough to fix them.

Michigan has the 40th worst-maintained roads in the nation, according to the nonprofit Citizens Research Council. Initial plans from both Whitmer and House Republicans had called for about $3 billion a year to fix them. The road-building lobby, meanwhile, contends Michigan needs $3.9 billion more a year.

“We’ve continued to hear over decades that road funding is a major priority for the Legislature,” Binoniemi said. “We’ve heard many different legislatures say that, but we’ve never come up with a full, long-term, sustainable solution that actually solves the problem.”

Long-term, both EV and infrastructure advocates say they want a more equitable road funding formula that charges drivers based on road usage, rather than the type of vehicle they drive.

“To be clear, there needed to be a road funding fix,” said Sophia Schuster, policy principal with the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, but the end result of this one is “not fair.”

Last year, lawmakers directed the Michigan Department of Transportation to study the concept of a usage charge in order to ensure stable road funding as more fuel-efficient vehicles and EVs cut into gas tax revenue.

Other states such as Oregon and Utah have experimented with a mileage tax, but critics have raised privacy concerns about GPS data collection devices used to track miles driven.

A flurry of changes for EV drivers

Bloss, the EV driver from Muskegon, predicted the fee hike won’t drive any EV owners back into gas cars. But it might prompt EV-curious buyers to stick with gas for a little longer.

From his perspective, the benefits of EV ownership still outweigh the costs. Refueling his EV costs less than half the price-per-mile of gas, he has no need for scheduled oil changes or belt replacements, and with at-home charging, “I never have to stand in the slush and fill up my car in the middle of a blizzard.”

The state fee hike for EV owners joins a flurry of other recent policy changes that have made EV ownership more expensive, contributing to lackluster EV adoption.

EVs account for 1.3% of the roughly 8 million vehicle registrations in Michigan, according to the Department of State. That’s below the national average of about 2%.

While the 102,549 EVs registered in Michigan today represent a marked increase from 20,000 in 2022, the state is not on pace to meet Whitmer’s goal of putting 2 million EVs on Michigan roads by 2030. There are another 19,226 plug-in hybrids registered in the state, according to Secretary of State data.

Whitmer’s office declined to comment on the new EV registration fee hike.

Beyond the state fee increase, President Donald Trump has canceled the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV purchases put in place by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, revoked grants and incentives for EV manufacturing and delayed disbursements from a multi-billion-dollar fund for EV charging stations along the nation’s major highways.

Those policy shifts are expected to slow consumer uptake of EVs. Indeed, both Ford Motor Co. and General Motors have downscaled their EV ambitions in the past year and reprioritized gas and hybrid manufacturing. Experts have said they expect the EV transition to continue, albeit more slowly, as buyers are drawn to the anticipated release of cheaper EV models that, when combined with lower maintenance and fueling costs, are expected to make EVs more affordable than gas-powered cars.

DETROIT, Jan 8 (Reuters) – General Motors said on Thursday it would take a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments, the latest car company to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration’s policies and fading demand.

The charge stems from reducing its planned EV production and the fallout on the supply chain, GM said in ‍a regulatory filing, and comes weeks after rival Ford Motor announced a similar but much bigger charge.

Most of GM’s writedown – a $4.2 billion cash charge – is related to contract cancellations and settlements with suppliers, who had planned for much higher production volumes before the market turned.

GM said the writedown would not affect its U.S. lineup of roughly a dozen EV models, which is the industry’s broadest offering of battery-powered vehicles. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,” it said in its filing.

The company will record the charge as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings report. It expects to incur additional charges in 2026 ‌as a result of negotiations with its supply base, but expects them to be less than its 2025 ‌EV charges.

GM PLACED A BIG BET ON EVs

Many automakers, including GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, have been dialing back factory work on EVs since last summer, when U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending package darkened the outlook for the EV market. Sales of battery-powered vehicles have cratered following the elimination on September 30 of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

Ford in December said it would take a $19.5 billion writedown over several quarters as ​it canceled several EV programs, including the fully electric version of its F-150 Lightning truck and an additional electric truck and van.

GM, the largest U.S. automaker by sales, made one of the biggest bets on EVs among global automakers, at one point vowing to essentially phase out internal-combustion ‍cars and trucks by 2035.

While the company has not publicly walked back the 2035 ​goal, analysts have sharply cut the industry’s EV sales forecast into the next decade for the U.S., GM’s ​largest and most profitable market. GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will respond to customer demand.

GM’s EV sales had started gaining traction in ‍late 2024 after years of manufacturing setbacks. The company rolled out more lower-cost offerings, helping it reach No. 2 in sales behind Tesla.

The company also said on Thursday that it would record a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its ongoing restructuring of its China joint venture.

The automaker began writing down some EV-related investments last year, including a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge. This month, GM halted production of EV batteries at two joint-venture plants for six months and cut production to one shift at an EV-only factory in Detroit.

The company also pivoted away ‍from plans for another Michigan factory that was slated to build EVs, and instead will build the Cadillac Escalade and full-size pickups, it has said.

EV SALES ARE DOWN INDUSTRYWIDE

GM’s EV sales dropped 43% in the fourth quarter after the loss of the consumer tax credit. Sales hit record highs ‍in the previous three months, when customers rushed to ‍buy EVs before the credit ended.

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2% in 2025 from the previous ​year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.

Automotive data provider Edmunds ​expects EVs ⁠to account for about 6% of overall U.S. vehicle sales in 2026, down from 7.4% in 2025.

Ford’s ‌shift, in which it essentially killed off its entire planned second generation of EVs, resulted in a much higher charge. Ford CEO Jim Farley said it was a painful but necessary move as the market cooled.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Farley told Reuters in a December interview.

Ford is now setting its EV hopes on a brand-new architecture that will enable the production of affordable models, starting with a $30,000 electric pickup in 2027.

Motor City, the former automotive center of Detroit, is the first place in the nation to roll out a public EV-charging road. The road charges electric vehicles wirelessly as the drive along it.

The EV-charging road is one mile long and comes from the Michigan Department of Transportation, while the tech comes from Electreon. It includes copper coils a few inches below the pavement that provide the opportunity for inductive charging. Of course, the electric vehicles also need components to allow wireless EV charging. They need a certain receiver plate onboard.

The charging capacity of the road is 15–16 kW. That’s not going to pump a lot of electricity into your car driving just a mile over the road. However, if this charging solution was implemented broadly around a city, it would provide enough electricity for most drivers to cover a huge portion of their charging needs, if not all of them.

I saw a headline about this EV road last month implying that it had just gone live, which confused me, because I thought we had written about it going live a long time ago. Well, we had. This road become operational in 2023.

“In February 2022, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, in coordination with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification (OFME) and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), announced that Electreon had won a tender to deploy a 1 mile (1.61 km) wireless Electric Road System in downtown Detroit, Michigan as part of Michigan Central Station, a new mobility innovation hub being developed in partnership with Ford, the city of Detroit, and the state of Michigan. The project will serve as North America’s first public Electric Road System for wireless charging of electric vehicles, and will also include static (stationary) wireless charge points as well,” Electroen writes.

“In addition to market entry into the U.S., the primary goals of the pilot will be to showcase the viability and effectiveness of wireless dynamic charging on public roads for multiple vehicle types and use cases in a real-world scenario — such as, but not limited to, transit buses, passenger shuttles, and last-mile delivery trucks. The pilot will also serve as a potential first step towards much larger Electric Road Systems being considered in multiple U.S. states and aims to build partnerships with U.S. based vehicle and infrastructure companies in order to serve as a blueprint for future collaboration and growth.”

Well, that’s great and all, but it’s 2026 now and I haven’t seen any news about another EV-charging road — public or private — coming to a town near you or me. Is the technology viable? Does it make enough sense when you pull out the spreadsheets and crunch the numbers, from any type of perspective — public or private?

Well, in September, Electreon signed a collaboration agreement with autonomous vehicle company ATLoS in Portugal, “starting with vehicles operating along fixed routes within manufacturing compounds, logistics hubs, and warehouse environments—key target sectors for both companies.” In October, Electreon launched another pilot induction charging system in France on a motorway. “The project is now entering a new phase, with prototype vehicles—including a heavy-duty truck, a utility vehicle, a passenger car, and a bus—driving on the motorway under real traffic conditions,” the company wrote.

This will prevent homicides through the early detection of non-fatal strangulation incidents as well as timely and appropriate prosecution of domestic violence perpetrators. This project is meant to address domestic and sexual violence, which remains a major concern in Southern Nevada with the state ranking second in the nation for domestic violence. Currently, the region lacks the critical infrastructure to reduce these incidents and implement a fuller community effort.

Over $1 million for the Nevada System of Higher Education’s Mitigating Wildfire Smoke Impacts in Nevada Project. This will enable the Desert Research Institute to partner with NASA to utilize satellite technology combined with AI to mitigate risks associated with wildland fire smoke in Las Vegas and across Nevada. As wildland fires grow in frequency and severity, the dangers to public health and safety have increased exponentially. This project will work to better track, map, and forecast fires and smoke.

Rep. Titus also helped secure significant investments for our public lands and natural landscapes:

Rejects President Trump's proposed cuts to Bureau of Land Management: Secured $1.26 billion for the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Management of Lands and Resources and $59 million for BLM's National Conservation Lands, rejecting deep cuts to both accounts proposed in President Trump's budget request. Congresswoman Titus led an appropriations letter calling for robust funding for both accounts, which are vital to the management and protection of public lands.

Protecting Jobs: The bill includes guardrails to ensure that the BLM maintains staffing levels to protect natural and cultural resources, maintain safe and appropriate access and recreation, and consult with tribes. As a proud member of the House Labor Caucus, Congresswoman Titus has spoken out against efforts by the Trump Administration to lay off federal workers or coerce them into leaving public service.

And $1 million for the Invasive Species in Alpine Lakes Pilot Program. Congresswoman Titus led provisions to reauthorize this vital program as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2024.

The legislation also addresses some of our nation’s biggest challenges:

Maintaining Fiscal Responsibility: Reasserts Congress’s power of the purse through mandatory staffing thresholds and notification requirements;

Keeping Energy Costs Down: Helps address higher energy costs and rising utility bills, increasing investment in electric grid infrastructure by $375 million;

Delivering Justice for Women and Girls: Helps keep our communities safe by increasing funding for Violence Against Women Act grants by $7 million;

Protecting our Water Resources: Invests in water infrastructure and climate resilience by increasing funding for the Army Corps of Engineers by $1.8 billion ($10.4 billion total);

Investing in Clean Energy: Provides $3.1 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funding, repudiating the Trump administration’s crusade against clean energy;

Confronting the Climate Crisis: Protects the environment with $8.8 billion in EPA funding – nearly double the White House budget proposal;

Creating American Jobs: Puts more Americans to work in good-paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure; helps small businesses grow and thrive; fosters the green energy jobs of tomorrow; and supports high-quality job training and apprenticeship programs so every American can contribute and succeed.",https://titus.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:02:01.735634

And that there are over 100 data centers here in Central Ohio? We’ll let you do the math on that.

Central Ohio residents were already concerned about the rising amount of data centers. For one, they’re causing a constant noise in some people’s neighborhoods. Residents are also experiencing soaring electric and water bills, and many people that live close to data centers nationwide are reporting severe health complications.

As if those weren’t enough to worry about, now, a proposed Ohio Environmental Protection Agency permit would allow data centers to release wastewater into Ohio’s lakes and streams.

BROUGHT TO YOU BY

If this is approved, a five-year permit would allow certain data centers to release water used to cool down their technology and water from air compressor condensation and boiler blowdowns back into the state’s fresh water resources.

There are some limitations:

Data centers couldn’t discharge water that “exhibits the reasonable potential” to break Ohio’s minimum water quality standards

Any discharged water that isn’t up to public water supply standards couldn’t be discharged within 500 yards upstream from a public water supply intake.

Discharges can’t occur in a lake other than Lake Erie, or into groundwater supplies

Discharges cannot contain large traces of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds

In a statement, Ohio EPA said, “Ohio EPA does not allow discharges that harm aquatic life, recreation, or human health. Every permit includes strict limits and monitoring requirements to ensure water quality standards are met at the state and federal levels.” Even so, environmental groups, as well as citizens, are worried that water would be polluted throughout our state.

In a BBC Article that has gone viral, a Georgia woman discusses her experience living next to a data center. She cannot drink her water anymore. In a Rolling Stones article, data center wastewater in Oregon that’s going back into the fresh water supply is allegedly causing miscarriages and cancers. Jim Doherty, a cattle rancher and former county commissioner of Morrow (in Oregon), led the investigation. Of the first 30 homes he visited, 25 residents recently had miscarriages. Six lost a kidney. One resident had his voice box removed because of a rare cancer only smokers get, although he hadn’t smoked a day of his life.

It comes on top of a $1.6 billion charge it disclosed in October for changes to its EV plans.

It’s another sign of the significant cost to traditional automakers after President Donald Trump ended federal policies that were intended to foster the adoption of zero emissions vehicles.

GM and other automakers invested heavily in EV plans in anticipation of stringent environmental regulations put in place during the Biden administration. They also expected some states to follow the lead of California and ban gas-powered vehicle sales within a decade. GM had previously announced a goal to produce only electric vehicles by 2035.

But the Trump administration has rolled back those emissions rules along with the financial support for EVs. It is also challenging the states’ authority to set their own tougher rules.

Electric cars aren’t going away entirely, however, as significant demand remains in the United States and demand continues to soar higher in other markets.

Much of GM’s $6 billion charge against its earnings will go towards settling canceled contracts with parts suppliers.

GM’s latest charge follows a Ford announcement in December that it would take a similar $19.5 billion charge against its earnings from its own change in EV plans.

GM did not announce that it would be discontinuing any particular electric cars at the moment, nor did it announce that it would be closing any factories or cutting any jobs. But it already announced in October that it would be eliminating one shift at its Factory Zero EV plant in Detroit, placing 1,200 hourly workers on indefinite layoff. It also placed 550 workers at an EV battery plant in Ohio on indefinite layoff as well.

Demand for electric vehicles surged through the summer and September due to the scheduled expiration of a $7,500 US tax credit for EV buyers. But US sales of electric models fell sharply across the industry in the fourth quarter, both compared to a year earlier as well as from the record third quarter.

GM CEO Mary Barra told investors in October that “electric vehicles remain our North Star,” but that it was now clear that sales of cars and trucks with traditional internal combustion engines “will remain higher for longer.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1236631485.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-08 17:01:36.635256

New requirements for utilities to consider upgrades to existing grid and transmission infrastructure that will allow it to operate more efficiently, providing more electricity without requiring expensive new power line construction;

New programs to expand energy storage and implement virtual power plants that tap into extra power from homes and businesses, ensuring electricity is available affordably when it’s needed most;

New and improved energy efficiency programs to help individual households and businesses lower their energy bills while also reducing overall strain on the electric grid;

New energy planning processes to prepare Illinois for future demand, including requiring utilities to align infrastructure planning with projected energy needs and support the growing adoption of electric vehicles and building electrification.

Port Houston

111 East Loop North

Houston, Texas 77029

Via email to cjenkins@porthouston.com.

CC: Maria Aguirre, maguirre@porthouston.com.

Dear Mr. Jenkins,

As elected officials representing communities and people living near the Houston Ship Channel, we write to ask you not to dump dredge material from the Houston Ship Channel Expansion Project 11 in our communities.

Members of the Healthy Port Communities Coalition (HPCC) recently learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) sought and received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to dump Project 11 dredge material in Galveston Bay. We understand that the Port of Houston Authority may be in a position to approve a plan for Project 11 that avoids dumping in the Glendale and Filterbed dredge material placement areas (DMPAs) in Pleasantville.

At the October 24 meeting of the Port Houston Commission, members of the HPCC spoke in favor of a plan to avoid dumping Project 11 dredge material in DMPAs located in communities. HPCC members and their representatives reiterated their specific concerns with the plan to dump Project 11 dredge material in communities.

Mr. Bill Empson, a retired geotechnical engineer from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Risk Management Center, spoke as a private consultant on behalf of the HPCC. Mr. Empson raised the following concerns:

The proposal to use existing dredge material to raise placement area berms, known as “upstream construction” which can also lead to berm failures and was banned in Brazil after multiple failures.

The proposed height of DMPAs qualifies them as dams that should comply with USACE dam safety regulations.

Upstream construction could lead to contaminated soils and offsite runoff.

DMPAs block natural drainage and could increase the risk of neighborhood flooding.

Dr. Paige Varner, a toxicological scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, also spoke at the Commission meeting. Dr. Varner asserted that testing from USACE and communities show that the material from both Project 11 dredging and ongoing maintenance dredging contains potentially hazardous concentrations of chemicals including dioxins, furans, PCBs, arsenic, and PAHs. Several samples taken from the dredge sites and the adjacent placement areas exceed EPA Regional Screening Levels. Dr. Varner also pointed out that the Pleasantville Community already faces some of the highest cancer and non-cancer health risks in the country from air pollution.

Several members of the HPCC, including Bridgette Murray with Achieving Community Tasks Successfully, Leticia Gutierrez with Air Alliance Houston, and Guadalupe Fernandez with Bayou City Waterkeeper, spoke as advocates and as residents of impacted communities. They asked Port Houston not to dump dredge material in their communities.

We write now with the same ask. Please support a plan for Project 11 that does not include the reopening of any DMPAs or the use of DMPAs in communities.

Brooks Landgraf and the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association say the situation compares poorly with Texas’ pro-energy environment.
California sued ExxonMobil and other companies in 2024 about the recyclability of plastics and now ExxonMobil has sued California, claiming the state’s new climate disclosure laws violate the First Amendment.
“Our state has encouraged advanced recycling, modern manufacturing and responsible energy development while enforcing clear, consistent environmental standards.
“As chair of the House Environmental Regulation Committee in Austin, I make sure California-style Green New Deal mandates stop cold before they ever take hold in Texas,” he said.
“In September 2024 California launched a highly publicized lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court, accusing ExxonMobil and others of misleading the public about plastic recyclability over decades,” Longanecker said from Austin.","There’s a legal war going on between the Houston-based ExxonMobil Corp. and the State of California and State Rep. Brooks Landgraf and the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association say the situation compares poorly with Texas’ pro-energy environment.

California sued ExxonMobil and other companies in 2024 about the recyclability of plastics and now ExxonMobil has sued California, claiming the state’s new climate disclosure laws violate the First Amendment.

“Texas delivers real results because we govern with common sense, not courtroom theater,” said Landgraf, an Odessa Republican. “Our state has encouraged advanced recycling, modern manufacturing and responsible energy development while enforcing clear, consistent environmental standards.

“That balanced approach, grounded in science, free enterprise and regulatory certainty, is why Texas leads the nation in energy production and continues to attract investment and jobs, especially in West Texas.”

By contrast, Landgraf said, California has turned environmental policy into a legal and ideological crusade.

“As chair of the House Environmental Regulation Committee in Austin, I make sure California-style Green New Deal mandates stop cold before they ever take hold in Texas,” he said. “Regardless of how those legal fights play out nationwide I will continue fighting to block any radical policies that would ever threaten the Texas Miracle.”

TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said the California standoff “is a clear case of politically motivated regulatory overreach targeting one of America’s most innovative energy companies.

“In September 2024 California launched a highly publicized lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court, accusing ExxonMobil and others of misleading the public about plastic recyclability over decades,” Longanecker said from Austin. “ExxonMobil has forcefully rejected these claims, emphasizing its pioneering role in advanced recycling technologies that have already diverted more than 120 million pounds of plastic waste from landfills and oceans, delivering real, scalable solutions that far outpace California’s rhetoric with actual results.

“ExxonMobil is defending its business against the California attorney general’s campaign of disparagement and defamation, suing him on Jan. 6, 2025, in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas along with the environmental activists who pushed his agenda.”

On Oct. 25, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, ExxonMobil also challenged California’s 2023 disclosure laws, Senate Bills 253 and 261, as blatant violations of the First Amendment, he noted.

“These mandates force large companies operating in the state to report Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and climate risks using frameworks that effectively compel the endorsement of California’s preferred narrative on climate change,” Longanecker said. “ExxonMobil correctly argues that this amounts to unconstitutional compelled speech, overriding the company’s own rigorous, voluntary reporting and clashing with established Supreme Court protections. “The company’s proactive leadership is further evidenced by its recent co-founding of the Carbon Measures coalition, which is developing superior market-driven carbon accounting standards that prioritize accuracy and practicality over ideological mandates.”

He said the national implications of these cases are substantial and TIPRO strongly supports ExxonMobil’s position.

“A victory in the climate disclosure case would help reinforce constitutional limits on state overreach, preventing a costly patchwork of disclosure rules that divert capital from productive innovation,” Longanecker said. “Such an outcome would protect investment across the sector and reinforce America’s energy dominance.

“Texas operators, already benefiting from a pro-innovation climate, would gain even greater advantage as capital continues to flow toward jurisdictions that reward results over excessive regulation or counterproductive litigation.”

Spencer Cox signed a next-generation agreement that builds on a successful shared stewardship partnership. The agreement expands opportunities for timber production, new wood uses, restoring landscapes, and reducing wildfire risk to communities, ecosystems, and local economies across Utah.

“I applaud Gov. Cox for reaffirming the importance of our partnership and recommitting to ensuring healthy forests on public and private lands,” said Chief Schultz. “More importantly, our shared vision includes expansion of sustainable timber production, advancing wood utilization opportunities, accelerating landscape-scale restoration, and increasing the pace and scale of forest treatments to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires, while also seeking additional opportunities for cooperative management of other resources on National Forest System lands. It’s a win for people in Utah and across the nation.”

“Utah knows how to manage land well and has done so successfully, side-by-side with federal partners, for decades. This agreement doesn’t change who owns or controls national forests. It simply lets us work together more efficiently,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. “This allows us to combine capacity, funding and expertise so we can quickly and more effectively care for our forests now and far into the future.”

The agreement follows similar agreements with Montana and Idaho. It also supports implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order 14225, Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production, and strengthens the 2004 Utah Good Neighbor Authority, which allows the Forest Service to authorize states, counties and federally recognized tribes to conduct certain projects on federally managed lands. Through the Good Neighbor Authority, the Forest Service and the state have reduced hazardous fuels and improved forest, rangeland and watershed health, including fish and wildlife habitat.

Agreements like these are essential to maintaining healthy landscapes, thriving rural economies, safer communities, and resilient infrastructure. USDA looks forward to working with all interested states, counties and federally recognized tribes to expand these efforts and deliver lasting benefits for our forests and rural communities.

capacity does not impact today’s retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac E.V.s in production,” G.M.","General Motors on Thursday became the latest automaker to announce a big loss from its investments in electric vehicles, as it reckoned with a slump in sales of those cars after Congress and President Trump overhauled federal policy to favor fossil fuels.

G.M., the largest U.S. carmaker, said it would record a $7.1 billion loss for the last quarter of 2025 primarily to reflect the diminished value of its investments in battery factories and electric vehicle assembly lines.

The loss also reflects compensation that G.M. will pay to suppliers for investments they made to produce components that the automaker no longer needs. About $1.1 billion of the total reflects the cost of restructuring G.M. operations in China that are not related to electric vehicles, the company said.

Policies put in place since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term have forced many carmakers to undertake costly changes. Ford Motor said last month that it would take a $19.5 billion hit to its profits related to its electrical vehicle business.

Electric cars have become more difficult to sell after federal tax credits that covered as much as $7,500 of the cost to buy or lease an electric vehicle were eliminated at the end of September. The Trump administration has also loosened environmental and fuel economy standards that had put pressure on carmakers to sell more electric vehicles, which have no tailpipe emissions.

“With the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, industrywide consumer demand for E.V.s in North America began to slow in 2025,” G.M. said in a securities filing on Thursday.

In October, G.M. announced a third-quarter loss of $1.6 billion stemming from its electric vehicle assets. The company has scaled back plans for electric vehicles while ramping up production of large sport utility vehicles and pickups, which are far more profitable. A G.M. plant in Orion, Mich., is being converted from electric vehicle manufacturing to production of large vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

The company warned that it might book further losses related to electric vehicles in the coming months. But those losses “will be significantly less than the E.V.-related charges incurred in 2025,” G.M. said.

General Motors offers one of the broadest selections of electric vehicles of any carmaker outside China, including luxury vehicles like the Cadillac Escalade IQ and models that sell for less than $40,000 like the Chevrolet Equinox EV. But to make money on those cars, G.M. needs to produce and sell them in much larger numbers to benefit from economies of scale.

Industry executives and analysts expect sales of electric vehicles to begin growing again as early as this year as companies begin selling more electric models for $30,000 or less, including a revived version of G.M.’s Chevrolet Bolt.

There is broad agreement in the industry that U.S. carmakers must keep investing in electric vehicles to compete with Chinese carmakers, like BYD, that are selling a lot more cars across Asia, Europe and Latin America. Tariffs effectively ban Chinese cars from the United States, but industry executives say it will be difficult to keep them out forever.

“Our strategic realignment of E.V. capacity does not impact today’s retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac E.V.s in production,” G.M. said. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08biz-gm-writedown-pgwl/08biz-gm-writedown-pgwl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:00:37.557656

It comes on top of a $1.6 billion charge it disclosed in October for changes to its EV plans.

It’s another sign of the significant cost to traditional automakers after President Donald Trump ended federal policies that were intended to foster the adoption of zero emissions vehicles.

GM and other automakers invested heavily in EV plans in anticipation of stringent environmental regulations put in place during the Biden administration. They also expected some states to follow the lead of California and ban gas-powered vehicle sales within a decade. GM had previously announced a goal to produce only electric vehicles by 2035.

But the Trump administration has rolled back those emissions rules along with the financial support for EVs. It is also challenging the states’ authority to set their own tougher rules.

Electric cars aren’t going away entirely, however, as significant demand remains in the United States and demand continues to soar higher in other markets.

Much of GM’s $6 billion charge against its earnings will go towards settling canceled contracts with parts suppliers.

GM’s latest charge follows a Ford announcement in December that it would take a similar $19.5 billion charge against its earnings from its own change in EV plans.

GM did not announce that it would be discontinuing any particular electric cars at the moment, nor did it announce that it would be closing any factories or cutting any jobs. But it already announced in October that it would be eliminating one shift at its Factory Zero EV plant in Detroit, placing 1,200 hourly workers on indefinite layoff. It also placed 550 workers at an EV battery plant in Ohio on indefinite layoff as well.

Demand for electric vehicles surged through the summer and September due to the scheduled expiration of a $7,500 US tax credit for EV buyers. But US sales of electric models fell sharply across the industry in the fourth quarter, both compared to a year earlier as well as from the record third quarter.

GM CEO Mary Barra told investors in October that “electric vehicles remain our North Star,” but that it was now clear that sales of cars and trucks with traditional internal combustion engines “will remain higher for longer.”

Majority members emphasized nuclear’s role in ensuring firm capacity and energy security, citing recent legislative actions such as the ADVANCE Act as critical steps toward deployment, and framing nuclear expansion as essential for U.S. competitiveness against China and Russia. According to committee chair Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio), “The importance of successful growth of the American nuclear energy cannot be understated. . . . What we need in this country is more energy.”

Others echoed support but raised concerns about maintaining the independence and transparency of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Several warned that political interference and staffing losses could erode public trust—a cornerstone for successful nuclear deployment. Ranking member Kathy Castor (D., Fla.) spoke about wanting to counter the “chaos coming out of the [Trump] administration” by keeping things on track, saying, “If the American public loses that confidence, then the industry will wither.”

Call for action: Witnesses included Maria Korsnick, president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute; John Williams, senior vice president at Southern Company; John Wagner, director of Idaho National Laboratory; and Judi Greenwald, president and CEO of the Nuclear Innovation Alliance.

Korsnick said the U.S. nuclear sector is “at a pivotal moment,” noting that electricity demand is accelerating faster than it has at any other point in decades. She outlined six priorities for congressional leadership: regulatory modernization, financial risk mitigation, fuel supply chain rebuilding, waste strategy, workforce readiness, and global competitiveness.

Williams pointed to lessons learned from Southern Company’s completion of Vogtle-3 and -4—the first new U.S. reactors in more than 30 years—where improved practices cut costs for Unit 4 by about 20 percent, compared with Unit 3. He stressed the need for federal risk-sharing tools, including tax credits and DOE loan support, to overcome high up-front capital costs.

Wagner emphasized the “unprecedented inflection point” for nuclear energy, a rare alignment of market demand, national security priorities, and policy support, and warned that decades of limited deployment have ceded global leadership to China and Russia. He called for sustained investment in advanced reactor demonstrations, fuel cycle capabilities, and waste policy modernization.

Greenwald underscored the importance of NRC independence and transparency, arguing that public trust is essential for scaling nuclear energy. She also urged Congress to ensure adequate staffing and oversight while fully implementing the ADVANCE Act.

Demand, deployment, and trust: Throughout the hearing, members and witnesses agreed that U.S. electricity demand is rising sharply and that nuclear energy must play a central role in meeting it. As Rep. Mariette Miller-Meeks (R., Iowa) said, “The question before us no longer is whether America needs nuclear energy, but how quickly we can deploy it.”

While optimism about nuclear’s future was evident, witnesses and several committee members stressed that success depends on maintaining strong safety standards and an independent regulator.

GM's $6 billion charge linked to EV investment reduction

Most of the writedown tied to supplier payouts for canceled work

GM is latest automaker to walk back EV plans after federal policy changes

DETROIT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab said on Thursday it would take a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments, the latest car company to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration's policies and fading demand.

The charge stems from reducing its planned EV production and the fallout on the supply chain, GM said in a regulatory filing, and comes weeks after rival Ford Motor (F.N), opens new tab announced a similar but much bigger charge.

Stay up to date with the latest news, trends and innovations that are driving the global automotive industry with the Reuters Auto File newsletter. Sign up here.

Most of GM's writedown - a $4.2 billion cash charge - is related to contract cancellations and settlements with suppliers, who had planned for much higher production volumes before the market turned.

GM said the writedown would not affect its U.S. lineup of roughly a dozen EV models, which is the industry’s broadest offering of battery-powered vehicles. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,” it said in its filing.

The company will record the charge as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings report. It expects to incur additional charges in 2026 as a result of negotiations with its supply base, but expects them to be less than its 2025 EV charges.

GM PLACED A BIG BET ON EVs

Many automakers, including GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, have been dialing back factory work on EVs since last summer, when U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending package darkened the outlook for the EV market. Sales of battery-powered vehicles have cratered following the elimination on September 30 of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

Ford in December said it would take a $19.5 billion writedown over several quarters as it canceled several EV programs, including the fully electric version of its F-150 Lightning truck and an additional electric truck and van.

GM, the largest U.S. automaker by sales, made one of the biggest bets on EVs among global automakers, at one point vowing to essentially phase out internal-combustion cars and trucks by 2035.

While the company has not publicly walked back the 2035 goal, analysts have sharply cut the industry’s EV sales forecast into the next decade for the U.S., GM’s largest and most profitable market. GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will respond to customer demand.

GM’s EV sales had started gaining traction in late 2024 after years of manufacturing setbacks. The company rolled out more lower-cost offerings, helping it reach No. 2 in sales behind Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab.

The company also said on Thursday that it would record a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its ongoing restructuring of its China joint venture.

The automaker began writing down some EV-related investments last year, including a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge. This month, GM halted production of EV batteries at two joint-venture plants for six months and cut production to one shift at an EV-only factory in Detroit.

The company also pivoted away from plans for another Michigan factory that was slated to build EVs, and instead will build the Cadillac Escalade and full-size pickups, it has said.

EV SALES ARE DOWN INDUSTRYWIDE

GM’s EV sales dropped 43% in the fourth quarter after the loss of the consumer tax credit. Sales hit record highs in the previous three months, when customers rushed to buy EVs before the credit ended.

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2% in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.

Automotive data provider Edmunds expects EVs to account for about 6% of overall U.S. vehicle sales in 2026, down from 7.4% in 2025.

Ford’s shift, in which it essentially killed off its entire planned second generation of EVs, resulted in a much higher charge. Ford CEO Jim Farley said it was a painful but necessary move as the market cooled.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Farley told Reuters in a December interview.

Ford is now setting its EV hopes on a brand-new architecture that will enable the production of affordable models, starting with a $30,000 electric pickup in 2027.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representatives Rob Menendez (NJ-08) and Greg Casar (TX-35) introduced the Preventing Rate Inflation in Consumer Energy (“PRICE”) Act and the Data Transparency Act, legislation to address skyrocketing energy bills and the environmental impacts of data centers built for artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the country. The bills would require data centers to generate their own renewable energy to reduce strain on the energy grid and require the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Information Administration to collect and update data on the environmental impacts and energy consumption of data centers.

“While AI innovation is promising, we must ensure that our constituents are not negatively impacted because of the industry’s continued growth,” said Congressman Menendez. “New Jersey families have seen their electricity bills increased by 20% because of the rapid growth of energy-intensive AI data centers. Our bills would protect Americans by requiring data centers to generate their own clean energy, transition to 100% renewable sources by 2040, and provide detailed, transparent reporting on their environmental footprint. Addressing the growing energy affordability crisis requires bold solutions, and that is what we are delivering with this legislation that puts working families first.”

“Families should not pay more for utilities so that billionaires can get rich off AI data centers,” said Congressman Casar. “With this bill, Congressman Menendez and I are saying clearly: AI data centers should not be allowed to jack up your electric bill or poison your environment.”

""Energy costs are too high,"" said Karim D. Marshall, Director of Climate and Energy Policy at the Consumer Federation of America. ""Individual consumers should not be forced to pay corporate welfare through higher utility bills. Private-sector data centers should pay their own way and cover their energy costs. Disclosure is important and must be paired with meaningful action. These bills are a welcome and necessary first step in protecting the interests of everyday Americans and their ability to manage home energy costs.""

“Customers can’t afford to foot the bill for AI data centers,” said Charles Harper, Senior Power Sector Lead at Evergreen Action. “Data centers need to bring their own cheap, clean electricity to the table so they don’t spike our power bills and bring pollution to our neighborhoods. We are already seeing historically high power bills—the PRICE Act is exactly the safeguard we need to ensure data centers are paying their fair share. With the Data Center Transparency Act, the public will finally know what is being built in their communities. Data centers require large amounts of electricity—and sometimes bring new sources of pollution to our air and waters. The public has a right to know.”

Electricity consumption in the United States hit a record high in 2024, with data centers accounting for more than 4 percent of total national electricity consumption. That figure is expected to continue to grow in coming years. Last year, the Independent Market Monitor for PJM, the largest grid operator in the country, found that data center load growth is the primary reason for higher energy prices in the PJM region. In New Jersey, families experienced an electricity bill hike of about 20 percent, despite having far fewer data centers than other states in the PJM region.

At the same time, the environmental impact of AI data centers is expected to grow alongside energy demands. Much of the electricity required to power data centers is likely to come from fossil fuels, increasing emissions, and in some instances, worsening air quality in neighboring communities. In addition, data centers use large amounts of water to keep the facilities cool, which has caused serious concerns about their impact on local water systems.

A highway that delivers electricity to trucks as they roll? It’s real on this segment in Indiana.

NCDOT to truckers: Stay on interstates in Western N.C.

International’s engine ready for EPA 2027.

Purdue demonstrates wireless on-highway electric truck charging

For the first time in the U.S., a roadway has wirelessly charged an electric heavy-duty truck driving at highway speeds, demonstrating key technology that could help reduce costs of building electrified highways for all electric vehicles to use.

The experimental highway segment tests a patent-pending system designed by Purdue University engineers. Built by the state department of transportation that Overdrive readers named the worst in the nation for highway upkeep in 2025, the segment gives Indiana DOT a bit of a feather in its cap for new builds. It's a quarter-mile stretch on U.S. Highway 52/231 in West Lafayette.

Purdue researchers demonstrated the wireless charging system in the fall using an electric truck provided by Cummins.

“Cummins is proud to play a role in this initiative by successfully adapting a prototype Class 8 battery-electric truck to integrate with Purdue’s high-power dynamic wireless power transfer system,” said John Kresse, chief technology engineer at Cummins. “The on-road testing went exceptionally well, thanks to strong collaboration between our teams. With its high power and promising cost structure, this technology represents a practical, and potentially game-changing, solution for the future of on-highway commercial transportation.”

The demonstration is part of a multistage research project that Purdue and INDOT began in 2018. In addition to its funding from INDOT through the Joint Transportation Research Program at Purdue, the project is affiliated with a fourth-generation National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center called Advancing Self-sufficiency through Powered Infrastructure for Roadway Electrification (ASPIRE).

“With this breakthrough system, Purdue has shown that powering large commercial vehicles wirelessly is not just technically feasible but could be a practical and scalable solution for real-world highway transportation,” said Nadia Gkritza, a Purdue professor of civil and construction engineering and agricultural and biological engineering.

The Purdue system demonstrates “dynamic wireless power transfer,” with “dynamic” referring to vehicles in motion, the university said. A few other states and countries have also begun testing roads designed to enable dynamic wireless power transfer. But making this possible for highways -- and particularly for semis and other heavy-duty vehicles -- is a unique challenge. Because vehicles travel so much faster on highways than city roads, they need to be charged at higher power levels.

The Purdue-designed system works at power levels much higher than others demonstrated in the U.S. so far. Using the test segment in West Lafayette, the system delivered 190 kilowatts to a truck traveling at 65 miles per hour. By accommodating the higher power needs for heavy-duty vehicles, the Purdue design is also able to support the lower power needs of other vehicle classes.

Purdue said that with the ability for electric trucks to charge or stay charged using highways, batteries could be smaller in size, allowing the trucks to haul more cargo, which could lower equipment costs and increase revenue.

North Carolina DOT reminds truckers to stay off backroads in Western N.C.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation put out a reminder this week to truck drivers that “local roads near I-40 in Western NC are for drivers with four wheels.”

In a video PSA posted to Facebook, NCDOT’s Marion Ferguson said “truck drivers need to stay on the interstate.” The side roads, he said, are “curvy, mountainous roads” that “lead into gravel roads, and trucks can get into bad situations when they leave the interstate.”

Ferguson added that heavy-duty trucks should stay on either a “prescribed detour” or the main highway to avoid issues. Routes for truck drivers heading West out of North Carolina, NCDOT said, are to stay on I-40 through the Pigeon River gorge, or take I-26 West to I-81.

International’s S13 Integrated Powertrain meets EPA 2027 requirements

International Motors this week announced its 2027 S13 Integrated Powertrain meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) emissions requirements for 2027 model year trucks.

The 2027 S13 powertrain, made up of the S13 engine and T14 transmission, carries more than 90% of the hardware from the current platform, which includes consistency in service tools, parts, and technician training, International said. Truck owners can expect similar fuel economy, driving experience, and powertrain weight as today's S13 Integrated Powertrain.

""We've been preparing for EPA 2027 for years. Our customers won't face surprises, only the same proven powertrain,"" said Dan Kayser, executive vice president, Commercial Operations, International. ""Our customers get a reliable solution without unnecessary complexity.""

The S13 Integrated Powertrain enables a compact, efficient design that meets nitrogen-oxide (NOx) regulations without unnecessary complexity.

[Related: EPA won't delay 2027 NOx rule, but plans 'major changes']

New features for 2027 in the powertrain:

S13 engine: Variable Valve Timing (VVT), which enables Variable Valve Braking (VVB) for improved braking performance, closed crankcase breather, oil centrifuge

T14 transmission: 24V Transmission Control Module with predictive shifting using GPS/topography data

Electrical architecture: Reduces complexity by using a standardized 24V electrical architecture across the entire powertrain platform; 24V alternator, starter, and engine controllers for improved cold-crank performance and durability, while retaining a 12V cab and chassis electrical system for battery accessories and body controls.

The 2027 powertrain also eliminates exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), International noted.

The S13 Integrated Powertrain is approved for use with R100 renewable diesel, reducing well-to-wheel carbon footprint without any hardware changes, the company added. Trials for B100 biodiesel compatibility are underway, reinforcing International's commitment to practical sustainability.",https://img.overdriveonline.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2026/01/electric-truck-highway-charging-purdue.P7QmZZcIsf.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-08 17:02:11.896225

House Republicans are on a mission to responsibly fund the federal government as we fight to get America’s financial house in order and return to regular order. To continue making progress in funding the government, we are bringing forward a package of three appropriations bills that furthers President Trump’s agenda and delivers real spending cuts for hardworking Americans.

The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act protects Americans at home and advances American leadership by halting the spread of fentanyl and other illicit and deadly drugs in the U.S. through increased funding for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), holding foreign countries accountable for unfair trade practices, supporting NASA’s Artemis program to counter China, bolstering the American research enterprise, and countering foreign adversaries by increasing funding to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). It also defends the Second Amendment from Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) overreach and invests in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.

The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act bolsters our long term national security by investing in our nuclear weapons stockpile and infrastructure, preventing hostile nations and terrorist groups from acquiring nuclear devices or expertise, and banning the sale of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. This legislation also reduces our reliance on foreign countries for critical minerals by making historic investments in mining technologies. Additionally, the legislation improves and maintains America’s ports and waterways and increases investments to develop new geothermal energy sources.

The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act allows us to continue unleashing American energy by increasing funding for oil and gas development. It reduces regulatory burdens by encouraging the ongoing review of harmful Biden-era rules and exempting farmers and livestock producers from confusing greenhouse gas permitting and reporting requirements, and safeguards access to public lands. It also combats illegal drug trade, confronts the opioid crisis, and increases funding for law enforcement to protect public lands. Additionally, the legislation gets rid of wasteful funding for Environmental Justice and cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

With this appropriations package, House Republicans are following through on our promises to gut wasteful bureaucracy, bolster our national security, restore American energy dominance, and put America first while returning to fiscal responsibility.

H.R. 6938, the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026, sponsored by Chairman Tom Cole, makes appropriations through FY26 and supports efforts to strengthen our energy security, secure our communities, reduce bureaucratic environmental red tape, advance critical programs, and implement President Trump’s America-First agenda.

As of the end of Q3, Nuvve had 26.4MW of bidirectional EV charger power capacity under management and 200kWh of stationary storage batteries.
In New Mexico, it would deploy the 40MWh of systems through the company’s recently launched battery-as-a-service subscription business model, which offers customers access to battery storage capacity at no upfront cost.
The BESS assets will provide peak load mitigation, resiliency and wholesale market participation through the Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM).
Nuvve had previously participated in a V2G pilot in Japan in 2020 with the same partners.","A week earlier, Nuvve had revealed a non-binding agreement via a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Denmark-based renewables developer E&B Renewables for projects in European Nordic and Baltic countries, ranging from 2MW to 100MW in output to the grid.

That partnership, which builds on a collaboration framework signed by the pair in November, will kick off with three Danish projects, each of 2MW and undisclosed megawatt-hour capacity.

Nuvve emphasised BESS strategy in Q3 earnings call and shareholder letter

As reported by our colleagues at Electric Vehicle Infrastructure News (EVIN) on 19 December, Nuvve’s company leadership sent a letter to shareholders last month, informing them that it is expanding its focus on stationary BESS and microgrid technologies.

The move to make stationary batteries a “larger portion” of its business in the three global regions was signposted earlier in the company’s Q3 2025 earnings call. At that time, Nuvve reported a 20% decline in year-to-date revenues versus 2024 figures and losses widening year-over-year from US$1.2 million in Q3 2024 to US$4.8 million in Q3 2025.

As noted by EVIN, the shift echoes moves by other companies in the e-mobility sector, particularly, but not limited to, the US, where EV demand growth has slowed in the past year.

Nuvve’s Grid Integrated Vehicle (GIVe) energy management technology platform was developed to facilitate the aggregation of EV batteries to provide grid services. Its business model in that space has seen it work with the likes of electric school bus fleet operators in California that have been enrolled in utility demand response programmes.

As of the end of Q3, Nuvve had 26.4MW of bidirectional EV charger power capacity under management and 200kWh of stationary storage batteries.

Aggregation platform and BaaS business models enabling diverse applications and ownership structures, company claims

In its Japan project announcement, Nuvve claimed its aggregation platform equipped with proprietary AI would provide market forecasting and automated bidding to optimise the asset’s participation across the country’s merchant market opportunities, which include the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JPEX) wholesale trading and frequency response ancillary services markets.

In New Mexico, it would deploy the 40MWh of systems through the company’s recently launched battery-as-a-service subscription business model, which offers customers access to battery storage capacity at no upfront cost.

The BESS assets will provide peak load mitigation, resiliency and wholesale market participation through the Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM). They will also be capable of grid-forming and black start functions for Kit Carson Electric Cooperative’s grid, and provide backup for critical community infrastructure, like healthcare facilities.

The New Mexico deal comes after Nuvve was the only bidder awarded a contract in March 2025 through ‘Electrify New Mexico’, a request for proposal (RFP) held by the US state’s government to find partners for EV charging and other electrification solutions. This is in support of a New Mexico zero emissions vehicle mandate, but also includes the right for Nuvve to deploy stationary storage and the startup claimed the total value of the opportunity could be as much as US$400 million over four years.

Meanwhile, in the Nordic and Baltic states, Nuvve highlighted that current market conditions are seeing BESS assets earn between US$340,000 and US$570,000/MW-year in revenues, with opportunities extending to multiple value streams beyond the currently lucrative ancillary services markets over their expected 15-year lifetimes.

That said, Nuvve had previously announced deals in the Nordic and Japanese markets in 2023 that do not yet appear to be included in its most recent asset under management figures.

In June of that year, the company said it would manage 40MW of fast EV chargers and around 1MW to 2MW of battery storage capacity in frequency regulation markets in Norway and Denmark for roadside services operator Circle K. In December 2023, Nuvve said it had been selected by Japanese partners Toyota Tsusho and Chubu Electric Power Miraiz to manage grid-connected battery storage with a combined capacity of 30MWh. Nuvve had previously participated in a V2G pilot in Japan in 2020 with the same partners.

Nuvve has also formed a joint venture (JV) in South Korea to participate in the country’s ongoing 2025 Second-Round Central ESS Auction with South Korean company Volt. The pair registered for the auction in early December, and award announcements are expected in February.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nuvve-EV-charger.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:13:46.150768

America can, and must, meet the new age frontiers of energy and water, and invest in our workers, protect our water, and power our future.","WASHINGTON – Today, House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro, House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee Ranking Member Grace Meng, House Appropriations Energy and Water Development Subcommittee Ranking Member Marcy Kaptur, and House Appropriations Interior and Environment Subcommittee Ranking Member Chellie Pingree applauded House passage of the Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy-Water, and Interior-Environment funding package.

The appropriations legislation helps address the cost of living crisis, protects funding for key Democratic priorities like clean energy, environmental protection, scientific research and public safety grants, and reasserts Congress’s power of the purse.

“I commend Ranking Members Meng, Kaptur and Pingree for their extraordinary work crafting this legislation,” said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro. “We had three goals when we began this process: to protect funding for Democratic priorities, remove any poison pills, and reassert Congress’s power of the purse. This legislation accomplishes all three and more. It invests in programs to address high utility costs, promotes public safety through increased grant funding, defends our national parks and public lands, and protects the environment while rejecting steep cuts sought by the Trump Administration. Now that this package has passed the House, I look forward to completing the remaining funding bills ahead of the January 30th deadline.”

“I’m glad to see that the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill has finally passed the House,” said Congresswoman Grace Meng, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. “While this bill does not achieve every goal, I am proud to pass legislation that is far more responsible and meets many more Americans’ needs than the GOP’s original proposal would have. After weeks of negotiations, we were able to produce a bill that saves programs that combat violence against women and other violent crime in communities across the country, help create and preserve good-paying American jobs, and reaffirm our commitment to the United States’ global leadership in science, technology, and innovation. We were also able to strip this bill of every harmful policy rider that the GOP attempted to include that would have weakened gun safety regulations, undercounted the Census, made our schools and communities less safe, and harmed our LGBTQ+ friends and neighbors. Importantly, this legislation also reasserts Congress’s power of the purse, holding the Administration more accountable on funding, staffing, and Congressional notification requirements. I am proud to support this bill, along with every dollar it delivers to our communities and the programs that all Americans rely on.”

“Today, the House of Representatives passed a measure that chooses progress over retreat. The Energy and Water legislation that now goes to the Senate provides a critical $2.4 Billion increase over last year to address rising energy and water bills for American families, climate-caused shortages in the West, and increased flooding coast to coast. It ensures our Great Lakes stay vibrant, our ports on all coasts stay open, and our water infrastructure is built to last for Mother Nature’s complexities in this century. It maintains our commitment to critical regional commissions and authorities to build America forward here at home,"" said Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water. ""To tackle the cost-of-living crisis and affordability head-on, this bill provides an additional $375 Million for electric grid modernization. America can, and must, meet the new age frontiers of energy and water, and invest in our workers, protect our water, and power our future. I thank my colleagues for their overwhelming bipartisan support for this bill, and I urge the Senate to move with haste to get this legislation to the President’s desk to be signed into law.”

“After weeks of difficult negotiations, Appropriators delivered a bipartisan funding bill that protects public lands and the environment, invests in Tribal communities, supports the arts, and rejects billions in extreme cuts proposed by the Trump Administration and House Republicans,” said Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Interior and Environment. “No one should mistake this for Republicans suddenly embracing responsible governance. These investments exist because Democrats fought to restore dollars that Republicans tried to eliminate and insisted on real, enforceable funding requirements that reassert Congress’s Constitutional power of the purse. Rather than handing the Trump Administration a blank check through another stopgap measure, we've imposed precise, legally binding spending requirements that constrain executive overreach. We secured $8.8 billion for EPA—$4.7 billion above what the administration requested—and level funded the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, which the Administration tried to eliminate entirely. I’ll keep pressing for stronger investments in the months ahead, but the funding package we passed today is proof that when we stand our ground, we can deliver for communities, protect our environment, and block harmful special-interest provisions.”

Appropriators have been making steady Article I progress, with three full-year appropriations bills signed into law and three more heading to President Trump's desk following Senate passage next week. All twelve full-year funding bills have passed through committee, and work continues on floor passage of remaining FY26 legislation.

Despite the longest government shutdown in history, partisan obstruction, and tough deadlines, Appropriators have continued the thoughtful and deliberate work of funding our government. Last month, Congress avoided another end-of-year omnibus rammed through at the last minute because Republican leadership and governance insisted on responsible legislating and a member-driven process. Today’s action reflects steady movement toward regular order and completing full-year funding through accountability and deliberation.

Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) said, ""Today, the House took another step forward in advancing three more FY26 appropriations bills to President Trump’s desk. Through bipartisan, committee-led consensus, we are delivering full-year measures that spend less than current funding, implement critical priorities for our districts, and continue to advance the America First agenda. This was not by accident – it is the result of ending bloated omnibuses, empowering members, and doing the hard work Article I of the Constitution demands. I commend the leadership and attention to detail of our Subcommittee leaders: Chairman Hal Rogers, Chairman Mike Simpson, and Chairman Chuck Fleischmann. With their direction, we have a product that supports law enforcement and the fight against illicit drugs, unleashes U.S. energy dominance and strengthens nuclear deterrence, and supports our wildland firefighters and the stewardship of America’s resources. This package reflects a commitment to governing discipline, transparency, and purpose. It is exactly the kind of responsible legislating the American people expect – and deserve – from Congress.""

Chairman Cole’s floor remarks are available here.

Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) said, ""This new year's package is a great way to kick off 2026, delivering key funding to make America safer and stronger, including our economy, our borders, and our holistic future. The bill for Commerce, Justice, Science, and related agencies, reins in wasteful spending and invests in programs that strengthen our families and communities. We're doubling down on our commitment to back historic law enforcement efforts to dismantle drug cartels and stop the flood of deadly drugs, like fentanyl, from poisoning our communities. We're also restoring national security, leading the way for cutting-edge innovation, and bolstering economic development opportunities. Thanks to the stellar leadership of Chairman Tom Cole, we're upholding our promise to advance critical federal funding for the American people.""

Subcommittee Chairman Rogers' remarks are available here.

Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) said, ""As part of President Trump’s and House Republicans’ mission to renew our great nation, we promised to unleash American-made energy, invest in our military, and modernize infrastructure nationwide. The Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Appropriations Act, which I led and successfully passed in the House, strengthens America by investing in our nuclear deterrent to counter aggression from Russia and China, funding essential upgrades for our ports and waterways infrastructure – including full funding for the Chickamauga Lock: a critically important project for Tennessee, and strengthening our electrical grid to enhance its resiliency. The Energy and Water bill also makes historic commitments to decrease our reliance on China’s monopoly of critical minerals, makes America the global leader in the technologies of tomorrow like AI, quantum, and supercomputing, continues to provide robust funding for America’s next-generation Nuclear Navy, and ensures that we continue unleashing American energy dominance to lower energy prices. I am proud that the FY26 Energy and Water bill puts America First and delivers for our great nation. I thank the Trump Administration, Chairman Cole, and my bipartisan colleagues in the House and Senate for their collaboration and support to pass my Energy and Water bill. I look forward to President Trump signing my bill into law.""

Subcommittee Chairman Fleischmann's remarks are available here.

Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Mike Simpson (R-ID) said, ""Today's passage of the Fiscal Year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Act sends a strong message that House Republicans are determined to advance President Trump's America First policy agenda by reducing energy costs, protecting America's public lands, and reversing harmful Biden-era regulations. As Chairman of this subcommittee, I am pleased that this bill protects important programs that states and local communities rely on. This legislation fully funds the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and prioritizes funding for Indian Country and Wildland Fire Management. I am grateful to Chairman Cole for his leadership and my colleagues' support across the House floor. I look forward to this critical legislation getting signed into law by President Trump.""

Supporting President Trump’s War on Drugs

After four years of open borders that allowed astonishing amounts of fentanyl into our communities, Republicans are taking decisive action to combat the spread of this fatal drug on our streets – and restore law and order to cities around the country.

Republicans are supporting President Trump’s fight against fentanyl with robust support for state and local law enforcement.

Republicans are increasing funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration by $63 million in support of the Trump Administration’s efforts to take down drug traffickers.

This legislation strengthens programs that combat child exploitation, protecting our most vulnerable.

Republicans are maintaining the America First ethos the American people overwhelmingly support – we’re making it harder for the CCP to gain a foothold in the U.S. or access any of our national security equipment and technology.

Restoring American Energy Dominance

House Republicans are using the power of the purse to advance the critical priority to restore American energy dominance.

With such incredible resources beneath our feet, Americans should not be dependent on foreign nations for our energy.

This legislation supports one of the largest investments in decades, with a focus on mining production technologies for critical minerals extraction. We are increasing investment in geothermal energy sources, capitalizing on the many domestic energy sources we have in the U.S.

A secure electric grid provides reliable, affordable energy to American families. We are strongly funding cybersecurity efforts to protect our grid from attacks.

Biden-era work spending is gone! We are eliminating the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and zeroing out the accounts for DOE’s Office of Energy Justice and Equity and the EPA’s Environmental Justice program.

Bolstering Our Nuclear Defense Systems

Our nuclear deterrence programs are championed in this legislation, helping to maintain America’s advantage over our adversaries.

We are investing over $20 billion in the continued modernization of the nuclear weapons stockpile and infrastructure.

Republicans are investing not only in the advancement of our own nuclear weapons, but also in our defense and deterrence technologies to defend our people.

This legislation protects our Strategic Petroleum Reserve by banning sales of crude oil to the Chinese Communist Party.

Adversaries in Russia and China should never be allowed in U.S. nuclear weapons facilities. This legislation bans citizens of our adversaries from these facilities.

America the Beautiful

From sea to shining sea, our public lands are beautiful, historic places for people around the world to visit. Proper management and care are necessary to ensure these lands continue to be a resource for every American.

Catastrophic wildfires have torn through American communities in recent years. We are ensuring funds for wildland firefighters to protect our communities from these events.

Visitors to America’s national parks deserve to know they can enjoy these national resources safely. We’re prioritizing emergency response and law enforcement on our public lands to keep Americans safe.

Republicans are honoring our relationship with America’s native tribes by bolstering funding to protect the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women program, as well as increasing funds for Tribal Public Safety and Justice programs.

America First Wins

This legislation rescinds harmful, Biden-era spending on woke, DEI, and energy-inefficient programs.

We are defending the Second Amendment, reversing Biden’s anti-gun overreach, and reducing funding for the ATF.

Protecting the life of an unborn child is a long-held Republican conviction. Our legislation includes legacy riders that prevent DOJ funds from being used to pay for abortions.

This legislation protects the American people and our government from the malign influence of the Chinese Communist Party.

Critical support to the NASA Artemis program will bolster American leadership in space and counter China’s ambitions.

America First policies strengthen the American economy. By reducing government waste and cutting federal spending, Americans will see strong economic growth.
