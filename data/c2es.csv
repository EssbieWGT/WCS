Voltpost, a New York-based startup, made that happen.

The company's solution is to retrofit existing street light poles with a modular EV charger.

Voltpost’s first publicly available lamppost charger for electric vehicles in Michigan is now online. It’s a big moment for the four-year-old New York-based startup founded with a big idea: turn regular old street lights into EV chargers.

The startup’s solution is to retrofit existing lampposts with its modular Level 2 charger, so that any city street in the world can offer EV charging without costly infrastructure upgrades or bulky hardware.

The lamppost EV charger can have up to four retractable cables.

Voltpost’s first Michigan installation can be found at the American Center for Mobility’s campus in Ypsilanti Township, near Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan. This is just the beginning, though, with 11 more installations due to go online later this year at several strategic locations in the Detroit are. Last week, the startup also turned on its first-ever publicly available lamppost charger in Oak Park, Illinois.

“Deploying this charger is a meaningful step toward making EV charging more accessible and equitable for all communities,” said Jeffrey Prosserman, CEO and co-founder of Voltpost. “ACM’s testbed provides the perfect proving ground to launch Voltpost Michigan. This collaboration lays the groundwork for a cleaner, more connected mobility future in Detroit, the nation’s epicenter of transportation innovation.”

The lamppost EV charger can be installed in under an hour, according to its maker, and each unit can power two or four EVs at once via integrated cables. That said, it’s worth noting that the stalls rely on the public lighting infrastructure, which was not designed to sustain high loads. In other words, don’t expect lightning-fast charging speeds when hooked up to a lamppost charger.

This is strictly a Level 2 type of thing, but it can still be plenty useful if an EV is parked for several hours. Going to a movie and parking on the street? Just plug into a street light charger. Meanwhile, municipalities can quickly retrofit existing lampposts with Voltpost’s unit without having to spend a fortune on DC fast charging infrastructure–although that’s needed, too.

Voltpost was founded in 2021, and last year, it partnered with telecom giant AT&T to turn Detroit’s lampposts into internet-connected EV chargers. Thanks to AT&T’s wireless data services, Voltpost can remotely monitor chargers and detect malfunctions.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/jlE7lg/s1/voltpost-curbside-ev-charging-solution.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 12:18:03.578879

ABIDJAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- As the rainy season settles over southwestern Cote d'Ivoire, the Sassandra River swells with renewed vigor. In the early morning mist, workers in uniforms and hard hats move with purpose through the Gribo-Popoli Hydroelectric Power Plant, inspecting spillways, monitoring water levels, and checking equipment.

Among them is 32-year-old Bassirou Konate, a quality inspector who began his career nearly a decade ago.

""When I first joined the Chinese-built hydropower project, I could barely read the blueprints,"" Konate recalled. ""But a Chinese mentor was assigned to me. Step by step, he taught me everything.""

Konate began his career in 2016 at the Soubre Hydroelectric Power Plant, a project also built by the Power Construction Corporation of China (PowerChina). Since then, he has contributed to several major infrastructure initiatives and become a key member of the team building the Gribo-Popoli hydropower plant.

""What I learned in school was theory,"" he said. ""It was these projects that gave me hands-on experience. Now, I can support my family. I see a future not only for myself but for my community.""

Situated on one of Cote d'Ivoire's major rivers, the Gribo-Popoli station is part of a series of hydropower projects. The Sassandra River, with its abundant flow and favorable elevation gradients, holds vast potential for renewable energy. After completing the Soubre Hydroelectric Power Plant in 2017, PowerChina saw all three generating units at Gribo-Popoli come online by November 2024, unlocking even more hydropower capacity for the country.

Yet, the energy these projects generate extends beyond electricity -- it is also empowering the growth of local talent.

Dozens of Ivorian workers who began their careers at Soubre, like Konate, have since stepped into critical roles at Gribo-Popoli as quality inspectors, technicians, and supervisors. Their growing expertise is powering a new chapter in national infrastructure, one driven not just by machines, but by the skilled hands of local professionals.

Hou Bing, chief engineer of the Gribo-Popoli Hydroelectric Power Plant, said the project created roughly 2,000 direct jobs during its construction phase and supported an additional 1,000 through related industries.

""These projects are more than worksites. They are schools, places where Ivorian workers gain skill and confidence,"" Hou noted. ""Knowledge is passed on along with the trust between our peoples. Together, we are building not only dams but bridges of friendship.""

Yao Michel N'Guessan's story mirrors that of Konate. Fresh out of school when he joined the Soubre project, N'Guessan began with little more than textbook knowledge. ""Chinese engineers taught me how to install and maintain electrical systems,"" he said.

Through on-the-job training, he steadily mastered the complexities of construction. Today, he leads a construction team at Gribo-Popoli.

""What I gained from my Chinese mentors wasn't just skills,"" he said. ""They taught me discipline, responsibility, and precision. We're not just workers anymore. We're nation-builders.""

As night falls, lights flicker on across the Gribo-Popoli Hydroelectric Power Plant, casting a warm glow over the Sassandra River. The dam and power station stand not only as engineering feats but as enduring symbols of partnership between China and Cote d'Ivoire. ■",,N,,2025-06-08 12:17:35.687887

One North Sea oil worker said the government’s stance represented “nothing short of a strangulation of an industry and of the north-east Scottish economy”.
“I do think the government is, belatedly, becoming a little more pragmatic about [the North Sea],” the second source added.","It was inevitable that Nigel Farage would take Reform UK’s campaign tour to Aberdeen. On a visit to the capital of the UK’s oil and gas industry on Monday last week he welcomed a defecting Aberdeen Conservative councillor, the 13th switch to his party’s ranks in Scotland to date.

Reform is hoping to make political hay from the discontent surrounding the government’s North Sea policies, the demise of the oil and gas basin and the vast workforce that depends on it. The populist party has vowed to reverse Labour’s ban on fresh North Sea oil and gas drilling as a “day one” priority if elected to power in 2029.

Farage’s naked targeting of the Granite City and of net zero – which he has described as “lunacy” and the “next Brexit” – has some in Westminster and the energy industry asking what would once have been unthinkable: will be forced to water down or even U-turn on its North Sea pledges?

Green light for North Sea?

Keir Starmer’s party swept to power last summer with a manifesto pledge to end new North Sea oil and gas projects and make Britain a clean energy superpower. But in less than a year the government has bent to the backlash against some of its most high-profile policies on benefits and winter fuel allowances, stoking speculation that its position on the North Sea might be the next to crumble.

Industry sources believe ministers may be poised to give the green light to new North Sea projects from this autumn. The Guardian understands that senior government advisers have told North Sea investors that new drilling could still move ahead despite the election promise, provided the projects are close to existing pipeline infrastructure and do not extend into “greenfield” areas.

One energy investor said advisers in the Treasury and No 10 had “quite openly” signalled that the door would be left open for new oil and gas projects to proceed despite climate commitments. “Myself and a number of colleagues have been told that the government is moving towards the idea of allowing new licences,” the source said.

However, the claims are at odds with the green agenda set out by Ed Miliband, secretary of state at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), who has previously described plans to develop the Jackdaw and Rosebank oilfields in the North Sea as “an act of climate vandalism”.

Those two oilfields, which are caught in a long-running legal battle over their emissions, will be a critical test of how Labour’s desperation to counter the rise of Reform rubs up against its green principles.

Cutting greenhouse gases has strong support in the UK, with YouGov polling in March showing 61% of adults support or strongly support the government’s target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. About 24% oppose or strongly oppose the policy.

But with domestically produced oil and gas being replaced with imports from Qatar and the US, sources believe the Treasury is anxious to allow projects to move ahead to protect the more than 200,000 jobs that rely on the North Sea sector, and the billions in forecast tax revenues the industry generates.

“Within the Treasury there is a desire to interpret the manifesto commitment loosely,” a second industry source said. “If there is an existing licence related to a field which means it might not be considered a ‘greenfield’ site then perhaps an expansion of that area could be acceptable.”

The North Sea contributes £25bn in value to the UK economy each year, according to the trade group Offshore Energies UK, which is more than five times the contribution of the UK steel industry and twice the contribution of the UK car industry.

“I suspect there will be some difficult internal rows about what counts as a ‘new licence’ between DESNZ and the Treasury - but I suspect that ultimately the Treasury will win this battle, with support from No 10,” the source added.

Room for manoeuvre?

Labour’s manifesto offers some room for manoeuvre: it promised that the party would not “issue new licences to explore new fields”, but would also not revoke existing North Sea licences.

This means that controversial North Sea oil and gas projects at Rosebank, Jackdaw and Cambo – which were granted licences by the previous government – could in theory be granted final consent to move ahead without breaching the pledge.

Oil companies that hope to drill new wells within their previously licensed areas, known as “in-fill drilling”, could also be allowed to extract more oil and gas from their existing projects. The sources have suggested that even more leeway could be created within the definition of the manifesto promise.

The pledge was welcomed by green groups as a clear sign of the government’s intent to meet its legally binding net zero targets as the climate crisis intensifies. However, critics of the policy – who include backbench Labour MPs and union leaders – fear the economic fallout may outweigh any climate benefits as imported hydrocarbons increasingly replace North Sea oil and gas.

Britain’s trade unions, which donate generously to Labour, fear that job losses in the industry and its supply chains are accelerating quicker than companies can pivot towards the green economy.

Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: “Letting go of one rope before we have hold of another by ending oil and gas licences is not acceptable. It threatens both our national security and jobs.”

“Oil and gas workers cannot be the coal miners of our generation,” she added. “Britain needs to maintain skills and invest in the industries of the future. Jobless transitions will not be accepted by Unite, neither will jam tomorrow. If Labour do not back workers other voices fill the vacuum.”

Andy Prendergast, the GMB’s national secretary, said the union has called on the government to re-appraise the UK’s energy policy. “Existing policy is simply offshoring responsibility, importing virtue, and undercutting a transition for energy workers in the North Sea,” he said.

One North Sea oil worker said the government’s stance represented “nothing short of a strangulation of an industry and of the north-east Scottish economy”. He voted Reform in the last general election and said he could not name a single person who would vote for Labour.

“Aberdeen is being bled dry,” the rig worker added. “The hypocrisy of a government which is willing to import and burn fossil fuels for energy generation but is unwilling to support its homegrown hydrocarbon industry, all to catch the newspapers headlines for political point scoring, is astounding.”

Mel Evans, a climate team leader at Greenpeace UK, said the switch from oil and gas to renewables “must bring workers and communities along” and create jobs in green manufacturing. Unions and climate campaigners are demanding an emergency funding package of £1.9bn a year to help with the transition be included in Rachel Reeves’s spending review on Wednesday.

“It’s vital that we don’t leave oil and gas workers’ future in the hands of private companies who put their profits above workers’ security and the climate time and time again,” she said.

“We urgently need a renewable energy system fit for the 21st century that can bring down bills, helping our energy security and the climate at the same time. But we must bring workers and communities along and ensure that wind manufacturing and renewable energy jobs stay here in the UK, rather than leaving other countries to benefit from the booming green economy.”

‘Not clear cut’

The government’s independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have called for tight controls on any new North Sea production but have also found that the emissions case for a ban on new projects is “not clear cut”.

“The CCC has not been able to establish the net impact on global emissions of new UK oil and gas extraction,” the advisers said in a letter to former energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in 2022.

This is partly because the UK’s oil and gas has a relatively low carbon footprint relative to the countries that supply its gas imports. The UK will continue to be a net importer of fossil fuels by 2050 even when keeping to its net zero ambition.

Under the CCC’s forecasts, oil and gas will tumble from about 75% of the UK’s primary energy demand now to about 23% by 2050. But that would still mean the UK needs over 14m tonnes of oil equivalent each year – most of which will be imported. The UK is increasingly reliant on imports of liquified natural gas from the US and Qatar – which have a far higher carbon intensity than North Sea gas – as well as piped gas from Norway.

On the one hand the UK could help lower global emissions by replacing some of these fossil fuel imports with domestic hydrocarbons, but on the other hand any extra oil and gas produced by the UK could risk creating a global oversupply of fossil fuels “that would pose a risk to the aims of the Paris agreement”.

What oil and gas remains in the North Sea is becoming harder to extract, meaning the basin will still be in terminal decline even if the government loosens its stance.

The policy against new North Sea oil projects emerged after the global energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, warned in 2021 that no new fossil projects could move ahead if the world hoped to meet its climate targets.

Here too the hard lines appear to be softening. By 2023 the Paris-based agency clarified its stance, stating that “no new conventional long-lead time oil projects” should be approved but that “investing in existing fossil fuel supply, however, is still needed”.

The government is expected to clarify its plans for the future of the North Sea through an industry consultation that closed at the end of April. Its response, which is expected in the autumn, is likely to rule out a return to annual North Sea licensing rounds – but industry insiders expect that it will allow at least some new projects to progress.

That could leave Miliband in an awkward position. There have been “discussions within the Labour party for months over how to handle his potential resignation”, said an industry source.

“I do think the government is, belatedly, becoming a little more pragmatic about [the North Sea],” the second source added. “And I suspect that ultimately pragmatism will win the day. But it may be too late, honestly. In the North Sea we’re on a worrying downward spiral of job losses and an accelerated production decline.”

A DESNZ spokesperson dismissed the claims as “secondhand speculation” which “bear no relation” to the government’s work to “implement our manifesto position to not issue new licences to explore new oil and gas fields”.

That's half the economy in Nova Scotia.""","HALIFAX — Two leading environmental groups are giving a thumbs up to Nova Scotia's ambitious plan to dramatically expand its fledgling offshore wind energy industry.

But both groups were quick to add caveats.

On Monday, Premier Tim Houston said the province's plan to license enough offshore wind farms to produce five megawatts of electricity would be increased eightfold to 40 megawatts, well beyond the 2.4 megawatts Nova Scotia needs. He called on Ottawa to help cover the costs of his new Wind West project, saying the excess electricity could be used to supply 27 per cent of Canada's total demand.

""Nova Scotia is on the edge of a clean energy breakthrough,"" the Progressive Conservative premier said in an online video, adding the province is poised to become an ""energy superpower.""

Gretchen Fitzgerald, executive director of Sierra Club Canada, said the premier's bold plan, which includes building transmission lines across the country, represents an exciting opportunity for the province.

""It could be a game-changer for the region and for Canada,"" she said in an interview from Ottawa. ""But it needs to be done correctly and with consultations.""

Fitzgerald said the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments must focus on securing long-term benefits from the nascent offshore wind industry because they did a poor job on that front when dealing with the offshore oil and gas sector.

""We have to make sure that we are not selling out what is a massive resource for less benefit than communities should have,"" Fitzgerald said, adding that Nova Scotia continues to suffer from a high rate of energy poverty. In May of this year, utility affordability expert Roger Colton produced a report showing that 43 per cent of Nova Scotians were struggling to pay their energy bills — the highest proportion in Canada.

While Fitzgerald applauded Houston's clean energy plan, she criticized what she described as the premier's populist penchant for taking decisive action before consulting with experts and the public.

""Moving from a couple hundred turbines to thousands in the next decade needs to be done in a staged way so we learn how to do this right,"" she said, adding Houston appears to have adopted a ""'move-fast-and-break-things mentality.""

""(That) can lead to unacceptable harm to sensitive ocean life,"" she said. ""From a community benefits and acceptance point of view, breaking trust can be the biggest barrier to getting to good climate solutions.""

In October 2023, the Public Policy Forum released a study saying Sable Island Bank, an ocean area about 180 kilometres south of Nova Scotia, is among the world’s best locations for wind energy generation.

""It and several other similarly endowed areas off the coast of Atlantic Canada hold the potential to place the region among the leading global hubs of offshore wind-powered energy development,"" says the report from the independent non-profit think tank.

It goes on to say that as the world shifts from a dependence on fossil fuels to forms of energy that do not emit climate-changing greenhouse gases, Atlantic Canada is facing ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity ... to recover an economic vitality comparable to the Age of Sail — fittingly built again on the power of wind at sea.""

The report says the installation of 15 gigawatts of offshore wind generation would create about 30,000 direct jobs annually.

Despite the hype, the industry must also earn acceptance from Nova Scotia's fishing industry, which in 2023 contributed $2.5 billion to the province's economy and employed 19,000 people.

In Halifax, a spokesman for the Ecology Action Centre called on the provincial government to build public trust, especially with coastal communities.

""There really needs to be a priority on stakeholder engagement for all ocean users,"" said senior energy co-ordinator Thomas Arnason McNeil.

""We're going to need to prioritize ecological safeguards and preserve the existing livelihoods that we have. That includes the fishing industry. That's half the economy in Nova Scotia.""

Still, he said the province's big push for clean energy is on the right track, especially when it comes to building out its electricity grid to better connect with the rest of the country.

If done right, the payoff would be enormous, Arnason McNeil said.

""We're talking serious job creation here and a lot of revenue potentially,"" he said. ""The bottom line is that you have to do this right. (But) the prize at the end of the road is monumental in terms of the benefits.""

A call for bids to build enough offshore turbines to generate five gigawatts of electricity is expected as early as this year.

Regulators can also prevent hidden costs of coal-fired power with common-sense policy.","America’s power bills are soaring. Coal-fired electricity keeps making it worse.

Between 2021 and 2024 the cost to generate coal-fired electricity across the United States has skyrocketed 28%, according to new Energy Innovation analysis – nearly twice the rate of inflation over that same time, with the highest price spikes in states east of the Mississippi.

Existing coal-fired power plants are also running far less than in the past because coal is more expensive than clean energy, which drives up the cost of every megawatt-hour of energy they generate, and forced consumers to pay $6.2 billion more for the same amount of power in 2024 than they would have in 2021.

It’s another hit to America’s bottom line as fossil fuels force families to make hard financial choices – 34% of households had to cut back or skip necessary expenses in the past 12 months to pay energy bills, while 23% were unable to pay part or all of their energy bill.

But coal’s rising costs could crunch consumer budgets even further. Executive orders issued by the Trump administration would force utilities to keep expensive coal-fired power plants online even if they increase consumer costs or were scheduled to close. This has already forced a Michigan coal-fired power plant to remain online even though the utility that operates it said closing the plant would save its customers more than $600 million.

The Trump administration promised to cut energy bills in half by the middle of 2026 but coal’s soaring costs threaten American consumers with the exact opposite.

Coal Power: Last Century’s Technology, Today’s Inflationary Costs

Coal-fired power plants have only gotten more expensive since Energy Innovation’s 2023 Coal Cost Crossover report, which found 99% of America’s existing coal fleet cost more to simply keep running than replacing them all with new local solar, wind, and energy storage.

This new analysis shows 95% of the 162 U.S. coal-fired power plants that were still operating at the beginning of 2025 were more expensive than in 2021, and costs increased at twice the rate of inflation for half of these plants.

In 2021, the weighted average cost of a MWh of power generated by coal-fired power plants was $36/MWh, and in 2024 the average cost was $46/MWh, or 28% higher in just three years. The Consumer Price Index, a proxy for inflation, grew 16% over the same time.

Coal prices have been highest in Appalachian coal mines, but digging rocks out of the ground to crush and burn simply costs more across the country than other forms of energy.

Coal plants also cost more to run because they’re getting geriatric (the average U.S. coal plant age was around 44 years in 2024), which increases operations and maintenance costs – things tend to break as they get older. The average coal plant capacity factor, or the amount of time they are generating power, dropped from 46% in 2021 to 38% in 2024, which increases their overall cost to run.

Customers Pay The Price To Keep Coal Alive

Consumers are already paying the toll for these expensive power plants.

In Georgia, Plant Bowen was originally scheduled to retire in 2028, but Georgia Power recently extended its life to 2035 despite costs increasing from $46/MWh in 2021 to $72/MWh in 2025. That decision came on the heels of Georgia Power forcing consumers to endure six electricity bill rate increases between 2023-2025 while the utility’s profits soared 10% over the same time.

In South Carolina, the Williams Station coal-fired power plant had its retirement pushed back from 2028 to at least 2031, even though its costs have spiked by $27/MWh, or more than 50%, while South Carolina energy costs are forecast to rise 6.3% this summer.

In Ohio, consumers have been forced to pay $679 million over the past decade via fees on their power bills to subsidize two money-losing coal-fired power plants owned by the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation – including a whopping $172 million in 2024 alone. Statewide, electricity rates just jumped anywhere from 10%-36% across Ohio’s six major utilities.

The list goes on and on.

Michigan is the newest front in this war on affordability. Following the Trump administration’s April executive orders to prop up coal, the U.S. Department of Energy declared an “energy emergency” and ordered the 63-year old J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant to stay open at least through this summer to avoid a “risk of blackouts.”

But the truth is that no energy emergency exists in Michigan. Consumers Energy decided to close Campbell in 2022 after determining the regional MISO grid had enough extra capacity for it to be shut down, and estimated closing the plant would save its customers $600 million. “We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed,” said Dan Scripps, Chair of Michigan’s Public Service Commission. “As a result, there is no existing energy emergency in either Michigan or MISO.”

States That Build Wind and Solar Protect Their Citizens

Pro-coal federal officials say keeping expensive coal-fired power plants online to meet America’s surging electricity demand is a good idea, but relying on these aging plants will hit consumers harder and harder every year.

These impacts aren’t theoretical; families and businesses are already paying the toll. Across the country, electricity prices have risen nearly 20% since 2021, and consumer electricity rates have risen fastest in states that rely heavily upon coal like Kentucky and West Virginia, where electricity rates rose 24% between 2021 and 2024.

Compare that to states with the highest levels of wind and solar generation like Colorado, Iowa, Oklahoma, or New Mexico where consumers have experienced the lowest rate increases and it’s clear power price spikes are driven by fossil fuel price volatility and the climate change impacts they cause.

The good news is state officials and utility regulators have the power to protect Americans from rising coal costs while ensuring the grid can meet rising electricity demand.

Solar, wind, and energy storage composed 93% of new resources added to the grid in 2024, and moving those proposed resources through the interconnection queue is the fastest way to get new generation online. Utilities and their regulators can also get more out of the grid by reconductoring existing transmission lines with advanced conductors, or deploying demand response and energy efficiency.

Regulators can also prevent hidden costs of coal-fired power with common-sense policy. For instance, many states permit coal-fired power to run even when they’re not the cheapest available generation – this “uneconomic dispatch” costs consumers more than $2 billion annually and is most prevalent in the Southeast and Western U.S.

Utilities and grid operators have plenty of options to keep the lights on, but consumers often have very few options on the price they pay for electricity. Inflation and fossil fuel prices keep rising – doubling down on coal will only harm consumers.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68435464fc0e67152fc54717/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-08 11:05:24.984714

“Advanced economies and China account for 80% of global grid spending.
The pending tax bill could slow down or stop investments in renewable energy and infrastructure projects by speeding up the phase-out of critical tax credits.
Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are among the leading tech giants investing in renewable energy.
Renewables are now the primary vehicle driving investment in the energy sector.","Investors are betting big on renewable energy, which is projected to reach $2.2 trillion this year—more than double the investment in fossil fuels. This accounts for more than 40% of the $3.3 trillion estimated for the global energy sector. Solar power stands out, with expectations of attracting $450 billion in investment.

The unprecedented dollars flowing into renewable energy aren’t just reshaping power markets—they mark a tipping point in the global energy transition, where clean power is overtaking fossil fuels as an economic priority. These investments are gaining momentum and building scale, and now, they are changing how we use energy, not just supplementing the existing generation mix.

“Amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security"" as the main reason the global community attracted $3.3 trillion, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency or IEA. “The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas, we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”

He notes that China is leading global energy investment, particularly in renewables. It invests as much as the United States and the European Union combined. Over the past decade, China’s share of global clean energy spending has increased from a quarter to nearly a third, supported by ventures in solar, wind, hydropower, nuclear, batteries, and electric vehicles.

For context, investment in fossil fuels had been 30% greater than in electricity generation, grids, and storage. However, that has changed in 2025: investments in electricity production are now 50% higher than the amount spent on bringing coal, oil, and natural gas to market.

Though battery storage investment is lower at $65 billion, it plays an outsized role in enabling intermittent renewables to provide round-the-clock power. Meanwhile, nuclear energy is gaining momentum and is expected to secure $75 billion by 2025. Compare that to investment in the oil and gas sector, which is expected to decline this year by 6%—the first drop since 2020.

Can The Grid Handle The Rise In Demand?

The central question is whether the grid can accommodate the new capacity. Indeed, the rise of artificial intelligence, data centers, and EVs—powered by sustainable energy—means the country must at least double regional transmission capacity.

According to the IEA, AI and data centers alone are projected to account for as much as 4% of global electricity use by 2030—accelerating the urgency for grid modernization and new capacity. The Brattle Group states that $2 trillion is required by 2030 to modernize the lines; grid investments are now $400 billion yearly, short of what is necessary.

“Grids have become a bottleneck for energy transitions, but investment is rising, driven by new policies and funding in Europe, the United States, China, and parts of Latin America,” IEA’s report said. “Advanced economies and China account for 80% of global grid spending. Investment in Latin America has almost doubled since 2021, notably in Colombia, Chile, and Brazil. However, investment remains worryingly low elsewhere.”

But how will the U.S. withdrawal from the global climate talks affect the overall trend? Undoubtedly, it will try to reduce federal support for the clean tech sector while creating policies that favor fossil fuels. At a minimum, that will foster business uncertainty and delay key projects. The pending tax bill could slow down or stop investments in renewable energy and infrastructure projects by speeding up the phase-out of critical tax credits.

Even as federal support wanes, state policies and utility mandates will continue to fuel the clean energy movement. In other words, decentralized governance will help maintain momentum, at least in some regions.

There’s a lot more at play. For starters, Donald Trump serves four years. That’s it. But there’s an even more powerful force: market economics, which favors the lowest-cost fuels and the ones that pollute the least. To that end, a lot of companies have branded themselves as green. Walking back sustainability claims—or resorting to greenwashing—would carry reputational and financial risks.

Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are among the leading tech giants investing in renewable energy. Meanwhile, Walmart, Target, and Ikea lead the retail sector. General Motors, Boeing, and Ford are at the forefront of the industrial sector.

Equally noteworthy is the effort to attract international investment in key technologies to guide us through the energy transition. If the United States remains uninvolved, that funding will go to others eager to take the lead. Already, China, the EU, and the United Arab Emirates are stepping in to fill the gap left by this country.

“Cheap electricity from renewable sources could provide 65 percent of the world’s total electricity supply by 2030. It could decarbonize 90 percent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and helping to mitigate climate change,” the UN said.

Renewables are now the primary vehicle driving investment in the energy sector. Indeed, the increased money flowing into wind and solar illustrates their viability. As capital and policy continue to align, renewables are positioned not just to compete—but also to lead. Their accelerating scale and declining cost mean they will be the linchpin in the world’s effort to curb emissions and prevent the worst impacts of climate change.

Indeed, the laws in Phoenix delineate where and how these vehicles can be operated. For instance, e-bikes, which must have fully operable pedals and an electric motor, are not allowed on sidewalks and have a minimum age requirement of 16 for operators, among other rules. E-scooters, similarly, are forbidden from sidewalk use and carry the same age restriction for usage, with additional guidelines mandating obedience to road rules and prudent speed control.

Moreover, the laws concerning motor-driven cycles steer them in alignment with motorcycles. Requirements for a driver's license with a motorcycle endorsement, mandatory helmets for riders under 18, and obligations of registration and insurance underline the serious nature of these modes of transport.

“There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas.
However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers.
“They care about power.” Gas plants for data centers Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers.
Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity.","Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it.

The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road.

“It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.”

The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this build out promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come.

The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.”

Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar, and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability.

“There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.”

IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers—giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said.

There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totaling 411,600 MW of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, S.B. 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies.

Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply.

Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today.

Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation.

Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try to slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand.

This build-out promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records.

Texas, with 9 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15 percent of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26 percent of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state.

GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers.

For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand.

“The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.”

It forecast up to a 20 percent increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers.

Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate.

It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines have quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook.

“If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said.

The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March.

About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference.

“Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.”

Gas plants for data centers

Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 MW of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity.

Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 MW cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940.

“Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.”

CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 MW gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 MW data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart.

Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 MW South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 MW megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar, and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 MW from the grid.

Altogether, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global.

“There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.”

However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals.

Restrictions on renewable energy

Looking forward to a build out of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer.

Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power.

“It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.”

While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry.

One failed bill, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, H.B. 3356 and S.B. 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating.

When the legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund.

Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, S.B. 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas, or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass.

Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state.

Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue.

More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40 percent of their income.

He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the legislature is headed with renewables.

“I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/data-center-protest.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-08 11:05:47.922931

“Despite advancements in EV technology, ‘charging anxiety’ remains the biggest pain point affecting the user experience,” BYD chairman and president Wang Chuanfu said in a statement.
In the Shanghai demonstration, a new BYD Han L sedan reached a brief charging peak of 1,002 kW, before steadily tapering off to a “low” of 463 kW.
The company claims its 1,000 ampere current and 10-C charging rate are global records for any EV battery.
Finally, there’s the BYD Megawatt charger itself, whose maximum 1,360-kW output whips the 500 kW of Lucid’s new Charging Hub in New York City.","A five-minute charge for an EV, virtually as quick as a gasoline fill-up, has long seemed a quixotic dream.

Now electric Don Quixotes can save critical time on their quests, at least in China. BYD’s “megawatt charging” is here. And the company’s 1,000-kilowatt fast chargers could eliminate perhaps the biggest consumer gripe over EVs: That they take too long to charge.

BYD, the automaker that has passed Tesla in global EV sales, demonstrated its record-setting tech in Beijing during the recent Shanghai auto show. The numbers are staggering: More than a kilometer of added driving range per second on the plug. It supplies 400 kilometers of fresh range (nearly 250 miles) in five minutes. Even by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s more-realistic estimates, that equates to about 270 kilometers (168 miles) of range in five minutes.

“Despite advancements in EV technology, ‘charging anxiety’ remains the biggest pain point affecting the user experience,” BYD chairman and president Wang Chuanfu said in a statement. “To fully address this, our goal is to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refueling time for gasoline cars.”

BYD’s Fast Charging Versus Competitors

How does BYD’s lightning pace compare with other standards? In the latest Hyundai Ioniq5, I’ve added 270 kilometers in about 18 minutes. Tesla says its latest Model Y can manage that in 15 minutes. Lucid’s new Gravity SUV, the best of the bunch, can add 320 kilometers in 15 minutes, at a peak rate of 400 kW.

In the Shanghai demonstration, a new BYD Han L sedan reached a brief charging peak of 1,002 kW, before steadily tapering off to a “low” of 463 kW. In just under five minutes, the Han L boosted its battery from 13 to 60 percent and added 421 kilometers (262 miles) of range—about three times as fast as the top EV-and-charger combos in the United States.

“If I can add 250 miles in five minutes, what does this mean for oil and gas?” says Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights. “And if China is the only country that’s going to support this, are the rest of us going to live in an analog world?”

The real game changer, Le said, is that BYD—which is on pace to sell 5 million EVs and hybrids this year—has the cars, chargers, andbatteries to bring these advances to the masses at affordable prices. Without all three, none of this works. And none of that would be possible without being a vertically integrated company at massive scale. That includes an entire “kilovolt manufacturing chain” to develop and build every necessary component.

“This is where BYD is uniquely positioned,” Le says. “No other company has that much engineering control over what might seem to be disparate elements, by designing their own cars, chargers, and batteries.”

BYD claims its Blade battery’s 1,000-ampere current and 10-C charging rate are global records for the EV industry.BYD

In March, BYD debuted its Super e-Platform, which underpins the Han L sedan and Tang L SUV. The world’s first 1,000-volt car platform tops the Lucid’s 926 V, the 800 V of Hyundai, Porsche and other brands, or Tesla’s puny 400 V. To match the charging speeds, the platform integrates the industry’s first mass-produced, 1,500-V silicon-carbide chips. A powerful, 30,000-rpm electric motor can generate up to 580 kilowatts (778 horsepower). That’s enough to scoot the new BYDs from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour) in about 2.7 seconds. And while the Han L would surely cost more in Western countries, the sedan starts at roughly 210,000 yuan in China, or about US $29,000. The Tang L sells for the equivalent of about $40,000.

BYD’s next advance is a Flash Charging Battery, a variant of its current Blade batteries. Its lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry trades some power density for safety, durability, and unbeatable charging speeds. The company claims its 1,000 ampere current and 10-C charging rate are global records for any EV battery. (A 1-C battery refers to one that can charge or discharge in one hour; a 10-C battery can do the trick in six minutes.) BYD reduced the battery’s internal resistance by 50 percent, redesigning electrolytes, separators, and electrodes for “ultrafast ion channels.” Its latest refrigerant cooling system helps deliver a 35 percent gain in high-temperature lifespan, ensuring that megawatt charging won’t degrade the battery.

Finally, there’s the BYD Megawatt charger itself, whose maximum 1,360-kW output whips the 500 kW of Lucid’s new Charging Hub in New York City. The units feature built-in energy storage to reserve juice for when the grid can’t supply it, or for use in China’s rural areas.

The company designed its plug handles, or guns, to be less bulky than the CCS units found in the United States and Europe, if not quite as svelte as Tesla’s Supercharger plugs. But BYD’s quick-draw routine can extend to a pair of pistols: When a Megawatt charger isn’t available, the Han L and Tang L can plug into two fast chargers at once to maximize refill speeds, using DC ports on either side of the car. Pull up to a 250-kW charger with two plug outlets, and these Chinese models can charge at about 500 kW, or 360 kW on a pair of 180 kW units. Several Western models offer dual charging ports, but they’re exclusively DC on one side and AC on the other. BYD is the first to let users double their charging pace; no word on how Chinese EV owners might react to seeing one car hogging a pair of public outlets.

As Le notes, that speed is a watchword for China’s entire EV ecosystem. While the United States dithers—or seeks to kill incentives that encouraged consumers to buy EVs and automakers to build factories—China continues to innovate through a ruthless blend of competition and government support. Just two months after announcing its kilovolt platform, BYD has already built 500 Megachargers, though only at its dealerships for now, with plans for 4,000 chargers.

“The system is ready and the cars are affordable, from day one,” Le says.

That country’s arms race in fast charging is already sparking one-upmanship. Since BYD’s big move, Huawei—the smartphone giant now stepping into the automotive industry—and the Geely Group’s Zeekr brand have announced their own chargers that promise speeds of up to 1,500 kW. And Le responded to industry critics who have described these systems as overkill.

“Maybe so,” Le said. “But that’s the nature of the Chinese market: You have to outdo your competitor, or you’ll be left behind.”",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=60463254&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C281%2C0%2C282,N,,2025-06-08 12:18:12.113762

Federal data from early June show regular reformulated gas cost 34 cents more per gallon than conventional gas, on average, in the Midwest. But Byron Gary of the Kentucky Resources Council said complicating factors make it hard to isolate the causes of such price differences.

He noted reformulated gas is mainly sold in and around cities. “And urban areas can often see higher prices for a number of things, for a number of different reasons,” he said.

Government officials are now collecting public comment on whether the Louisville area should opt out of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s reformulated gas restrictions.

People can submit comments to the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District through July 2. They also can send their thoughts to the Kentucky Division for Air Quality through July 6.

Burning reformulated gas contributes less to dangerous ozone pollution than using conventional gas. That’s why, back in the 1990s, Kentucky opted into a federal requirement to sell reformulated gas in the Louisville area.

The effort did make a difference, but circumstances have changed, according to a draft proposal by the Air Pollution Control District and state Division for Air Quality.

The agencies say dropping the reformulated gas rule now shouldn’t prevent this region from meeting federal limits on ozone pollution, even though Louisville has repeatedly overshot those standards.

Two key reasons it’s safe to stop requiring reformulated gas sales, they say, are:

Updated federal standards led to cleaner conventional gas, significantly narrowing the gap with reformulated gas in terms of how much it contributes to ozone pollution.

They expect any relevant increase in emissions from dropping reformulated gas will be largely counterbalanced by Louisville Gas and Electric’s recent closure of a coal-fired unit at its Mill Creek facility, plus LG&E’s plan to retire another coal unit there.

According to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, the initiative involves approximately 160 kilometres of new and upgraded transmission lines to support growing energy needs across Ontario. The announcement follows the government’s recent plans for the largest nuclear expansion in the province’s history.

“Ontario is growing fast and so is our energy demand,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “That’s why we’re planning early and advancing approximately 160 km of new and upgraded transmission lines to connect people and businesses to the affordable, secure, reliable and clean energy they’ll need in the years ahead.”

The new and upgraded lines are intended to power manufacturing facilities, greenhouse operations, and expanding communities. Over the next 25 years, electricity demand in Ontario is projected to grow by 75 percent, with industrial demand alone expected to rise by 40 percent in the next five years.

To address these challenges, the province will consult on proposals to prioritize three major transmission projects:

A new line from Bowmanville to the Greater Toronto Area, connecting new electricity generation in Eastern Ontario, including the Darlington small modular reactors (SMRs), to Ontario’s grid.

A new line from Windsor to Lakeshore, aimed at meeting the growing energy needs of Windsor-Essex’s manufacturing and greenhouse sectors.

An upgrade to the existing lines between Orangeville and Barrie, to improve reliability and support economic growth in Central Ontario.

In addition, the government announced its support for upgrading existing lines between Manby and Riverside Junction in Toronto, to boost capacity and meet electricity demand in the city’s west end and downtown core.

“For Ontario’s energy-intensive industries — from greenhouses to auto manufacturing — access to affordable, secure and reliable electricity isn’t optional; it’s essential,” said Sam Oosterhoff, Associate Minister of Energy Intensive Industries. “By advancing these lines, we’re leveraging Ontario’s energy advantage to power investment, support increased production and protect jobs.”

The government also reaffirmed its support for Hydro One’s commitment to 50-50 partnerships with Indigenous communities for building new large-scale transmission lines.

Dear unnamed Viva Energy spokesperson,

I’m thinking of you – the person who recently told the Geelong Independent that:

“A gas terminal would be good news for Geelong. A reliable and affordable supply of gas is critical for industry and manufacturing, supporting employment and economic growth.”

I would genuinely welcome the opportunity to hear your thoughts in more detail, and to share a few of mine. Maybe I could invite you for a cup of coffee at a local café where we could talk this through? In which case we could also discuss why your organisation on several occasions has declined doing a radio/podcast interview with us about these matters.

Here are some of the perspectives I’d be very interested in your response to:

Reliable?

You describe gas as “reliable,” but is it really? Gas supply depends on finite wells that eventually run dry. It’s a fuel that leaks, emits toxins, and carries risks of explosion. None of that says ‘reliability’. And how often does Viva publicly report shutdowns, delays, or infrastructure issues?

Affordable?

Gas is currently the most expensive form of energy in Australia’s energy mix. It’s a key driver of high electricity prices – as we heard energy retailer Colin Long explain to us in The Sustainable Hour recently. It is a well established fact that households are financially better off by switching from gas to electric. (See links below). So who exactly is it ‘affordable’ for? Local Geelong families, or international fossil fuel shareholders?

Supporting employment?

The gas industry is shrinking globally. As renewables rise, fossil fuel jobs are disappearing. Where is your transition plan for Viva Energy’s gas workers when this terminal becomes a stranded asset? Why not invest in sectors with real long-term job growth, like electrification, energy efficiency, or battery storage?

Economic growth = community wellbeing?

Framing this project around “economic growth” feels deeply out of touch. Growth at what cost? The climate emergency is already affecting Geelong and the Surf Coast through heatwaves, flash flooding, rising insurance premiums, mental health, bushfires. Shouldn’t our energy strategy focus on stability, health, and resilience – not locking in decades of new emissions?

No name, no accountability – why?

You declined to put your name to the statement. That silence speaks volumes. If this project is genuinely in the public interest, why the anonymity? Surely transparency is a minimum standard for companies wanting social licence in our community?

I don’t doubt that you care about your role and your organisation. But please understand – many of us in Geelong do not see this gas terminal as “good news.” We see it as a costly, polluting, backward-looking distraction from the urgent task of building a clean and sustainable future for all of us.

I’d be happy to meet and speak respectfully, openly, and honestly about these things. I believe in conversation – not confrontation. If you’re open to that, just say the word. You have my email address below, and the comments field further down on this page is open.

Even better, join us in The Sustainable Hour’s virtual radio studio for an open talk in public about these important matters, with a genuine aim not only to get to understand each other better, but also to involve our podcast’s listeners in this discussion about Geelong’s energy future.

Kind regards,

Facts, figures and projections on gas

The case for electrification is stronger than ever. New research reveals Australians are ready to spend an incredible $82 billion on home energy upgrades like insulation, draught-proofing, heat pumps and solar, and RenewEconomy reported recently that at current rates, gas heating could effectively disappear from homes by 2032:

→ RenewEconomy – 2 June 2025:

Decommissioning rates show gas heating could be gone by 2032, but oil exec bonuses might suffer

“Unlike a number of manufacturing businesses, most households can readily substitute gas appliances with electric alternatives. Not only that, because electric heat-pump air and water heaters are vastly more energy-efficient than the gas alternatives, households would be financially better off switching to electric once their existing gas appliance is close to its end of life.”

→ RealEstate – 14 May 2025:

$82 billion opportunity: Why Aussies aren’t doing more to slash this big household expense

“Making homes more energy efficient has major financial benefits for households but one big barrier is holding people back, a new report has found. About 65% of households plan to make energy-efficient improvements to their homes in the next five years, expecting to spend an average of $7,950 on energy efficiency improvements, representing an $82 billion opportunity, the report found.”

The death spiral for gas companies is on: the less gas is used, the more gas companies charge those customers still left, thus making more customers abandon gas, and so it goes on for unloved old technology.

Facts, figures and projections on renewables

Renewables are now the cheapest source of new electricity

For the seventh consecutive year, Australia’s national science agency, the CSIRO, has confirmed that solar and wind are the cheapest source for new electricity generation in Australia. Their latest GenCost 2024-25 report shows that even when including the costs of storage and transmission to ensure reliability, the levelised cost of renewables is significantly lower than that of gas-fired power.

By the numbers: The estimated cost for a new gas generator ranges from $65 to $111 per megawatt-hour (MWh). In contrast, large-scale solar PV is as low as $44-$65 per MWh, and continues to fall. The report also notes that the cost estimates for new gas plants have increased to reflect the extra expense of making them ‘hydrogen-ready’.

Renewables and batteries are directly out-competing gas for grid services

Gas power plants have traditionally been used for “peaking” – providing rapid power to the grid during periods of high demand. However, large-scale batteries are now proving to be faster, cheaper, and more efficient at providing this service, directly undermining a key economic rationale for gas.

An example: In the United States, heat pumps are now decisively outselling natural gas furnaces for home heating. In 2024, heat pumps outsold gas furnaces by 30%, the largest gap ever recorded, demonstrating a clear consumer and market shift away from gas at the residential level. This trend of electrification reduces long-term gas demand.

There is plenty of evidence-based good news in the global renewable energy sector at the moment, with several major milestones being reached. Here are some of the positive developments:

Global momentum

Renewables to overtake coal: According to the International Energy Agency, 2025 is the year renewables are set to surpass coal as the world’s largest source of electricity. This marks a historic turning point in the global energy transition.

Clean power surpassed 40% of global electricity in 2024: Driven by a massive surge in solar and wind power, clean energy sources – renewables and nuclear – accounted for over 40% of the world’s electricity for the first time last year, according to energy think tank Ember. Renewable generation alone saw record growth.

Investment in clean energy is now double fossil fuels: Global investment in clean energy technologies is on track to hit a record USD $2.2 trillion in 2025, twice the amount being invested in fossil fuels. The IEA reports that solar power alone is attracting more capital than any other single energy technology.

Record-breaking growth in renewables: 2024 saw the largest-ever annual increase in new renewable energy capacity, with the world adding a record 585 GW, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA. Solar and wind power accounted for 96.6% of this growth.

China green transition

Recent data from early 2025 reveals a remarkable acceleration in China’s energy transition, with global implications:

China’s CO₂ emissions are falling due to renewables: For the first time, the explosive growth in China’s clean power generation has caused the nation’s CO₂ emissions to fall, despite rapid growth in electricity demand. Analysis from Carbon Brief shows emissions fell 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025 because new renewable energy met more than 100% of the new demand for electricity, actively displacing fossil fuels.

Wind and solar capacity overtakes coal: As of February 2025, China’s total installed capacity of wind and solar power surpassed its thermal power (predominantly coal) capacity for the first time.

Record clean energy generation: In the first quarter of 2025, China produced a record 951 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity from clean sources – wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear – a 19% increase from the same period in 2024. Solar generation alone was up an astonishing 48%.

These developments indicate that the momentum behind the renewable energy transition is not only sustained but accelerating, with key global milestones being achieved sooner than many had predicted.

Facts, figures and projections on climate

In Australia

Accelerated warming: Australia’s climate has warmed by an average of 1.51°C since national records began in 1910, with the majority of this warming occurring since 1950. The past decade has been the warmest on record.

Intensified heat extremes: The number of days with extremely high temperatures has sharply increased. In 2019, there were 33 days where the national average maximum temperature exceeded 39°C, a number greater than the combined total from 1960 to 2018.

Shifting rainfall patterns: Southern Australia is experiencing significant drying. Since 1970, cool season (April to October) rainfall has decreased by around 16% in the southwest and by about 9% in the southeast since 1994. Conversely, northern Australia’s wet season (October to April) rainfall has increased by approximately 20% since 1994.

Diminishing water resources: Streamflow has seen a significant decrease in over 28% of monitoring stations across Australia since 1970, with the most pronounced reductions in the south. This trend is impacting water availability for agriculture, industry, and urban centres.

Escalating fire danger: There has been a significant increase in extreme fire weather and a lengthening of the fire season across large parts of Australia since the 1950s.

Warming and acidifying oceans: The oceans surrounding Australia have warmed by an average of 1.08°C since 1900. This warming is contributing to more frequent and severe marine heatwaves, such as those affecting the Great Barrier Reef, Tasmania and the South Australian coast line. The oceans are also becoming more acidic, threatening marine ecosystems.

Rising sea levels: Sea levels around Australia are rising in line with the global trend, increasing the risk of coastal inundation and erosion, particularly during extreme high-tide events. Some houses in Indented Head on the Bellarine Peninsula can no longer be insured and are becoming unsellable due to projected sea level rise.

Globally

Unprecedented global temperatures: The last ten years (2015-2024) were the warmest decade ever recorded. 2024 was the warmest year in the 175-year observational record, with the global mean temperature reaching approximately 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels.

Record ocean heat: For the eighth consecutive year, ocean heat content reached a record high in 2024. The rate of ocean warming over the past two decades is more than double that of the period between 1960 and 2005.

Rapid ice melt:

Glaciers: The three-year period from 2021 to 2023 saw the largest loss of glacier mass on record.

Polar ice sheets: The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass at an accelerated rate. Between 1993 and 2019, Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tonnes of ice per year, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tonnes annually.

Accelerating sea level rise: The rate of global mean sea-level rise has more than doubled since the beginning of a satellite tracking in 1993.

Dramatic changes at the poles:

Arctic: The 18 lowest Arctic sea-ice extents have all occurred in the last 18 years.

Antarctic: The three lowest sea-ice extents on record have all been observed in the last three years.

Record greenhouse gas concentrations: In 2023, atmospheric concentrations of the three main greenhouse gases – carbon dioxide (CO2​), methane, and nitrous oxide – reached their highest observed levels. CO2​ levels were 151% of pre-industrial levels and are continuing to rise.",https://climatesafety.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gas-versus-renewables2_Gemini800.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 12:16:33.383506

Two polls conducted at virtually the same time frame reached the same conclusion.

Interest in EV purchases among U.S. adults downshifted to its lowest level since 2019, according to a new AAA survey.

The automobile group reported Tuesday that 16% of adults reported they were either likely or very likely to buy a fully electric vehicle as their next car. That’s down from 18% in 2024, 23% in 2023, and 25% in 2022.

These generally deteriorating EV sentiments align with a Gallup poll released in April.

That poll showed that the number of Americans open to buying an EV dropped to 51% in early 2025, down from 59% in 2023.

Despite 75 new electric vehicle models being introduced in the past four years, the AAA survey found the percentage of consumers indicating they would be unlikely or very unlikely to purchase an EV rose from 51% in 2022 to 63% in 2025.

AAA said the survey was conducted March 6-10 through online and phone interviews with 1,128 U.S. adults. The margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.

Barriers to the EV movement, according to the survey, include high battery repair costs, EV purchase prices, a perceived unsuitability of EVs for long-distance travel, a lack of convenient public charging stations and a fear of running out of charge while driving.

Respondents cited gas savings, environmental concerns and lower maintenance costs as their top motivations to purchase an electric vehicle, according to AAA, which said its 2024 analysis “found that EVs had the lowest fuel cost and lowest maintenance cost of any vehicle type.”

Taking a longer view, the percentage of U.S. drivers who believe that most cars will be electric within the next 10 years declined from 40% in 2022 to 23% this year, according to the survey.

EV makers face increasing pressures from sweeping Trump administration tariffs, the threat of repeal of consumer tax credits and a halt to a national build-out of EV chargers.

While EV sales are still increasing year over year, that rise has slowed in recent months, the Gallup poll found. Tesla sales in particular have plummeted during Elon Musk’s polarizing push to cut the federal workforce as head of the U.S. DOGE Service.

But we can’t blame the negative EV perception solely on Musk.

Gallup’s polling detected that trend even before President Donald Trump’s second term.

Lydia Saad, director of U.S. social research at Gallup, told the Washington Post that the poll doesn’t show the exact reasons for the waning interest, but she emphasized that the drop first appeared in March 2024.

In that survey, the same number of Americans, 51%, said that they own an EV or are open to purchasing one.

“At that time, we weren’t attributing it to politics as much as mounting concerns about EVs,” she said. “The practical issues of accessing charging stations, the driving range of these vehicles, those sorts of things.”

Now, Saad added, it’s hard to say whether those issues are continuing to have an effect or if they are also compounded by political controversies.

More worrisome, the results from Gallup’s annual environment survey, conducted March 3-16, elicited a shift in attitude among the most enthusiastic supporters of EVs. The number of Americans who say they already own an EV or are seriously considering buying one dropped from 16% in 2024 to 11% in 2025.

Democrats, young adults and college graduates also showed declines from 2023 to 2025.

Even amid uncertainty about the future of the market, EV sales have continued to rise. More than 365,000 EVs were sold in the final quarter of 2024, up from 317,000 in the final quarter of 2023. But the rate of growth has slowed in recent years, at the same time the U.S. has begun to lag behind the typical “S-curve” of technology adoption — a slow ramp-up followed by exponential growth.

But Corey Cantor, research director at the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the poll also offers good news for the EV transition. “Half of the market is currently interested or already owns an EV,” he said.

At the moment, electric vehicles make up about 10% of all new-car sales. “It suggests to me that there’s potential on the EV side for five-times adoption,” Cantor said.

After a year of a lot of political controversy and debate around EVs, he added, it’s a good sign for the shift to EVs that there was no interest decline between 2024 and 2025.

The poll also found high consumer interest in hybrids — particularly among Republicans. Fifty-five percent of Republicans own or would consider buying a hybrid, compared with 31% who own or would consider buying an electric vehicle.

While these polls can only be viewed as a snapshot of consumers’ feelings, they do suggest that EVs’ most ardent supporters might have overestimated motorists’ readiness to accept vehicles that plug into a charger rather than fill up at the pump.

Dueling numbers aside, these polls show that old habits die hard, especially when the alternative remains beyond the price range of most Americans.",https://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP_Poll_Electric_Vehicles_12971.jpg?w=1024&h=638,N,,2025-06-08 09:03:58.365878

Buckle up, folks — this week we’re taking off with a look at the futuristic dream of flying electric cars possibly gliding above U.S. roads sooner than you think. But before we get carried away, let’s bring it back down to the bumpy road of present-day realities.

Recommended Videos

Even if you’re mostly interested about the tech powering the electric vehicle (EV) revolution, it’s become increasingly hard to avoid the politics around it: You guessed it, we’re talking about this week’s public feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump.

What does this have to do with EV tech? Well, quite a lot actually. For starters, the technology behind Tesla’s Autopilot and Full-Self Driving (FSD) modes may return in the crosshairs of regulators: Despite the names, these are still driver-assist features that require active driver supervision, and until Trump’s election, they had been under heavy scrutiny by safety regulators for several years.

Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched an investigation into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD. Big questions remain about the driver-assist system’s performance under adverse, yet naturally-occurring conditions such as fog, sun glare, rain, and snow.

When Musk, who spent about $275 million to help elect Trump, was appointed to head a newly-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), it raised more than a few eyebrows about his power and influence over the regulators who are supposed to oversee traffic safety, and therefore Tesla.

It didn’t help that the Trump administration followed Musk’s recommendations and relaxed crash-reporting requirements put in place since 2021, while also relaxing rules to accelerate the deployment of fully-automated robotaxis.

The Trump/Musk clash takes place just as Tesla is due to launch its robotaxi pilot progam in Texas later this month. While Trump is now threatening to pull billions of dollars in government subsidies and contracts from Musk’s companies, it’s unclear whether he might pressure the Department of Transportation to again tighten the regulatory screws on Tesla. What is clear is that Trump has never been a fan of electric vehicles and is already trying to end federal subsidies on EV purchases and leases. And while he had made a big deal about buying a bright red Tesla Model S back in March, Trump now says he wants to sell it.

Back to the tech

Meanwhile, Tesla is still required to respond to information and data requests from NHTSA regarding the safety of its robotaxis by July 1. And ultimately, it should come down to the performance of the technology.

For Autopilot and FSD, Tesla has opted for less expensive navigational tech relying on multiple onboard cameras that feed AI machine-learning models. But especially for so-called adverse driving conditions, it’s the more expensive technology relying on a blend of pre-mapped roads, sensors, cameras, radar, and lidar (a laser-light radar) which has received the nod of regulators.

Waymo, the sole robotaxi service currently operating in the U.S., and Zoox, Amazon’s upcoming robotaxi service, both use that blend of navigational tech.

For its robotaxis, Tesla is said to have upped its game in terms of autonomous driving with its Hardware 4 (HW4) technology, which does include radar sensors and promises enhanced environmental perception.

Will that be enough for Tesla to convince regulators, catch up with Waymo, or compete effectively with Zoox?

We’ll have to wait and see.

Flying cars

In a recent edition, we noted that while consumer confidence about robotaxi technology is on the rise, most people also want more data before they hop into a self-driving vehicle.

What about flying taxis? According to a recent survey by Honeywell, nearly all U.S. airline fliers, or 98%, said they would consider using a so-called electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL, as part of their travel journey.

But while the buzz around flying electric vehicles has mostly focused on air taxis— like Archer Aviation’s Midnight, expected to fly athletes around the 2028 LA Olympics, or Joby’s slick air taxi, backed by Toyota — one California startup is shooting for something a little more… driveable.

Meet Alef Aeronautics, a Bay Area company that wants to put the “car” back in “flying car.” This week, Alef announced it has received over 3,400 pre-orders for its electric flying vehicle, the Model A — and get this: it’s not a futuristic prototype gathering dust in a lab. Alef says production could begin by the end of 2025, or early next year.

On the ground, the Model A operates like a low-speed electric car, complete with hub motors in the wheels and—wait for it—a real steering wheel. You can legally drive it at up to 25 mph on public roads, parking it in a normal garage like any other EV. It’s refreshingly manual in an increasingly hands-free world.

But when it’s time for lift off, the steering wheel takes a backseat. For vertical takeoff and flight, the Model A transforms into a drone-like aircraft. Its cabin rotates sideways to create lift, and eight electric rotors—controlled by a flight system and joysticks—take over. No pedals, no yoke, just a bit of joystick magic (or autopilot, if you prefer).

The Model A has already received the nod from regulators for test flights.

While the $300,000 price tag won’t fit everyone’s budget, the company is clearly betting on a future where you don’t have to choose between a car and a flying machine—you can have both.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Alef-in-Transition-Flight.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-06-08 09:04:02.581649

Released by the Gulf Statistical Center, the index serves as an assessment tool to evaluate the progress of 125 nations toward achieving net-zero emissions through a balanced approach that incorporates mitigation technologies and enabling tools.

It also measures their transition to a carbon-neutral future based on circular economy principles, the Oman News Agency reported.

The GCC’s performance highlights its growing commitment to sustainable energy and carbon reduction strategies.

Its push toward a circular carbon economy aligns with broader economic diversification goals, as the region seeks to reduce its reliance on hydrocarbons while tackling environmental challenges.

“The contribution of the design capacity of renewable energy plants in the GCC countries to the total design capacity of renewable energy plants worldwide also increased, reaching 0.43 percent in 2024, compared to 0.03 percent in 2015,” the ONA report stated.

This expansion reflects increased investments in solar, wind, and other clean energy projects across the region.

With some member states ranking among the world’s highest per capita emitters, the shift to sustainable practices — such as waste recycling, renewable energy development, and carbon capture — aims to balance continued energy leadership with climate commitments.

According to the Jeddah-based Gulf Research Center, rapid urbanization and resource-intensive consumption patterns have further driven the need for circular solutions, particularly in water and waste management, as the GCC works to mitigate its ecological footprint while fostering green investment and job creation.

Currently, the GCC operates three commercial carbon capture and storage facilities, with a combined capacity of 3.8 million tonnes of CO2 per year. These facilities play a crucial role in reducing industrial emissions, the ONA report noted.

Looking ahead, the region is projected to capture and store up to 65 million tonnes of CO2 annually by 2035. CCS technology is a key component of the GCC’s strategy to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

GCC’s leadership

During its G20 presidency in 2020, Saudi Arabia introduced the Circular Carbon Economy Framework, which was endorsed by G20 leaders as a sustainable and cost-effective approach to tackling climate change while ensuring energy security.

Building on this momentum, the Kingdom launched its CCE National Program in 2021, focusing on emissions reduction through four key strategies: reduce, reuse, recycle, and remove.

Saudi Arabia has since implemented over 30 CCE initiatives across its energy sector, aligning with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s 2021 pledge to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060.

The UAE has also emerged as a regional leader in circular economy policy. Its Circular Economy Agenda 2031 serves as a national blueprint, outlining 22 policies across four key sectors — manufacturing, food, infrastructure, and transportation — to drive advanced recycling, economic growth, job creation, and resource efficiency.

As host of COP28, the UAE reaffirmed its global sustainability commitment, leveraging its strengths in green finance, clean energy, and climate innovation.",,N,,2025-06-08 12:16:37.750547

India, like many others, has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. It has made impressive progress in scaling up renewable energy. Yet, the shift to clean mobility—particularly EVs—remains fraught with obstacles. With the transport sector accounting for nearly 14% of India’s total greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonising mobility is no longer optional; it is imperative.

Electric vehicles are transforming global transportation and promise a cleaner, greener future. India, too, is steadily advancing towards EV adoption. In this context, the re-entry of Tesla into the Indian conversation, after two false starts, adds a new dimension. But the question remains: are EVs the panacea they are often made out to be? And is India ready—both structurally and strategically—to embrace them as part of its climate and industrial policy?

The need for urgency—and infrastructure

India’s major cities—Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru—are already gasping under the weight of vehicular emissions. Air quality routinely falls into hazardous territory, and with climate extremes like heatwaves intensifying, the urgency for cleaner transport systems is growing. Electrifying mobility can reduce India’s dangerous dependence on imported fossil fuels, which make up 85% of its crude oil consumption.

However, the shift to EVs faces deep structural limitations. A patchy charging infrastructure is among the most significant. India currently has just one public charger for every 135 EVs, and only 25,000 charging stations across the country. Meeting the ambitious target of 3.9 million chargers by 2030, according to a recent report by Gamechanger Law Advisors and Speciale Invest, will require massive public-private coordination and capital.

The Indian road network also presents a unique challenge. Poor road conditions, extreme temperatures, and inadequate service support could compromise EV performance. Any global player, including Tesla, must design and deliver products suited for these realities.

Policy incentives and protectionism

The automotive market in India is undergoing a cautious but determined transformation. Government projections suggest that by 2030, 80% of two- and three-wheelers, 40% of buses, and 30% of private cars could be electrified. To attract foreign investment, India recently reduced import duties on EVs to 15%—but only for companies committing over $500 million towards domestic manufacturing.

While such incentives may benefit players like Tesla, policy unpredictability remains a deterrent. Frequent changes in EV regulations create planning ambiguity. Furthermore, the government’s rejection of a $1 billion investment proposal from Chinese EV major BYD, ostensibly on national security grounds, shows how geopolitical considerations shape industrial policy.

This protectionist tilt could benefit Western manufacturers, but it raises questions about competition, innovation, and market access for domestic players.

Trump, tariffs, and Tesla’s gamble

Tesla’s renewed India push comes at a politically sensitive time. US President Donald Trump has publicly criticised Elon Musk’s plans to expand manufacturing in India. Labelling it a betrayal of American industry, Trump has backed a 26% tariff on Indian goods, part of a wider campaign to penalise outsourcing and promote domestic jobs.

This puts Tesla in an awkward position. As Musk eyes India’s booming premium car segment, he also risks alienating a powerful political ally at home. The 90-day pause on these retaliatory tariffs—announced in May 2025—only deepens the uncertainty. For India, it’s a moment of geopolitical balancing: to welcome investment without becoming collateral in someone else’s trade war.

EVs and the domestic industry ecosystem

Tesla’s entry could trigger broad ripple effects across India’s automotive supply chain. Several Indian firms already supply components to global EV makers, and the arrival of Tesla could deepen those linkages, create jobs, and spur innovation. With global manufacturers rethinking their supply dependencies post-COVID, India stands to benefit as an alternative sourcing hub for electronics, electricals, and components.

Yet, the EV market remains small. EVs account for less than 3% of all passenger vehicle sales in India. Tata Motors dominates the segment with a 60% share, while Mahindra and MG Motors cater to middle-income buyers. Tesla’s offerings, however, are priced at a significant premium. The company competes more with BMW and Mercedes than with mass-market vehicles. Without substantial price adjustments—or localised manufacturing—Tesla risks being a niche player in a country where affordability drives volume.

Sustainability: A deeper look

Beyond manufacturing and market access lies the larger question of environmental integrity. EVs are only as green as their supply chains. Lithium-ion batteries—containing lithium, nickel, cobalt—are resource-intensive to produce and challenging to dispose of. India’s battery recycling framework is rudimentary at best. Without rigorous policies for battery reuse and material recovery, the ecological benefits of EVs could be undermined.

Sustainability also means resisting the temptation of green capitalism in its most performative form. Building an EV ecosystem should not merely be about chasing profits or prestige; it must also prioritise long-term environmental balance, energy equity, and social inclusion.

Roadmap for a greener future

The arrival of global giants like Tesla can infuse much-needed momentum, capital, and technology into the electric vehicles sector. But the road ahead requires far more than high-powered branding and aspirational products.

It demands consistent policy, sound infrastructure, and equitable pricing. It calls for investment not just in factories but in ecosystems—charging networks, R&D hubs, recycling systems, and workforce training. And above all, it requires a governance mindset that values sustainability not as a slogan but as strategy.

The question is not whether India should go electric. It is whether it can do so wisely, equitably, and at scale. In this pursuit, will India stay the course—or get caught in the traffic?

New Jersey households, newly burdened with higher electricity costs, will receive $100 to $250 credits from the state, parceled over six months, to help pay the bills, Governor Phil Murphy announced in Newark on June 5.

Typical households will receive $16.60 per month from July-December. Low- and moderate-income households will receive $41.60 per month.

The initiative comes after the average residential electricity bill rose about $20 a month starting June 1. That’s the result of higher prices at an annual energy supply auction by PJM Interconnection, a regional wholesaler to local utilities. PJM has said the grid is under pressure from sources including energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers and renewed domestic manufacturing.

“As households across New Jersey begin to crank up the air conditioning and plug in their fans to stay cool in the summer heat, we know there is one concern that is top of mind for many, if not most: the rising cost of energy,” Murphy said.

The state expects to spend $430 million on the relief. The funding comes from three sources: the Clean Energy Fund, the Board of Public Utilities’ share of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) money and the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment Fund (SACPF).

“This is not going to solve our issues,” said Christine Guhl-Sadovy, president of the Board of Public Utilities, which announced the price increases in February. “We are just at a moment in time that if we can help people, it is our duty.”

Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat from Woodbridge, said the new rates “simply weren’t fair.”

“That’s why we went to work immediately, not just to start to solve the immediate problem, which is what we’re doing here today, but to start the work on the long-term solution,” Coughlin said.

Earlier this week, the Senate passed legislation that would require the Board of Public Utilities to study the role of data centers in driving up the cost of electricity in the state, as well as another piece of legislation directing the BPU to investigate the recent energy auction by PJM Interconnection that established the higher rates.",https://mercerme.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/new_jersey_electric_credit.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 12:16:49.197647

EVs Sales Forecast and Real Estate Opportunity in EV Manufacturing

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), in line with projections by NITI Aayog and the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), estimates cumulative EV sales in India to reach 25.3 to 31.8 million units by 2030 – an annual average of 4.2 to 5.3 million units. According to Savills India Research, this will drive land requirement of 2,009 to 2,467 acres for manufacturing facilities, with a built-up potential of 43.8 to 53.7 mn sq. ft.

Note: RE investments refer to investments in land and the construction of facilities required for the manufacturing of EVs.

Need for Public Charging Infrastructure and Real Estate Opportunity

To accommodate this substantial increase in EV adoption, Savills India Research estimates that India will need 81,000 to 92,500 public and semi-public charging stations, maintaining a 1:20 station-to-vehicle ratio. This translates to a total land requirement of 2,402 to 2,744 acres, with a built-up potential of 52.3 to 59.8 mn sq. ft. requiring an investment of USD 2.8 to 3.2 bn. Significant infrastructure will also be needed for electric two-wheeler charging across office complexes, malls, transit hubs and public parking areas.

Note: RE investments refer to investments in land and the construction of public charging stations.

Li-Ion Battery Demand Forecasts and Real Estate Opportunity

India aims to produce 13% of its EV battery cell demand domestically by 2030, reducing reliance on imports from countries like China, South Korea, and Japan. Lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity, currently at 4 GWh (as of 2023) is projected to rise to between 147 GWh and 179 GWh by 2030, according to Savills India Research. This will require a total land requirement of 1,348 to 1,641 acres of land with a built-up potential of 29.3 to 35.7 mn sq. ft. and an investment of USD 1.9 to 2.3 bn for land and construction.

Note: RE investments refer to investments in land and the construction of facilities required for the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries.

House budget bill favors wealthy

Here are the things I strongly object to in the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed in the U.S. House:

A provision of the bill states, “No court of the United States may enforce a contempt citation for failure to comply with an injunction or temporary restraining order if no security was given when the injunction or order was issued,” to be applied retroactively. If trillion-dollar bonds are required to contest trillion-dollar damages our government is causing, that destroys the protections our Constitution provides its citizens against the rule of tyrants.

The provision prohibiting states from regulating AI for the next 10 years is unconscionably ignorant and dangerous. Federal oversight and regulation can be slow, and the power of AI moves very fast. The states are much more responsive and agile in detecting dangers to the public.

The slashing of the benefits of medical care, food and other assistance to low-income families in this bill goes so far beyond even the most exaggerated claim of fraud, waste and abuse as to be cynically and sadistically abusive. In addition, this bill makes the trillions in tax reductions for the ultra-wealthy a permanent part of our tax code.

In a system ruled by the “noble wealthy,” where courts are a mere formality to dress injustice in a righteous cloak, dangers to the public are only tended when “inconvenient” to those above, and where the peasants have no right to fairness in how they are paid for their labor, this bill would make perfect sense. Let’s don’t continue down the path toward being that country.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Chiseling away at President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Rolling back the green energy tax breaks from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

At its core, the Republican “big, beautiful bill” is more than just an extension of tax breaks approved during President Donald Trump’s first term at the White House.

The package is an attempt by Republicans to undo, little by little, the signature domestic achievements of the past two Democratic presidents.

“We’re going to do what we said we were going to do,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after House passage last month.

While the aim of the sprawling 1,000-page plus bill is to preserve an estimated $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that would otherwise expire at year’s end if Congress fails to act — and add some new ones, including no taxes on tips — the spending cuts pointed at the Democratic-led programs are causing the most political turmoil.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this week that 10.9 million fewer people would have health insurance under the GOP bill, including 1.4 million immigrants in the U.S. without legal status who are in state-funded programs. At the same time, lawmakers are being hounded by businesses in states across the nation who rely on the green energy tax breaks for their projects.

As the package moves from the House to the Senate, the simmering unrest over curbing the Obama and Biden policies shows just how politically difficult it can be to slash government programs once they become part of civic life.

“When he asked me, what do you think the prospects are for passage in the Senate? I said, good — if we don’t cut Medicaid,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., recounting his conversation last week with Trump. “And he said, I’m 100% supportive of that.”

Health care worries

Not a single Republican in Congress voted for the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in 2010, or Biden’s inflation act in 2022. Both were approved using the same budget reconciliation process now being employed by Republicans to steamroll Trump’s bill past the opposition.

Even still, sizable coalitions of GOP lawmakers are forming to protect aspects of both of those programs as they ripple into the lives of millions of Americans.

Hawley, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and others are wary of changes to Medicaid and other provisions in the bill that would result in fewer people being able to access health care programs.

At the same time, crossover groupings of House and Senate Republicans have launched an aggressive campaign to preserve, at least for some time, the green energy tax breaks that business interests in their states are relying on to develop solar, wind and other types of energy production.

Murkowski said one area she’s “worried about” is the House bill’s provision that any project not under construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law may no longer be eligible for those credits.

“These are some of the things we’re working on,” she said.

The concerns are running in sometimes opposite directions and complicating the work of GOP leaders who have almost no votes to spare in the House and Senate as they try to hoist the package over Democratic opposition and onto the president’s desk by the Fourth of July.

While some Republicans are working to preserve the programs from cuts, the budget hawks want steeper reductions to stem the nation’s debt load. The CBO said the package would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the decade.

After a robust private meeting with Trump at the White House this week, Republican senators said they were working to keep the bill on track as they amend it for their own priorities.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the president “made the pitch and the argument for why we need to get the bill done.”

The disconnect is reminiscent of Trump’s first term, when Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, only to see their effort collapse in dramatic fashion when the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, voted thumbs down for the bill on the House floor.

Battle over Medicaid

In the 15 years since Obamacare became law, access to health care has grown substantially. Some 80 million people are now enrolled in Medicaid, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reports 41 states have opted to expand their coverage. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to all adults with incomes up to about $21,500 for an individual, or almost $29,000 for a two-person household.

While Republicans no longer campaign on ending Obamacare, advocates warn that the changes proposed in the big bill will trim back at access to health care.

The bill proposes new 80 hours of monthly work or community service requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, age 18 to 64, with some exceptions. It also imposes twice-a-year eligibility verification checks and other changes.

Republicans argue that they want to right-size Medicaid to root out waste, fraud and abuse and ensure it’s there for those who need it most, often citing women and children.

“Medicaid was built to be a temporary safety net for people who genuinely need it — young, pregnant women, single mothers, the disabled, the elderly,” Johnson told The Associated Press.

“But when when they expanded under Obamacare, it not only thwarted the purpose of the program, it started draining resources.”

Initially, the House bill proposed starting the work requirements in January 2029, as Trump’s term in the White House would be coming to a close. But conservatives from the House Freedom Caucus negotiated for a quicker start date, in December 2026, to start the spending reductions sooner.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has said the changes are an Obamacare rollback by another name.

“It decimates our health care system, decimates our clean energy system,” Schumer of New York said in an interview with the AP.

The green energy tax breaks involve not only those used by buyers of electric vehicles, like Elon Musk’s Tesla line, but also the production and investment tax credits for developers of renewables and other energy sources.

The House bill had initially proposed a phaseout of those credits over the next several years. But again the conservative Freedom Caucus engineered the faster wind-down — within 60 days of the bill’s passage.

“Not a single Republican voted for the Green New Scam subsidies,” wrote Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, on social media. “Not a single Republican should vote to keep them.”

The “Big, Beautiful Bill” that Republicans are pushing under President Trump would roll back almost all the clean energy incentives that Democrats enacted under President Biden, shredding federal support for solar, wind, nuclear, electric vehicles, and other climate-friendly technologies. But it would make a lavish exception for one supposedly green form of energy that isn’t green at all: farm-grown jet fuels.

Aviation, which generated about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2024, is a notoriously difficult sector to decarbonize, and the US aviation industry has committed to using so-called “sustainable aviation fuels” to reach its net-zero climate goals. But using crops like corn and soybeans to produce fuel instead of food not only increases food prices and global hunger, it spurs farmers around the world to tear down more forests and plow up more grasslands to create new farmland to replace the lost food. That’s why farm-grown biofuels have been a climate problem masquerading as a climate solution for cars, and they would have the same problem in planes.

In a particularly egregious policy twist, the GOP bill would not only extend Biden’s tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) until 2031, it would also ban any consideration of those land-use emissions when calculating which fuels are sustainable. That would be like banning consideration of smokestack emissions when calculating which power plants are sustainable. And in legislation that otherwise slashes energy spending, the biofuels giveaway would cost US taxpayers an extra $45 billion.

But such is the power of US agricultural interests, which are increasingly worried that electric vehicles will crush demand for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel on the road and have been furiously lobbying Washington to create new demand in the sky. In case there was any confusion about the purpose of the biofuels provision, it’s not in the energy policy section of the Big Beautiful Bill: It’s in the section that claims to “Make Rural America Grow Again.”

The political twist is that it’s not just a Republican provision. While the overall bill has no Democratic supporters, and even some Republicans have objected to its assault on other energy subsidies, the biofuels carve-out has strong backing from farm-friendly Democrats, who created the original tax credit for SAFs in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. There’s always been broad bipartisan support for the federal mandate requiring corn ethanol to be blended into gasoline, and even though the overall Big Beautiful Bill aims to dismantle Biden’s climate policies and extend Trump’s tax cuts, its biofuels language was lifted from a bipartisan “Farm to Fly” bill explicitly designed to get ethanol to qualify for SAF credits of up to $1.75 a gallon.

“It’s shocking but it’s not surprising,” says Dan Lashof, a climate scientist and senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. “Agriculture has an extremely well-oiled lobbying machine. So even as Congress guts all these things that reduce emissions to save money, they get Congress to spend lots of money to expand the one thing that increases emissions.”

The impacts on the global landscape could be dramatic. An analysis by the American Enterprise Institute concluded that producing about 10 percent of US jet fuel from SAF by 2030—an explicit Biden Administration goal—would require about half the US soybean crop, occupying enough farmland to cover the state of Nebraska.

Princeton senior research scholar Tim Searchinger has calculated that using vegetable oils like soybean for one fourth of global aviation fuel would require 40 percent of global cropland, an area twice the size of India. Flying a plane with corn ethanol would be particularly inefficient; it takes 1.7 gallons of ethanol to make a gallon of jet fuel, and producing ethanol uses almost as much fossil fuel as ethanol replaces.

The world is already losing a soccer field worth of tropical forest every six seconds, most of it to agricultural expansion, and heightened demand for feedstocks like corn, soy, canola, and palm could overrun vast swaths of forests and undeveloped land, releasing its sequestered carbon and eliminating its ability to absorb atmospheric carbon in the future. The European Union specifically excludes the use of crop-based fuels for aviation because the land-use effects are so devastating, but even when Biden was still president, the US farm lobby was fighting to make sure that didn’t happen here.

At one Biden cabinet meeting in 2023, agriculture secretary and former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack handed treasury secretary Janet Yellen a one-page briefing document, flagging it as a high-priority issue. Yellen’s high-priority issues usually involved inflation, threats of recession, and global economic crises, so she was perplexed to read a page of acronym-laden biofuels-industry talking points about the methodological superiority of the GREET computer model over the CORSIA model for calculating carbon emissions from ILUC.

“Can someone tell me what this is about?” she later asked her top aides.

It was about billions of dollars, because the CORSIA model put enough emphasis on “indirect land-use change” to make crop-based aviation fuels ineligible for tax credits, while the farm-friendly GREET model downplayed ILUC enough to give corn and soybeans a chance to look sustainable. The stakes of this purportedly technical debate were so high that Biden climate czar John Podesta led a boringly named Sustainable Aviation Fuel Lifecycle Analysis Interagency Working Group to hash it out.

As I recount in my forthcoming book We Are Eating the Earth, the working group held weekly meetings that were clearly less about improving climate analytics than justifying the creation of a lucrative new market for farmers. “Nobody talked about the elephant in the room,” one administration official recalled. “It was theater of the absurd.”

The GREET modeling implied that all of Iowa’s corn production could be converted to ethanol while inducing virtually no farmers anywhere on Earth to expand their fields to grow more grain, but the results didn’t have to make sense when Biden was declaring at an Iowa ethanol plant that “we want to see facilities like this all over the Midwest.”

In 2024, the Biden administration agreed to use GREET—and since even GREET didn’t make ethanol look quite climate-friendly enough to qualify for credits, Vilsack secured several additional conditions that made the model even more favorable for farm-grown fuels. He barely even pretended the decision was driven by science in his public statement, hailing it as “a great beginning as we develop new markets for…home-grown agricultural crops.”

The initial US biofuels mandate for cars, in 2007, unleashed a torrent of deforestation in the Amazon, but Nikita Pavlenko, director of fuels and aviation for the International Coalition for Clean Transportation, says the farm lobby’s influence in Washington helped persuade the White House to ignore fears of a reprise. “We spent two years wrangling,” he says, “and in the end everyone who wanted to take land-use change seriously got steamrolled.”

Today, only 0.3 percent of the world’s aviation fuel is classified as sustainable: Most of it is recycled cooking oil that’s genuinely climate-friendly because it doesn’t use farmland or spur deforestation. United Airlines has an ad campaign touting its commitment to making SAF from waste instead of crop-grown feedstock, featuring Oscar the Grouch as its “Chief Trash Officer.” Environmentalists also hope to see planes fly on “green hydrogen” produced with clean energy; pongamia oil made from the seed of a climate-friendly tropical tree; and electricity, at least for short-haul flights.

But for the airlines, the most scalable alternative fuel opportunity would be subsidized crop-based fuels, which is why they have joined farm interests to push the current Congress to extend the SAF credit and make it even easier for farm-grown SAF to qualify. The Biden team had already diminished the role of indirect land-use change in its emissions analyses—the critics say its ILUC value should have been at least five times higher, and perhaps 40 times higher—and the US has already built enough biorefineries since 2021 to increase its production capacity for crop-based SAF sixfold.

Still, the industry lobbyists wanted to make sure that ILUC would pose no threat whatsoever to fuels brewed from crops, and they got what they wanted on page 208 of the Big Beautiful Bill: “The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land-use change.”

This is like Congress dictating that financial regulators can’t look at how much banks owe their creditors when determining whether they’re solvent; one environmentalist compared the provision to a legislative decree that pi equals nine.

“There’s a lot of hype about how this kind of legislation can jumpstart SAF and make a lot of money for farmers, and I think that’s right,” says Dan Blaustein-Rejto, who runs the Breakthrough Institute’s food and agriculture program. “I just don’t think that’s good.”

Abraham Lincoln liked to tell a riddle: How many legs does a dog have if you call a tail a leg? His answer was four: A tail is still a tail, even if you call it a leg. And using farmland to grow fuel still induces the expansion of farmland elsewhere to grow more food, even if emissions analysts aren’t allowed to acknowledge those indirect land-use changes. The brazen ban on even evaluating indirect land-use change could create problems for airlines that want to sell carbon credits for using alternative fuels, since a Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance, funded by Jeff Bezos, is working with environmental groups to make sure the credits are scientifically credible. But it’s not clear how much buyers like Microsoft and Meta really care about scientific credibility.

In any case, the biofuels lobby tends to get its way in Washington. The Biden administration issued an “emergency waiver” to get more ethanol blended into gasoline last summer, and the Trump administration plans to issue the same waiver this summer. The first specific item the Trump White House mentioned in a May 8 press release hailing its preliminary trade deal with the UK was increased access for US ethanol, with celebratory quotes from the US Grains Council, the Renewable Fuels Association, and the National Corn Growers Association. Those groups have a lot of influence, and it’s hard to imagine politicians bucking them over the proper way to assess indirect land-use change in life-cycle analyses.

“It’s hard to build a constituency for addressing an issue that seems so technical,” Lashof says. “And even if we could, it’s even harder to fight the farm lobby.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP21204602908932.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-08 07:02:53.294034

The dialogue was focused on NEVs and advanced photovoltaic industrial and supply chains, and spotlighted the growing resolve of participating countries to transform mobility and advance sustainable development.

It was a key part of the 2025 RCEP Local Governments and Friendship Cities Cooperation (Huangshan) Forum, which ran from June 4 to 6 and brought together approximately 300 delegates from all 15 RCEP member states. The forum yielded 27 cooperation deals spanning trade, technology and sister-city ties.

Under the RCEP framework, a number of joint projects were unveiled and signed during the event, reflecting a shared commitment to sustainability and deeper regional collaboration.

As protectionism and unilateralism continue to challenge global supply chains, the electric vehicle industry is facing increasing uncertainty.

Against this backdrop and as the world's largest free trade agreement by population and trade volume, the RCEP is emerging as a stabilizing force, bringing greater certainty to the global economy. This perspective was echoed by many forum participants.

Under the RCEP framework, NEV cooperation between member states is gaining strong momentum. In May, PT SGMW Motor Indonesia (Wuling) celebrated the production of its 3-millionth electric vehicle globally, and has manufactured 40,000 units at its plant in Cikarang, West Java. Geely reached a key milestone with the trial production of its EX5 model at its factory in Purwakarta, Indonesia, which is set to begin mass production in the third quarter.

Meanwhile, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has begun construction on a passenger vehicle plant in Cambodia's Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone. With a planned annual capacity of 10,000 vehicles, the plant is expected to start operations by the end of this year.

Representatives at the forum noted a clear shift in NEV cooperation among RCEP members -- from early-stage vehicle exports to deeper local integration. This transition has been marked by the establishment of regional manufacturing hubs and the development of full supply chains, including battery materials and key components.

SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile's factory in Indonesia, for example, has adopted a comprehensive setup encompassing both car manufacturing and the supply of parts to support the upgrade of the country's auto industry.

Major Chinese battery makers such as China Aviation Lithium Battery (CALB), Gotion High-Tech and SVOLT Energy Technology have also expanded into RCEP countries, building factories in Thailand, Vietnam and beyond. Some have already begun local production, accelerating the regional growth of an electric vehicle ecosystem.

""ASEAN represents a vibrant and dynamic region, with rising demand for mobility solutions, growing environmental awareness, and a youthful population that embraces change,"" said Edmund Araga, president of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Philippines.

In recent years, RCEP members have set goals to cut carbon emissions. Cambodia is aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and increase its renewable energy share to 70 percent by 2030. Thailand is planning for electric vehicles to account for 30 percent of its car production by 2030, and to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

""Together, we represent more than 2.3 billion people and around 30 percent of global GDP. That is not just economic scale -- it is social responsibility,"" said Bhokin Bhalakula, former president of the National Assembly of Thailand and chairman of the Thai-Chinese Culture and Economy Association, speaking of the RCEP member states.

""RCEP has established a mechanism for long-term cooperation for us,"" said Dennis Chuah, president of the Electric Vehicle Association of Malaysia, adding that battery development and recycling are expected to become key areas of long-term cooperation between Malaysia, China and other RCEP members.

As the host city of the dialogue, Hefei is making big strides in the new energy sector. In 2024, the city's NEV output exceeded 1.37 million units, with the total value of its industrial chain hitting 260 billion yuan (about 36.19 billion U.S. dollars). Its solar and energy storage sectors also saw rapid growth, exceeding 180 billion yuan.

According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, China produced nearly 4.43 million NEVs in the first four months of 2025, up 48.3 percent year on year, with sales rising 46.2 percent to 4.3 million units. NEVs accounted for 42.7 percent of all new vehicle sales during the period.

""China has become a global leader in NEVs -- not just in terms of production, but in R&D, battery innovation, infrastructure and scale,"" Araga said. ""Together, we have the power to shape the future of mobility in Asia and the world.""

Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.

Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production.

Kristina Costa, who formerly worked at the White House implementing the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and climate policies, said the IRA established at least 10 years of tax credits to support clean energy industries, which launched new projects and expanded the industry.

“The House bill that the Republicans passed explodes that entire paradigm,” Costa said. “It functions as a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Costa, during a news conference last week with Climate Power, said the bill “really radically” changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to “lock in” a tax treatment at the start of construction.

“This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,” Costa said. “It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.”

How the bill impacts clean energy projects

Clean energy tax credits impact transportation, power generation, industry and construction and create incentives for projects like renewable vehicle fuels, solar, wind, nuclear power generation and more.

Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors.

Some of the restrictions include strict construction timeline requirements, like beginning construction within 60 days of enactment, and bringing the projects online by 2028.

Costa said these timelines create an “incredibly sharp cliff” for developers to work within for projects that often take years and can face lengthy setbacks from supply chain disruptions.

The budget bill also has extensive language pertaining to and restricting projects that have any ties to foreign entities.

Costa said these restrictions are “very complicated, unworkable, Byzantine requirements” that impose “a lot of red tape” for developers and would have the “immediate effect of freezing the market.”

She said it would require companies to understand where “literally every nut, bolt, screw and wire in a project they are building comes from” and certify that it does not have any ties to China or to Russia.

Costa said gutting these policies will lead to increased energy costs for American customers. A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7 percent for residential electricity costs.

Part of the problem is an anticipated 2 percent energy demand increase nationwide, in 2025 and again in 2026, according to the EIA. Much of that energy demand is a result of battery manufacturing and data centers.

Iowa alone has roughly 100 data centers, which is one of the largest concentrations in the midwest.

“The near term additions to the grid are going to come from renewables, or they’re supposed to come from renewables under the current tax regime,” Costa said. “That is why you would see these consumer electricity price increases.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s utility companies with significant investments in solar and wind energy, said the company is monitoring the bill.

A spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy declined to comment on the pending legislation.

Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A representative from the company did not answer questions about the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project.

A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032.

Repeal of the credits also would affect associated manufacturing companies, like those that make solar panel parts, or wind turbine blades.

Analysis from Climate Power found 400,000 jobs nationwide would be in jeopardy without the tax credits supporting the expanding industry.

Joe Zimsen, an Iowa resident with 10 years of construction experience in the wind industry, said the IRA created a “tremendous amount of hope” among his colleagues in the industry that has now “disintegrated” because of budget bill.

Zimsen formerly worked on wind projects near Grinnell, but now works for Renew Energy as a construction manager for off-shore wind projects. He and his family still live in Iowa, and he urged Iowa senators to oppose the bill as it is currently written.

“This policy of killing offshore and onshore wind and solar energy is going to have tremendous detrimental effects and set us back another 10 to 15 years behind our competitors, like China and Europe,” Zimsen said. “We can’t afford to do that.”

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said last Tuesday that wind energy incentives have been at risk since 2015 when he worked to extend them, and he said the senators would try to find a “compromise” on them again, Radio Iowa reported.

But, the so-called, “big beautiful bill” comprises much more than just clean energy concerns, which Grassley said means one issue can’t “stand in the way” of the rest of the bill.

A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said the senator has a “proven track record of standing up for Iowa’s homegrown energy solutions” and will “continue to put Iowans first” as the Senate considers the legislation.",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com/?uuid=d783dff3-7dc9-5332-85cb-93845ea99925&type=preview&q=75&width=1200&height=800,N,,2025-06-08 12:17:00.101221

“The system was designed to serve irrigation with some long radial transmission lines.” The goal of the expansion is to integrate those individual lines into a bigger circuit.
Two regional transmission lines are privately being built across the region.
“We work a lot with our neighboring utilities, because ultimately, you know, this is one power grid, and so utilities are somewhat reliant on each other,” Xcel Energy’s Martz said.","Story first appeared in:

One summer afternoon as the temperature pushed toward 100 degrees, a power line sagging in the heat hit a filbert tree in Hillsboro, Oregon, creating a dazzling electric arc and knocking out power 1,260 miles away in Denver.

The Hillsboro line was one of four to fail on Aug. 10, 1996, mostly from hitting trees. One, across the Columbia River from Hillsboro, started a fire, and 190 miles upstream 13 turbines at the McNary Dam tripped offline.

The cascading effects rippled across seven Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico — from Calgary to El Paso, Texas — cutting the power for 7.5 million people for as long as seven hours.

In Los Angeles, the power outage set off fire alarms around the city and knocked out traffic lights, creating instant gridlock. In San Francisco, chefs at the Hayes Street Grill set up barbecues in the alley behind the restaurant.

The Western electric grid isn’t the only that has collapsed. In 2003, an overgrown tree, a powerline in Ohio and flawed warning software led to a blackout that shut down 265 power plants and left 55 million people in the Northeast — including those in New York City and Toronto — in the dark .

“The grid is a living thing,” said Chris Pink, vice president of operations at the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which provides electricity for rural cooperatives in Colorado and three neighboring states. “It knows no boundaries.”

The electric grid — more than half a million miles of high-voltage transmission lines strung across the nation — is under growing pressure as the economy becomes more electrified and generation shifts from old, fossil fuel-burning plants to renewable resources.

In Colorado, the grid is key to meeting the state’s goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040 and cutting greenhouse gas emissions 100% by 2050. There are already plans to add more than 10,000 megawatts of wind, solar and storage to the state’s grid.

To absorb all that, the Colorado Electric Transmission Authority estimates between $4.5 billion and $8 billion in investments and 3,700 miles of line upgrades are needed.

And the challenge extends beyond the state’s borders. The Western Electricity Coordinating Council, which is responsible for assuring adequate electricity for 14 Western states and two Canadian provinces, warns that the grid is having trouble keeping pace.

A growing population, data centers, cryptocurrency mines, the electrification of manufacturing are all boosting demand. At the same time, the grid is shifting from baseload generation, like coal-fired plants, to variable renewable sources, and severe weather, wildfires and droughts are an increasing threat.

“Data centers can be built in as little as 18 months, and it takes a much longer time than that to get the approval to build new generation or to build out the transmission network,” Kris Raper, a WECC vice president, told The Colorado Sun.

New renewable energy and storage projects are piling up across the West, with waiting times as long as six years to get connected to the grid.

At the end of 2023, Xcel Energy’s Colorado subsidiary had 18 renewable projects in its queue, four that were suspended and 289 that had been withdrawn, according to a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study.

While some transmission is being built within state borders, constructing regional lines across the West has been difficult, Raper said, because of “jurisdictional issues.”

“We didn’t get to the place where we are because utilities are delaying resources or not paying attention,” Raper said. “We got there from a confluence of events — weather, people using more electricity, the resources coming on are different than the ones being retired.”

“It is everything everywhere all at one and the grid can only take so much and still be reliable,” she said.

The largest machine in the world

To understand the grid, a bit about electricity and history are in order. An electric generator — a turbine or solar panels — frees electrons to create an electric charge that can be carried on wires.

Thomas Edison put this phenomenon to widespread use with the light bulb. Edison’s generators produced a direct current — with the electrons flowing in one direction. The farther you wanted to send direct current, the higher the voltage needed. It was safe for Edison to send direct current only about a mile.

There were obvious limitations to having a generating station every couple of miles, and George Westinghouse pioneered alternating current, which changes direction every fraction of a second and can be sent over long distances without much energy loss.

One thing about alternating current is that when it is put on the grid it goes where it wants. There are a set of high-voltage transmission lines along Interstate 25 running from Xcel Energy’s Comanche 3 coal-fired power plant in Pueblo to Denver.

There is, however, no guarantee that the electricity from Comanche 3 will end up in Denver, and this complicates managing the grid. The current will flow based on where the demand is, which lines are congested and which have capacity. This can lead to the problem of “loop flow” or unscheduled power flowing through the system.

Tri-State’s Pink said the association’s substation in Gladstone, New Mexico, has technology on its transformer to guard against a loop-flow surge that could be coming from as far away as the Pacific Northwest.

As more renewable energy flows onto the grid, it also creates a new challenge.

Power plants with rotating machines, like a gas turbine, create alternating current, or AC, that can be directly connected to the grid. This spinning creates inertia in the grid, so if there is a disturbance, a drop in power, there are a few fractions of a second to right the system.

“It is hard to stop a big ship,” Omert Beik, a Colorado School of Mines electrical engineering professor, said.

When renewables are connected to the grid they need to be converted to AC and those resources have no rotating mass, no inertia. “It makes for a lighter system, more vulnerable to perturbations,” Beik said.

There are ways to compensate with battery storage and devices such as a synchronous condenser, which has a spinning motor. This calls for more investment and better grid design.

The nation’s electric grid has been called the largest machine in the world — with 11,000 power plants, 3,000 utilities and 2 million miles of large and small power lines — but it isn’t a single system. It is three pretty much isolated systems.

There is the Eastern Interconnection, which covers 33 Eastern and Midwestern states and Ontario and Quebec, an area from the Atlantic coast to a line running roughly along the eastern New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Montana borders.

The Western Interconnect covers the 14 Western states, British Columbia and Alberta, and a small piece of Baja, Mexico. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas covers just Texas.

The three grids are barely connected. When Winter Storm Uri caused widespread blackouts in Texas in 2021, the state could not draw extra power from neighboring grids, and when a heat wave taxed the Western grid in 2022, it could not access power from other regions.

“Transfer capability is a critical measure of the ability to address energy deficiencies,” according to the North American Reliability Corp., which is responsible for electric reliability across the entire grid.

The single biggest gap or “seam” is between the Western and Eastern grids. There are only seven, small direct-current tie lines — scattered from Miles City, Montana, to Artesia, New Mexico — connecting the two grids.

One of the ties, a 20-year-old, 210-megawatt line, runs to Lamar on Colorado’s southeastern plains. Moving electricity from the 1,000-MW transmission lines in Kansas to Colorado would be like driving on Interstate 70 and then at the Kansas-Colorado border having to get on a two-lane state road.

A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden found big operational and economic benefits in more tightly linking the East and the West, particularly the wind resources of the central states and the solar resources of the Southwest.

“Wind on one side and western solar on the other,” Pink said, “you know that looks good, but there is some really expensive transmission that has to be put in place.”

Still, NREL calculated an increase in transfer capacity would produce $2.50 in benefits for every dollar spent on the new transmission facilities.

For now, however, the two grids remain isolated and on the western side of the divide the single most isolated piece of the Western Interconnection is Colorado.

The Colorado grid is not well connected to the rest of the West

“If you think about the Western grid as a highway system, you have a huge interstate highway along the Pacific coast, from Washington to California, moving massive amounts of power back and forth,” said Tyler Farrell, a senior associate with clean energy consultant RMI.

“Similarly, across Montana, Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, huge amounts of transmission have been built,” Farrell said. “Colorado essentially has the equivalent of dirt roads. It’s just not very well connected to the rest of the West.”

Geography hasn’t helped with mountains between Colorado’s population centers and the rest of the region. “Colorado is kind of an island,” said Ken Wilson, a consultant with GridLab, which provides analysis on energy transition issues to regulators, grid operators and utilities. “The Colorado grid is thin.”

In 2021, the state legislature created the Colorado Electric Transmission Authority to identify key transmission projects in the state, bond to finance them and use eminent domain to obtain rights of way if necessary.

Two years later, the legislature directed CETA to do a comprehensive study of the state’s transmission needs. The study concluded that to meet its goals Colorado needs at least $4.5 billion in new and upgraded transmission.

“This is the first statewide study of transmission needs in Colorado,” Maury Galbraith, CETA’s executive director, said. “Colorado utilities routinely plan for their own customers’ needs and their own service territories. So, they’ve been planning for a smaller footprint.”

The electric resource plans developed by each Colorado utility lay out their projected demand for electricity and the new resources to meet it. The current plans project adding more than 10,000 megawatts of new generation and storage in the next 10 years.

The CETA study, however, warned “the state may not be planning sufficient transmission capacity to accommodate the growing load and resource adoption levels.”

To absorb all that, the report concluded, 2,900 miles of existing lines would have to be replaced with ones that can carry more current. This is called reconductoring. Another 269 miles would have to be rebuilt with lines added.

In addition, 548 miles of new transmission must be constructed. Although the seven new lines proposed are the smallest component of CETA’s plan, they are the most expensive, totaling nearly $2 billion.

The San Luis Valley, southeastern and northeastern Colorado are the areas most in need of new transmission, according to the study.

The 2021 legislation also requires utilities with transmission to join a regional, wholesale electric market by 2030. The only two regions in the country without such a market are the Southeast and the West.

“One of the big findings of the study is that we need to address bottlenecks within the state of Colorado in order to facilitate regional market participation,” Galbraith said. “There are a lot of intrastate bottlenecks.”

The study took a brief look at connecting Colorado with the rest of the West, suggesting four transmission lines, with a $753 million price tag, to connect with New Mexico, eastern Wyoming and Utah. Who would build such projects was unanswered.

“CETA as a new entity, without deep pockets, we’re not going to be able to develop all the projects identified in the plan,” Galbraith said. The authority will, he said, identify a small list of possible projects.

“There are utilities in the state that are clearly interested in taking on a significant chunk of the investment that we have identified,” Galbraith said. “We identified an awful lot of upgrades to existing transmission.”

The two utilities building transmission in Colorado are Xcel Energy, the state’s largest electricity provider with 3.7 million customers, and Tri-State, serving 40 rural electric cooperatives and public power districts spread across Nebraska, Wyoming, New Mexico and Colorado.

The biggest project is Xcel Energy’s $1.7 billion Power Pathway — 560 miles of high-voltage transmission lines — an electric highway bringing Eastern Plains wind and solar projects to Front Range cities and suburbs.

“It’s a bit of a field of dreams,” said Steve Martz, Xcel Energy’s vice president for integrated planning. “Colorado has some of the best wind resources in the country. … We knew we needed to kind of build that initial bridge of transmission to that area to start to harvest those resources.”

When the Power Pathway brings electricity to the Denver metro area, the project is projected to be completed by 2028, it will need another $900 million in transmission upgrades and additions in the Denver metro area to handle all that power.

But the $2.6 billion in transmission investments — which was approved by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission — don’t directly connect to any other grid.

“Part of the issue is that a regulated utility has to show the PUC that investments are prudent and address needs in its service area,” said Ron Lehr, a former Colorado PUC commissioner and CETA board member. “Another reason is that if you control the transmission, you control the market.”

The other transmission builder in Colorado is Tri-State, which operates 5,793 miles of high-voltage transmission lines across four states. Its most recent addition is a 230-kilovolt, 112-mile line from Burlington to Lamar capable of carrying 700 MW.

It took five years to build the line across four counties crossing more than 100 parcels of land and requiring more than 700 signatures for access, options to acquire right-of-way, compensation, encroachment and acquisition of right-of-way easements.

The Burlington-Lamar line is part of Tri-State’s $186.5 million Eastern Colorado Transmission Expansion, which includes another 103 miles of transmission lines and a switching station.

“It’s pretty sparse out in eastern Colorado,” Pink said. “The system was designed to serve irrigation with some long radial transmission lines.” The goal of the expansion is to integrate those individual lines into a bigger circuit. “You’re connecting existing parts of the system and making it more robust.”

The projects, however, don’t connect to any other grid.

Twenty years ago, the High Plains Express, a $5.1 billion, transmission project sweeping down from Wyoming through eastern Colorado into New Mexico and Arizona, had been proposed. Tri-State’s projects would have connected to it.

“I wouldn’t say High Plains Express died, but it isn’t active,” Pink said. “Xcel Energy and Tri-State took a look at it and said, ‘What if we only need to do certain things in Colorado? So, let’s just look at Colorado.’”

There remain drawbacks to this approach, said Vijay Satyal, director of markets and transmission for the environmental group Western Resource Advocates.

“They’re serving their customers, but you are putting a lot more burden on ratepayers only to build up your footprint and not look at opportunities in another utility’s footprint, where the greater interstate connectivity could bring more clean energy sources,” Satyal said.

Demand for electricity is outstripping the grid’s capacity

If Colorado was more firmly tied to the Western Interconnection, it would be joining a grid that is under increasing pressure.

The Western grid — 156,000 miles of transmission lines — is facing a 20% annual growth in electricity demand from now until 2034, reaching 1,134 terawatt-hours, according to WECC. A terawatt-hour is enough electricity to power 70,000 homes for a year.

“We did a Western assessment of resource adequacy in November that basically said, under current circumstances, the pace and magnitude of growth is greater than the resources available to meet that load,” WECC’s Raper said.

Part of meeting that demand will come from new generation and part from being able to move electricity from places with low demand but high output to load centers.

Two regional transmission lines are privately being built across the region. These so-called merchant transmission lines will bring wind power to the West Coast.

The 732-mile, $3 billion TransWest Express will carry power from a central Wyoming wind farm to southern Nevada where it can connect with the West Coast. The wind farm and the transmission line are being built by Phil Anschutz’s Denver-based Power Company of Wyoming.

Although the transmission line cuts across northwestern Colorado, since it is an “express” it makes no stops in the state.

Sun Zia is the second large project, a 550-mile-long transmission line from a central New Mexico wind farm to Pinal County, Arizona, where it can also connect with the West Coast.

The Tohono O’odham and San Carlos Apache tribes, however, have a lawsuit seeking to block Sun Zia, saying it crosses their ancestral homeland.

Both projects employ high-voltage direct current, or HVDC, lines. Thanks to technological improvements, these lines can carry more power, more cheaply than an AC line and since they send that power in one direction it can be better controlled.

“HVDC solves the whole loop-flow problem,” said Debra Lew, director of the Energy System Integration Group, ESIG, a nonprofit focused on grid transformation. “It helps you control where the power is going and avoid causing congestion for your neighbor.”

The TransWest Express and Sun Zia will each be able to carry 3,000 MW of electricity. The HVDC lines have been called “a superhighway with an express lane.” Both lines are taking more than a decade to build.

There is one other merchant power line in the very early stages of development, the Three Corners Connector, which would link Colorado with the Eastern Interconnection, running about 300 miles to Pueblo from Guymon, Oklahoma.

“We start with the land and talking to landowners,” said Ashley McGeary, a spokesperson for Houston, Texas-based Grid United. It isn’t until landowners are onboard that the company will seek regulatory approvals.

In March, the company held a meeting in Pueblo attended by about 100 people. “This community existed before we got here, it is going to be here after we leave, so the question is how can we help?” McGeary said.

While these merchant lines help bolster the grid, they do little to solve the problem of making Colorado’s grid more resilient and do little to integrate the rest of the region’s grids.

“There has not been a Western Interconnection study encompassing the entire West in about 10 years,” Raper said. “That is too long.”

The West does have some regional planning efforts. “We work a lot with our neighboring utilities, because ultimately, you know, this is one power grid, and so utilities are somewhat reliant on each other,” Xcel Energy’s Martz said.

Xcel Energy is part of the Colorado Coordinating Planning Group, a transmission planning forum, which Martz describes as “a localized, but still regional process.” Tri-State, Colorado Springs Utilities and the Platte River Power Authority are among the group’s nine members.

A broader effort to come up with a transmission plan for the entire West is being done by the Western Transmission Expansion Coalition, known as WestTec. Xcel Energy is a participant as are utilities and regulators from across the West.

The WestTec, however, is voluntary. The hope, Raper said, is that “everyone feels like they got the same opportunity to contribute and create an actionable plan that utilities, merchant developers can use.”

For the moment, ESIG’s Lew said the WestTec plan could help show that an investment in a seemingly distant part of the grid has benefits closer to home, since regional transmission lines always spark local opposition.

When in 2024 the federal government designated a route from Colorado to New Mexico as a “nation interest transmission corridor,” farmers and ranchers were up in arms.

“Colorado and New Mexico, we’re easier pickings,” rancher Ed Hughs told a Prowers County Commission meeting in February. “We’re a rural area and we don’t read the Federal Register.”

On June 5, the Elbert County Planning Commission voted unanimously to recommend the county commissioners deny a permit for Xcel Energy’s Power Pathway to cut through the county.

The opposition has been led by the Elbert County Environmental Alliance, which was formed in 2021 with the goal of “minimizing the environmental and economic degradation from Segment 5 of Xcel’s Colorado Power Pathway within Elbert County.”

“We need to educate people,” Lew said. “You want affordability, clean energy, reliability … it’s going to take this much transmission, this much build out. We’ve got to come together as a society to be able to do that.”

In most of the country, grid building is done by regional transmission organizations, RTOs, or independent system operators, ISOs, who run large regional grids, selling wholesale power among utilities, and approving and financing transmission projects.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, for example, in December approved a $22 billion transmission plan, including a 3,600-mile, high-voltage “backbone” transmission line across its service area covering all or parts of 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba.

The West is the largest region in the country without a regional grid operator and wholesale market, but that may be about to change.

On Monday, Premier Tim Houston said the province’s plan to license enough offshore wind farms to produce five megawatts of electricity would be increased eightfold to 40 megawatts, well beyond the 2.4 megawatts Nova Scotia needs.
“It could be a game-changer for the region and for Canada,” she said in an interview from Ottawa.
While Fitzgerald applauded Houston’s clean energy plan, she criticized what she described as the premier’s populist penchant for taking decisive action before consulting with experts and the public.
“There really needs to be a priority on stakeholder engagement for all ocean users,” said senior energy co-ordinator Thomas Arnason McNeil.","HALIFAX — Two leading environmental groups are giving a thumbs up to Nova Scotia’s ambitious plan to dramatically expand its fledgling offshore wind energy industry.

But both groups were quick to add caveats.

On Monday, Premier Tim Houston said the province’s plan to license enough offshore wind farms to produce five megawatts of electricity would be increased eightfold to 40 megawatts, well beyond the 2.4 megawatts Nova Scotia needs. He called on Ottawa to help cover the costs of his new Wind West project, saying the excess electricity could be used to supply 27 per cent of Canada’s total demand.

“Nova Scotia is on the edge of a clean energy breakthrough,” the Progressive Conservative premier said in an online video, adding the province is poised to become an “energy superpower.”

Gretchen Fitzgerald, executive director of Sierra Club Canada, said the premier’s bold plan, which includes building transmission lines across the country, represents an exciting opportunity for the province.

“It could be a game-changer for the region and for Canada,” she said in an interview from Ottawa. “But it needs to be done correctly and with consultations.”

Fitzgerald said the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments must focus on securing long-term benefits from the nascent offshore wind industry because they did a poor job on that front when dealing with the offshore oil and gas sector.

“We have to make sure that we are not selling out what is a massive resource for less benefit than communities should have,” Fitzgerald said, adding that Nova Scotia continues to suffer from a high rate of energy poverty. In May of this year, utility affordability expert Roger Colton produced a report showing that 43 per cent of Nova Scotians were struggling to pay their energy bills — the highest proportion in Canada.

While Fitzgerald applauded Houston’s clean energy plan, she criticized what she described as the premier’s populist penchant for taking decisive action before consulting with experts and the public.

“Moving from a couple hundred turbines to thousands in the next decade needs to be done in a staged way so we learn how to do this right,” she said, adding Houston appears to have adopted a “‘move-fast-and-break-things mentality.”

“(That) can lead to unacceptable harm to sensitive ocean life,” she said. “From a community benefits and acceptance point of view, breaking trust can be the biggest barrier to getting to good climate solutions.”

In October 2023, the Public Policy Forum released a study saying Sable Island Bank, an ocean area about 180 kilometres south of Nova Scotia, is among the world’s best locations for wind energy generation.

“It and several other similarly endowed areas off the coast of Atlantic Canada hold the potential to place the region among the leading global hubs of offshore wind-powered energy development,” says the report from the independent non-profit think tank.

It goes on to say that as the world shifts from a dependence on fossil fuels to forms of energy that do not emit climate-changing greenhouse gases, Atlantic Canada is facing “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity … to recover an economic vitality comparable to the Age of Sail — fittingly built again on the power of wind at sea.”

The report says the installation of 15 gigawatts of offshore wind generation would create about 30,000 direct jobs annually.

Despite the hype, the industry must also earn acceptance from Nova Scotia’s fishing industry, which in 2023 contributed $2.5 billion to the province’s economy and employed 19,000 people.

In Halifax, a spokesman for the Ecology Action Centre called on the provincial government to build public trust, especially with coastal communities.

“There really needs to be a priority on stakeholder engagement for all ocean users,” said senior energy co-ordinator Thomas Arnason McNeil.

“We’re going to need to prioritize ecological safeguards and preserve the existing livelihoods that we have. That includes the fishing industry. That’s half the economy in Nova Scotia.”

Still, he said the province’s big push for clean energy is on the right track, especially when it comes to building out its electricity grid to better connect with the rest of the country.

If done right, the payoff would be enormous, Arnason McNeil said.

“We’re talking serious job creation here and a lot of revenue potentially,” he said. “The bottom line is that you have to do this right. (But) the prize at the end of the road is monumental in terms of the benefits.”

A call for bids to build enough offshore turbines to generate five gigawatts of electricity is expected as early as this year.

Located in the Hainan Province, this reactor is being developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) at the Hainan Nuclear Power Co. Ltd. site. As the world’s first land-based small modular reactor (SMR) to begin construction, Linglong-1 is expected to play a significant role in reducing China’s carbon emissions. This project exemplifies China’s commitment to advancing nuclear technology and achieving its climate goals.

World’s First Commercial Mini Nuclear Reactor

Linglong-1, also referred to as ACP100, represents a new era in nuclear technology as a third-generation small pressurized water reactor. Developed entirely in China, it possesses independent intellectual property rights, underscoring China’s expertise in nuclear innovation. In 2016, it became the first SMR globally to pass a safety review by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), marking a critical milestone in its development. Due to its compact size and ability to deliver power safely and steadily, it has been dubbed a “nuclear power bank.”

This reactor is a key element of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025), which focuses on advanced nuclear technology. The project is progressing smoothly, with engineers undertaking system tests and preparing for cold functional testing, an essential precursor to full-scale operations. Unlike traditional nuclear power plants, small modular reactors like Linglong-1 are smaller, safer, and quicker to build. They incorporate passive safety systems, allowing for safe shutdowns without requiring human intervention or external power. Their versatility supports deployment in diverse locations, ranging from industrial parks to energy-intensive regions.

To Power 526,000 Homes

Each Linglong-1 reactor has the capability to generate 125,000 kilowatts of electricity, culminating in an annual output of 1 billion kilowatt-hours. This is sufficient to power approximately 526,000 homes or support around 1 million people. By substituting coal-based power with nuclear energy from Linglong-1, China can achieve a substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, estimated at about 880,000 tons annually. This reduction is equivalent to the environmental impact of planting 7.5 million trees.

The introduction of Linglong-1 signifies a pivotal advancement in China’s nuclear development, highlighting the nation’s leadership in small reactor technology. Following the success of Hualong One, a full-size third-generation nuclear reactor, Linglong-1 represents the next step in China’s strategy to independently innovate in nuclear energy. It is anticipated to support the Hainan Free Trade Port and contribute to the region’s clean energy objectives. Furthermore, it aligns with China’s national climate targets of achieving peak carbon emissions before 2030 and reaching carbon neutrality before 2060.

Nuclear energy stands as one of the most powerful and controversial energy sources in modern history. From its origins in early 20th-century scientific discoveries to its current role as a critical component of America’s energy portfolio, nuclear power has shaped both technological progress and public policy debates. As the United States grapples with climate change and energy security, understanding nuclear energy’s complex history, current capabilities, and future potential becomes increasingly important.

Dawn of the nuclear age (1895–1945)

The story of nuclear energy begins with fundamental breakthroughs in atomic physics. Wilhelm Roentgen’s discovery of X-rays in 1895 and the identification of the electron in 1897 laid the groundwork for understanding atomic structure[1][2]. These early discoveries set the stage for one of the most significant scientific achievements of the 20th century. The concept of nuclear fission — the splitting of atomic nuclei to release enormous amounts of energy — was experimentally confirmed in 1938 by Otto Hahn, Fritz Strassmann, Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch[2][3]. This breakthrough revealed the tremendous power locked within the atom, fundamentally changing humanity’s understanding of energy production.

The transition from theoretical understanding to practical application came in 1942, when Enrico Fermi and his team achieved the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in Chicago[4][5]. This milestone marked the birth of practical nuclear technology and demonstrated that atomic energy could be harnessed for human use.

The urgent demands of World War II accelerated nuclear research, focusing primarily on developing atomic weapons. This massive scientific effort culminated in the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945[6][4]. While these events demonstrated the devastating potential of nuclear fission, they also shifted postwar attention toward the peaceful applications of nuclear energy[6].

Post-World War II development

Following World War II, governments and scientists worldwide began exploring nuclear energy’s civilian applications, particularly for electricity generation and naval propulsion[6][5]. The first milestone in civilian nuclear power came in 1951 when the Experimental Breeder Reactor I in Idaho produced the first electricity from a nuclear reactor[6][5].

President Dwight Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” program in 1953 marked a pivotal moment in nuclear energy development, actively promoting civilian nuclear power and international cooperation in peaceful nuclear technology[6]. This initiative helped establish the foundation for the global nuclear power industry.

Commercial nuclear expansion

The first large-scale nuclear power plant dedicated to electricity generation began operation at Shippingport, Pa. in 1957[7][5]. This successful demonstration plant proved that nuclear energy could reliably generate electricity on a commercial scale, ushering in an era of rapid expansion.

The 1960s and 1970s witnessed explosive growth in nuclear power worldwide. Countries invested heavily in nuclear infrastructure, with rapid increases in installed capacity[7]. France exemplifies this commitment — following the 1973 oil crisis, the nation invested so heavily in nuclear energy that it eventually generated over 70% of its electricity from nuclear power[8].

Challenges and opposition emerge

Beginning in the late 1960s, growing concerns about nuclear safety, waste disposal and weapons proliferation led to increasing public opposition and regulatory challenges[8]. High-profile accidents fundamentally changed public perception and policy. The Three Mile Island accident near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979 and the catastrophic Chernobyl disaster near Pripyat, Ukraine, in 1986 intensified scrutiny and significantly slowed new nuclear construction, particularly in the United States and Europe[9].

Despite these setbacks, nuclear power has remained a significant electricity source in many countries, with France and the United States leading in nuclear generation[5].

Nuclear versus other energy sources

When comparing nuclear energy to other sources, distinct patterns emerge across multiple criteria:

Carbon emissions: Nuclear energy has the lowest lifecycle carbon emissions (30 tCO₂e/GWh), even lower than renewables like solar (45 tCO₂e/GWh) and wind (26 tCO₂e/GWh), and dramatically lower than fossil fuels like coal (888–1069 tCO₂e/GWh) and natural gas (450–500 tCO₂e/GWh)[30].

Reliability: Nuclear power excels in reliability, with capacity factors exceeding 92%, providing consistent baseload power. In contrast, renewables are intermittent and weather-dependent, requiring storage or backup systems for reliable supply[26].

Land use: Nuclear energy is the most land-efficient energy source, requiring minimal space per unit of energy produced compared to solar and wind installations[32].

Cost: While renewables have seen dramatic cost reductions and now represent the cheapest sources for new capacity in many regions, nuclear power faces high upfront capital costs[29][24]. However, nuclear plants typically have competitive operating costs over their long lifespans.

Safety: Nuclear energy maintains a very low accident rate, though the consequences of rare accidents can be severe. Renewables are generally considered safer, while fossil fuels pose the highest health and environmental risks through air pollution and operational hazards[27].

US infrastructure and expansion plans

The United States currently operates the world’s largest commercial nuclear fleet, with 94 reactors across 54 power plants generating nearly 97 GW of capacity[10]. Recent additions, including two new reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia completed in 2023 and 2024, demonstrate that the U.S. maintains the capability to build large-scale nuclear infrastructure, though such projects have been rare in recent decades[10][11].

The federal government has established ambitious targets to triple or quadruple nuclear capacity by 2050, aiming to add 35 GW by 2035 and sustain a pace of 15 GW per year by 2040[12][11]. New federal legislation, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, provides significant investment and tax incentives for both existing plants and advanced reactor technologies[13][11].

Radiation safety and health considerations

Radiation dangers associated with nuclear energy operation are generally low, thanks to strict safety protocols, engineering controls and regulatory limits[43][44]. Routine emissions from nuclear plants remain well below dangerous levels and are not lethal[44].

Severe nuclear accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have resulted in significant radioactive releases, but such events are extremely rare — two major incidents in over 18,500 reactor-years of commercial operation worldwide[43][45]. Recent studies indicate that workers at nuclear plants, even when exposed to radiation within regulatory limits, may have slightly higher risks of certain diseases, though their overall cancer risk may be lower than the general population due to health monitoring and protective measures[46].

For residents living near nuclear plants, studies suggest slightly increased risks of certain cancers, particularly in children under 5, even when exposures remain within current regulatory limits[46][47]. However, these increased risks are small, and for the vast majority of people, radiation risk from nuclear power plants remains extremely low compared to other everyday risks[43][45].

Nuclear energy occupies a unique position in America’s energy landscape — offering unmatched reliability, minimal carbon emissions and the potential for massive clean electricity generation, while simultaneously presenting challenges related to safety, waste management and public acceptance. As the nation confronts climate change and seeks energy security, nuclear power’s role becomes increasingly significant.

The path forward requires balancing nuclear energy’s substantial benefits against its genuine risks and challenges. Success will depend on continued technological innovation, streamlined regulatory processes, substantial investment, workforce development and most importantly, sustained public and political support. Whether nuclear energy becomes America’s dominant power source by 2050 will ultimately determine not just the nation’s energy future, but its ability to meet climate goals while maintaining economic prosperity and energy security.

Experts: Why storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain is problematic

Nevada’s Yucca Mountain represents one of the most contentious aspects of U.S. nuclear policy. Located about 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Yucca Mountain was selected as the proposed site for America’s deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste[51].

As President Donald Trump has raised the prospect of resuming storing nuclear waste at Yucca, here are the long-held concerns and potential impacts if such a project were to be undertaken by the federal government:

Potential complications of natural disasters

Earthquake risks: An earthquake of magnitude 6 or greater could cause groundwater to surge up 750 feet above present levels at the repository site, according to University of Colorado geophysicists. There are more than thirty known earthquake faults in and around Yucca Mountain, some of which have been active since work began on the repository. In 1992 an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.7 caused considerable damage to the aboveground Yucca Mountain project field operations center.

Fault line discovery: In September 2007, it was discovered that the Bow Ridge fault line ran underneath the facility, hundreds of feet east of where it was originally thought to be located, requiring structures to be moved and drawing criticism from Nevada officials.

Volcanic activity: By some estimates, the probability of future volcanic activity disrupting the Yucca Mountain repository during the next ten thousand years is about one in seven thousand. There is a continuing dispute among Yucca Mountain Project scientists, NRC scientists, and State scientists about the probability of future volcanic disruption, with State and NRC scientists estimating probabilities two to three orders of magnitude greater than Project scientists.

Groundwater and hydrology concerns

Water infiltration: During the mid-1990s new findings indicated that there were more fractures and more water in Yucca Mountain rock than previously believed. The storage site is located 1,000 ft. above an aquifer that supplies drinking water and irrigation.

Seismic pumping: Davies and Archambeau believe that an earthquake of sufficient magnitude could cause open fractures underneath the Yucca Mountain site to squeeze shut, forcing water upward into the storage facility, potentially causing rapid corrosive breakdown of containers.

Technical and engineering challenges

Container safety: In June 2008, Holtec International criticized the DOE’s safety plan, expressing concern that in an earthquake, unanchored casks of nuclear waste material awaiting burial could be sent into motion.

Geophysical limitations: Seismic reflection studies have been unable to discern reflections from noise even using elaborate techniques, indicating that “in this volcanic terrain reflection surveys cannot work”, limiting understanding of subsurface structure.

Political and social opposition

“Screw Nevada Bill”: In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to focus only on Yucca Mountain, commonly referred to as the “screw Nevada bill,” because the Nevada delegation had the least political clout. Two-thirds of Nevadans believe it is unfair for Nevada to store nuclear waste when it has no nuclear power plants.

Indigenous rights: Yucca Mountain is an integral part of the traditional homelands of the Western Shoshone and Paiute Indians, who call the land “Newe Segobia” and regard it as sacred. The identification of Yucca Mountain represents another injustice in the long history of attacks on Native lands and people.

Transportation risks

Opponents have pointed out that an accident during nuclear waste transport could result in the release of radiation in a populated area, as materials would need to be shipped from across the country.

Regulatory and timeline issues

Project Delays: The DOE was to begin accepting spent fuel by January 31, 1998, but did not do so because of legal challenges, transportation concerns, and political pressure resulting in underfunding. By 2010, federal funding was eliminated and the license application was withdrawn.

Standards Disputes: In 2004 the US Court of Appeals ruled that EPA’s 10,000-year protection standards were inadequate in light of National Academy of Sciences recommendations.

These concerns have contributed to the project’s troubled history, with over $15 billion spent on studies and development but no waste currently stored at the facility.

In 1947, decades before the federal Clean Air Act, California’s leaders began regulating the causes of harmful air pollution. It was also our state that, in 2006 under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, passed arguably the most aggressive greenhouse gas reduction law in the world, setting off a global race for climate action.

California’s leadership on the environment has a well-deserved reputation.

So it is with a great deal of pride, and no small amount of sadness, that a growing flaw in the California Environmental Quality Act, one of the principle legal mechanisms we use to protect clean air and water, conserve sensitive lands and habitats and address the pollution that causes climate change, is now cause for concern.

CEQA, as it’s colloquially known, embodies the proposition that you should “look before you leap” on issues that could have negative environmental or public health impacts. The law’s core legal principle holds that decisionmakers should know the environmental consequences of their actions before taking them.

This purpose remains a worthy one. Unfortunately, over time CEQA has led to unfortunate and inadvertent consequences — in particular, it is commonly used to block much-needed housing in California. But the law is not only harmful in its use: The mere threat of a CEQA lawsuit is enough to stifle new housing developments since such suits can add substantial time, cost and risk for builders who already face daunting construction costs.

Finding Balance in Reform

The dilemma is how to retain the beneficial essence of CEQA while dealing with the downsides. A bill in the California legislature deals with this and deserves support.

Assembly Bill 609 creates an exemption from CEQA for infill housing projects that are compliant with local laws and not in environmentally sensitive locations. “Building up” in urban locations reduces development pressure on open land in outlying areas. It also reduces commute times and reduces pollution.

As a father and son with lifetimes of experience in environmental causes, we write with some ambivalence. Decades ago, one of us was responsible for the emergence of CEQA as a “super statute,” drafting the amicus brief to the California Supreme Court in Friends of Mammoth v. Mono County — the bedrock case in which the court ruled CEQA extended a public “right of action” against private activity.

Some may view any changes to CEQA as a “camel’s nose under the tent,” inevitably leading to its demise. Our view is the opposite: Like all laws, CEQA derives its social license from its good-faith application. But when a bedrock environmental law is used to cause measurable environmental harm — for example, by displacing housing developments to agricultural and open lands — that undermines political support for the law.

Thoughtful reforms such as AB 609 can maintain CEQA’s core focus on environmental protection, while enabling housing to be built more quickly, cheaply and sustainably.

Climate Benefits of Infill Housing

For those that view climate change as one of the key issues of our time, infill housing is a critical solution. For those that want to see California’s environmental values shape the nation, without cheaper housing, California will lose population and electoral power to other states.

After the 2030 census, projections show that California could lose four congressional districts (and four electoral college votes), while states with cheaper housing, like Texas and Florida, stand to gain.

If reducing the cost of housing alone is not enough, then for those that care about the environment and climate change, there is plenty to love in the growing push to legalize more infill homes in our cities.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Tempers are flaring on all sides over the Trump administration's sweeping tax and spending bill.

Dubbed ""The One, Big, Beautiful Bill,"" the legislation is part of the administration's core agenda, containing measures such as ramping up border security and lowering corporate and individual taxes.

""The bill ... has ugly provisions for America's most vulnerable people,"" The Hill said in a recent report, noting that ""it shamelessly cuts assistance for the poorest Americans to continue tax cuts for the rich.""

Citing Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who called the bill ""ugly and disgusting"" and part of ""the largest redistribution of wealth in the nation's history,"" the report questioned why House Republicans passed the bill ""that retains tax cuts for the rich by taking 800 billion U.S. dollars from Medicaid"" while leaving 3 million policyholders without coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Echoing this view, Marc Morial, president and CEO of the civil rights organization National Urban League, said the bill is ""a massive wealth transfer from those at the bottom of the economy to those at the top.""

""In addition to betraying millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid, the Act also puts nutritional assistance out of reach for many by slashing billions from SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and creating additional hurdles to accessing both programs,"" he said.

The bill has also become a major source of division in Washington -- even within the Republican party itself -- in an era of bitter partisan rivalry.

Indeed, the world's two most prominent billionaires -- U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla founder Elon Musk -- are in a war of words over the legislation. Musk has blasted the bill as negating the spending cuts he put in place as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude,"" Musk wrote on his social platform X on Friday.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said he was ""very disappointed"" over Musk's opposition to the bill. ""I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it,"" Trump said.

""He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem,"" he added, noting that Musk only developed the problem ""when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate.""

Trump was referring to the legislation's elimination of electric vehicle tax credits, up to 4,000 dollars for a used EV and 7,500 dollars for a new one, which could hurt Musk's interests as CEO of Tesla.

Soon after Trump's Oval Office comments, Musk polled his followers on X: ""Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80 percent in the middle?"" The final results showed that the poll had drawn 5.6 million votes, with over 80 percent voting ""Yes.""

Meanwhile, Democrats have lambasted the bill as cutting crucial services to vulnerable segments of the population.

""This is one big, ugly bill,"" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, while reading out letters from U.S. citizens describing the harm these cuts would cause.

Freshman Democratic Representative John Mannion said the bill would eliminate food assistance for children and the elderly, deprive the disabled and the most vulnerable of healthcare, and saddle the nation with trillions of dollars in new debt.

""This bill is cruel and immoral, and its supporters rejected any attempts at bipartisan compromise,"" Mannion said.

As the Congressional Budget Office warned that the bill will create a 2.4 trillion dollar gap in the U.S. national debt over the next decade, analysts have expressed skepticism over the administration's claim that the bill will reduce the record-high national debt.

The Tax Foundation, an international nonprofit think tank, said in a recent article, ""Rather than making the most pro-growth features permanent, the bill spends far too much money on political gimmicks and carveouts, resulting in a package that provides a modest boost to the economy but at a huge fiscal cost.""

The international credit rating agency Moody's also blasted the bill, downgrading the U.S. credit rating for the third time since 2011.

""If the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is extended, which is our base case, it will add around 4 trillion dollars to the federal fiscal primary (excluding interest payments) deficit over the next decade,"" the agency said.

The bill has been submitted to the Senate for consideration, but several GOP senators, including Sen. Rand Paul, have indicated their opposition.

The Trump administration, however, said the bill is the biggest cost-cutting measure in three decades. ""There's 1.6 trillion dollars worth of savings in this bill,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a recent press briefing. ""That's the largest savings for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.""

Experts said that given the bill passed the House by just one vote, its future remains highly uncertain.

Republican leaders have set the July 4 deadline to ensure the bill is passed by both chambers and sent to the president for signature.

It is expected that the bill will continue to spark controversy among both parties and the public. ■",,N,,2025-06-08 09:04:32.293218

“We worked with a New York City neighborhood philanthropy to identify a flood-exposed, low-income community in Rockaways,” said Bouchard.

For Sara Oliver, executive in residence in Pratt’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, preparation starts by helping the public understand risk. “The language we use is not helping people understand,” said Oliver. “What would you think the 100-year storm means? It doesn’t mean that a storm happens every 100 years. It represents the statistics: Every year there’s a 1 percent chance.”

Oliver, a civil engineer, believes engineers need to be trained to think about the ambiguity that comes with natural disasters.

“Engineers have been trained to think of the ‘right answer.’ But there is no one answer. They need to be totally uncomfortable.” Oliver said. “We don’t train engineers on that human element. They need to be able to do the storytelling and speak in plain language.”

Oliver directs Duke’s new master of engineering in climate and sustainability engineering – a program she hopes will address this need.

The first cohort of the master’s program will be entering their second year in August. While some students are straight from undergraduate study, other participants come from various careers, including solar power development and risk modeling.

Risk modeling could be of use with issues involving insurance – a pain point that comes up for homeowners after disasters.

“We need new insurance solutions,” said Oliver. “We’re in America, where individual freedom is important. That’s great in some instances. But hurricanes don’t happen to individuals. They happen to communities. I protect my property – but what if my neighbor doesn’t? That’s why we end up with marginalized communities feeling the brunt when a disaster hits.”

During the Los Angeles fires, some homeowners were diligent about cutting back brush around their properties, but others weren’t – contributing to the fires’ spread.

Can We Do Something About Insurance?

Duke engineer Mark Borsuk uses his expertise in mathematical risk modeling to explore a new type of insurance coverage. Called community-based catastrophe insurance (CBCI), it focuses on the community rather than the individual.

Here’s how CBCI would work: A portion of a household’s insurance would be covered at a community level rather than an individual level – whether by a nonprofit or a financial organization. Rates would be tied in part to the things that the community did to reduce its risks from wildfires, flooding or hurricanes, In California, for example, rates could reflect whether individuals created a buffer zone of protection around their homes, or whether communities practiced fuel abatement (such as removing vegetation) and forest management standards.

A community approach would also take some of the confusion that comes with insurance. With floods, homeowners often don’t know if they need it; and if they need it, it can be hard to get. In fact, it is not unusual for as much as 60 percent of the damage after a flooding event to be from households that were uninsured, said Francis Bouchard, a longtime insurance industry executive and non-resident senior fellow at the Nicholas Institute for Environment, Energy & Sustainability.

Bouchard, Borsuk and other colleagues worked as part of a Bass Connections team to investigate CBCI’s potential. Leading the team were Bouchard and Lydia Olander, program director at the Nicholas institute.

The company Bouchard works for — Marsh McLennan — designed a pilot project for CBCI in New York City. “We worked with a New York City neighborhood philanthropy to identify a flood-exposed, low-income community in Rockaways,” said Bouchard. The pilot focused on a product to pay out to the community if a trigger is met.

“In this case, we have water gauges tracking the rise in water. If it gets to a certain point, it pays, whether there is damage or not,” said Bouchard. “It takes out a lot of the subjectivity and allows you to pay the claim very fast.

“A lot of people don’t (evacuate) because they can’t afford a hotel. Hopefully (with this type of insurance) we would be able to identify early-stage triggers.”

The trigger has not been met yet in this NY case, although the local partner has used the program as the basis for educational classes on disaster preparedness.

Bouchard and Duke colleagues are still looking for communities ready to commit to CBCI. “That’s been the challenge,” said Bouchard. “But the status quo isn’t working.”

Nature Can Step In

At a springtime event co-sponsored by the Duke Center on Risk in Science and Society and Duke RESILE, Bouchard said that the insurance industry also struggles with demonstrating the benefits of what’s known as nature-based solutions. These are efforts to use natural features, such as building wetlands or reforestation to reduce flooding or prescribed burns for wildfires.

Lydia Olander and a team with the Nicholas Institute run Duke’s Nature Activation Hub, which works with a range of organizations to advance nature-based solutions. The group created a roadmap for the Department of the Interior to educate people on these strategies.

The roadmap allows users to search by risk, and provides case studies of communities implementing strategies: such as green space and landscaping techniques to increase water absorption in downtown Houston; removing invasive grasses to reduce wildfire risk in Tucson, Ariz.

Olander said that more communication with local officials, as well as design standards for engineers, can bring nature-based solutions into the mainstream conversation. “We need more awareness,” said Olander.

Olande recently co-authored a publication detailing how federal policy and programs can play an important role in helping communities on disaster mitigation and preparedness – with a breakdown of legislation in Congress.

Relationship Building Is Key

Disaster experts often refer to disaster management as a cycle (graphic above): initial emergency response, longer-term recovery, and mitigation and preparation measures. In the initial emergency response period, responders and health care personnel jump into action based on the preparation they received, as they did with Hurricane Helene.

The training helps responders rely on their muscle memory when they’re in a stressful situation, said David Marsee, health care preparedness coordinator at Duke – taking some of the immediate decision making out of the equation. That can make a difference in responders’ ability to do their work and work with others.

Marsee coordinates volunteers and schedules trainings for Duke’s State Medical Assistance Team (SMAT), which deployed to western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene, as described in this story.

Sara Houston, a Durham County paramedic, was one of the health care professionals who attended a Duke SMAT training back last December. “As a paramedic, it’s good to network with different health care clinicians and see different perspectives and how we can work together for a common goal,” said Houston, who has been deployed for emergency work during hurricanes Helene and Florence. “If we don’t learn from the previous situation, we’re doomed to fail again. You need to make mistakes to learn.”

“In our view, the low altitude economy (LAE) may eventually vastly exceed the size of today's automotive market,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a research note earlier this week.

That term refers to aerial commercial activities conducted within one mile of the earth’s surface, airspace now sparsely occupied by helicopters and small drones. Analysts expect advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics to support the launch of new aircraft—notably, electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles—with applications in areas like logistics/distribution, public security and emergency services, tourism, urban commuting, and intercity transportation.

Morgan Stanley forecasts the total addressable “Urban Air Mobility” (UAM) market will be valued at $1 trillion by 2040 and $9 trillion by 2050. Not everybody’s expectations are quite that high: Bank of America recently estimated a market worth $23 billion by 2035. BofA expects adoption to remain relatively slow until at least that year, when it anticipates economies of scale and battery technologies to improve eVTOL cost and accessibility.

Whatever the size of the pie, the companies vying for a slice of it include upstarts like Archer Aviation (ACHR), which is currently testing an eVTOL model and partnering with defense contractor Anduril to develop military applications, and Joby Aviation (JOBY), which is in the process of getting its air taxi certified for passenger rides.

Tesla Could Dominate U.S. Home Low-Altitude Economy

Morgan Stanley’s Jonas thinks those companies could face formidable competition from Tesla (TSLA). The EV maker hasn’t announced any intention to develop eVTOLs, but CEO Elon Musk has discussed the need for a homegrown low-altitude economy in the U.S.

When Jonas, on Tesla’s most recent earnings call, asked Musk for his thoughts on the U.S. and China’s AI and robotics rivalry, Musk expressed concern about America’s limited drone manufacturing capabilities. “Any country that cannot manufacture its own drones is doomed to be the vassal state of any country that can,” he said, quoting X user ""@naval."" “And we can’t. America cannot currently manufacture its own drones.”

Tesla, Jonas says, “has a host of relevant skills to be a factor” in the commercial and military LAE, including its work in manufacturing, autonomy, electric motors and batteries, and robotics. Jonas estimates Tesla’s share of a future $9 trillion UAM market could add between $100 and $1,000 to its share price.

Tesla's work on autonomous vehicles could give it a leg up on LAE competitors.

The head of a multi-billion pounds project to build a new nuclear power station says she is ""very optimistic"" a final go-ahead will be given to the scheme this week.

Julia Pyke, the joint managing director of Sizewell C in Suffolk, told BBC Politics East she is hoping for an announcement when the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves unveils her Spending Review on Wednesday.

She said construction of the new power station was expected to create 10,000 jobs and fund a new post-16 college in the nearby town of Leiston, along with other infrastructure projects in the area.

But there was fierce opposition on Saturday at a demonstration calling on the government to reject the scheme.

Ms Pyke, who has been working on the project for 10 years, told Politics East that she would ""really like to see the go-ahead for Sizewell C"".

""Obviously we are very optimistic, because it's a great thing for this country and a great thing for this region.""

She added that the nuclear plant was needed by the nation because ""we want energy security. We want to wean ourselves off gas"".

The project is expected to be jointly owned by the British government and the French state-owned energy giant EDF, and would be funded by taxpayers and private investors.

She said the taxpayer contribution would be funded by adding around £1 a month to energy bills, but she argued that once operational, the new power station would save consumers between £1bn and £1.5bn a year.

""It will have been cheaper to have built it than not to have built it,"" she said.

Impact ""is already devastating""

But there is opposition to the scheme.

On Saturday, about 300 protesters braved the bad weather to demonstrate on the beach near Sizewell B.

Organisers said the rally was ""to grieve for our beloved Suffolk and urge ministers to think again about splashing the cash on this slow, expensive folly"".

Alison Downes, director of Stop Sizewell C, said pre-construction work had already changed the area dramatically.

""Anybody visiting Suffolk for the first time in a year or so is going to be enormously shocked,"" she said.

""Local people say to me all the time just how devastated they feel at seeing old oak trees, seeing long swathes of hedgerows and vegetation, being chopped down.

""The local economy has been seriously impacted. Tourists are staying away.""

She also questioned how many of the jobs being created at the site would go to locals.

Julia Pyke told Politics East she would never deny that it was inconvenient to have a big construction project on your doorstep - but said Sizewell C would do everything it could to minimise disruption.

She said the project hoped to mitigate against increased traffic by having 60% of materials brought to the site by rail or sea.

Asked about claims that early construction work was already putting off tourists from visiting the area, she said: ""The power station site is in Leiston, it's not in Aldeburgh and it's not in Southwold.

""It's quite a contained area. Our experience of having built Hinkley Point C (nuclear power station in Somerset) is that actually tourism increases.""

She said Sizewell C was contributing to a tourism fund and there was a legal commitment to a third of the workforce coming from the local area.

Sizewell was highlighted by the government as being suitable for a future nuclear power station in 2010.

There have been two power stations at Sizewell already - Sizewell A, which opened in the 1960s and shut in 2006, and Sizewell B, which opened in the 1990s and is still in operation.

The Labour government and previous Conservative administrations have committed £6.4bn to Sizewell to help with start up costs.

Labour, like the Conservatives, believes more nuclear power will help Britain become energy self-sufficient.

There are still questions over where the private finance for Sizewell C will come from, but ministers and EDF insist there are plenty of potential investors and they are close to finalising an agreement.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/90f2/live/cd92d6f0-4307-11f0-a566-7935eb8fffe5.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 07:03:18.034697

The convergence of aggressive trade policies and legislative rollbacks under President Donald Trump’s administration has created an unprecedented challenge for the U.S. clean energy industry.

The combination of sweeping tariffs on imported clean technology components and the proposed repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives represents a fundamental shift away from the previous administration’s climate-focused economic strategy.

FAF, Washington.Media analyses of Trump's dual approach threaten to undermine years of progress in renewable energy deployment, manufacturing capacity building, and technological innovation while potentially raising energy costs for American consumers and businesses.

Congressional Assault on Clean Energy Incentives

House Republicans Target the Inflation Reduction Act

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has launched a comprehensive effort to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy provisions through the budget reconciliation process.

On May 22, 2025, the House passed H.R. 1, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which dramatically curtails clean energy tax credits and subsidies.

The legislation passed by the narrowest of margins with a vote of 215 to 214, demonstrating the contentious nature of these policy changes even within Republican ranks.

The House bill represents a significant escalation from earlier committee proposals. While the Ways and Means Committee had initially proposed a three-year phase-down schedule for clean energy credits, the final House version eliminated this transition period.

Instead, the legislation would terminate the technology-neutral clean electricity production tax credit (Section 45Y) and clean electricity investment tax credit (Section 48E) for any facilities that do not begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

This accelerated timeline creates an extraordinarily tight window for project developers to secure their investments and commence construction activities.

The scope of the proposed cuts extends far beyond production and investment credits.

The House bill would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits, end transferability mechanisms allowing clean energy developers to monetize tax credits, and roll back manufacturing production credits supporting domestic clean technology production.

The legislation would devastate residential solar installations, eliminating credits for leased residential and community solar projects that began after the bill’s passage.

Senate Republican Complementary Measures

While the House focused on comprehensive IRA rollbacks, Senate Republicans have pursued complementary strategies to eliminate climate spending.

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has proposed budget reconciliation language that would repeal all sections of the 2022 IRA and withdraw any unspent funds allocated for climate and clean energy programs.

Senator Shelley Moore Capito, the Republican chair of the EPW committee, characterized this as fulfilling Senate Republicans’ commitment to “stopping the Democrats’ natural gas tax and clawing back unobligated funds from the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.”

The Senate proposal also includes provisions to suspend the methane emissions fee on oil and gas operators for a decade, effectively removing one of the Biden administration’s key tools for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil fuel sector.

These measures demonstrate a coordinated Republican effort to eliminate clean energy incentives and reduce regulatory pressure on traditional energy industries.

Trump’s Tariff Strategy and Clean Energy Impacts

Comprehensive Import Duties on Clean Technology

President Trump’s tariff strategy represents one of the most aggressive trade policy initiatives in modern American history, with particularly severe implications for the clean energy sector.

On April 2, 2025, Trump declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and announced sweeping tariffs affecting virtually every country globally.

The baseline 10% tariff on all imports and higher reciprocal tariffs for major trading partners have created unprecedented cost pressures for clean energy manufacturers and developers.

The impact on clean energy has been particularly severe due to the industry’s reliance on international supply chains.

China, which faces a 34% reciprocal tariff in addition to the baseline 10%, dominates the production of critical clean energy components. The cumulative effect of these tariffs is dramatic for battery energy storage systems.

Chinese lithium iron phosphate cells now face a total tariff burden of 64.9%, increasing to 82.4% in 2026 when previously planned Section 301 tariffs take effect. This represents an effective doubling of battery costs for American energy storage projects.

Solar panel manufacturers have experienced even more extreme tariff impacts. The Commerce Department’s finalization of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Southeast Asian solar panel producers has resulted in tariffs ranging from 50% to over 120% for many imported modules.

In the most extreme cases, some solar equipment exporters in Cambodia face duties of up to 3,521% due to what the Commerce Department characterized as a lack of cooperation with its investigation.

These astronomical tariff rates eliminate entire supply chains and force American companies to seek alternative, often more expensive, sourcing options.

Wind Energy and Broader Renewable Impacts

The wind energy sector, already facing challenges during the Trump administration, confronts additional pressures from the new tariff regime. Wind turbines require numerous internationally sourced components even when final assembly occurs in the United States.

Analysis by Wood Mackenzie suggests that a 25% tariff on imports could increase the cost of constructing onshore wind turbines by 10% and renewable energy by 7% overall.

Many of Trump’s tariffs exceed the 25% threshold, so cost increases will likely be substantially higher.

The timing of these tariff implementations coincides with a period of expected rapid growth in renewable energy deployment.

The Energy Information Administration had projected that 18.2 GW of utility-scale battery storage would be added to the U.S. energy grid in 2025.

However, with battery tariffs reaching 65% to over 80%, many projects face significant economic challenges that could delay or cancel their development.

Economic and Industrial Consequences

Manufacturing Sector Disruption

The clean energy manufacturing sector, which had experienced significant growth following the IRA’s enactment, faces an uncertain future under the combined pressure of tariff increases and tax credit eliminations.

Hundreds of new clean energy projects representing hundreds of thousands of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars in investments had been announced since the IRA became law.

The MIT and Rhodium Clean Investment Monitor documented that most investments focused on batteries, electric vehicles, and solar panels.

Eliminating clean energy tax credits threatens to undermine much of this manufacturing capacity.

Princeton University researchers estimate that if electric vehicle tax credits were repealed, existing manufacturing capacity might be sufficient to meet reduced American demand for EVs by 2030.

This scenario would eliminate the need for additional domestic EV or battery manufacturing capacity and could force companies to reduce output and lay off workers from recently constructed facilities.

For solar panel manufacturing, the dual impact of high tariffs on imported components and the loss of installation incentives creates a particularly challenging environment.

Companies that had planned to expand domestic production capacity based on projected demand growth now face the prospect of reduced market demand due to higher system costs.

This dynamic threatens to undermine the administration’s goal of promoting domestic manufacturing by making American-produced clean energy systems less competitive in domestic and international markets.

Consumer Cost Implications

Multiple economic analyses have projected that combining IRA repeals and tariff increases will raise energy costs for American consumers.

Reports from Princeton REPEAT, Energy Innovation, and Rhodium Group estimate that repealing the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits will increase annual household electricity bills by $46 and $160 over the next decade.

These cost increases reflect the economic reality that clean energy sources have become among the cheapest and fastest methods of adding power supply to the grid.

The tariff impacts compound these cost pressures by increasing the price of clean energy equipment and making renewable energy projects less economically viable.

For electric vehicles, manufacturers and dealers warn that tariffs could inflate vehicle prices by as much as $10,000, exacerbating one of the primary barriers to EV adoption.

This price increase occurs when the industry has been working to achieve cost parity with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

Regional and Political Dynamics

Republican Party Divisions

The push to eliminate clean energy incentives has revealed significant divisions within the Republican Party, particularly among members whose districts have benefited from IRA-funded investments.

In March 2025, Representatives Jeff Hurd and Gabe Evans signed a letter requesting protection for some energy tax credits from the IRA. Hurd emphasized the importance of policy stability for utility infrastructure investments, noting that companies make decisions on 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year time horizons.

However, this moderate position faced opposition from conservative Republicans led by Representative Lauren Boebert, who sent leadership a letter demanding the complete repeal of all IRA tax credits.

Boebert argued that “Republicans ran—and won—on a promise to completely dismantle the IRA and end the left’s green welfare agenda” and characterized continued subsidies as undermining “America’s return to energy dominance and national security.”

This ideological divide reflects broader tensions within the Republican Party about the appropriate role of government in energy markets.

Several Republican senators have expressed interest in maintaining certain tax credits that benefit investments in their states, creating potential complications for the comprehensive repeal strategy pursued by House Republicans.

These regional considerations highlight the challenge of implementing nationwide policy changes with differential impacts across congressional districts and states.

State-Level Countermeasures

Some states have committed to clean energy deployment through renewable portfolio standards and other regulatory mechanisms despite federal policy changes.

California’s mandate requiring utility providers to source 50% of power sales from clean energy sources by 2030 provides a continuing market driver for renewable energy development.

Such state-level policies may offer some protection for the clean energy sector, though they cannot fully offset the impact of federal tax credit eliminations and tariff increases.

International Competitiveness and Strategic Implications

China’s Market Position

The Trump administration’s approach to clean energy policy is shaped by intense competition with China for leadership in clean technology markets.

Chinese companies currently produce approximately 70% of the global supply of most components used in finished clean tech goods.

While the high tariffs on Chinese imports are intended to protect domestic industry, they may inadvertently handicap American clean energy companies by forcing them to use more expensive domestic or alternative foreign suppliers.

This dynamic creates a strategic paradox: while the administration seeks to challenge Chinese dominance in clean technology markets, the policy tools employed may strengthen China’s position by making American clean energy products less competitive globally.

Chinese manufacturers benefit from scale economies and government support that allow them to maintain cost advantages even when facing tariff barriers in specific markets like the United States.

European Union Relations

The Trump administration’s tariff strategy has extended beyond China to include traditional allies such as the European Union, which faces a 20% tariff on imports.

This approach has implications for clean energy cooperation and technology transfer between the United States and Europe.

The EU has responded with counter-measures and has rejected Trump’s proposal for mutual tariff elimination unless Europe agrees to purchase $350 billion worth of American energy, primarily liquefied natural gas.

The European Union’s commitment to Green Deal policies has created additional friction with the Trump administration’s fossil fuel-focused approach.

European officials have indicated that while there is interest in purchasing American LNG, there is no intention to compromise Green Deal objectives.

This divergence in climate policy priorities may limit opportunities for transatlantic cooperation on clean energy technology development and deployment.

Industry Response and Future Outlook

Private Sector Uncertainty

The clean energy industry has responded to policy uncertainty with caution and, in some cases, outright project cancellations.

Data from the first quarter of 2025 shows that U.S. clean tech projects worth $7.7 billion were canceled—the highest level on record and more than four times the total of all cancellations in 2024.

This trend reflects investor uncertainty about the future policy environment and the economic viability of clean energy projects under new regulatory and trade conditions.

Scott Elias of CleanCapital characterized the House budget bill as threatening “U.S. energy development and risks ceding the AI race and tech leadership to China.”

Industry representatives have warned that the policy changes would “dramatically increase project risk, reduce investment certainty, cancel previously announced projects and investments, and stall clean energy deployment.”

Analysts predict that a complete repeal of the IRA could threaten the development of approximately $500 billion in clean tech projects, with some estimates suggesting this figure could exceed $1 trillion by 2035.

These projections underscore the scale of economic activity that depends on current clean energy policy frameworks and the potential consequences of eliminating them.

Technological Innovation Impacts

Beyond immediate economic effects, policy changes threaten to slow technological innovation in clean energy sectors where the United States has gained competitive advantages.

The combination of reduced domestic demand due to higher costs and limited access to international supply chains may discourage research and development investments by American companies.

This could have long-term implications for U.S. competitiveness in emerging clean technology markets such as advanced battery chemistries, next-generation solar cells, and grid-scale energy storage systems.

Conclusion

The Trump administration’s approach to clean energy policy represents a fundamental departure from the previous administration’s strategy of using government incentives and international cooperation to accelerate clean technology deployment.

The combination of comprehensive IRA repeals and aggressive tariff policies creates a challenging environment for American clean energy companies, consumers, and workers.

While proponents argue these policies will strengthen domestic manufacturing and reduce government spending, the evidence suggests they are more likely to increase energy costs, minimize industrial competitiveness, and slow technological innovation.

The success or failure of this approach will largely depend on whether domestic manufacturing capacity can develop quickly enough to replace international supply chains at competitive costs.

Given the scale and complexity of clean energy supply chains, this transition appears unlikely to occur without significant economic disruption and higher costs for American consumers and businesses.

The ultimate impact on American energy security, economic competitiveness, and environmental outcomes will become clearer as these policies are implemented and their effects become visible in energy markets and manufacturing statistics.

The political sustainability of these policies may also depend on their actual economic impacts as they unfold.

If energy costs rise significantly or manufacturing job losses occur, public opinion and congressional sentiment could shift, potentially creating pressure for policy modifications.

However, the budget reconciliation process and the administration’s emergency powers provide mechanisms for implementing these changes quickly and with limited opportunity for legislative opposition, at least in the near term.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5808122d59cc68e812741033/580a2d6bebbd1a407c287240/6843254ae757962f631d4a39/1749345765949/IMG_3744.jpeg?format=1500w,N,,2025-06-08 11:05:20.826672

IEA pegs electric car sales in 2025 to cross 20 million worldwide.","To draw major global companies to invest in the production of battery-powered passenger vehicles in India, the Centre has launched a new electric vehicle (EV) policy that lowers import duties on electric cars.

The Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI), unveiled last week, will help attract investments from global EV manufacturers, promote India as a manufacturing destination for e-vehicles, create jobs, and help India achieve carbon emission norms.

Fine Print

To encourage global brands to invest under the Scheme, they will be allowed to import Completely Built-in Units (CBUs) of e-4W with a minimum Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) value of $35,000 at reduced customs duty of 15% for five years from the application approval date. To avail this important benefit of the scheme, manufacturers would be required to make minimum investment of Rs 4,150 crore.

The maximum number of electric four-wheelers allowed to be imported at the reduced duty rate is capped at 8,000 units per year. The carryover of unutilised annual import limits would be permitted. The maximum benefits from this duty reduction are topped at Rs6,484 crore or the actual investment amount, whichever is lower.

Manufacturers are also required to meet certain criteria including the need to achieve an annual turnover of at least Rs2,500 crore by the second year, Rs5,000 crore by the fourth year, and Rs7,500 crore by the fifth year. Additionally, they must reach local value-addition targets of 25% by the third year and 50% by the fifth year.

They are also required to be of a certain size. The Global Group’s Revenue (from automotive manufacturing) has to be at least Rs10,000 crore and if the applicant is an investment company, the revenue should not be less than Rs3,000 crore.

The application widow under the scheme is likely to open soon, and will remain open for 120 days. However, the government can reopen the window as and when required till March 15, 2026. Union heavy industries minister H D Kumaraswamy has said that global players including Mercedes, Volkswagen-Skoda, Hyundai, and Kia have shown interest in applying under the EV policy.

Tesla gives the policy a miss

American electric car company Tesla, which has been exploring opportunities in the Indian market for years but has hesitated due to concerns over high import duties, is not interested in participating in the Scheme. This is a major blow for India given India first announced the new policy when Tesla was showing interest and was lobbying extensively for a cut in import duty.

Following the changes in the EV policy in March 2024, reports emerged that Tesla was planning to send a team to scout locations for a proposed $2-3 billion EV manufacturing plant.

However, progress stalled in April 2024 when Musk postponed his planned visit to India and a follow-up meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Shortly after, Tesla announced it would focus on scaling production at its existing facilities rather than investing in new manufacturing units.

Now it is confirmed that Tesla is not interested in setting up a facility in India anytime soon and would rather start selling its cars here as CBUs.

According to Kumaraswamy, Tesla is not interested in manufacturing cars in India but is keen on establishing showrooms in the country. A Tesla factory in India would have given a major boost to the country’s electric vehicle ecosystem by producing cars, batteries and charging solutions locally.

Experts, however, believe that even if Tesla agrees to set up a plant here, it would remain a small player here. This is primarily because India is a price-sensitive market, with the bulk of the passenger vehicles sold here carrying a price tag of less than Rs20 lakh. In contrast, Tesla’s cheapest Model 3 retails for $42,490 in the US (around Rs37 lakh), placing it firmly in the luxury segment in India, even before the hefty duties come into play.

Tesla is now expected to import cars from Germany to sell in India. These models are likely to attract a duty of about 110%. The company may benefit if India and the US finalise a trade deal in which President Donald Trump arm-twists India to reduce duties on American cars.

Invite all but China

Concessions outlined in India’s electric vehicle (EV) policy aimed at attracting global players in all likelihood will not extend to Chinese companies. This was almost confirmed by union minister of commerce and industry Piyush Goyal who said in April that Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD will not be allowed to make new investments in India.

“We will have to be cautious on whom we allow to invest in the country. We have to be cautious about our strategic and security interests,” Goyal told Bloomberg at the India Global Forum in Mumbai.

“We need to be convinced that they will work by the rules of the game,” he said, adding that the country needs to be alert on dumping by other countries in the wake of US tariffs.

BYD, the largest electric car company in the world, is keen to invest in India. Other Chinese firms have also shown interest in having a presence here. In 2023, India rejected investments from China’s auto behemoths — BYD and Great Wall Motors (GWM). BYD’s $1 billion investment plan was rejected in July 2023 while GWM had to shelve plans to set up an India plant as it could not secure clearances.

A senior government official confirmed that Chinese companies will be excluded from these benefits due to national security concerns. Chinese car companies have come to terms with India’s reluctance.

BYD said in October last year that they are not applying for benefits under the new EV policy. ""Representatives of our company, who have a good idea about the policy, went in, went through that. The final conclusion... is that we have decided that, no, we are not ready to implement this policy in the short term. So, we are not applying,"" said Rajeev Chauhan, head of electric passenger vehicles business, BYD India.

Small but growing: India’s electric car market

India’s electric car market is small and its penetration in total car sales is quite low at just 3%. Compared to over 11 million battery-powered cars sold in China in 2024, India’s total electric car sales were just 111,300 units. In the US, electric car sales increased to 1.6 million in 2024, with their share in total car sales growing to more than 10%.

The slow intake of electric car sales in India, the world’s largest car market, is primarily attributed to fewer models, expensive selling price and inadequate charging infrastructure to support the EVs.

However, things are changing at a rapid pace. Retail sales of electric cars in April 2025 stood at 13,120 units, up by a massive 69% year-on-year. On the back of new launches, e-PV cumulative January-May 2025 retail sales grew to 59,444 units, recording a 44% growth year-on-year. Given the current sentiment and new launches in the coming months, including one by India’s largest carmaker – Maruti Suzuki -- electric car sales are expected to breach the 150,000-units mark for the first time in CY2025.

Research and rating agency firm ICRA said that the penetration of electric vehicles in India’s overall automobile sales is expected to grow exponentially by FY30 from the current levels. ICRA sees EV penetration in passenger vehicle sales grow five-fold by FY30 to 15%, up from 3% seen at the end of FY25. The sharp growth will be led by expansion of product portfolio by automakers, improved charging infrastructure, lower battery prices, and lower running cost of electric PVs, said ICRA.

Trade pacts can play spoilsport

The key attraction of the scheme is a lower (15%) tariff on imports by manufacturers who commit to start manufacturing facilities in India. However, India’s trade pact with the US, the UK and later on with the European Union might play spoilsport. It is well-known that the US, UK and Europe are bargaining hard to make India lower tariffs on cars.

In fact, under the UK trade deal, India has agreed to reduce tariffs on cars to 10% under a quota system. However, commerce ministry officials say small EVs have been kept out of the ambit of the trade deal. Also, the US and EU are likely to ask for similar concessions for the automotive sector under the ongoing trade talks.

Is the future all electric?

A whopping 17 million electric cars were sold globally in 2024, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA). China maintained its lead among major markets, with electric car sales exceeding 11 million. In fact, almost half of China’s car sales were electric in 2024, representing almost two-thirds of electric cars sold globally.

For context, China accounted for half of global electric car sales in 2021; this share grew to almost two-thirds in 2024. On a monthly basis, sales of electric cars have overtaken conventional car sales in the country since July 2024, bringing the share of electric car sales close to 50% for the full year. In China, 2024 marks the fourth consecutive year in which the electric car sales share grew by approximately 10 percentage points year-on-year.

In the US, another major market for electric cars, EV sales are growing but not as fast as in China. In 2024, around 1.6 million electric cars were sold in the US, with the sales share growing to more than 10%. In the first quarter of 2025, around 3 lakh EVs were sold, according to available data.

A total of 24 new electric car models were launched in the US in 2024. While the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 have been the two best-selling models in the United States since 2020, the 110 new models that have entered the market since then have driven the market share of Tesla down from 60% in 2020 to 38% in 2024.

IEA pegs electric car sales in 2025 to cross 20 million worldwide. This would mean, 25% of all cars sold globally will be electric. China, which is driving EV usage in emerging markets through export of electric cars, EVs are projected to represent 60% of overall car sales in 2025.

Incentives and subsidies China gives to promote EVs

China gives to promote EVs China’s ‘Made in China 2025’ plan is a national strategy which targets 20% EV sales by 2025. China already surpassed this figure in 2022.

The Chinese government offers purchase grants through central and local policies, providing subsidies of up to RMB 100,000 (approximately $15,000) per vehicle.

Manufacturer Subsidies: All-electric plug-in cars with a range over 400 km can receive subsidies of RMB 12,600 (approximately $2000), while those with a range of 300-400 km get RMB 9,100 (approximately $1400).

Consumers can receive a subsidy of up to RMB 20,000 ($2,730) when they scrap an older ICE vehicle or EV and purchase a new EV. The Chinese government also provides incentives for infrastructure investment, such as charging stations.

Incentives and subsidies US gives to promote EVs

The US government provides many subsidies to promote EV production and adoption, including both demand-side incentives for consumers and supply-side incentives for manufacturers.

To boost demand, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides tax credits for new and used EVs. For new EVs, the credit is up to $7,500, but it’s subject to requirements regarding the sourcing of battery components and critical minerals. For used EVs, the credit is up to $4,000. Some states offer additional rebates on top of the federal tax credit.

On the supply-side Incentives, the IRA includes tax credits for the production of electric batteries and components in the US, potentially offering subsidies of up to $35 per kWh for battery production and $10 per kWh for module assembly.",https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2025-06-07%2Fqdnredd7%2FCHINA.jpg?rect=0%2C89%2C1210%2C635&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-06-08 02:04:33.840666

Another area where it excels by a great margin is in the reliability sector, where it bests the likes of some of the best cars on the market today, from the likes of both Toyota and Tesla.

Hyundai has typically been a well-trusted brand among consumers. The South Korean company's early entry into the EV sphere hasn't been without its fair share of hiccups, but it has managed to find an impressive balance between overall reliability, performance, and efficiency. This shows itself in a set of impressive reliability ratings and standards from some of the most esteemed publications and analysts.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Hyundai's websites and other authoritative sources, including J.D. Power, Edmunds, and the EPA.

Hyundai Ioniq 6: Top-Ranked In J.D. Power’s 2025 EVX Study

BEV owners in the premium and mass market segments show renewed optimism about electric vehicles following a drop in satisfaction in 2024. According to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. EVX Ownership Study, BEVs conquered 9.1 percent of the retail market in 2024, rising from 8.4 percent in 2023. This is primarily thanks to there being more mass market options available to consumers, some of which benefit from more competitive pricing and leasing rates. This growth occurs amid an uncertain set of policies, as the current administration considers cutting EV tax credits and funding for public charging.

Recent changes to the Inflation Reduction Act more than doubled the number of buyers receiving federal tax incentives. Over half of BEV owners said tax credits influenced their purchase decision, making them one of the strongest buying motivators. Despite this, J.D. Power predicts the EV retail market share will hold steady through 2025.

The Ioniq 6 Scores 751 Points, Leading The Mass-Market EV Segment

The Hyundai Ioniq 6 leads the mass market BEV segment in the 2025 J.D. Power EVX Ownership Study with a score of 751, followed by the Kia EV6 at 743, and the Chevrolet Equinox EV at 737. The study includes 12 award-eligible mass market models, down from 14, and eight premium models, unchanged from last year. Average satisfaction scores stand at 756 for premium BEVs and 725 for mass-market models. Now in its fifth year, the study evaluates the first year of EV ownership, measuring satisfaction using a 10-factor index rating system.

These factors include battery range and accuracy, public charging access, cost of ownership, driving enjoyment, home charging ease, styling, safety and tech features, service experience, and overall vehicle quality and reliability. The study reflects a detailed look at how owners perceive their vehicles across both segments, highlighting key strengths and areas for improvement in an evolving electric vehicle market.

Outperformed Tesla And Toyota In Quality And Reliability Metrics

J.D. Power's evaluation of the Ioniq 6 highlights a 76/100 quality and reliability, 81/100 driving experience, and 74/100 resale score, together with a 71/100 dealership experience score. This brings the overall consumer-verified score up to 76/100.

For reference, the Tesla Model 3 sits with a higher 80/100 consumer-verified overall score, thanks to an 82/100 driving experience and 89/100 resale score. However, it gets a 74/100 score for quality and reliability. The Toyota bZ4X fairs even worse, bringing in a 64/100 quality and reliability, 76/100 driving experience, and 81/100 resale score, resulting in a 73/100 consumer-verified overall rating.

Exceptional Range And Efficiency

The Ioniq 6 further motivates itself as an appealing proposition when you look at its impressive EPA energy consumption estimations. The base SE with the standard range battery pack returns 151/120/135 MPGe on its city/highway/combined cycle, as well as 25 kWh per 100 miles on the combined cycle. This does feature a smaller battery pack, so you're only going to cover 240 miles on a single charge. The EPA estimates that you'll be saving up to $5,500 on gasoline every five years and spending $550 on electricity every year. On average, it will cost you 94 cents to drive 25 miles.

Up To 342 Miles Of EPA-Estimated Range

Upgrading to the extended battery pack interestingly improves efficiency, despite the increased curb weight. The EPA estimates that it will return 153/127/140 MPGe and 24 kWh per 100 miles on the combined cycle. You also get to enjoy a considerably generous 361-mile range figure. Five-year fuel savings and annual energy costs are unchanged, but it will only cost you 90 cents to drive 25 miles.

The top-of-the-range dual-motor configuration with the smaller 18-inch wheel option reflects a good balance of performance and efficiency. This consumes 130/111/121 MPGe and 27 kWh per 100 miles, while returning a 316-mile range on a single charge. This will save you $5,250 in fuel costs every five years and cost you $600 to recharge every year. The increased consumption means you'll be spending $1.02 to drive 25 miles.

The nuclear energy sector is experiencing a resurgence unseen in decades, driven largely by its potential to power the burgeoning AI revolution. Major technology companies such as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) are competing to secure reliable energy sources for their expanding data centers, and nuclear power’s clean, consistent output has positioned it as a key player in this race.

Confident Investing Starts Here:

Leading this revival are three companies—Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale Power (SMR)—each bringing a distinct approach to the nuclear landscape. Over the past year, all three have outperformed the market, capturing investor attention amid rising energy demand.

Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) | The Nuclear Titan Locking in Tech Giants

Constellation Energy is the 800-pound gorilla of U.S. nuclear power, and it’s just landed a deal that’s got everyone’s attention. Just two days ago, CEG signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Meta to deliver 1.1 gigawatts from its Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, starting in 2027. This isn’t an ordinary contract, but rather a lifeline for a plant that was on the verge of closure when its zero-emissions credits expire. The deal, which also boosts Clinton’s output by 30 megawatts, underscores CEG’s ability to secure tech giants. Microsoft is already on board with a Three Mile Island restart.

What makes CEG a one-of-a-kind destination for tech titans is its scale. With 94 reactors across the U.S., they’re a one-stop shop for tech companies chasing net-zero goals while powering AI workloads. Their shift away from co-located data center plans to grid-connected projects, as noted in last month’s update, indicates they’re adapting to regulatory hurdles, such as FERC’s rejection of expanded co-location deals.

Moreover, the Meta deal demonstrates that CEG can pivot and still secure massive contracts. Sure, their stock’s run-up makes it a bit daunting to be bullish on today, but with AI data centers projected to eat up 9% of U.S. electricity by 2030, CEG’s infrastructure could be a cash cow in waiting.

Is Constellation Energy Stock a Good Buy?

Currently, most analysts are bullish on CEG stock. The stock features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buy and five Hold ratings assigned in the past three months. No analyst rates the stock a sell. CEG’s average stock price target of $319.45 implies ~10% upside over the next twelve months, despite shares having already rallied 30% year-to-date.

Oklo (NYSE:OKLO) | The Startup with a Nuclear Vision

Oklo, the newest entrant in the nuclear energy space and backed by OpenAI’s Sam Altman, is focused on small modular reactors (SMRs)—compact, flexible power plants ideally suited for data centers. The company’s stock has surged 440% over the past year, fueled by high-profile agreements such as its December deal with Switch to supply 12 gigawatts through 2044. Additionally, a recent memorandum with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to advance their 75-megawatt Aurora Powerhouse fast reactor has further accelerated momentum.

While Oklo remains pre-revenue and is currently investing heavily in technology development, with commercial operations still several years away, its “power-as-a-service” model—where the company builds, owns, and operates reactors—could revolutionize how data centers secure reliable power without significant upfront costs. Recent executive orders easing nuclear regulations have also provided a regulatory boost.

However, significant risks remain, including ongoing R&D challenges and the high costs of scaling production. For investors who believe SMRs are key to powering the AI revolution, Oklo’s long-term vision holds considerable promise.

Is OKLO Stock a Good Buy?

On Wall Street, Oklo stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buy and three Hold ratings. No analyst rates the stock a sell. Oklo’s average stock price target of $54.40 implies about 15% upside potential over the next twelve months.

NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) | The SMR Pioneer with a Head Start

NuScale Power holds a distinct advantage as the first U.S. company to secure Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval for its small modular reactor (SMR) design—the 77-megawatt VOYGR module.

But the company isn’t resting on this milestone; it is rapidly advancing a 2-gigawatt agreement with Standard Power to supply data centers in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Despite posting losses as it invests in expanding its supply chain, NuScale’s Q1 report revealed an impressive 857% year-over-year revenue increase. The recent Meta-Constellation Energy deal also boosted NuScale’s stock, signaling strong market confidence in its role in nuclear’s resurgence.

What distinguishes NuScale from its competitors is its pragmatic approach. Its light-water reactor technology is more established and less experimental than Oklo’s fast reactors, making it a safer candidate for near-term deployment. However, supply chain constraints and complex project coordination remain significant challenges that could delay progress.

Still, with tech giants like Google and Amazon entering SMR agreements, NuScale’s first-mover advantage positions it well to meet growing energy demands. Its factory-built, modular design aligns perfectly with data centers’ requirements for scalable, reliable power.

Is NuScale Power a Good Stock to Buy?

NuScale Power is currently covered by eight Wall Street analysts, who generally hold a bullish outlook. The stock carries a Moderate Buy consensus rating, reflecting five Buy ratings, two Holds, and one Sell over the past three months. However, SMR’s average price target of $27.42 suggests approximately 12% downside potential over the next twelve months.

Why Nuclear Energy Is the Smart Bet for AI’s Future

The resurgence of the nuclear sector is no coincidence, as the soaring energy demands of AI are reshaping the industry landscape. Constellation Energy (CEG) brings scale, Oklo (OKLO) leads with innovation, and NuScale Power (SMR) holds a regulatory advantage.

Each faces its own challenges—CEG’s stock trades at a premium valuation, Oklo is still managing significant cash burn, and NuScale navigates operational risks. Nevertheless, the potential upside is substantial. With tech giants committing to multi-gigawatt agreements and nuclear capacity projected to quadruple by 2050, these companies are at the forefront of a transformative energy revolution and merit close attention.

What’s fueling this demand? Artificial intelligence.

However, it’s pretty clear the current energy grid is already stretched thin, struggling to meet electricity demands. Add anything more, and it might just buckle.

More pressure on the energy infrastructure could translate into hiked power bills, brownouts, and blackouts for the American public. Worse still, if the grid can’t supply enough energy, it could bring the tech industry to a halt, potentially stifling AI development before companies can even begin to explore half of its possibilities.

The US is still dealing with aged energy infrastructure in key states

According to IEA’s analysis, data centers used up 415 TWh in 2024, about 1.5% of global electricity consumption, and AI servers accounted for a hefty share of that.

Per their report, AI servers alone made up 24% of server electricity use and 15% of total data center energy demand last year. That’s a staggering footprint for a technology still in its early stages—and it’s only expected to grow moving forward.

Alex de Vries, a researcher at VU Amsterdam and the founder of Digiconomist, believes the IEA’s figures are underestimated, calling their AI stats a bit vague.

Goldman Sachs also made their projections, estimating that AI data centers could burn through 165% more power; even Arm’s CEO warned that AI might use 25% of US electricity by 2030. Sounds a bit dramatic, but the real question is, can the country handle the future energy demands of AI?

The government certainly believes so, seeing that it already started issuing incentives and implementing new regulations both at the federal and state levels.

For instance, in April, President Trump signed executive orders to fast-track coal energy production—supposedly to meet the AI industry’s soaring power demands because reviving fossil fuels in 2025 is the answer. Well, analysts aren’t exactly thrilled with the president’s decision. Many doubt it’ll even be enough, and environmentalist backlash is only getting worse.

Focusing on fossil fuels like natural gas or coal could alleviate the AI power crisis, but building new fossil fuel-powered facilities may take at least three to five years. If we are talking nuclear plants, it could take even longer, roughly seven to 15 years. Furthermore, renewables like solar and wind require costly battery storage to maintain steady power for AI data centers.

Not to mention, multiple transmission lines and substations in several states are over 50 years old. Talk about ancient; some even date back to the 19th century, particularly in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago, which begs the question, is there really a method to cater to AI power demands, or should companies rethink their tech development strategies?

CEO Michael Polsky asks the government to provide support to power developers.

The US is still very focused on beating China in developing artificial intelligence. However, if it stands a chance to win, it would need to invest in power superhighways to move large quantities of electricity, according to Invenergy LLC Chief Executive Officer Michael Polsky.

He argues that establishing a national transmission activity to set up high-voltage lines could even expedite the process. His words: “I do believe it’s an emergency because of how difficult it is to build things. We don’t have decades to figure this out. We have years.”

Additionally, he suggested the government offer support to power developers as it does for others like Musk and his spaceships. He claimed they should also be fairly compensated for their investments.

However, the Trump administration seems hell-bent on budget cuts, especially on clean energy power developers. Just last month, the government cut off nearly $4 billion in support from some clean energy projects. Not to mention, Invenergy’s Grain Belt Express project funding could be next on the chopping block, meaning it could potentially lose about $11 billion that could transmit 5 gigawatts of power across 800 miles.

Nonetheless, Invenergy President Jim Murphy believes the government will still fund their project. Polsky even argued that their project was of national concern.",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Americas-energy-infrastructure.webp,N,,2025-06-08 07:03:22.053242

Article no. 1539.

A Japanese company has paused construction of a $1.6 billion battery factory in South Carolina, intended to produce batteries for electric BMW vehicles, citing uncertainty around U.S. policies and tariffs as the main reason for the halt.

While Automotive Energy Supply Corp. didn’t specify what those problems are, South Carolina’s Republican governor said the company is dealing with the potential loss of federal tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and incentives for EV businesses as well as tariff uncertainties from President Donald Trump’s administration.

This pause reflects broader challenges in the automotive supply chain caused by a 25% tariff imposed on imported auto parts from Japan and other countries starting May 3, 2025, which has significantly increased costs for engines, transmissions, electrical components, and batteries.

The tariff has disrupted decades-old trade patterns between the U.S. and Japan, forcing manufacturers to reconsider sourcing strategies. For example, the tariff adds about $1,875 to the cost of a $7,500 electric vehicle battery pack, making battery production more expensive and uncertain.

This environment of tariff-induced cost increases and policy unpredictability has led to delays and caution among battery manufacturers, including this Japanese company’s decision to pause the South Carolina plant’s construction5.

Additionally, Japanese automakers like Honda are adjusting their supply chains by procuring batteries domestically within the U.S. to mitigate tariff risks, such as sourcing batteries from Toyota’s U.S. plants for hybrid vehicles.

The tariffs, part of ongoing trade tensions, threaten to slow the expansion of battery production critical to electric vehicles and grid energy storage, with industry experts warning that these tariffs could discourage new investments and delay projects.

In this notional future, nearly all of Canada’s energy needs are met through renewable electricity generation from wind, solar, and existing hydroelectric and nuclear facilities.
Electrification fundamentally alters Canada’s energy flows, significantly reducing overall energy input requirements due to enhanced efficiency.
For this analysis, it’s important to understand that Canada’s fossil fuel industry consumes 24% of industrial energy demand today.
Due to the massive efficiency gains of an electrified economy that leverages ambient heat, primary energy requirements plummet.","Canada stands at a crossroads in its energy future, and the path it chooses will define its economic resilience, environmental integrity, and quality of life for generations. As a Canadian who is involved in shaping Ireland’s 2050 energy roadmap through my work with Trifecta Ireland, I see an immense opportunity for Canada to follow a similarly ambitious trajectory toward comprehensive electrification and renewable energy integration.

This article has been triggered by a public call for key people who should be in a few days of workshops related to Canada’s energy transformation at this inflection point by a Canadian PWC executive I worked with for years, Shelley Gilberg. While she and I met through our involvement with building the world’s most sophisticated public health surveillance system, Panorama, and continued working together on proposals and projects in Canada, we’ve stayed in touch as I’ve applied my global perspective to the challenges of decarbonization. I was one of the people she tagged in her LinkedIn post to request my suggestions for participants. Personally, I think I should be one of them, and this is my initial reflection on the subject. I’ll undoubtedly be able to suggest others as I understand more of the goals and scope Shelley has in mind.

Trifecta has been formed and is being led by an Irish executive I’ve been working with for a year, Lesley O’Connor. She had a global executive role with Mainstream Renewables, developing GW of renewables in Chile, for example. She now sits on the Board of the Mainstream and has established Trifecta as part of her goal to give back to her country.

The Trifecta approach, anchored in principles of clean, secure, and affordable energy for all, provides a clear framework adaptable to Canada’s unique energy landscape. While Canada and Ireland differ vastly in scale, both nations share common challenges and opportunities around decarbonizing their economies, securing energy independence, and maintaining affordability. Canada’s vast renewable resources and technological capabilities position it ideally to embrace this transformation fully.

Today, Canada’s energy system is deeply embedded in fossil fuels, heavily influenced by its role as a major supplier of oil and natural gas, almost entirely to the United States, although increasingly, if temporarily, to Asia. This reality shapes both domestic energy policy and international trade relationships, particularly with our currently fractious neighbor to the south. Canada’s energy exports are significant, but this trade dependence carries vulnerabilities tied to global market fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty, and of course is going to decline over the coming decades as we stop burning hydrocarbons we dig out of the ground.

At home, the reliance on fossil fuels for heating, transportation, and industrial processes dominates Canada’s energy flows, characterized by substantial inefficiencies and resulting in high levels of wasted energy, mostly through heat loss in combustion-based systems. A detailed Sankey analysis highlights that, in the current system, Canada consumes roughly 2,500 terawatt-hours (TWh) of primary energy annually, but only about 1,009 TWh ends up as useful energy services. Nearly 1,500 TWh is effectively lost, predominantly as waste heat from inefficient internal combustion engines, furnaces, and conventional power plants.

Note that I pulled the Sankey diagram together quickly for this article, following the same process I’ve used for similar diagrams for Ireland, Pakistan, India, the Netherlands (in aid of 2050 scenario planning with TenneT this summer), Australia and an exemplar electrifying port. It may be imperfect as a result, but it is accurate enough for the purposes of this article. I’m compelled to create my own versions of these diagrams as the large majority of the ones that exist aren’t in the energy of the future, units of electricity, and usually exclude or deeply understate rejected energy.

Imagining a fully electrified Canadian economy presents a compelling vision. In this notional future, nearly all of Canada’s energy needs are met through renewable electricity generation from wind, solar, and existing hydroelectric and nuclear facilities. Wind energy, abundant across Canadian provinces, could provide just over 300 TWh annually, with solar adding around 180 TWh.

Existing hydroelectric infrastructure continues to deliver about 270 TWh per year, complemented by current nuclear generation at approximately 90 TWh. Crucially, biomass resources, sustainably harvested from Canadian forestry and agriculture sectors, supply about 143 TWh annually, converted into biofuels essential for long-haul aviation and maritime shipping. This strategic use of bioenergy resolves the challenge of electrifying energy-dense transportation sectors where battery technologies currently face limitations.

Electrification fundamentally alters Canada’s energy flows, significantly reducing overall energy input requirements due to enhanced efficiency. Electric vehicles replace gasoline and diesel cars, buses, trucks, and trains, dramatically cutting transportation-related energy use. Electric drivetrains convert about 77% of input energy directly to vehicle motion, compared to just 20–30% efficiency typical of internal combustion engines. Consequently, transportation’s total energy requirement shrinks substantially, with around 230 TWh of electricity supporting electric road and rail transport, alongside 100 TWh of biofuel used exclusively for long-distance aviation and shipping. This transition significantly diminishes rejected energy, resulting in only modest thermal losses from battery charging, electric motors, and biofuel combustion engines.

Residential and commercial heating similarly benefit from electrification through advanced heat pump technology. Canadian homes and commercial buildings leverage ambient heat from the environment, drawn by heat pumps that provide heating at approximately three times the efficiency of conventional electric resistance heaters. Heat pumps capture ambient heat from air and ground sources, supplying residential buildings with around 140 TWh and commercial buildings with about 57 TWh annually. This use of ambient heat reduces the need for electricity significantly; residential buildings require only about 205 TWh of electricity to meet heating, cooling, and appliance demands, while commercial buildings draw roughly 120 TWh. This combination sharply reduces wasted energy in heating systems, resulting in significantly lower thermal losses compared to traditional fossil fuel or resistance-based heating systems.

Industry, which accounts for the largest share of Canada’s current energy consumption, can also achieve substantial efficiencies through electrification. Industrial processes below 200°C are especially amenable to heat pump technology, leveraging about 70 TWh of ambient heat per year, thus significantly reducing electricity needs. Canada has already proven seasonal storage of heat in reservoirs, something exceedingly common in European countries, with cold being storable as well. Electric arc furnaces, electric plasmas, infrared, microwave and resistance heating methods handle higher-temperature requirements efficiently. In this scenario, industry would use approximately 320 TWh of electricity annually.

For this analysis, it’s important to understand that Canada’s fossil fuel industry consumes 24% of industrial energy demand today. That will drop radically as our oil, gas and coal sectors decline to being only used as feedstocks for petrochemicals, likely in the 10% to 20% of current levels. However, as our economy continues to diversify and our advantages related to critical minerals and other future industries including data centers grow, I’ve chosen to leave industrial energy demands untouched.

As such, energy service provision remains constant at today’s levels, around 360 TWh of useful industrial output, yet achieves this with far less input energy and reduced waste. This streamlined electrification results in modest industrial rejected energy, limited primarily to inevitable process heat losses and minor inefficiencies.

Due to the massive efficiency gains of an electrified economy that leverages ambient heat, primary energy requirements plummet. Excluding the ambient heat, we only need to generate around the same amount of energy in the form of electricity and biofuels as our entire energy services, about 1,000 TWh. That’s only 40% of the primary energy we consume today. We don’t have to replace the 2,500 TWh we use currently, just the energy services. This is a very achievable goal, not one that is out of Canada’s reach.

Implementing such an electrified vision demands significant upgrades to Canada’s electrical grid. Modernization of transmission infrastructure is essential to distribute power reliably from wind-rich regions in the Prairies and coastal areas to population centers in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Enhanced grid capacity, coupled with energy storage solutions such as battery systems and pumped hydro storage, ensures stability despite the intermittent nature of renewable resources. Investment in smart grid technology and demand-response systems allows flexible, real-time energy management, optimizing electricity distribution and consumption. Such improvements position Canada not only to handle increased electricity loads efficiently but also to improve overall system resilience and flexibility.

Economically, transitioning to a fully electrified and renewable-based system presents multiple benefits. Job creation in renewable energy sectors, from wind turbine manufacturing to solar installation and grid upgrades, can significantly boost employment, particularly in regions historically reliant on fossil fuel industries. Over the long term, renewable electricity generation provides greater price stability compared to volatile fossil fuel markets, benefiting consumers and businesses alike.

Policy initiatives to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, incentivize renewable energy adoption, and support research and development into innovative electrification technologies are vital steps in realizing this transition. Canada can look to international experiences, including the policy frameworks considered in Europe and China, to shape effective national strategies.

Ireland’s 2050 energy roadmap process has provided valuable lessons, particularly around stakeholder engagement, interim target setting, and balancing ambitious national objectives with practical, local realities. The goal of the effort is to deliver five-year incremental visions of the country’s energy flows as an evolving series of Sankey diagrams, with each five-year increment accompanied by actions organized by a five-factor framework synthesized from global leading practices:

Policy & Regulation

Technology & Innovation

Infrastructure & System Integration

Market Mechanisms & Finance

Organization & Workforce (Institutions)

Trifecta will be bringing stakeholders from industry, academics, the government and community-oriented NGOs together during the process to arrive at a common vision for the end state and the increments to getting there, and to flesh out the key things that must be accomplished within each element of the framework in order to succeed.

We’ve been identifying the key organizations and individuals required to bring to the table to create this vision, among other key strategic goals, over the course of many hours of strategy sessions focused on Richard Rumelt’s kernel of good strategy: diagnosis, policies, plans. That involved a lot of stakeholder analysis, including a Latourian actor-network theory assessment of Ireland’s energy environment. It included a good deal of work on those who might be opposed to a transformative vision for Ireland’s energy future, and how they could be engaged positively in the process.

Canada’s diversity — geographical, economic, and cultural — means a similar stakeholder-driven approach is critical for successful implementation. Collaborative planning involving governments at all levels, industry leaders, Indigenous communities, and citizen stakeholders will be essential to craft policies that are both effective and inclusive. As Canada’s challenge with carbon pricing on home heating oil in the east show, whatever comes out of this must be affordable for all. How that is achieved is open to discussion, and there are multiple levers that can be pulled in the framework at the right time. Incremental yet ambitious interim goals ensure progress remains measurable and achievable, helping maintain momentum toward full decarbonization by mid-century.

However, Canada’s conditions are different from Ireland’s in key ways. Ireland doesn’t have unifying governmental bodies below the level of the Prime Minister, something Trifecta is hoping to bridge by being a focused convener of stakeholders who don’t have formal reasons to talk presently. Canada does have those governance layers. Ireland doesn’t have a major fossil fuel extraction and processing industry, or heavy industry at all, in fact leaping from agriculture directly into the knowledge and service economies without industrializing. Ireland doesn’t have the internal trade barriers Canada does, the removal of which are now thankfully at the top of political agendas federally and provincially.

Like Canada, Ireland does have very close ties to the United States historically and tight economic ties with 30% of trans-Atlantic data cables terminating in the country and major US internet firms including Google, Microsoft and Amazon have data centers in the country and are planning to build more.

Notably, Ireland doesn’t have a roadmap to decarbonized energy yet, and Trifecta is filling a clear gap that emerged in our strategic assessments. As a result, an energy roadmap exercise for Canada is necessarily a different beast with different expected impacts than the one for Ireland. I’m engaging with Shelley to understand more about her vision, with this article being part of my thinking process.

The path to Canada’s electrified future is clear and achievable. It offers a chance not only to radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also to build a stronger, more resilient economy, foster innovation, and secure sustainable energy independence. Leveraging insights gained from Ireland’s process, Canada can confidently embark on its energy transition journey, transforming its abundant renewable resources into lasting prosperity and environmental stewardship for generations to come.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ChatGPT-Image-Jun-7-2025-12_17_39-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-06-08 01:03:56.223075

By the time you read this article, the “wind port” project at Paulsboro may be in a state of hibernation. Stockpiles of wind turbine monopiles manufactured there are being disassembled. It is doubtful whether any offshore wind energy farms will be built in New Jersey over the next four years. Gov. Murphy’s bold vision for offshore wind is a shambles.

President Trump, who seeks to foster oil and gas development, despite the inherent emissions danger, has issued a moratorium against new development of offshore wind projects. Trump is also blocking offshore wind projects that already received federal permits.

The opposition to wind power, which includes right-leaning politicians and NJ shore towns, has distributed a series of never-ending lies about offshore wind power, beginning with “it kills whales” and ending with “it cannot coexist with the fisheries industry.” Such misinformation plays into the hands of fossil fuel interests by prejudicing the public against wind energy, which is substantially cleaner and better for the environment than coal, oil, and gas.

In the meantime, offshore wind is far better established in states such as Maine, Virginia, Massachusetts, and New York. At least two of those states have offshore systems that are now fully online. In New Jersey, Paulsboro and a sister wind port in Salem County still have a role to play in offshore wind, according to state officials, although the promise of many new jobs in this industry has dimmed.

While the offshore wind situation in New Jersey is bleak, renewable power in the United States is doing much better than Trump would like. The reason that solar and onshore wind power are doing well is simple: economics. A 2023 report, based on International Energy Agency data, indicated that “Overall, solar and onshore wind remain the cheapest option for new electricity generation in most countries.”

In the United States, solar has stepped in to supply a large chunk of the energy demand in many states. In the West, land-based wind turbines are churning out significant levels of power. In Iowa, South Dakota, and Kansas, renewable power produces more than half of the electricity. There are nine more states where renewables produce more than a third of their power.

Strangely, politicians in Texas (which produces more wind power than any other state) recently passed a law that requires utilities to build more fossil fuel plants when they build more renewable power. Ostensibly, the reason is to ensure backup power is available in case of system failures.

Electric power demand is up greatly all over the country—US electricity demand is forecast to grow by 16% over the next five years. Unfortunately, the grid is not keeping up with the demand. Here in the Northeast, our grid operator, PJM Interconnection, has a two-year backlog to approve the connection of a new generating facility. Adding to the delays, there has been a surge in applications for new renewable energy projects, such as wind and solar farms, as well as fossil fuel power plants.

While it is true that there have been challenges and delays in new grid construction and infrastructure development within PJM’s territory, it’s important to note that there have also been ongoing projects and investments aimed at addressing these issues. There are several “smart grid” ideas floating around, including advanced digital, communications, and automation technologies designed to improve the efficiency, reliability, and resilience of the electric power grid, but these don’t eliminate the need for new towers, wires, and substations.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-08 02:04:50.480819

We’re a mission-driven company at the forefront of consumer renewable energy lending, leading the charge against the deceptive practices of the biggest financing companies and the shady sales tactics that have plagued solar for years.

Founded by a longtime Daily Kos community member with over a decade leading ethical credit union solar lending, we’re committed to making clean energy lending fair and transparent for everyone. We’ve got a full intro post coming soon that’ll break down who we are, what we’ve already built, and the full mission we’re building — but right now, the solar industry is in crisis. And we’re asking for your help — not for us, but for our reputable friends in the business.

The “Big Beautiful Blunder” — with the elimination of solar tax credits for homeowners (Section 25D) — threatens to gut the residential solar market. It’s not just about homeowners losing a 30% tax credit. It’s about:

Millions of jobs at stake in solar installation, manufacturing, and supply chain.

Higher energy costs for families who want to go solar but can’t close the gap without the credit.

Tilting the game to fossil fuels — as usual.

We’re already seeing the fallout: projects canceled, workers laid off, and communities left behind.

Daily Kos has always been a place where people take action — where policy meets the power of grassroots voices. So here’s our direct ask:

✅ Contact these key Senate offices today — they’re the swing votes that could keep solar tax credits alive.

Tell them:

> “If you won’t make the smart choice for America’s energy future, then kill subsidies for ALL energy. Let renewables send the dinosaurs back to extinction. Keep 25D”

But that undermines one of TVA’s main arguments for building new gas plants in the first place: its self-determined deadline for coal retirement.
“The imperative of 2027 closure of the [Kingston coal plant] is not adequately disclosed.
That coal plant is the largest in the fleet, providing a capacity of roughly 2.4 GW.
TVA plans to add a nearly 1.5-GW gas plant on site and a 0.9-GW gas plant in Cheatham County, about 20 miles from Nashville.","The Tennessee Valley Authority is considering extending the life of its coal plants.

Or, at least, that is what the utility is saying publicly.

“TVA is very concerned about how they are being viewed by the Trump administration,” said Stephen Smith, director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

TVA currently operates four coal plants: Kingston, near Knoxville, Cumberland, near Clarksville, Gallatin, about 30 miles from Nashville, and Shawnee, in Paducah, Kentucky.

In 2021, TVA announced a plan to retire all coal plants by 2035. Two of the coal plants, at Kingston and Cumberland, are scheduled to close completely by 2027 and 2028, respectively, and be replaced with equivalent gas generation.

“Substantial performance and cost risk is carried by operating a coal fleet reaching the end of its useful life,” TVA wrote at the time. “Unplanned outage rate, a component of availability, is the primary driver of challenges.” Many Tennesseans experienced this firsthand during Winter Storm Elliott two years ago, when TVA issued rolling blackouts after coal and gas plants failed.

But earlier this month, TVA changed its tune, shortly after President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at reviving the coal industry and granted TVA exemptions to Biden-era coal pollution regulations.

“We’re evaluating our coal units’ lifespans,” TVA’s new CEO Don Moul said during a recent board meeting. “We continue to depend on them to help power this region.”

Moul declined an interview request from WPLN News about the possible extensions. Wade White, a member of the TVA Board, the utility’s main regulator, also declined an interview with WPLN News at a meeting in early May.

TVA undermines one of its key arguments for new fossil fuel generation

TVA may find it difficult to extend use of the Kingston or Cumberland coal plants, because the utility would have to get permission to emit two kinds of dangerous fossil fuel pollution simultaneously, as new gas plants at those sites come online. All four of the utility’s coal plants rank among the top five climate polluters in Tennessee and Kentucky — with Cumberland consistently ranking as the top emitter. Air pollution from these plants is also linked to hundreds of premature deaths each year.

Or TVA could burn coal longer if any gas plant construction gets behind schedule. But that undermines one of TVA’s main arguments for building new gas plants in the first place: its self-determined deadline for coal retirement.

When proposing a 1.5-gigawatt gas plant for Kingston, for example, TVA suggested that the gas plant was the only option for generation because of how quickly it needed to shut down the coal plant — an argument scrutinized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year.

“TVA dismisses the lower costs, lower financial risks, and far superior environmental performance of [the solar option] by arguing that solar cells could not be installed by 2027,” EPA wrote in a letter to the utility. “The imperative of 2027 closure of the [Kingston coal plant] is not adequately disclosed. If closure by 2027 is an imperative, then TVA created an alternative that is technically infeasible and therefore not a viable alternative.”

TVA’s own transmission queue challenges this idea. As of January 2025, the utility had about 8.6 GW worth of solar and battery projects, with requested dates of June 2025 or later, waiting to be developed and added to the grid. That is more power than TVA’s entire gas buildout this decade.

Last year, TVA said it takes an average of “5.4 years” for a solar project to come online, but experts say TVA could speed up the rate at which it’s bringing solar projects online.

“If TVA had the proper ambition and motivation, they could be building out solar and storage to scale,” Smith said. “They choose not to, and they choose then to mislead the public that it’s not possible.”

TVA made a similar argument for the Cumberland site a few years ago. That coal plant is the largest in the fleet, providing a capacity of roughly 2.4 GW. TVA plans to add a nearly 1.5-GW gas plant on site and a 0.9-GW gas plant in Cheatham County, about 20 miles from Nashville.

TVA stressed the need to have replacement generation by 2026 to replace the first of the coal plant’s two units.

“If the first Cumberland unit must stay in operation beyond 2026, significant investment would be required to maintain safe and reliable operations and comply with environmental regulations,” TVA wrote in an environmental review. “Operation beyond 2026 would also inject operational risk back into the TVA system due to the deteriorating condition of the coal units.”

So, why would TVA now say it is considering keeping its coal plants running longer?

The U.S. ‘national energy emergency’

President Donald Trump declared a “national energy emergency” on his first day in office.

This was not an effort to mitigate the climate crisis. The Trump administration purged those words from government websites, and reduced or cut scientific reports, data tools like the “billion-dollar disasters” database, and scientists from the federal workforce.

The Senate will also soon consider the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which would repeal tax credits for clean energy development in the nation’s first big climate law — which has a special provision for the Tennessee Valley Authority — and incentives for consumer purchases on items like electric vehicles and solar water heaters. The new bill threatens the national trend: Solar, wind and batteries were forecasted to make up 93% of new electric generation this year. (However, that isn’t the Tennessee trend.)

Trump instead wants to boost fossil fuel production. Many of his executive orders aim to expedite oil and gas projects and reduce regulations on pollution.

For context, the U.S. became the world’s largest producer of gas in 2011, surpassing Russia, and the largest producer of oil in 2018, surpassing Saudi Arabia. The nation reached record fossil fuel production under Biden. Some scientists and environmentalists say the U.S. is now, under Trump, a “petrostate.”

Trump also wants to salvage the declining coal industry, which may partially explain TVA’s willingness to open the conversation on extensions.

“Much of this is a political discussion that TVA is having publicly to send a signal to the Trump administration that they’re responding to some of Trump’s desires,” Smith, the director, said.

Coal use has been waning for over a decade, largely due to cheaper options like gas and renewables. Nearly all coal plants in the U.S. are more expensive to run than the cost of building renewable replacements, according to a 2023 study by Energy Innovation, without factoring in tax credits or environmental regulations.

More coal was retired during Trump’s first administration than during the Biden presidency or Obama’s second term.

Although coal remains the dirtiest fuel for energy, Smith said, Trump has created a pathway for delays.

“We’re seeing lots of things starting to slip in the wrong direction,” Smith said. “The environment doesn’t care about politics. The physics are going to happen, and that’s what we’re most worried about.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a1e79d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+115/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2Ff4%2F5c6ac10e4f8687e1c28fb351add0%2Fcumberland-tva-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 02:04:55.790005

Chiseling away at President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Rolling back the green energy tax breaks from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

At its core, the Republican “big, beautiful bill” is more than just an extension of tax breaks approved during President Donald Trump’s first term at the White House.

The package is an attempt by Republicans to undo, little by little, the signature domestic achievements of the past two Democratic presidents.

“We're going to do what we said we were going to do,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after House passage last month.

While the aim of the sprawling 1,000-page plus bill is to preserve an estimated $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that would otherwise expire at year's end if Congress fails to act — and add some new ones, including no taxes on tips — the spending cuts pointed at the Democratic-led programs are causing the most political turmoil.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this week that 10.9 million fewer people would have health insurance under the GOP bill, including 1.4 million immigrants in the U.S. without legal status who are in state-funded programs. At the same time, lawmakers are being hounded by businesses in states across the nation who rely on the green energy tax breaks for their projects.

As the package moves from the House to the Senate, the simmering unrest over curbing the Obama and Biden policies shows just how politically difficult it can be to slash government programs once they become part of civic life.

""When he asked me, what do you think the prospects are for passage in the Senate? I said, good — if we don't cut Medicaid,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., recounting his conversation last week with Trump. “And he said, I'm 100% supportive of that.”

Health care worries

READ:

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

Not a single Republican in Congress voted for the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in 2010, or Biden’s inflation act in 2022. Both were approved using the same budget reconciliation process now being employed by Republicans to steamroll Trump's bill past the opposition.

Even still, sizable coalitions of GOP lawmakers are forming to protect aspects of both of those programs as they ripple into the lives of millions of Americans.

Hawley, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and others are wary of changes to Medicaid and other provisions in the bill that would result in fewer people being able to access health care programs.

At the same time, crossover groupings of House and Senate Republicans have launched an aggressive campaign to preserve, at least for some time, the green energy tax breaks that business interests in their states are relying on to develop solar, wind and other types of energy production.

Murkowski said one area she's ""worried about” is the House bill's provision that any project not under construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law may no longer be eligible for those credits.

“These are some of the things we’re working on,” she said.

The concerns are running in sometimes opposite directions and complicating the work of GOP leaders who have almost no votes to spare in the House and Senate as they try to hoist the package over Democratic opposition and onto the president’s desk by the Fourth of July.

While some Republicans are working to preserve the programs from cuts, the budget hawks want steeper reductions to stem the nation's debt load. The CBO said the package would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the decade.

After a robust private meeting with Trump at the White House this week, Republican senators said they were working to keep the bill on track as they amend it for their own priorities.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the president “made the pitch and the argument for why we need to get the bill done.""

The disconnect is reminiscent of Trump’s first term, when Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, only to see their effort collapse in dramatic fashion when the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, voted thumbs down for the bill on the House floor.

Battle over Medicaid

In the 15 years since Obamacare became law, access to health care has grown substantially. Some 80 million people are now enrolled in Medicaid, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reports 41 states have opted to expand their coverage. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to all adults with incomes up to about $21,500 for an individual, or almost $29,000 for a two-person household.

While Republicans no longer campaign on ending Obamacare, advocates warn that the changes proposed in the big bill will trim back at access to health care.

The bill proposes new 80 hours of monthly work or community service requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, age 18 to 64, with some exceptions. It also imposes twice-a-year eligibility verification checks and other changes.

Republicans argue that they want to right-size Medicaid to root out waste, fraud and abuse and ensure it’s there for those who need it most, often citing women and children.

“Medicaid was built to be a temporary safety net for people who genuinely need it — young, pregnant women, single mothers, the disabled, the elderly,” Johnson told The Associated Press.

“But when when they expanded under Obamacare, it not only thwarted the purpose of the program, it started draining resources.”

Initially, the House bill proposed starting the work requirements in January 2029, as Trump's term in the White House would be coming to a close. But conservatives from the House Freedom Caucus negotiated for a quicker start date, in December 2026, to start the spending reductions sooner.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has said the changes are an Obamacare rollback by another name.

“It decimates our health care system, decimates our clean energy system,” Schumer of New York said in an interview with the AP.

The green energy tax breaks involve not only those used by buyers of electric vehicles, like Elon Musk's Tesla line, but also the production and investment tax credits for developers of renewables and other energy sources.

The House bill had initially proposed a phaseout of those credits over the next several years.

While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.","WASHINGTON (States Newsroom) — Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.

While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by State Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.

Trump vowed in early April to “supercharge our domestic industrial base.”

“Jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,” he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.

But as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.

Critics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.

They have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

U.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.

Kevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.

“We’re just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we’ll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,” Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.

Doffling’s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.

Moving away from fossil fuels

The suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.

For example, the IRA’s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output.

Battery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.

Most credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.

A group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam” — echoing Trump’s rhetoric — pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.

The House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled “foreign entities of concern,” making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.

The legislation also repeals “transferability,” which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.

For example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.

Schneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals “reflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.”

Silfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.

Investment soared

Spurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.

Of the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.

The credit spurred a “sea change” in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.

Despite solar technology’s roots in the U.S., the nation “didn’t even have a toe” in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.

“But after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,” Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.

Active manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association’s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.

The renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.

Active solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.

Advanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.

But various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country — for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.

Lithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.

China largely dominates the world’s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.

When accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 — including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits — just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power’s 2024 report on clean energy employment.

Troy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.

“​​We’re getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,” said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.

“What troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can’t get anything done, and that’s been very difficult to deal with,” he said.

Industry slowdown

The industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.

Six announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor’s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.

Van Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.

“We had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,” Van Beek said. “And when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.”

Van Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.

Several companies declined States Newsroom’s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.

Spencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.

“Whether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you’re doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,” said Pederson, the association’s senior vice president of public affairs.

Too expensive, Republicans say

Some House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits — for example by removing the “overly prescriptive” restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.

Kiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that “the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.”

Her co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.

Far-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company’s ability to transfer credits.

The right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the “commonsense changes” championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.

The organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.

“The longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it’s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,” Thomas Aiello, NTU’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.

Hope in the Senate?

But representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.

Jeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that “The Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.”

Pederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are “particularly restrictive coming out of the House.”

“So we’re hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,” Pederson said.

Doffling believes senators have a “longer term vision” of the nation’s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.

“They see what’s happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,” Doffling said.

The House bill just sets the U.S. “further behind,” he added. “This bill is all about going backwards in time and hoping for the best.”

“I wish they could look at the numbers and understand the economic impacts it’s gonna have. … But somehow we’re talking about the fact of hamstringing a whole entire industry itself over verbiage of the word ‘clean.’”",https://nowhabersham.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/solar-panels.png,N,,2025-06-07 20:03:08.165927

In addition to the Orange Grove project, it is currently constructing another solar farm just southeast of Abilene, Texas.
The Sequoia Solar project is expected to have a capacity of around 815MW, making it one of the largest solar arrays in the US, when completed.

The project comprises approximately 300,000 solar panels across 920 acres and will deliver energy into the Texas ERCOT grid.

AT&T will purchase the environmental attributes associated with the project to support a reduction in its carbon footprint and stabilize its long-term energy costs. The virtual PPA was initially signed last year and is now in force following the successful commissioning of the project.

Commenting on the project's energization, Matthew Akman, EVP of corporate strategy and president of its power business, stated: “We are pleased to be able to deliver additional zero-emission electricity into the grid in support of local and Texas state-wide economic growth and energy demand.”

Enbridge is predominantly known as a midstream natural gas pipeline firm, owning a vast network of pipelines across North America, which transports around 20 percent of all natural gas consumed in the US.

Over recent years, it has attempted to diversify its energy mix through investments in a range of low-carbon technologies. In addition to the Orange Grove project, it is currently constructing another solar farm just southeast of Abilene, Texas. The Sequoia Solar project is expected to have a capacity of around 815MW, making it one of the largest solar arrays in the US, when completed.

Despite its foray into the solar sector, the company very much remains focused on its fossil fuel production, and considers the growth of data center capacity in the US a real opportunity for the company. Speaking to DCD earlier this year, Caitlin Tessin, VP of market innovation and Gulf Coast at Enbridge, stated: “Natural gas is the only really scalable baseload option for data centers to meet short-term increases in power demand.”

The PPA with Enbridge is the latest for AT&T, which is increasingly prioritising renewable energy generation as a means to achieve its goal of carbon neutrality across its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035.

That bill drawing the oil industry's ire is now headed for a key vote this weekend.
Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, said he's known Gov.
The office, which has oversight that includes oil and gas, oil field cleanup, and groundwater pumping and injection, has its own commissioner who reports directly to the governor.
""So, there's no increased restrictions as it relates to water in this bill,"" Gray added.","Gov. Jeff Landry turned heads this week when he accused the oil-and-gas industry of ""hypocrisy"" in a dispute over a bill making its way through the state Legislature. That bill drawing the oil industry's ire is now headed for a key vote this weekend.

The comments from the Republican governor came in defense of a sprawling bill that includes changes to how the state and its courts deal with a class of oil field cleanup litigation known as ""legacy"" lawsuits.

The bill, SB 244 by Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, was originally intended to make changes to the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources with the aim of making the oil and gas regulator more efficient.

But as it advanced, it picked up amendments attempting to revive stalled bills on carbon capture and legacy suits. The legacy amendment has added heat to what might otherwise have been a relatively staid measure in governmental tinkering.

Critics on various sides of the legacy issue charge the amendment language has inserted unconstitutional provisions that would work to the detriment of either landowners looking to clean up old messes or oil companies seeking to avoid the cost of the cleanup from long-gone drillers.

Those changes came in a 53-item amendment adopted Tuesday that led various legislators to characterize it as under-cooked or inept. State Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, compared it to an unqualified mechanic.

""He just takes all his tools, and he throws (them) at your engine and says, ... 'I'm gonna fix it. There you go,'"" said Orgeron.

The bill is headed to a final House vote Sunday and legislators like Orgeron are expected to add more amendments to the more than 200-page legislation.

Sen. Eddie Lambert, who's been in the Legislature for 22 years and played a role in writing that legacy language opposed by oil and gas interests, said there's ""no telling"" where things will end up Sunday night, though he expected the bill would get out of the House.

""Now what language it has on it, will it be acceptable to the governor, does it wind up in conference, that's all to be determined,"" said Lambert, a Republican from Gonzales.

He added that moving the bill to conference, where a select group of the House and Senate hash out final language, could mean more late amendments with little time to review them.

""You'll have a lot of people very nervous, and that could cause problems with passing it,"" Lambert said.

The 'crux' of the issue

What has stirred opposition from oil and gas interests is a proposal that could leave companies on the hook to pay for cleanups after they sell an oil and gas field to another driller. Current indemnification rules are meant to ensure that the new drilling companies agree to assume the cost of any cleanup from past drilling.

Though industry advocates say these rules that are regularly built into lease contracts are critical to enticing the state's lagging oil rig activity on land, Sen. Lambert views it as passing the buck. As Gov. Landry said Tuesday, it sits at the core of the legacy suit issue.

Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, said he's known Gov. Landry for 20 years and knows he wants ""to pass legacy reform."" Moncla said he spoke with the governor after the legislative hearing on Tuesday morning where governor made the ""hypocritical"" comment.

""From conversations with him Tuesday afternoon, I think he recognizes the unconstitutionality of the anti-indemnity language. We are working together on language to move industry forward,"" Moncla said.

The Governor's Office didn't immediately respond to an email for comment Friday.

'A foundation' for the future

Some aspects of the bill haven't been controversial, including changing the department's name to the ""Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy.""

SB 244 would also create a special commission made up of the state's various agencies to consider how new laws and economic development projects affect the state's natural resources. The commission would serve as an information hub and provide a unified front to counter unwanted congressional changes and pursue federal grant dollars, agency officials have said.

DENR Secretary Tyler Gray told legislators earlier this month this new panel, the Natural Resources Commission, would formalize lines of communication among the agencies.

The bill would also strengthen the state's role in overseeing groundwater. Gray explained that, as the state considers steel, data center and other economic projects, it will need to plan for critical resources like water.

That involves greater data gathering on water use, though not by greater regulation of its use, Gray said.

""We’re looking to build a foundation to make sure that we can inventory and be prepared for the future. Water and power are the two most important components of economic development. Louisiana visibly has a lot of (water), so we want to make sure we're in a place where we can negotiate, not necessarily regulate, but negotiate with other states,"" Gray told legislators.

The bill would also more fully consolidate power in the hands of the secretary by eliminating the state Office of Conservation, a semi-independent agency that dates to the early 1900s.

The office, which has oversight that includes oil and gas, oil field cleanup, and groundwater pumping and injection, has its own commissioner who reports directly to the governor.

Natural resources officials have told legislators the reason that SB 244 is more than 200 pages is that legal provisions that give authority to the commissioner of conservation are being shifted to the department secretary.

Keith Hall, an LSU professor who specializes in energy law, said the office was put inside the department when state government was reorganized in the mid-1970s. But Hall said he suspected that even with the consolidation, day-to-day operations wouldn't change much because so much is handled by staff.

Groundwater raises concerns

These bureaucratic changes, however, haven't been without some lower-level controversies, in particular, for areas of the state, like Baton Rouge, where groundwater use is already a closely followed issue.

An earlier version of the bill had proposed bringing the Capital Area Groundwater Commission in Baton Rouge and another groundwater district in north Louisiana that oversees the Sparta aquifer fully under the department and making them advisory panels only.

Later changes brought them back out from under the department, but the bill kept some of the Baton Rouge commission's regulatory language that included requiring meters on groundwater wells and also left out longstanding exemptions for agricultural wells.

Gray and Hensgens had to assure rural legislators that meters aren't being required and that the exemption omission was an error, with Hensgens reminding a House panel that he's from a family of sixth-generation rice farmers who rely on groundwater.

""So, there's no increased restrictions as it relates to water in this bill,"" Gray added.

At the same time, environmental advocates who have pressed the Baton Rouge groundwater panel to take a stronger hand in regulating the capital region's aquifer to stem saltwater intrusion say the bill still grants the state exclusive authority over groundwater.

Kathy Wascom, a board member for the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, said the current bill puts the commission, which has been an independent regulator for 50 years, in an unsettled position.

""It still leaves a real gray area,"" she said.

In an interview, Gray said that the portion of the bill remains an area in need of work.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/11/211e1995-b25e-5fd9-9088-f887f2894e46/6837429474f82.image.jpg?crop=1715%2C900%2C0%2C32&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-07 21:06:36.824712

The award, presented to standout solar adopters, recognizes efforts to transition to clean energy and contribute to sustainability while generating economic benefits.

This year’s honorees included a diverse group of organizations ranging from businesses and nonprofits to schools and religious institutions. Notable recipients included the University of Pittsburgh, the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum, and Hess Brothers Fruit Company. Each awardee was recognized for their unique approach to solar integration, with several highlighting substantial cost savings that allowed reinvestment into their missions and operations.

Sharon Pillar, Founder and Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Solar Center, lauded the awardees’ leadership. “Solar is becoming an increasingly big player in the energy landscape across the country, thanks to its cost-efficiency and sustainability,” she said during the event. Pillar urged lawmakers to prioritize solar-friendly policies, emphasizing the potential to create thousands of jobs and accelerate economic growth in Pennsylvania.

Among the featured speakers, Cindy Dunn, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), delivered the keynote. “The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is using solar energy as part of our broader commitment to sustainably managing the Commonwealth’s natural spaces,” she said. Dunn emphasized the environmental and public benefits of solar expansion, commending the honorees’ efforts to drive adoption forward.

The economic gains associated with solar energy were central to the celebration. NEPA Youth Shelter’s Maureen Maher-Gray shared that solar panel installation will save the nonprofit nearly $78,856 over 25 years, providing funds to expand vital community services. Similarly, the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum highlighted $65,000 in annual utility savings thanks to its photovoltaic systems, enabling more resources for educational programming.

Solar energy, identified as the fastest-growing energy source nationwide, has empowered entities like the University of Pittsburgh to reduce operating costs and expand sustainability initiatives. The university reported that its new rooftop solar arrays on campus buildings would deliver annual electricity savings exceeding $25,000.

Awardees also highlighted solar projects’ environmental importance. Chuck Rakaczky of St. Teresa of Kolkata Parish noted that their solar panels align with a commitment to protecting the environment while redirecting savings into social outreach programs. “Our Parish is proud to be the first in the Diocese of Pittsburgh to commit to the goal of protecting our common home with our solar panel project,” he said.

As the event concluded, participants voiced optimism for Pennsylvania’s solar future, stressing the need for state policies to advance large-scale adoption.

Plans include pool parties, barbecues and vacations.

Some plans will account for summer heat. Air conditioning and other tools will be increasingly used to keep homes cool.

This increased electricity demand means that our electric grid will be under greater stress.

We are already hearing of potential breaking points this summer in our electric grid.

The Friday before Memorial Day, Energy Secretary Wright issued an emergency order directing the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) to ensure a coal-fired power plant in Michigan remained operational.

Wright issued the order to minimize the risk of blackouts ahead of the high electricity demand expected.

New Orleans is part of MISO, a regional grid operator that provides transmission service to all or part of 15 U.S. states as well as Manitoba, Canada.

Notwithstanding keeping the plant open, the New Orleans metro area suffered a large and unexpected power outage during Memorial Day weekend. At the blackout’s peak, more than 100,000 customers lost electricity.

According to news website Axios, utilities were aware of the strain on the grid for at least 48 hours before the disruption.

Reports confirmed that two of the region’s nuclear power plants lost connection to the grid. One was due to expected maintenance, the other was unexpected. Constrained by a lack of energy supply, grid operators cut power to customers in New Orleans.

Entergy, an electric utility company in the region, said that the forced outages directed by MISO were done to prevent a larger scale and more prolonged power outage from impacting the electric grid.

This blackout was not the only major power outage in recent memory.

On April 28, Portugal and Spain witnessed the worst blackout in their history, affecting 55 million people, per British newspaper The Guardian.

Airports were shut down, cars drove on streets without traffic lights, hospitals resorted to backup generators and some people were stuck in elevators!

While the Iberian Peninsula blackout continues to be investigated, it is interesting to note that on April 16, Spain reported its first weekday where its national power grid was 100% reliant on renewable power.

A coincidence? Maybe, maybe not!

Coincidentally, in a recent Virginia Tech press release, professor and Power and Energy Center director Dr. Ali Mehrizi-Sani highlighted how the systems that control these clean energy sources are more susceptible to blackouts.

As parts of the world transition to renewable energy sources like wind and solar, the lack of seamless grid adaptation to the use of these sources, as illustrated by the blackout in Spain and Portugal and by experts like Dr. Mehrizi-Sani, threatens destabilization of electric grids and more blackouts.

For years in Congress, I actively warned about the threats posed by leftist policies that attempted to gut our grid’s reliance on fossil fuels and convert to renewables.

Federal policies, like the Obama-era “War on Coal” and the Biden Administration’s so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), shunning reliable baseload forms of energy like coal and natural gas have made our electric grid more vulnerable to failure.

California’s reliance on renewables continues to subject residents to rolling brownouts. California has since, seemingly, mitigated the issue, but accordingly has one of the highest electricity rates in the country.

In 2013, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced plans to close eight coal-fired power units, citing a flat demand for power.

They have already closed five, but have opened several natural gas power plants.

TVA customers have experienced rolling brownouts as energy demand increases.

I have already introduced a bill this year to help improve our electric grid.

H.R. 3632, the Power Plant Reliability Act of 2025, allows states and regional grid operators to delay proposed closures of baseload power plants forced on them by state or federal mandates and regulations until a reliability solution is implemented.

This bill was passed by the House Energy Subcommittee on June 5.

There are also elements of the House reconciliation bill that support our electric grid.

In the House bill, we curtail some IRA tax credits, which disincentivize coal and natural gas power plants. We kept the incentives for nuclear because of its significant potential for baseload power.

We also create an energy project insurance pool to help protect energy investors from permits being revoked for coal, oil, critical minerals, natural gas or nuclear installations.

This de-risking compensation fund will make it harder for federal policies to discourage and phase out these reliable sources of energy.

I will continue advocating for reliable energy solutions that secure America’s electric power grid!

High battery maintenance costs, high purchase prices, and concerns about range continue to be major deterrents for U.S. consumers to consider buying an EV, according to AAA’s latest survey released earlier this month.

These key barriers have remained more or less the same in recent years.

But this year three other factors have also played a role to result in the smallest share of American drivers considering an EV purchase—lower gasoline prices, the increasingly uncertain future of EV incentives such as tax credits and rebates, and politics.

Only 16% of U.S. adults reported in AAA’s 2025 survey that they are “very likely” or “likely” to purchase a fully EV as their next car. This compares to 25% in 2022, when gasoline prices of $5 per gallon incentivized more buyers to consider an EV purchase.

This year, the percentage of consumers indicating they would be “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to purchase an EV rose to 63%, up from 51% last year.

“While the automotive industry is committed to long-term electrification and providing a diverse range of models, underlying consumer hesitation remains,” said Greg Brannon, director of automotive engineering for AAA.

Consumers cited high battery repair costs and purchase prices as key barriers to go fully electric, at 62% and 59%, respectively. Other top concerns identified in this year’s survey were the perceived unsuitability of EVs for long-distance travel (57%), a lack of convenient public charging stations (56%), and fear of running out of charge while driving (55%).

Other barriers cited by the Americans unlikely to buy an EV include safety concerns cited by 31%, challenges installing charging stations at their residences for 27%, and 12% who are concerned that the tax credits and rebates will be reduced or eliminated.

Saving on gasoline costs is a key reason for interest in EVs this year—77% of Americans likely to buy an EV cited gas savings as their top motivation to purchase.

The reason, of course, is quite simple. Gasoline prices this spring hit their lowest level ahead of Memorial Day weekend in four years. A large part of the strong demand over Memorial Day weekend was due to the fact that the typical seasonal spike in the spring didn’t materialize, because oil prices – the single-biggest driver of gasoline prices—have lingered in the low $60s per barrel for weeks.

Uncertainty about incentives for EV purchases has started to play a larger role in drivers’ hesitancy to consider fully-electric vehicle purchases. Interest in EVs to take advantage of tax credits and rebates has plummeted—from 60% of those saying last year they are likely to buy an EV to 39% this year, per the AAA survey.

Moreover, fewer Americans now believe that most passenger cars would be EVs within a decade. The share of U.S. drivers who believe that most cars will be electric within the next ten years has plunged from 40% in 2022 to 23% this year.

Despite the fact that the availability of EV models in the U.S. market has soared in recent years, with many legacy carmakers seeking to compete with Tesla, Americans remain hesitant about purchasing electric cars.

Public perception about the future of EVs remains uncertain, AAA says, despite the more than 75 EV models introduced in the past four years.

For many drivers, hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles could be more appealing than full battery EVs as they combine the advantages of traditional internal combustion engines with electric power, reducing range anxiety while providing an environmentally friendly alternative, AAA says.

The legislation fulfills several of Trump's campaign promises, including making his 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminating taxes on tipsand overtime for workers earning less than $160,000 annually, while also cutting green energy tax credits and increasing the SALT deduction cap to $40,000.

Major tax cuts and changes in the Big Beautiful Bill

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents one of the most comprehensive tax reform packages in years, with provisions affecting virtually every American taxpayer and business. The bill would make permanent the tax rates established under Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which are currently set to expire at the end of 2025. This would maintain the 37% top individual income tax rate rather than allowing it to revert to the previous 39.6% rate.

Among the most notable aspects of the legislation is the fulfillment of Trump's campaign promise to eliminate federal income taxes on tips for workers making less than $160,000 annually. The same income threshold would apply to a similar exemption for overtime pay, with no cap on how much overtime compensation workers could claim as tax-free. Both tax breaks would expire at the end of 2028, after Trump's term ends.

The bill also significantly increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for joint filers earning less than $500,000 per year, with the cap increasing by 1% annually. This change would particularly benefit taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and California, though Senate Majority Leader John Thune has indicated the higher cap may not survive Senate consideration.

Green energy rollbacks and other significant changes

The Big Beautiful Bill takes direct aim at several key components of President Biden's green energy agenda by eliminating or significantly reducing tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act. Homeowners would lose tax credits worth 30% of the cost for solar panels, wind turbines, and energy-efficient improvements like windows and heat pumps.

Electric vehicle incentives face complete elimination under the bill, ending tax credits of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used ones. The legislation also terminates tax incentives for homes and businesses installing EV charging stations, with all these green energy provisions ending at the conclusion of this year if the bill becomes law.

Other significant tax changes include removing the $200 excise tax on gun silencers that has been in place since 1934-a major victory for the National Rifle Association-and repealing the 10% excise tax on indoor tanning services that was implemented as part of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.

The bill would also create ""Trump savings accounts"" for parents to open for their newborn children, with a contribution limit of $5,000 per year. The government would provide an initial deposit of $1,000 for each newborn child.

On the education front, the legislation cuts $330 billion from student loan programs over the next decade and establishes an income-based ""Repayment Assistance Plan"" as the new standard for student loans. It also modifies the Pell Grant program by increasing the number of required credits per semester for low-income students.

According to analysis from the Tax Foundation, the major tax provisions in the bill would lead to a 0.8 percent long-run expansion of the economy, with the creation of approximately 983,000 full-time equivalent jobs. However, the bill would also increase the federal budget deficit by $2.6 trillion over ten years before accounting for interest costs, or $1.7 trillion when considering potential economic growth.",https://phantom-marca.uecdn.es/d83ddeea28d2969ca9c036f2ca947d31/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2025/06/07/17493111343641.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 22:03:59.281625

In a major step forward for renewable energy, China has just unveiled the world’s largest floating wind turbine, named Qihang, which promises to set new standards in clean energy generation and is making waves in the global energy market. This technological marvel is expected to drastically reduce carbon emissions and redefine how we approach offshore wind power.

A Technological Marvel: The Largest Floating Wind Turbine

The Qihang turbine, developed by China Railway Construction Corporation (CRRC), represents a monumental leap in wind energy technology. With a 20 MW capacity, it is the largest of its kind to date, boasting a rotor diameter of 853 feet—that’s about seven football fields long! For comparison, the Qihang far surpasses previous prototypes, like Envision Energy’s 16.7 MW turbine, offering far greater power and efficiency.

This giant turbine’s impressive scale isn’t the only thing that sets it apart. Its design and performance capabilities make it a formidable player in the global push for clean energy. The turbine’s massive blades rotate at speeds that rival high-speed trains, generating enough electricity in a single rotation to power a household for up to four days. This is a perfect example of how wind energy can evolve from just a renewable source to an efficient and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

Overcoming Challenges in Construction and Transportation

Building the Qihang was no small feat. The project faced numerous logistical challenges, especially when it came to transporting the massive turbine parts. Constructed in Sheyang, Jiangsu in October 2024, the turbine was carefully moved from the Sheyang Port to Guangli Port using self-propelled modular transport units, a method that ensured the structural integrity of the turbine as it was relocated to the Shandong Dongying testing and certification base.

On January 11th, after overcoming numerous obstacles, the turbine was installed at its designated test site. Thanks to innovations in modular system design, advanced control technologies, and typhoon-resistance features, the turbine can now withstand extreme weather conditions, ensuring its stability even in harsh marine environments.

Environmental and Energy Impact

The Qihang isn’t just about big numbers and bold innovation—it’s about real environmental impact. This turbine is designed to save approximately 27,500 tons of coal every year, making a significant contribution to carbon emissions reduction. By cutting out reliance on fossil fuels, it will decrease carbon emissions by 68,500 tons annually, making a tangible difference in the fight against climate change.

As the world continues to battle rising temperatures, the need for sustainable energy solutions has never been more urgent. With this advancement, China is positioning itself as a leader in offshore wind technology, reinforcing its commitment to clean energy while helping to power the future with renewable sources.

The Qihang will also play a key role in stabilizing the energy grid by storing excess power generated during times of high wind or low demand, allowing it to be distributed when needed. This addresses a major challenge in the renewable energy sector—how to manage intermittency and maintain a steady power supply.

China’s Role in the Global Energy Transition

China has already surpassed the UK to become the world’s largest producer of offshore wind energy. With this new addition to its arsenal of renewable technologies, the country is poised to expand its reach even further, particularly in the European market, where demand for clean energy is growing at an accelerated pace.

The success of the Qihang turbine is only one example of how China’s investments in research and development are giving it a strategic edge in the energy transition. Companies like CRRC and Mingyang Wind Power are continuously pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, and as offshore wind power becomes more advanced, these technologies are likely to make a major impact on global energy markets.

The Economic Benefits of Innovation

Aside from its environmental benefits, the Qihang turbine represents a significant economic opportunity for China. By reducing fossil fuel import costs and creating new jobs in the renewable energy sector, the turbine contributes to a more resilient and sustainable economy. In addition, it strengthens China’s position in the increasingly competitive global energy market.

China’s focus on modular systems, component reusability, and long-term efficiency in wind energy projects is driving the development of more cost-effective and innovative solutions that will likely serve as models for future projects across the globe.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Renewable Energy

The Qihang turbine represents the future of offshore wind technology—an innovation that not only benefits the energy sector but also serves as a crucial tool in the global battle against climate change. As countries look to reduce carbon footprints and shift to sustainable energy, projects like these will pave the way for a greener, cleaner future.

As China continues to lead the charge in wind energy innovation, the impact of the Qihang will reverberate across the globe. It marks a new chapter in renewable energy technology, showcasing how technological advancements can provide sustainable solutions to our most pressing environmental challenges.

But one thing is clear — the narrative of India’s energy story has changed.","On June 9, 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will complete 11 years in office — a milestone that not only marks political continuity but also signifies a decade of deep-rooted reforms across key sectors. Among these, India’s energy sector stands out as one of the most dynamically transformed areas, reflecting a bold shift toward sustainability, innovation, and self-reliance.

When Modi first took oath in 2014, the energy landscape of India was vastly different. Import dependency was high, renewable energy was still a developing conversation, and technologies like green hydrogen were not yet in the mainstream narrative. Fast forward to today, and India is well on its way to becoming a global player in clean energy transition — thanks to ambitious policies, record investments, and structural reforms led from the front by the Prime Minister.

A Vision for Energy Independence and Sustainability

Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, summed up the journey when he recently said:

""Alternative sources of energy are playing an important role in India’s quest towards green energy transition as we provide momentum to efforts to achieve energy security under the guidance and leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""

This vision has been about more than just adding megawatts of renewable energy to the grid — it’s been about reshaping the fundamentals of India’s energy economy. From decarbonising the fuel mix to encouraging innovation in energy storage, and from launching pioneering missions to rethinking public sector roles, the energy transition under Modi has evolved into a national movement.

Green Hydrogen: India’s Bet on the Future

At the heart of this transformation is the National Green Hydrogen Mission — India’s bold initiative to become a hub for green hydrogen production, application, and export.

The government has taken a comprehensive approach to build this ecosystem from scratch. The four major verticals — production, transportation, storage, and application — are being simultaneously developed with stakeholder engagement at every level.

Nine R&D and pilot demonstration plants are in progress across India. Of these, four have already been commissioned by major PSUs like Indian Oil Corporation, GAIL, HPCL, and BPCL. These early-stage projects are not only showcasing India’s technological readiness but are also laying the groundwork for future commercial-scale deployment of green hydrogen.

Massive Public Sector Push and Financial Commitment

The energy transition is not just a policy idea — it’s being backed by real investment. Public sector refineries alone have floated green hydrogen tenders worth 42 KTPA (kilo tonnes per annum). An additional 128 tenders are lined up, contingent upon the performance and outcomes of the initial ones.

What’s even more striking is the scale of funding involved — a projected investment of ₹2 lakh crore (approx. $24 billion) is being mobilised to fuel this new green industrial wave. This is not only expected to drive innovation but also generate thousands of green jobs, stimulate new-age startups, and attract global attention to India’s green capabilities.

A Broader Clean Energy Vision

While green hydrogen is a flagship mission, the energy reforms under Modi’s government go far beyond it.

Renewable energy capacity has seen exponential growth, with solar and wind installations putting India among the top global producers.

Schemes like PM-KUSUM, which promotes solar power in agriculture, have empowered rural India while reducing fossil fuel use.

The bio-energy ecosystem has expanded with incentives for compressed biogas and ethanol blending, creating new business opportunities.

The expansion of city gas distribution, LNG terminal infrastructure, and natural gas pipelines is creating a cleaner fuel economy.

Electrification of remote villages and the reduction in power transmission losses have brought reliable energy to the last mile.

From rural households to startup boardrooms, the shift towards clean and inclusive energy access has created ripples across every stakeholder group.

Startups, Innovation & the Green Economy

For India’s startup ecosystem, this energy transition has opened up massive innovation potential. Whether it’s green hydrogen storage, EV battery tech, solar module manufacturing, or smart grid analytics — the energy sector is no longer dominated only by legacy players.

Clean tech startups, deep-tech energy innovators, and sustainability-led platforms are now finding fertile ground to experiment, grow, and scale. The government’s policy support and funding ecosystem — from production-linked incentives (PLIs) to R&D grants — is directly influencing this startup surge in energy innovation.

Looking Ahead: A Green Roadmap for India’s Future

As PM Modi steps into his 12th year in office, the conversation is no longer about whether energy reforms will work — it's about how fast India can scale them. The foundations have been laid, pilot projects are live, and investor confidence is robust.

Yet, challenges remain. Balancing energy demand with environmental goals, making clean technologies affordable, and ensuring inclusive participation in the energy economy will require continuous effort.

But one thing is clear — the narrative of India’s energy story has changed. From being a passive consumer, India is now scripting its role as a global energy innovator.

Ranked: The Largest Electricity Producers in the World

China generated over 10,000 TWh of electricity in 2024.

For context, that’s more than the combined output of the U.S., EU, and India—the next three biggest producers.

Note: EU’s latest figure is from 2023.

China’s rapid rise in electricity generation fueled its equally rapid economic growth. In fact, research found that 1% increase in its electricity production corresponded to 0.17% increase in GDP (but not vice-versa).

However, in 2015 the Chinese government mandated a dual control policy to power generation. This meant reducing energy intensity by forcing shutdowns along with developing renewable sources to curb their emissions.

For reference, China also produces the most wind and solar energy in the world.

Why China Generates & Consumes More Electricity Than U.S.

If electricity generation (and consumption) correspond so closely to economic growth, then why is China still the second-largest economy in the world when it’s far outpaced the U.S. in power production?

The answer lies in how electricity is consumed in each country. Data from the IEA shows that industry is the primary consumer for China’s electricity.

CountryMain Consumption SectorShare of Total Electricity Use 🇨🇳 ChinaIndustry59% 🇺🇸 U.S.Residential38%

On the other hand, America’s primary electricity consumers are residential homes.

A quick reminder that over the last two decades, manufacturing and heavy industries (with the exception of oil and gas production) have moved to China from the rest of the world, driving its extraordinary economic growth.

Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is powered by consumption of goods and high-value services, both which aren’t as energy-intensive as manufacturing.

Thus, China needs more to power itself because of its economic structure, and not only because it has more people.

The House bill had initially proposed a phaseout of those credits over the next several years.","Washington — Chiseling away at President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Rolling back the green energy tax breaks from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

At its core, the Republican “big, beautiful bill” is more than just an extension of tax breaks approved during President Donald Trump’s first term at the White House.

The package is an attempt by Republicans to undo, little by little, the signature domestic achievements of the past two Democratic presidents.

“We're going to do what we said we were going to do,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after House passage last month.

While the aim of the sprawling 1,000-page plus bill is to preserve an estimated $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that would otherwise expire at year's end if Congress fails to act — and add some new ones, including no taxes on tips — the spending cuts pointed at the Democratic-led programs are causing the most political turmoil.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this week that 10.9 million fewer people would have health insurance under the GOP bill, including 1.4 million immigrants in the U.S. without legal status who are in state-funded programs. At the same time, lawmakers are being hounded by businesses in states across the nation who rely on the green energy tax breaks for their projects.

As the package moves from the House to the Senate, the simmering unrest over curbing the Obama and Biden policies shows just how politically difficult it can be to slash government programs once they become part of civic life.

""When he asked me, what do you think the prospects are for passage in the Senate? I said, good — if we don't cut Medicaid,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., recounting his conversation last week with Trump. “And he said, I'm 100% supportive of that.”

Health care worries

Not a single Republican in Congress voted for the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in 2010, or Biden’s inflation act in 2022. Both were approved using the same budget reconciliation process now being employed by Republicans to steamroll Trump's bill past the opposition.

Even still, sizable coalitions of GOP lawmakers are forming to protect aspects of both of those programs as they ripple into the lives of millions of Americans.

Hawley, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and others are wary of changes to Medicaid and other provisions in the bill that would result in fewer people being able to access health care programs.

At the same time, crossover groupings of House and Senate Republicans have launched an aggressive campaign to preserve, at least for some time, the green energy tax breaks that business interests in their states are relying on to develop solar, wind and other types of energy production.

Murkowski said one area she's ""worried about” is the House bill's provision that any project not under construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law may no longer be eligible for those credits.

“These are some of the things we’re working on,” she said.

The concerns are running in sometimes opposite directions and complicating the work of GOP leaders who have almost no votes to spare in the House and Senate as they try to hoist the package over Democratic opposition and onto the president’s desk by the Fourth of July.

While some Republicans are working to preserve the programs from cuts, the budget hawks want steeper reductions to stem the nation's debt load. The CBO said the package would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the decade.

After a robust private meeting with Trump at the White House this week, Republican senators said they were working to keep the bill on track as they amend it for their own priorities.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the president “made the pitch and the argument for why we need to get the bill done.""

The disconnect is reminiscent of Trump’s first term, when Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, only to see their effort collapse in dramatic fashion when the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, voted thumbs down for the bill on the House floor.

Battle over Medicaid

In the 15 years since Obamacare became law, access to health care has grown substantially. Some 80 million people are now enrolled in Medicaid, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reports 41 states have opted to expand their coverage. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to all adults with incomes up to about $21,500 for an individual, or almost $29,000 for a two-person household.

While Republicans no longer campaign on ending Obamacare, advocates warn that the changes proposed in the big bill will trim back at access to health care.

The bill proposes new 80 hours of monthly work or community service requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, age 18 to 64, with some exceptions. It also imposes twice-a-year eligibility verification checks and other changes.

Republicans argue that they want to right-size Medicaid to root out waste, fraud and abuse and ensure it’s there for those who need it most, often citing women and children.

“Medicaid was built to be a temporary safety net for people who genuinely need it — young, pregnant women, single mothers, the disabled, the elderly,” Johnson told The Associated Press.

“But when when they expanded under Obamacare, it not only thwarted the purpose of the program, it started draining resources.”

Initially, the House bill proposed starting the work requirements in January 2029, as Trump's term in the White House would be coming to a close. But conservatives from the House Freedom Caucus negotiated for a quicker start date, in December 2026, to start the spending reductions sooner.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has said the changes are an Obamacare rollback by another name.

“It decimates our health care system, decimates our clean energy system,” Schumer of New York said in an interview with the AP.

The green energy tax breaks involve not only those used by buyers of electric vehicles, like Elon Musk's Tesla line, but also the production and investment tax credits for developers of renewables and other energy sources.

The House bill had initially proposed a phaseout of those credits over the next several years. But again the conservative Freedom Caucus engineered the faster wind-down — within 60 days of the bill's passage.

“Not a single Republican voted for the Green New Scam subsidies,” wrote Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, on social media. “Not a single Republican should vote to keep them.”

“REPEAL THE GREEN NEW SCAM!” reposted Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a Freedom Caucus leader.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/07/PDTN/84093000007-ap-25155612646354.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-07 19:07:44.765247

This is a time for pragmatism, not partisanship — for making decisions that support American workers, American competitiveness and American energy independence.","As someone deeply involved in the construction and economic development industry here in Hampton Roads and across the mid-Atlantic, I’ve witnessed firsthand how federal energy policy can shape the direction of local investment, job creation and long-term economic growth. That’s why I strongly support Rep. Jen Kiggans’ Certainty for our Energy Future Act.

This legislation delivers exactly what businesses, workers and families across Virginia — and across America — need right now: stability, predictability and a path toward energy independence that strengthens our economy.

The premise is simple: By preserving federal energy tax credits that are already on the books, the act gives American businesses the confidence to invest in the future. When companies can plan for the long term, they build more, hire more and take the kinds of risks that lead to innovation and growth.

At MEB, we’ve worked on infrastructure projects across a wide variety of industrial sectors. What our clients want — what our communities need — is the certainty that a project started today will still make economic sense five or 10 years from now. This legislation does exactly that.

It also levels the playing field. Other nations are racing to scale up their energy production and industrial capacity, offering clear, long-term incentives to attract capital and technology. Without similar stability here, the U.S. risks falling behind. The Certainty for our Energy Future Act ensures that American companies stay competitive, not by adding new government programs, but by protecting and reinforcing existing policy that works.

This is smart policy for all sides of the aisle. For Republicans, this bill aligns with the principles of American energy leadership, reduced dependence on foreign sources, and the promotion of private-sector investment over government control. It helps meet our growing power demands without sacrificing fiscal responsibility or economic freedom.

For Democrats, the legislation continues a trajectory of smart, forward-looking investment in energy infrastructure, clean power and job creation. It supports the kind of high-wage, skilled labor jobs that lift working families and revitalize industrial corridors across our country.

In Hampton Roads and throughout Coastal Virginia, we’re already seeing the benefits of energy investment — whether it’s shipbuilding innovation, offshore wind staging or advanced manufacturing. But to sustain and grow that progress, we need the private sector to know the rules won’t change midstream. Predictability fuels confidence, and confidence fuels job creation.

It’s not just about big companies either. Small and mid-sized contractors, like many we partner with, stand to benefit greatly from a stable and growing energy sector. These are the firms hiring local workers, training apprentices and supporting community nonprofits. Their success is directly tied to whether larger-scale investments stay on track.

Kiggans’ bill protects that momentum. It provides a foundation for continued collaboration between the public and private sectors — without picking winners or micromanaging outcomes. Instead, it ensures that if an American company wants to invest in energy innovation, they’ll have the policy framework to do it.

In an era of economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability, energy security is national security. It’s also economic security. The Certainty for our Energy Future Act helps keep energy affordable for families, strengthens America’s supply chains and empowers job creators to keep growing.

I commend Kiggans for her leadership and urge Congress to act quickly to pass this important legislation. This is a time for pragmatism, not partisanship — for making decisions that support American workers, American competitiveness and American energy independence.

Let’s give our businesses the certainty they need to build the future — and let’s make sure that future is powered right here at home.

The utility is asking state regulators to build three new gas-fired power plants at a cost of $3.2 billion plus other transmission infrastructure for an airport-sized facility in Richland Parish. The data center would help Meta – the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp – expand its artificial intelligence technology and compete with rival companies like Google and OpenAI.

Powering the data center would draw more than twice the maximum capacity of New Orleans’ peak summer demand.

Consumer advocacy and environmental nonprofits Alliance for Affordable Energy and the Union for Concerned Scientists urged the Louisiana Public Service Commission to deny Entergy’s request, unless the utility adds more safeguards.

“Investment in Louisiana should benefit local communities where projects are being planned and not burden ratepayers across the state who stand to benefit nothing,” said Logan Burke, the executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy. “Entergy has provided no such assurances.”

Entergy disputes these arguments and stresses that the project will benefit all customers, not just Meta.

“This was a very complicated contract and unlike anything anybody’s negotiated in the industry,"" said Laura Beauchamp, vice president of business operations and strategy at Entergy. “There were gives and takes on both sides, but the overarching goal for us was to make sure our customers had significant benefits and that is the ultimate deal we struck.”

The opposing groups filed testimony in April and Entergy filed rebuttal arguments last week. At this point in the process, the parties typically negotiate their stances with commission staff or, in rare cases, enter a contested hearing. The utility regulators are expected to make a ruling on the proposal later this year.

Major details of the case are hidden from public view, as all parties involved signed nondisclosure agreements. The full capital investment of the projects, the data center's most recent expected power demands, and details of the agreement with Meta are all redacted from publicly available documents.

State officials have lauded Meta’s $10 billion project as a win for economic development in one of the poorest regions of the state. The company announced in December its plan to build the industrial site on agricultural land the size of around 70 football fields. The project is expected to support 300-500 permanent jobs and 5,000 construction workers at peak. It is unclear whether these jobs will go to local residents.

‘Major disruptions’

Because the data center needs so much power, sudden changes in the amount the facility uses could destabilize the grid, according to a technical service consultant supporting the nonprofits. This could be especially troubling for Louisianans, who pay higher-than-average electricity bills and depend on one of the least reliable grids in the country, according to a January report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s Office.

Over Memorial Day weekend, over 100,000 people in the New Orleans area lost power because of forced outages triggered by a constellation of problems with the region’s electric grid.

Nicholas Miller, a technical consultant supporting the nonprofits, argues that Entergy’s proposal may understate the amount of transmission needed and that the utility has not adequately evaluated potential risks.

“If these load fluctuation problems are not adequately addressed, businesses and residents in North Louisiana could face major disruptions to their electric service,” Miller said in his testimony.

As the amount of power used by data centers has skyrocketed in recent years, grid operators in other states are scrambling to avoid data center-induced mass blackouts.

Entergy says the utility has completed extensive modeling to address these concerns. Daniel Kline, an Entergy employee, said in the public filings that the utility proposal “fully accounts for system risks based on the best information at this time.” Beauchamp noted that the new resources will be studied by the regional grid operator.

'Can't dictate to a customer'

Entergy also maintains that regular customers will not pay for most of Meta’s energy needs. The company says that Meta is paying for the full annual revenue of the natural gas-fired plants for 15 years and that the tech company ""will contribute a large percentage of the costs that would otherwise be borne by all of [Entergy's] customers.""

The life of one such plant can exceed 30 years, and the advocacy groups question what will happen if Meta decides to leave after 15. The nonprofits want Meta’s contract with Entergy extended to 25 years to more closely align with the duration of a gas plant. The utility, however, says that even if Meta leaves after the 15-year contract, the plants will be needed as others are retired.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/95/7956670a-6fbe-55e4-bc31-5632691a262e/68017d818f070.image.jpg?crop=1457%2C765%2C0%2C2&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-07 21:06:50.685000

Trump said Musk’s vocal opposition to Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” is based on its elimination of incentives for electric vehicles (EVs).

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

While the bill may not be all bad for Musk – including preserving Trump’s 2017 income tax cuts – it contains significant provisions that impact Musk’s flagship company. It also rolls back green-tax incentives.

Since he’s stepped away of the Trump administration, the entrepreneur has been a vocal critic of the legislation, including lamenting that “there is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

While the House narrowly passed its version of the bill in late May, it is facing hurdles in the Senate, where it is so far losing some momentum.

Here’s a look at the provisions that may be particularly impactful for the company – as well as other electric vehicle and climate-friendly energy companies:

Eliminates EV tax credits

One major way in which the “big, beautiful bill” harms Tesla is by making its cars more expensive.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act lifted a cap allowing manufacturers that had already sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles to once again be eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit. It also extended eligibility for the credit through 2032

The bill effectively made the cars $7,500 cheaper for consumers.

But, the credits are cut in the GOP’s bill. Without that credit, Tesla and other EV makers may make fewer sales. One major hurdle facing the adoption of electric vehicles is that they are oftentimes more expensive than gas-powered cars.

However, Musk has contended when he was supporting Trump that he does not need the tax credit.

Cuts credits for solar energy

Tesla Energy sells both rooftop solar energy and grid scale solar power – both of which are hampered by the Republican bill.

The legislation axes tax credits for rooftop solar after this year.

It also eliminates tax credits for any grid scale project that begins construction more than 60 days after the bill is enacted. Projects also need to begin producing energy by the end of 2028 to become eligible.

These utility scale cuts are controversial even within the GOP and could face changes in the Senate.

Axes Biden-era EV regulations

The legislation would eliminate a Biden-era regulation that forces the electric vehicle market to shift toward EVs.

While Tesla is already all-electric, doing so could still impact its bottom line, as the way the regulations are set up, automakers either have to make their vehicles greener or purchase credits from automakers like Tesla that already outperform the regulations.

If the regulation is weakened, traditional car manufacturers may not have to buy as many credits from EV-makers like Tesla.

However, it’s not clear whether this provision will make it into what’s ultimately passed because it will first need to be approved by the Senate parliamentarian, which sets the rules for what types of provisions are eligible in legislation passed through a procedure that requires just 50 votes.",https://fox59.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/06/Tesla_060725_Getty_Spencer-Platt.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-08 06:09:54.808871

“As that salt at Fox River depletes and opens up more space at Fox River, we’ll be able to land new vessels of coal at Fox River, which then will allow us to deplete the inventories that we have at Mason Street,” Hasselhoff said.","Reading Time: 4 minutes

For the people of Green Bay, the long-awaited deal to move century-old coal piles from the riverfront near downtown is a big deal.

How big?

“This is our Louisiana Purchase. This is our purchasing of Alaska,” said state Rep. Dave Steffen, R-Howard. “It doesn’t get any bigger than this. We are not only just witnessing history, we’re part of it today.”

Steffen was one of the Green Bay-area lawmakers of both parties who were on hand Thursday before the Brown County Board of Supervisors approved a deal that will pave the way toward moving the hulking black piles that local officials and residents have hoped to oust for decades.

Thursday’s deal, approved unanimously after a closed session of the county board, sets the general framework for a lease agreement that will allow the coal to be relocated.

The coal sits on land along the Fox River that community leaders see as ripe for redevelopment. A very visible and not-so-pretty symbol of the city’s industrial heritage, it is also a nuisance for some residents who say dust from the piles blows into nearby neighborhoods.

But they are also a landmark, one that was immortalized by pranksters who decades ago made a “Ski Green Bay” poster of a man skiing down a coal pile with the skyline of the city behind him. That image was more recently included in a mural downtown.

A desire to move the coal piles to someplace less visible has been on the wish list of generations of city leaders.

“It’s literally something that mayors of the city of Green Bay and other community leaders have been working on for upwards of 75 years,” said Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich.

Thursday’s vote means the county will not lose a $15 million federally-funded state grant that was in jeopardy after the county board altered a previous deal in December and negotiations stalled. The county had until Tuesday to come to an agreement and until Friday for the board to approve it, or risk losing the grant.

C. Reiss Co. owns the coal piles. The company has operated the bulk commodities storage facility on Mason Street, located along the the Fox River, since 1900.

Under the deal, C. Reiss and the county will work to finalize a lease agreement for a 16-acre parcel of land at a former power plant site the county is redeveloping for the Port of Green Bay. The company would also lease up to 1.5 acres for a stormwater pond that it would maintain.

But the agreement stipulates that C. Reiss, or other users, may not store coal at the power plant site.

Rather, CEO Keith Hasselhoff said coal would be stored at a site near the power plant, known as the Fox River Terminal. C. Reiss’ parent company currently stores salt and other bulk commodities at the Fox River Terminal.

When the 16-acre parcel is ready, Hasselhoff said C. Reiss plans to move salt from the terminal site to the power plant.

“As that salt at Fox River depletes and opens up more space at Fox River, we’ll be able to land new vessels of coal at Fox River, which then will allow us to deplete the inventories that we have at Mason Street,” Hasselhoff said.

At a press conference before the meeting, Brown County Executive Troy Streckenbach said moving the coal from downtown “is not going to happen overnight” and could take “a number of years.”

County Board chair Patrick Buckley said the final negotiations came down to the eleventh hour. He said talks were ongoing up through Tuesday night, when all parties came to a consensus. He said the county’s corporation counsel spent Wednesday and Thursday getting the agreement in writing for the board’s approval.

“It’s really a group effort here to get this done,” he said. “A lot of people did not think this was going to get done. … But a lot of hard work went into it.”

The lease for the power plant site still needs to be fully ironed out, but the agreement requires the lease be fully executed by Sept. 15 or the parties could be required to go to arbitration.

According to the conditions approved Thursday, it would run for 60 years with the annual rent set at $350,000 with inflationary increases every five years.

The length of a lease had been one of the biggest sticking points in past agreements. Back in December, C. Reiss had wanted a lease that ran up to 75 years, while the county board wanted a 30-year lease with a 10-year extension option.

Streckenbach acknowledged that the board previously had reservations about a long-term lease. But he said all sides had to make concessions in the negotiation.

“Ultimately, because of what we came to an agreement with and everybody making concessions, the county board felt comfortable going forward with the length that was proposed,” he said.

The agreement also stated that the city of Green Bay would provide up to $2.2 million if the county faces funding shortfalls related to the coal relocation effort.

Genrich said the addition of the city’s financial commitment was “one of the latter changes” that was made to the agreement and was something that he and Council President Brian Johnson had committed to in their discussions with county officials.

“Our priority is Mason Street and (doing) whatever was necessary within reason to make that redevelopment project possible,” he said. “The commitment that we all made to each other in the room was like, ‘We’re going to get this done regardless.’”

Genrich said the full Green Bay City Council will discuss the up to $2.2 million in funding at its meeting on Tuesday.

“The change in gas demand is pretty large without the tax credits.
Many states have just one utility that both generates power and provides it to electricity customers.","Energy policy analysts are in broad agreement about one consequence of major legislation that Republicans are currently pushing through Congress: It will raise energy prices for the average American household by hundreds of dollars, once all is said and done.

That’s because the legislation, which President Donald Trump has dubbed the One Big, Beautiful Bill, will repeal the vast majority of clean energy provisions contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which a Democrat-controlled Congress passed in 2022. That earlier law provided a wide array of financial incentives for the deployment of electricity sources like solar, wind, battery storage, and nuclear power, as well as support for consumers looking to buy zero- and low-emissions products like electric vehicles. Choking off support for those measures not only hobbles U.S. efforts to fight climate change — the IRA, if left intact, could single-handedly reduce the country’s carbon emissions by 40 percent — but it also means there are fewer new sources of energy for a country that has started to need more and more of it. And reduced supply coupled with increased demand means higher prices.

That’s the virtually unanimous conclusion of the academics and policy experts who have been trying to understand the likely effects of the rollback for the past few months, though each group of experts used different assumptions about the full extent of IRA repeal, given that the legislation is still being revised by the Senate. Part of the reason for this unanimity is that, once constructed, many newer energy sources like wind and solar don’t have substantial operating costs compared to traditional power plants that must be continuously supplied with fuel.

“Clean electricity has zero generation cost,” said Robbie Orvis, a senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. “One of the dynamics is that less clean electricity gets built, and that makes power generation more expensive, because we’re relying more frequently on fossil fuels with higher generation costs.”

Orvis’ group calculated that those higher power generation costs from using coal or natural gas, along with other price increases stemming from IRA repeal, would result in household energy costs rising by more than $33 billion annually by 2035, compared to a scenario in which the IRA were left intact. That works out to roughly $250 more per year per household. Other analysts came to similar conclusions: The Rhodium Group, an independent policy analysis firm, estimates that average household costs could be as much as $290 higher per year by the same date. Princeton University’s ZERO Lab projects that energy costs could grow even higher: Their estimates show that, in a decade, annual household prices will be $270 to $415 higher under the GOP plan.

Energy Innovation’s analysis calculated the effects of repealing the IRA on energy bills and transportation costs across the nation. They found that if the tax credits for clean energy are taken away, utilities will increasingly rely on natural gas and coal, which have higher generation costs. These costs would then be passed on to customers. Additionally, as electric utilities’ demand for natural gas increases, the cost of the fossil fuel in the market will also rise, further raising household energy bills.

“Gas suppliers can’t respond immediately to large changes in the demand for gas,” said Orvis. “The change in gas demand is pretty large without the tax credits. So you’re really increasing the reliance on gas and therefore gas demand and gas prices.”

On the transportation front, the legislation passed by the House of Representatives eliminates IRA tax credits for electric vehicles and undoes the nation’s latest tailpipe standards, which limit the amount of pollution that new vehicles are allowed to emit. The result is a greater reliance on gasoline than would happen under the status quo — and more demand for gasoline means higher prices at the pump, per Orvis’ modeling.

These price spikes — and the electricity spikes in particular — won’t be felt uniformly across the nation. One key factor is how utilities in a state are regulated. Many states have just one utility that both generates power and provides it to electricity customers. But in so-called deregulated markets such as Texas and Pennsylvania, electricity providers compete on an open market to sell their power.

The rules around how utilities calculate and pass on the costs of generating electricity vary significantly between these two models. In regulated markets with just one provider, the cost of generating electricity and getting it to homes is averaged out and passed on to customers. But the competitive nature of deregulated markets means that customers can see wild fluctuations in price. During peak winter and summer, when demand for power is high, prices can be double or triple normal rates. As a result, customers in deregulated markets see more variation in their bills — because those bills closely track changes in the marginal cost of electricity. If those costs rise in a dramatic and systematic way because IRA repeal leads to fewer sources of energy, customers in deregulated markets will feel the full force of it. Customers in regulated markets like much of the Southeast, on the other hand, will be somewhat cushioned from the increase, because their costs reflect the average of all generation and transmission costs incurred by their utility.

“That helps minimize the impact of repealing IRA tax credits — though it also runs the opposite way and helps reduce savings when market prices go down,” said Jesse Jenkins, an associate professor at Princeton University who led the modeling conducted by the ZERO Lab, in an email.

These rising costs will come on top of U.S. energy bills that are already ticking upward. Electricity prices have been steadily rising since 2020, and the federal Energy Information Administration recently forecasted that that trend is likely to continue through 2026. Prices have increased for a variety of reasons, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupting global oil and gas supply chains, extreme heat and other weather shocks, costly maintenance needed to protected the grid from wildfires, and the buildout of additional capacity to meet growing demand. U.S. electricity demand is beginning to rise for the first time in decades, thanks to the construction of new manufacturing facilities and data centers, which support operations like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, as well as the growing adoption of electric vehicles.

Orvis said that the IRA has been helping meet that demand and maintain the country’s competitive advantage with China, one of the Trump administration’s stated goals. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill would undermine that progress by reducing the amount of energy available for new manufacturing and AI development — and making the electricity that’s left more expensive for everyone.

“The ironic thing is that what’s in the bill, the net results of it will be completely contradictory to what the [Trump] administration’s stated policy priorities are and will cede a lot of the AI development and the manufacturing to China specifically,” said Orvis. “That’s the important macro context for everything that’s happening now — and some of the un-modelable implications in the long run.”

The blast from the Russian missile shattered all the windows in the Mykolaiv CHP (combined heat and power) plant in southern Ukraine, igniting a gas fire and propelling shrapnel through the canteen.

“I had imagined what I might do when a missile or a Shahed [drone] comes, like if it really happens to me, and I had told myself I should be really calm at that moment,” says the 27-year-old.

She and her twin sister Alyona led a hyperventilating colleague out of the plant’s office to her car. The trio were still driving away when the second Iskander hit, devastating the plant’s boiler-room.

After that Oct 10 strike, the plant was targeted again, in January, February and May, each time with Shahed drones.

On Thursday night, Russia renewed its campaign against Ukraine’s national energy infrastructure, breaking a loosely followed ceasefire Vladimir Putin agreed with Donald Trump in a phone call on March 18.

Power facilities were struck in the western city of Ternopil and targeted in other areas, days after Putin warned he would avenge Ukraine’s elaborate “Spiderweb” attack on Russia’s bomber fleet.

“The scumbags haven’t hit the energy sector en masse for five months,” wrote Myroshnykov, a Ukrainian military blogger. “Ballistics on transformers – only the scumbags could do that.”

On Friday night, Moscow struck the northeastern city of Kharkiv with what the mayor described as the “most powerful attack” since the start of the war, involving more than 50 Iranian-made drones, one rocket and four guided bombs.

At least three people were killed and 22 wounded in the strikes. Bloodied residents were carried out on stretchers from their homes by rescue workers wearing gas masks.

Respite is direly needed. Ukraine faces shortfalls in both electricity and natural gas production after the wave of Russian attacks – and every hour without further explosions allows for the progress of repairs.

Few appreciate the challenges like Dmytro Myroshnychenko, the chairman of Mykolaiv CHP plant. On a tour of the facility, he grimly points out the legacy of Russia’s bombardment: the boiler-room is a tangle of charred iron and splintered rebar; shrapnel perforates an oil tank; flaps of corrugated roof panelling limp over the walls of the destroyed turbine control centre.

In full health, the Mykolaiv CHP heats 160,000 homes and provides 26MW of electricity to the national grid. The latter was ended by a February drone strike. That the plant managed to deliver heat over winter is testament to the grit of its staff.

After the first Iskander strike in October, Mr Myroshnychenko ran through the facility to check if anyone was injured. “My first thought was, everyone is lying on the floor,” he says. Luckily, everyone survived.

The next day, repairs began. Russia’s attack hit two weeks before the start of Mykolaiv’s heating season, when residents can turn on their radiators as temperatures sink below freezing. Staff were nervous coming to work but “everyone understood the importance, as if we didn’t rebuild the city would be left without heat”.

Only interrupted by air raid alerts, workers frantically shifted pipelines from the two ruined boilers to a 1930s predecessor.

When he pushed the button to turn on the heat again, Mr Myroshnychenko felt little relief. “I knew more attacks would be coming,” he says, “so we started preparing for them.”

The £29.5million needed to build two new boilers is prohibitive; instead, the plant is focused on keeping its elderly system running. Four small metal air raid shelters have been placed on the plant floor, in addition to three underground bunkers.

Gennady, a 47-year-old machinist, escaped the boiler room by touch in one strike, unable to see through the clouds of dust. Now, when sirens warn of an impending strike, he often has to climb up and down several ladders: unlike the destroyed computerised systems, the surviving parts have to be operated by hand.

He jokes there is one advantage: “It is difficult to break them so easily, as there are no electronics.” But they are harder to shut down in an emergency.

One new metal air raid shelter stands a few feet from the boiler. As Gennady opens the door, a worker caught in a lunchtime nap guiltily slips out.

The most serious challenge facing Ukraine ahead of the next heating season is a shortage of gas, with underground storage badly hit by the Russian strikes: Mykolaiv CHP lost large quantities when the Iskander destroyed a pipeline.

“We need to find $2.5 billion and purchase gas, putting aside the risk of further strikes. The task is quite clear, but extremely difficult,” Oleksandr Kharchenko, the director of Ukraine’s energy research centre, told RBC-Ukraine, a local news outlet, this month.

Last winter, Ukraine avoided a crisis. Record high temperatures and low industrial use spared residents from major power cuts. Experts are calling for small boilers, firewood and coal to be delivered to the worst-hit cities – Mykolaiv, Odesa, Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih – before winter.

Should there be long-lasting blackouts, further waves of refugees will head west. Others will freeze to death.

In Mykolaiv CHP, the workers plough on with gallows humour. The plant knows war: it was destroyed by the Nazis when they were forced out of Mykolaiv by the Red Army in 1943.

A portrait of Lenin has been left above the doorway in one workshop, with the name “Morozov” scrawled underneath; a decades-old reference to a lookalike employee.

The shipyard next door built Russia’s only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetzov, before this invasion began.

All the plant’s staff are protected from conscription. But it needs another 40 people to get up to speed, admits Mr Myroshnychenko.

At work, Valeria and her friends no longer eat pizza. The next time they sat down to one after the October strike, an air raid sounded immediately. “It’s become a joke,” she says – and another reason to loathe the Russians.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/06/07/TELEMMGLPICT000427653944_17493015990410_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-06-07 17:08:30.696431

Electrified vehicles and stationary storage systems are at the heart of this transition—but the sustainability of lithium-ion battery production remains a critical challenge.

Addressing this, researchers at Fraunhofer IWS, led by Benjamin Schumm, Holger Althues, and Stefan Kaskel, have pioneered DRYtraec, a breakthrough dry coating method that could transform how batteries are made.

Traditional battery manufacturing relies on a wet chemical process involving slurry—an energy-intensive method that uses toxic solvents and requires large-scale drying equipment. This not only inflates the environmental footprint but also raises production costs and complexity.

Holger Althues, Stefan Kaskel and Benjamin Schumm from Fraunhofer IWS

DRYtraec upends this norm. It enables the creation of battery electrodes without a single drop of solvent, using a dry mixture of active material, conductive carbon black, and binders. These components are mechanically fused into a stable, high-performance electrode layer using a specialized calendering process that eliminates the need for drying altogether.

The advantages are striking. DRYtraec delivers all the performance benefits of conventional electrodes while removing one of the most resource- and energy-intensive steps in the production line. It also supports double-sided coating in a single step, allowing for greater throughput and more compact manufacturing footprints.

Born out of over a decade of research and development—the first prototype dates back to 2013—DRYtraec has matured into a scalable, roll-to-roll process suitable for industrial deployment. With a modular R&D platform in place, Fraunhofer IWS now offers industry partners a comprehensive pipeline from concept to commercialisation. Licensing the technology to a leading European automotive player marks a significant milestone in taking this innovation from lab to line.

Importantly, DRYtraec isn’t confined to lithium-ion technology. The method has proven compatible with emerging battery chemistries, including sodium-ion, lithium-sulphur, and solid-state batteries—areas where conventional wet processing compromises material performance. Its 'drop-in' adaptability makes DRYtraec not just a future-ready tool, but a critical enabler for next-generation battery platforms.

For Germany and Europe, this innovation arrives at a pivotal moment. As regions race to localise clean technology value chains and retain industrial competitiveness, DRYtraec strengthens Fraunhofer IWS’s role as a cornerstone in sustainable mobility and advanced manufacturing. By redefining battery production with a solvent-free, energy-efficient process, DRYtraec is more than just a technical milestone—it is a foundation for greener power, smarter factories, and a more resilient energy future.

""An abrupt end to the solar tax credit would be economically devastating to me.
Why is this solar tax credit elimination concerning?
What's being done about this threat to the solar tax credit?
EnergySage has compiled contact information for influential representatives so people can voice their support for keeping solar tax credits available.","A U.S. Marine veteran and solar installer in Vermont is sounding the alarm about proposed policy changes that could eliminate federal solar tax credits, according to EnergySage.

What happened?

Congress is considering eliminating or drastically reducing the Investment Tax Credit by the end of this year. This federal incentive helps homeowners save thousands of dollars when they install solar panels.

Liam Madden, who runs Light On Earth Solar Partners, wrote an urgent letter to the House Ways and Means Committee.

He argued that an abrupt end to solar incentives would devastate small businesses and families who have invested their livelihoods in clean energy.

Madden's situation shows the human cost of these policy changes. After nine months of preparation, he has several solar projects lined up with Vermont farms, schools, and homeowners. His employer has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in materials and staff for the upcoming season.

""An abrupt end to the solar tax credit would be economically devastating to me. My clients would lose important opportunities to save money by producing their own energy. My employer would be forced to take a major financial loss and lay off numerous employees,"" Madden wrote.

He invested most of his savings into solar inventory and home repairs and has a third child on the way.

Why is this solar tax credit elimination concerning?

This policy would hinder progress toward a cleaner, safer future for American families and communities dependent on affordable energy options. Small business owners like Madden have built their careers around helping people access clean energy, and sudden policy changes could force layoffs and business closures nationwide.

When solar businesses shut down, local economies lose jobs, and families lose access to money-saving energy solutions. Schools, farms, and homeowners miss out on opportunities to reduce their electricity bills through clean energy production.

Going solar is one of the best ways to save money on home energy costs while reducing planet-overheating pollution. Solar panels typically pay for themselves within several years and continue generating free electricity for decades. You can explore EnergySage's free tools for quick solar installation estimates and compare quotes from vetted local installers.

Although the fate of the ITC remains uncertain, taking advantage of the incentives earlier rather than later could be worth thousands of dollars.

What's being done about this threat to the solar tax credit?

Advocates are urging representatives to vote against the abrupt elimination of solar incentives. Madden, who wrote that ""an abrupt end to these tax credits would be reckless, irresponsible, and short-sighted,"" called for at least a year's notice if changes must happen, giving businesses and consumers time to adjust their plans.

EnergySage has compiled contact information for influential representatives so people can voice their support for keeping solar tax credits available. The platform connects homeowners with prescreened solar installers and provides free guidance throughout installation.

With EnergySage's help, the average person can get nearly $10,000 in incentives for solar purchases and installations. These savings could disappear if Congress eliminates the tax credit, which makes existing incentives more valuable than ever.

If you're considering solar, explore your options through EnergySage's free services. This simple action could save you money before policy changes take effect. One helpful resource is its mapping tool, which displays average installation costs for every state in addition to incentive details.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-tax-creditimage-recYsiW2yhZ3KnTcP.jpg,N,,2025-06-08 01:04:50.788222

Ten years ago, Pope Francis told the world we needed to take climate change seriously with Laudato Si.","This year marks the 10th anniversary of Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical Laudato Si, a groundbreaking letter to the entire world addressing global warming and the unjust pillaging of our common home.

Laudato Si inspired humanity to see climate change as far more than a fringe concern for environmentalists, but as the fundamental “life” issue of our time and an existential threat to humanity. Laudato Si forever linked the ecological collapse unfolding around us with scarcity conflicts, forced migration and the plight of the world’s poor, marginalized and forgotten.

On May 8, the first American was elected to succeed Pope Francis and immediately signaled his continued commitment to Catholic social justice by taking the name Leo XIV, invoking the author of Rerum Novarum, which outlined modern Catholic teaching on social justice. While it remains to be seen how Pope Leo XIV moves the message of Laudato Si through his papacy, initial indications are encouraging.

On May 19, Pope Leo XIV stated: “If we Christians and members of other religious traditions stand together, free from ideological and political conditioning, we can be effective in saying ‘no’ to war and ‘yes’ to peace, ‘no’ to an economy that impoverishes people and the Earth and ‘yes’ to integral development.”

On May 22, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget bill that drastically cuts U.S. commitments to the working poor and hard-won progress on clean energy and climate. Maine’s two congressional representatives, Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, proudly stood against the injustices and negligence of this legislation, with the extremely careful Rep. Golden even calling it “one of the easiest ‘no’ votes I’ve ever taken.”

The cruelty and recklessness of this legislation couldn’t be more transparent: (1) cutting $800 billion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act; (2) cutting food assistance (which feeds 1 in 8 Mainers), putting 18 million kids nationally at risk of losing school meals; (3) increasing health care costs by an average of $180 per month for tens of thousands of Mainers; (4) adding $3.1 trillion to the national debt to benefit the affluent (giving households earning more than $1 million a year an annual tax cut around $90,000, while low-income households receive an average of just $90 from the tax cuts — while burdening them with increased costs from Medicaid and SNAP rollbacks).

On energy and climate, experts warn this budget raises energy costs for Mainers by 4.7% in four years, increases pollution and local health costs, and decimates clean energy investments transforming our statewide and national energy grid (to the glee of our rivals like China, which increasingly corners the clean energy market, where the winner of the 21st-century economy is being decided).

Mainers will suffer greatly under this legislation. Ending clean energy tax credits will put energy-efficient heat pumps, insulation and rooftop solar out of reach just when we need their help to save money, reduce pollution and stabilize our energy grid.

Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will add $13 billion and support 39,000 full-time jobs in Maine annually. That’s not hypothetical — that’s real money and real livelihoods for Mainers. Rural job creators like Lincoln Battery Storage Project, Northern Maine Renewables Program, County Line Wind Farm and others would likely be shuttered with this legislation.

Maine has become a true climate leader and energy leader, thanks to the outstanding work of the Maine Climate Council; bipartisan lawmakers like Gov. Janet Mills and Sens. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, and Stacy Brenner, D-Scarborough; and business and community groups like ClimateWorks Maine and E2Tech. We are grateful for Maine U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King, who have likewise led admirably to address climate change and clean energy. Compliance with the current budget’s painful unraveling of the progress would only hurt Maine’s economy, people and environment.

Ten years ago, Pope Francis told the world we needed to take climate change seriously with Laudato Si. Ten years ago, Sens.

Through a partnership with PurposeEnergy, a cutting-edge anaerobic digestion facility in St. Albans is converting waste from the iconic ice cream brand into renewable energy. This initiative not only reduces waste but also aids in lowering emissions, setting a sustainable example for the industry. As the plant produces substantial renewable electricity annually, it underscores the potential of industrial symbiosis and renewable energy innovations.

Turning Food Waste into Power

The partnership between Ben & Jerry’s and PurposeEnergy is a prime example of industrial symbiosis, where food production waste is turned into clean energy. This closed-loop system benefits both the environment and the local economy. Initiated by an agreement in 2021, the collaboration involves Ben & Jerry’s supplying organic waste, including wastewater and out-of-spec products, to the facility.

At the heart of this process is the high-tech anaerobic digestion facility in St. Albans, Vermont. Here, waste is piped directly from Ben & Jerry’s factory to the digester, where it is broken down without oxygen. This decomposition produces methane-rich biogas, which is captured and used to generate electricity and heat. The plant is expected to produce 8.75 million kilowatt-hours of renewable electricity annually, enough to power hundreds of Vermont households. By feeding this electricity into the state’s power grid, the facility contributes to a cleaner energy future.

Fueling the Future

Beyond electricity, the plant also generates up to 45,000 million British thermal units of renewable thermal energy each year. This energy helps heat the digester and supports on-site operations, enhancing the plant’s efficiency. Jenna Evans, PurposeEnergy’s global sustainability manager, emphasized that this project reinforces Ben & Jerry’s commitment to environmental sustainability, offering a long-term solution for organic waste management.

By reducing road traffic, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and decreasing phosphorus pollution, the facility marks a significant step towards a more sustainable future. Other regional food producers, such as Casella and Evergreen Services, are also contributing waste to the plant, indicating its growing influence in the area. The plant’s success could make the St. Albans Industrial Park an attractive hub for other food manufacturers seeking sustainable waste disposal solutions.

Investment and Impact

The PurposeEnergy facility was developed with funding from Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, a specialized investment manager focused on renewable energy. Officially opened in December 2024, the plant quickly began exporting electricity to the state grid. This initiative marks PurposeEnergy’s most significant project since its acquisition by Quinbrook in April 2023.

By integrating waste management and renewable energy production, the facility serves as a model for similar initiatives worldwide. If successful, this model could be replicated to help food producers reduce emissions and convert waste into clean energy. The facility not only highlights the potential for innovative waste solutions but also underscores the importance of strategic investments in renewable infrastructure.

Expanding the Model

The success of the plant in St. Albans presents an opportunity to expand this model to other regions. Built on land from the Franklin County Industrial Development Corporation, the facility represents a new direction for waste management and renewable energy in Vermont. The integration of multiple food producers into this system enhances its sustainability and economic viability.

As more companies join this initiative, the potential for reducing emissions and promoting clean energy grows. PurposeEnergy hopes that this centralized solution will inspire other food manufacturers to adopt similar practices. By providing a ready-made, sustainable waste disposal and energy system, the plant can serve as a blueprint for future projects. This approach could revolutionize how industries handle waste and contribute to a more sustainable world.

The innovative collaboration between Ben & Jerry’s and PurposeEnergy demonstrates the power of industrial symbiosis in creating sustainable solutions. By turning food waste into renewable energy, the facility not only reduces environmental impact but also boosts local economies. As other companies consider similar initiatives, what other industries could benefit from adopting such a sustainable approach to waste management?

The Solar Shares Act is just that: a homegrown energy opportunity that keeps benefits local and builds a more resilient energy future.
Let’s keep moving in the right direction — toward more freedom, more innovation, and more energy abundance for all Montanans.","Montana lawmakers have done something rare this legislative session: come together across party lines to advance a pro-business, all-of-the-above energy solution that empowers consumers and small businesses, attracts private investment, and strengthens our grid.

Senate Bill (SB) 188, which creates a voluntary Solar Shares program, passed the Legislature with overwhelming bipartisan support. It’s a clear signal that Montanans are ready for practical, locally driven energy options that work for families, landowners, and small businesses alike.

Now that the Legislature has signaled its support, it’s up to Governor Greg Gianforte to sign the bill into law.

The Solar Shares program would allow Montanans to subscribe to small-scale solar projects built right here in the state. Solar currently makes up only 1.8% of the grid in Montana — so there’s plenty of room for growth. These projects deliver local energy at no extra cost to non-participating customers, give rural landowners an income opportunity, and allow more people to benefit from clean, reliable power — without having to install rooftop panels or own property.

It’s exactly the kind of common-sense solution that matches Montana’s independent spirit and decentralized geography. And it couldn’t come at a better time.

Energy costs are rising. Major transmission line buildouts take decades. But demand is here now — driven by population growth, technology, and increasing demand for electricity across manufacturing and industry sectors. Solar Shares can begin to meet some of that demand quickly, efficiently, and affordably as Montana becomes a hub for entrepreneurs.

What’s more, the bill carries no fiscal note. Not a single dollar of new taxpayer funding is required. Yet the economic upside is immense: if implemented with a 100 MW target cap over the first three years, this program could generate an estimated $280 million in local economic impact and support over 1,200 jobs across the state. This is private capital being put to work in service of public benefit — without mandates, subsidies, or budget riders.

To help ensure smooth implementation, the industry has taken the extra step of outlining voluntary commitments to the Montana Public Service Commission. These reflect our industry’s strong desire to be good partners in the years ahead — supporting transparency, utility cost recovery, and customer protections as the program scales. This approach isn’t just responsible, it’s proof that collaboration works.

Above all, this is a moment to deliver what Montanans are asking for. Montanans have made it clear that they want more options for affordable energy — and legislators, from both sides of the aisle, responded. What happens next will determine whether that momentum continues.

Montana has long prided itself on practical solutions and forward-looking leadership. So has Governor Gianforte. The Solar Shares Act is just that: a homegrown energy opportunity that keeps benefits local and builds a more resilient energy future.

Let’s keep moving in the right direction — toward more freedom, more innovation, and more energy abundance for all Montanans. The Governor can now do his part by signing SB 188 into law and upholding his promise of being a pro-business governor that supports an all-of-the-above approach to energy.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

""We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,"" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to ... document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.

""It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

""The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

For entrepreneurs, established companies, and investors looking to capitalize on this green revolution, understanding the landscape of government support is crucial. Government incentives play a pivotal role in de-risking investments, enhancing financial viability, and accelerating the establishment of local solar panel production lines.

This guide provides a detailed roadmap to understanding and accessing the diverse range of UAE government incentives designed to foster solar panel manufacturing projects. Whether you’re in the initial stages of exploring opportunities or developing a detailed business plan, this information will be invaluable.

Why Invest in UAE Solar Manufacturing? The Big Picture

The UAE’s commitment to a sustainable future is unwavering, creating a fertile ground for solar manufacturing investments. Several factors converge to make the nation an attractive destination:

National Renewable Energy Goals: The UAE’s Energy Strategy 2050 aims for 50% of its energy mix to come from clean sources. Furthermore, the UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative underscores the long-term commitment to decarbonization. These goals necessitate substantial growth in solar energy capacity, driving demand for locally manufactured components. Significant investments, estimated between USD 45-54 billion, are planned by 2030 to triple the share of renewable energy.

Rapidly Growing Demand: The UAE’s solar energy market is experiencing explosive growth. Valued at 11.0 TWh in 2024, it is projected to reach 73.5 TWh by 2033, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.33%. Installed solar capacity is also set to soar from 7.90 GW in 2024 to an anticipated 36.06 GW by 2029 (CAGR 35.48%). This surge is exemplified by mega-projects like the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park and the Al Dhafra Solar PV plant.

Strategic Location and Logistics: Situated at the crossroads of global trade, the UAE offers unparalleled logistical advantages, with world-class ports, airports, and infrastructure, facilitating both the import of raw materials and the export of finished solar modules to regional and international markets.

„Tariff Haven“ Status: For manufacturers eyeing export markets, particularly the United States, the MENA region, including the UAE, presents a significant advantage. It’s considered a „tariff haven“ with a relatively low basic tariff (around 10%) on modules exported to the US, compared to much higher duties imposed on products from other regions. This can provide a substantial competitive edge.

Falling Cost of Solar: The cost of solar energy in the UAE has dramatically decreased, reaching as low as 1.69 cents/kWh in 2024, down from 11 cents/kWh a decade ago, making solar power increasingly competitive and boosting its adoption.

Federal Level Incentives & Support Programs

The UAE federal government has established a framework of incentives and support mechanisms to attract and nurture investments in the solar manufacturing sector.

Financial Incentives

Tax Exemptions and Rebates: While the UAE introduced a federal corporate tax, the regime includes provisions and potential exemptions that can benefit strategic sectors like renewable energy manufacturing. Notably, equipment and materials for solar power generation can be eligible for tax and duty-free advantages within the first ten years of certification. Furthermore, a zero-rated Value Added Tax (VAT) often applies to the supply of solar power generation equipment and materials, reducing the cost burden for manufacturers. Specific tax rebates may also be available, subject to guidelines from the Ministry of Finance.

Customs Duty Waivers: To lower the initial capital expenditure for setting up manufacturing facilities, customs duty exemptions are often available for imported machinery, equipment, and raw materials essential for solar panel production.

Potential for Production-Linked Incentives (PLIs): Globally, PLI schemes are becoming a popular tool to boost domestic manufacturing. While specific PLI schemes exclusively for solar manufacturing in the UAE are evolving, the government’s proactive stance on industrial development suggests a supportive environment for such initiatives. Investors should monitor announcements from relevant ministries for potential future programs.

Grants and Subsidized Funding: Various federal entities may offer grants or subsidized funding for projects aligned with national strategic objectives, including renewable energy manufacturing.

Financing Support

Emirates Development Bank (EDB): The EDB plays a crucial role in financing industrial projects that contribute to economic diversification and sustainability. A key initiative is the AED 100 million Solar Energy Finance Program, specifically designed to support businesses, including mSMEs, in solar energy projects. This program can offer attractive terms, such as loans with up to an 8-year tenor, up to 100% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and grace periods of up to six months. The EDB provides various other financing solutions that could be applicable to solar manufacturers.

Other National Financial Institutions: Several other national banks and financial institutions are increasingly aligning their lending portfolios with the UAE’s green agenda, potentially offering favorable financing terms for solar manufacturing ventures.

Non-Financial Support

Support for R&D and Technology Adoption: The UAE government encourages innovation and the adoption of advanced technologies. Support may be available through research grants, partnerships with universities and research institutions, and initiatives promoting technology transfer.

Streamlined Regulatory and Licensing Processes: Efforts are continuously made to simplify business setup, licensing, and approval processes, reducing bureaucratic hurdles for investors.

Emirate-Level Incentives: Tailored Opportunities

Beyond federal support, individual emirates offer their own unique sets of incentives and support programs, often tailored to their specific economic development plans and industrial strengths.

Abu Dhabi

Key Entities: The Abu Dhabi Department of Energy (DoE) and industrial zones like Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD) are pivotal in driving the emirate’s renewable energy manufacturing ambitions.

Incentives: Investors may find attractive land lease rates, benefits on utility connections and tariffs in designated industrial zones, and support for infrastructure development.

Masdar: Masdar, Abu Dhabi’s renewable energy company, often plays a role in fostering the clean energy ecosystem, which can create collaborative opportunities for manufacturers.

Dubai

Key Entities: The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), Dubai Industrial City, and Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA) are central to Dubai’s solar strategy.

Incentives: Dubai offers excellent infrastructure in its industrial parks. While programs like Shams Dubai (promoting rooftop solar installation) and Net Metering policies primarily target solar adoption, they significantly contribute to creating robust local demand for solar panels, benefiting local manufacturers.

Dubai Industrial City and JAFZA offer specific advantages related to industrial land, warehousing, and logistics.

Sharjah & Northern Emirates

Key Entities: The Sharjah Electricity, Water and Gas Authority (SEWA) and free zones such as Sharjah Airport International Free Zone (SAIF Zone) and Hamriyah Free Zone Authority (HFZA) are active in promoting industrial growth.

Incentives: These emirates provide competitive setup costs, access to skilled labor, and strategic locations, along with various incentives offered through their respective free zones and industrial areas.

Special Economic Zones (SEZs) & Free Zones: The Manufacturer’s Edge

The UAE’s numerous Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Free Zones are a cornerstone of its business-friendly environment and offer substantial advantages for solar manufacturers.

Key Benefits:

100% foreign ownership.

Full repatriation of profits and capital.

Exemption from corporate taxes (often for extended periods, subject to zone regulations).

Exemption from import and export duties.

Access to world-class infrastructure and logistics.

Streamlined administrative and legal procedures.

Key SEZs/Free Zones for Solar Manufacturing:

KIZAD (Abu Dhabi): Offers large industrial plots, excellent connectivity, and an environment conducive to heavy manufacturing.

Dubai Industrial City (DIC): A dedicated industrial hub with specialized zones and infrastructure for manufacturing.

Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA – Dubai): One of the world’s largest free zones, offering exceptional logistics and access to Jebel Ali Port.

SAIF Zone & Hamriyah Free Zone (Sharjah): Provide cost-effective solutions and strategic locations.

These zones often provide „one-stop-shop“ services for business setup, making the process efficient for foreign investors.

Navigating the Application Process: A Practical Guide

Accessing government incentives requires a clear understanding of the application procedures. While specifics vary by program and emirate, here’s a general approach:

Thorough Research: Identify the most relevant incentives for your specific manufacturing project based on scale, technology, and location.

—Alice Magritte, New Orleans, LA

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been one of America’s strongest environmental laws since it first passed in 1973. It’s credited with saving hundreds of species from extinction. Some species include the bald eagle and the gray wolf. But recently, the Trump administration has made several moves that critics say would weaken the ESA, particularly when it comes to defining what counts as “critical habitat.”

Under new rules announced in April 2025, federal agencies would no longer be required to protect areas that endangered species might potentially need to survive, only areas where they already live. This ignores that many species need room to migrate, adapt or recover. According to Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation at Earthjustice, “This is a recipe for extinction. Wildlife can’t survive if we don’t protect the places they need to live.”

So, does Trump actually have the political muscle to make these changes stick? In short, sort of—but it’s complicated. The administration does have backing from some Republican lawmakers and lobbyists tied to agriculture, oil and development industries. These groups claim the ESA is outdated and too restrictive, and that it interferes with land use and economic growth. But there’s also a lot of resistance. Environmental organizations like Earthjustice, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) are all filing lawsuits challenging the legality of the new rule. Polls show that the majority of Americans support strong protections for endangered wildlife as well.

Plus, the ESA is hard to fully overturn. It would take an act of Congress to repeal it, and that’s unlikely to happen anytime soon given the current split in Congress. Instead, what we’re seeing is more like a slow chipping away of protections, done through administrative rules that can be changed again by future presidents. Still, those changes can last for years and seriously affect vulnerable species in the meantime.

For people who care about wildlife, there are things you can do. Support conservation groups taking legal action. Call your representatives and ask them to strengthen wildlife laws. And stay informed—some of these policy changes happen quietly, without much media coverage. The more people speak out, the harder it is to roll back decades of environmental progress.

State College

On May 22, the House of Representatives voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed to see that the House advanced this legislation.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Pennsylvania if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution and threaten growing economic investments in the Commonwealth. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

Federal tax credits–designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S.–have been working. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, Pennsylvania has benefited from just under $3.5 billion in investments in 34 clean energy projects to create more than 7,900 jobs. That’s according to an analysis by Citizens’ Climate Lobby.

An outsized chunk of that investment is in the state’s 15th Congressional District, represented in Congress by Glenn Thompson. Nine projects–eight solar and one for electric transmission lines–have spurred $1.7 billion in investments in PA15 with an estimated 2,550 jobs to be created.

The tax credits were passed by Democrats, so they have been an easy target for Republican attacks. But the legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts–78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP.

That success story, however, could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits that support clean energy manufacturing will jeopardize long-term projects. Eliminating clean vehicle tax credits could put up to 100% of planned EV plant construction and a significant portion of existing capacity at risk, according to industry analysis.

Households and local businesses will take a huge hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades such as rooftop solar is a blow to Pennsylvanians who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners to install solar panels, save money and even help stabilize America’s power grid. But those benefits–and the local businesses that depend on them–are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

By contrast, if Congress protects clean energy tax credits, it would be a giant boost to the Commonwealth’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will be a $65 billion economic boost to our State in the next 10 years and support more than 35,000 in full-time jobs in Pennsylvania annually.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican Senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits work for Pennsylvania. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Senators David McCormick and John Fetterman to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits.

How does OCBRA work: The Ottawa County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority works with municipalities across the county to extend redevelopment support to areas without their own local brownfield authority.","What’s happening: Ottawa County has received a $500,000 Brownfield Assessment Grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to support the revitalization of vacant or contaminated properties. The federal funds will be used to conduct environmental site assessments, an essential step in turning abandoned or underutilized land into community assets.

Why it matters: The grant will help unlock the redevelopment potential of properties across Ottawa County, especially in areas with a legacy of industrial use along Lake Michigan and the Grand River. Many of these sites are difficult to repurpose due to environmental uncertainty. By assessing contamination risks, the county aims to remove a key barrier to redevelopment, protect local waterways, and attract economic investment.

When it happened: The award was announced May 16 as part of the EPA’s nationwide distribution of $224 million in Brownfield Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup grants. Ottawa County was one of 207 communities selected.

What officials are saying: “We’re extremely grateful to receive this funding to jumpstart brownfield development on priority sites within the county,” says Becky Huttenga, Ottawa County’s agriculture and economic resources coordinator. “Often, the biggest barrier to redeveloping these sites is the unknown costs. This grant support will allow us to significantly increase site evaluations, ensuring that developers know what to expect.”

Context and history: This is the third time Ottawa County has received EPA funding for brownfield work since establishing the Ottawa County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (OCBRA) in 2008.

A $400,000 grant awarded in 2013 supported 34 projects and leveraged an estimated $35.6 million in private investment.

A $300,000 grant in 2020 funded 29 projects, leading to $90 million in investment.

Among the projects supported by previous funding was Terra Station, a 12-building mixed-use development under construction in Hudsonville.

What’s next: The new funding will primarily support Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments. These evaluations determine whether contamination is present and guide subsequent remediation steps. A smaller portion of the grant will go toward cleanup planning and redevelopment strategy reports. Roughly 34 sites are expected to be assessed, depending on project size and complexity.

Although the funding will prioritize brownfield sites in Grand Haven and Holland, cities with a high number of known contaminated and blighted properties, other communities may be eligible following a formal selection process.

Why this is a solution: By addressing unknown environmental liabilities, the grant paves the way for developers to confidently invest in neglected properties. Redevelopment of brownfield sites offers long-term community benefits, including:

Returning properties to the tax rolls

Creating new jobs and investment

Increasing surrounding property values

Reducing sprawl through infill development

Improving environmental quality near key waterways

Defining the issue: Brownfields are properties where redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination, blight, or functional obsolescence. Without support, these sites often remain idle for decades. Brownfield programs provide incentives such as grants, cleanup support, and tax financing tools to encourage redevelopment and reduce risks for developers.

How does OCBRA work: The Ottawa County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority works with municipalities across the county to extend redevelopment support to areas without their own local brownfield authority.

Most NJ residents’ electric rates will increase by about 20% in June. In this article, we explain why this is happening. It’s not due to the push for clean energy.

Natural gas prices are expected to continue to rise as well, from $2.10/MMBtu in 2024 to $4.60/MMBtu in 2025 according to the US Energy Information Agency.

The Building Electrification Committee stands by its commitment to clean energy and electrification and refutes statements that tie the pending rate increases to clean energy. We continue to advocate for home electrification because it will result in additional energy efficiency and lower electric bills and will put less strain on the grid during peak demand. We offer the following explanations and recommendations to avoid and counteract future electric rate increases.

Your Electricity Bill

Your electricity bill is made up of two parts: delivery (about 40%) and supply (about 60%).

Delivery cost includes distribution lines, meters, etc. This portion of the bill is regulated by the NJ Board of Public Utilities (BPU). Delivery cost is not the cause of the large increase.

Supply cost covers the generation and transmission of electricity that your utility buys in the competitive electricity market. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates this portion of the bill, not New Jersey. Supply cost is the part that is increasing. This is considered the wholesale side of electricity, and it is managed through a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).

Supply Cost Explained

PJM, the RTO, manages the larger electric transmission grid for 13 states and Washington, DC. PJM decides how much to charge for electricity by holding regular auctions. The prices in these auctions are influenced by estimates of how much electricity will be needed in each state. These estimates are made by utility companies across the region and help set the final prices for electricity supply.

After over 15 years of almost level demand and rising efficiency, and therefore lower overall demand for electricity, electricity usage is now forecast to climb quickly without sufficient supply to cover it. This is due in part to new demand (e.g., data centers, AI, and onshoring of industrial manufacturing across the entire PJM region). Also, PJM and the utilities did not plan well enough to meet this growing demand without a sharp price increase.

It is not clear that the demand forecast is 100% accurate. PJM auctions recently understated the available supply of energy, resulting in an almost 10x increase in price of electricity for 2025-2026.

This was successfully challenged in court by a multi-state lawsuit joined by New Jersey, and a new auction to be held in July of this year (for 2026-2027) is expected to produce lower prices.

One cause of the supply and demand imbalance is that new power generation is not coming online fast enough. PJM must review every application for new power generation sources, and PJM is not completing these grid interconnection reviews fast enough. There is now a huge multi-year backlog of project proposals totaling approximately 140 gigawatts (GW), almost as much power as PJM’s peak summer load!

If PJM were approving new energy projects, including lower-cost clean energy generation plants, at a faster pace, this would make energy cheaper for consumers (Graphic).

The use of clean energy in New Jersey is not a cause of the price increases. NJ electric utilities are required by the BPU to achieve a 2% annual reduction in usage, and they have done so. Currently, electric vehicles represent less than 1% of the electricity used in New Jersey, and heat pumps consume even less than that. In fact, heat pumps help reduce the peak summer energy usage in New Jersey because they are more efficient than standard central air conditioners.

Peak energy times have high prices because expensive plants are used. Improving efficiency, using demand response programs (which encourage customers to reduce energy use during peak times) and adding solar power can help lower these peak prices.

Recommendations

What can you do to reduce your electricity bill?

Cut down on wasted energy by getting an energy audit and weatherizing your home.

Subscribe to demand response programs offered by your utility to qualify for reduced prices. Ask your utility how to sign up.

Buy and use lower-cost clean energy:

Install rooftop solar

Subscribe to community solar

Buy from an independent supplier instead of your utility, but be careful to read the fine print since a long term variable rate can also result in a higher bill.

Ask legislators, PJM, and the BPU to do the following:

Legislators

Press developers for quick build-and-connect solutions using already-approved energy sources (57 projects in NJ and 300 in PJM), such as new battery storage and capacity improvements to existing power plants.

Pass bill S4143/A5564 to require new, very large users of power, such as data centers, to guarantee:

They will use new renewable, zero-emissions energy,

Buy enough renewable energy certificates to finance their capacity, and

Employ the most efficient cooling technologies like geothermal heat pumps or thermal energy networks.

Enact into law 100% clean electricity by 2035. This would set the state on a path for efficient, cheaper and faster clean energy generation (bill number not yet assigned).

PJM

Urge PJM to drastically reform and speed up the review process for new energy sources.

Ask PJM not to bypass clean energy projects with fossil fuel projects. Demand that rules that have allowed artificially high prices be reformed and auctions be held on a regular schedule.

BPU

Encourage the BPU and utilities to broaden demand-response programs so that more customers can choose when to use electricity and also reduce the amount of electricity that utilities must buy.

Make offshore wind a reality: 11 GW have been proposed, and that would make a large impact on energy supply in New Jersey and help to hold down prices. The current federal administration may be holding offshore wind hostage for a while, but this is not the end. New Jersey must be prepared to bring offshore wind on full force after the Trump administration.

Editor’s note: This commentary was published in April 2025 on NJ.com.

New Jersey’s utility bills are already some of the highest in the nation, and they are about to get even higher. New Jerseyans want to power their homes and businesses with affordable and reliable energy, without the uncertainty of rising rates from year to year. It’s time to address the real cause of rising rates with solutions that will keep costs down.

The demand for electricity across our regional grid is rising at an unprecedented rate. With the increase in the number of data centers and with new manufacturing sites set to come online, our regional grid operator, PJM Interconnection, is rightly feeling the pressure of managing energy supply and demand. PJM is the entity that operates the power grid in our region, which includes 13 states and Washington, DC. It decides which power sources will supply our electricity.

However, PJM continues to double down on expensive, inefficient, and outdated energy sources, which is driving up costs. PJM even sent a letter to President Trump on behalf of fossil fuel companies asking for his help in propping up aging coal plants in the region. Our regional grid is mostly dominated by fossil fuel and nuclear generation, with solar and wind only contributing about 7% by the beginning of this year.

Data show that states that rely on natural gas for electricity generation—as New Jersey does (49%)—are among those with the highest rate of retail price increases. As a matter of fact, New Jerseyans are already paying among the steepest rates in the country for their electricity, with the state’s average residential rate being 23% higher than the national average.

According to an April 2025 Synapse Energy Economics report released by Evergreen Collaborative, PJM is on course to spike residential electric bills almost 60% over the next 10 to 15 years. However, if PJM allows the deployment of more cost-effective clean energy generation, residential electricity bills could fall by 20% over the same time, saving households huge amounts of money.

In New Jersey, this would be an average savings of $405 a year per household through 2040. The study also finds that New Jersey would see as many as 23,000 jobs created annually—if the new energy generation plants include solar, wind, and battery storage, which are job intensive. That means real, tangible savings and jobs for families in New Jersey.

Dragging Its Feet

When it comes to adding low-cost, clean sources of electricity to the grid, PJM is simply dragging its feet. Energy generators across the region continue to propose clean energy projects, such as wind and solar paired with battery storage, given their quick-to-build and low-cost advantages; however, these are stuck in the PJM interconnection queue. This delay jeopardizes the viability of projects and is leading to significantly increased costs of electricity for New Jersey ratepayers.

In response to the upcoming steep rate hikes in New Jersey and the region, Gov. Phil Murphy and other states in the PJM grid have been calling on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate whether PJM’s flawed processes have been subject to market manipulation.

A balanced energy approach requires us to let the market build what it wants: more low-cost clean energy. By doing that, electricity rates will fall and New Jersey families’ power bills will actually decrease significantly below current levels in the long term. Conversely, if we leave it to business as usual at PJM, New Jerseyans’ power bills will soar, thereby increasing hardship and reducing the quality of life for millions of state residents.

As New Jersey considers state-level solutions to the pressing issue of rising electricity rates, we must accept the truth: Fossil fuels and PJM are no longer serving our wallets or our state.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-07 17:08:18.012575

Trump said Musk’s vocal opposition to Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” is based on its elimination of incentives for electric vehicles (EVs).

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

While the bill may not be all bad for Musk – including preserving Trump’s 2017 income tax cuts – it contains significant provisions that impact Musk’s flagship company. It also rolls back green-tax incentives.

Since he’s stepped away of the Trump administration, the entrepreneur has been a vocal critic of the legislation, including lamenting that “there is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

While the House narrowly passed its version of the bill in late May, it is facing hurdles in the Senate, where it is so far losing some momentum.

Here’s a look at the provisions that may be particularly impactful for the company – as well as other electric vehicle and climate-friendly energy companies:

Eliminates EV tax credits

One major way in which the “big, beautiful bill” harms Tesla is by making its cars more expensive.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act lifted a cap allowing manufacturers that had already sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles to once again be eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit. It also extended eligibility for the credit through 2032

The bill effectively made the cars $7,500 cheaper for consumers.

But, the credits are cut in the GOP’s bill. Without that credit, Tesla and other EV makers may make fewer sales. One major hurdle facing the adoption of electric vehicles is that they are oftentimes more expensive than gas-powered cars.

However, Musk has contended when he was supporting Trump that he does not need the tax credit.

Cuts credits for solar energy

Tesla Energy sells both rooftop solar energy and grid scale solar power – both of which are hampered by the Republican bill.

The legislation axes tax credits for rooftop solar after this year.

It also eliminates tax credits for any grid scale project that begins construction more than 60 days after the bill is enacted. Projects also need to begin producing energy by the end of 2028 to become eligible.

These utility scale cuts are controversial even within the GOP and could face changes in the Senate.

Axes Biden-era EV regulations

The legislation would eliminate a Biden-era regulation that forces the electric vehicle market to shift toward EVs.

While Tesla is already all-electric, doing so could still impact its bottom line, as the way the regulations are set up, automakers either have to make their vehicles greener or purchase credits from automakers like Tesla that already outperform the regulations.

If the regulation is weakened, traditional car manufacturers may not have to buy as many credits from EV-makers like Tesla.

However, it’s not clear whether this provision will make it into what’s ultimately passed because it will first need to be approved by the Senate parliamentarian, which sets the rules for what types of provisions are eligible in legislation passed through a procedure that requires just 50 votes.

Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will set out her spending review for the rest of this parliament on Wednesday. Amid continuing economic uncertainty and Labour’s promise to boost defence spending, many departments are facing deep cuts to dearly held commitments.

Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has been fighting for the promised £13.2bn for home insulation to be protected, as experts and charities have warned that failing to insulate Britain’s draughty homes will undermine the restoration of winter fuel payments to many pensioners. There are also questions over the funds available for GB Energy, the publicly owned company that invests in green energy, and support for farming and for flood defences.

The campaign group Friends of the Earth, which successfully took the last Conservative government to court over its net zero plans, has said it will take legal action again if Reeves’s plans appear to fall short.

The high court ruled that the last government had failed to set out a credible plan to meet the legally binding target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and ordered ministers to come up with a comprehensive plan on climate action. The duty now falls on Labour to publish it by 29 October.

Friends of the Earth has written a letter, seen by the Guardian, to Keir Starmer, reminding him of the high court’s demands, and warning that any major cuts by Reeves to programmes that boost clean energy or cut emissions could be subject to legal challenge in light of the ruling.

The group’s interim chief executive, Jamie Peters, said: “The decisions made as part of the [spending review] could significantly influence your government’s ability to comply with the court order.”

Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth’s head of science, policy and research, added: “The government has a legal duty to deliver on climate targets – no amount of political manoeuvring can change that. With the planet already warming to a dangerous degree, extreme weather costing lives and livelihoods, and the UK’s current and future prosperity hanging in the balance, Friends of the Earth will, if necessary, go to the high court to ensure the UK delivers on its legal obligations.”

Spending on climate measures now would reduce the cost of extreme weather – such as droughts, floods and storms – in the future, he added. “It’s imperative the chancellor does not sideline the future of the planet in her upcoming spending review.”

Reeves boosted public transport this week by announcing £15bn for trams, trains and buses outside London, which will come out of the £113bn earmarked for capital projects and infrastructure.

But there is no such guarantee over the future of the £13.2bn for home insulation. Ed Matthew, UK director at the climate change thinktank E3G, warned that if Labour failed to help people with the high costs of energy, by boosting renewables and insulating homes, it would give added impetus to the rightwing populist Reform party.

He said: “The Labour government has so far underplayed the importance of the green economy in sparking economic growth. This was mostly a result of No 10 attempting to appease potential Reform voters. But this strategy has backfired. Most of these voters love renewables because they bolster energy independence and can lower energy bills.”

He said Reeves would be missing a vital opportunity if she failed to invest in the green economy, which according to recent CBI research grew by 10% last year, three times the rate for the rest of the economy.

“Failing to centre the clean economy in their capital spending plans would be an act of economic self-harm and undermine their political fortunes,” said Matthew. “Reeves must now deliver the biggest boost to the clean economy in UK history at the spending review. It is green growth or bust.”

A government spokesperson said: “The clean energy mission is in the DNA of this government because it is the route to energy security, lower bills, and good jobs for our country. We are committed to meeting our ambitious targets, and we will publish a report setting out our plan to meet carbon budgets by October. Through our warm homes plan up to 300,000 households will benefit from upgrades this year, such as insulation, double glazing, solar and heat pumps, making them cheaper and cleaner to run.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/254318ba0b61bc0177e835fa33146b6516dc3975/626_0_6183_4946/master/6183.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=420104f0036549bfd95c834ac7900c70,N,,2025-06-07 17:08:21.894889

Keep your eyes on the BYD and Tesla rivalry, as well as the pros and cons of Tesla stock vs. BYD stock.","Tesla (TSLA) and BYD (BYDDF) are the world's largest electric-vehicle makers.

It's not much of a race anymore. China EV and battery giant BYD's EV sales are more than double those of Tesla. BYD has even taken the crown for all-battery electric vehicles (BEVs).

↑ X NOW PLAYING How China's BYD Is Beating Tesla As Musk Faces Challenges

Tesla earnings plunged in Q1, while BYD boomed, passing its U.S. rival on yet another metric: net income.

With an aging lineup and serious brand issues hitting EV sales, Musk is betting on robotaxis, robots and artificial intelligence. A limited robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, is imminent.

BYD has launched driver-assist systems across its lineup at no added charge. It's also started selling EVs that can be charged in five minutes. BYD has its own issues, slashing domestic prices by up to 34% recently, but surging overseas sales will help mitigate that.

Tesla stock has been a loser in 2025, plunging recently on the Elon Musk feud with President Donald Trump. BYD stock has been a big winner this year, though it sold off on the automaker's huge price cuts.

Tesla Vs. BYD Sales

Tesla delivered 336,681 EVs in Q1, down 13% vs. a year earlier and the lowest since Q2 2022. They fell 32.1% vs. Q4's record 495,570 EVs. Q1 deliveries once again missed much-lowered analyst estimates.

Tesla also deployed 10.4 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in Q1, down slightly vs. Q4's record 11 GWh but up 156% vs. a year earlier.

Meanwhile, BYD sold 1,000,804 EVs in the seasonally slow Q1, down 34.3% vs. Q4's record 1,524,270 vehicles. But they jumped 59.8% vs. a year earlier. Exports and overseas sales, which tend to be higher margin, rose sharply.

Passenger BEV sales were 416,388, easily beating Tesla for a second straight quarter.

April-May sales were 762,565, including 400,109 BEVs. BYD's BEV sales are now outpacing plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) once again.

Tesla doesn't release monthly sales, but data point to continued weakness. Q2 deliveries should top the weak Q1, but it may be close. The year-over-year decline may be bigger.

BYD Price War

Meanwhile, BYD is offering discounts of up to 34% discounts on its BYD-branded EVs through June, especially on the lower end. As the low-cost leader due to in-house production and squeezing suppliers via to its heft, the EV giant is putting heavy pressure on rivals. Plus, BYD has the advantage of booming overseas sales, which boast significantly higher margins. Still, BYD will likely also feel the pain from its price war.

Several rivals have also announced some big price cuts. Tesla recently announced a new referral incentive for different paint options.

Tesla EV Lineup

The new Tesla Model Y hasn't boosted sales much, with cheap financing already offered to drum up demand.

The Cybertruck, Tesla's first new passenger EV in the past five years, is a bust. Overall sales of the Model S, X and Cybertruck were just 12,881 in Q1.

Tesla now aims to launch ""affordable"" EVs that will resemble the Model Y or 3. Several reports have stated that the first cheap EV would be a stripped-down Model Y. Tesla is sticking to its plan for output to start by mid-year, though mass production could be months away. It could cannibalize Model Y sales, and would face extremely fierce competition in China.

Otherwise, Tesla's EV pipeline is thin. The Cybercab needs actual self-driving, as well as the ""unboxed"" manufacturing process that Tesla hasn't figured out yet.

The EV giant has delivered a few dozen Tesla Semi trucks to PepsiCo (PEP) and a few other customers. The specs and price are unknown, though the price tag reportedly has risen. Tesla recently said it expected mass production in 2026, but Semi timelines have often slipped by a factor of years.

BYD Expansion

BYD sells BEVs and PHEVs from below $10,000 to $150,000, including its premium Denza, FangChengBao and Yangwang brands, with a steady stream of new or upgraded models.

Improved driver-assist systems and faster charging are expanding to more of BYD's lineup.

Overseas sales are surging, a trend that will likely continue. Export logistics have improved, with several more roll-on/roll-off ships coming into service this year. BYD outsold Tesla in Europe in BEVs in April, while PHEV sales also are strong.

A Hungary plant in early 2026 and a Turkey plant later that year will let BYD sidestep EU tariffs.

BYD's Thailand plant, its first full-assembly plant outside of China, is still ramping up. A Brazil factory will open in late 2025. BYD also is building factories in Indonesia and Turkey, with knockdown plants eyed for Cambodia and Pakistan.

BYD makes EV buses in California but says it has no plans to enter the U.S. passenger EV market, amid import tariffs and political opposition.

Tesla Vs. BYD Batteries

Tesla traditionally has not mass-produced its own batteries, working with partner Panasonic while buying batteries from South Korea's LG, China's CATL as well as BYD itself.

Tesla is working on 4680 batteries, first touted at the 2020 Battery Day. But the touted benefits have been slow going, while rivals' batteries have improved.

Tesla is a major battery storage provider, but gets its batteries from CATL and BYD. The Tesla Energy business has been booming, with strong margins. But Trump tariffs, threats to IRA tax credits and increased competition all pose near or long-term threats.

BYD is one of the world's largest EV battery makers. Its Blade batteries are a form of lithium ferrous phosphate (LFP). BYD supplies third-party EV makers, including Xiaomi, XPeng's Mona subbrand, Nio's Orvo brand, Toyota as well as Tesla.

Meanwhile, BYD now has unveiled its 1,000-kilowatt superfast charging, providing essentially a full charge in roughly five minutes. BYD's BYD Han L sedan and Tang L SUV are the first models that support charging up to 1,000 kW.

BYD is setting up its own network of superfast chargers.

Tesla Full Self-Driving

Elon Musk has promised actual self-driving ""this year"" or ""next year"" for about a decade. But will it be this coming week?

Tesla will begin paid robotaxi rides in a geofenced, heavy mapped part of Austin, Texas, in June, starting with some 10 Model Ys. Teleoperators will be involved.

Musk says there will be a rapid expansion, moving to multiple cities. Tesla owners with Full Self-Driving will get true self-driving by late 2026, Musk now says.

However, the unofficial FSD Community Tracker, endorsed by Musk several times, signals FSD is a long way from truly unsupervised.

Meanwhile, BYD has spent massively on driver-assist and smart-car software, racing to catch industry-leading peers.

On Feb. 10, BYD announced that it was rolling out Level 2 driver-assistance systems across its lineup. More-expensive BYD EVs and premium brands will get more advanced ADAS, with lidar.

Along with fast charging, the smart-car push should enhance the brand. BYD's system has low ADAS component costs, making it hard for rivals to keep pace. Several rivals have already announced ADAS will come standard.

Tesla's Other Businesses

Tesla has its own Supercharger network. Most automakers have gained access to U.S. Superchargers. Those deals, and some related charging subsidies, boost revenue, but also reduce Tesla's charging moat.

Tesla has a solar installation business, but it's struggled for years.

Tesla also is pursuing a humanoid robot, Optimus, with Musk saying he expects it to be a multitrillion-dollar business, with sales beginning in 2026. But Musk timelines often slip. Many other companies are developing humanoid robots. The use case for humanoid robots in factories or warehouses is still unclear. Home health care is one potential use case.

BYD's Other Businesses

BYD, notably, makes its own chips. That, along with in-house batteries and other vertical integrations, helps make BYD a low-cost EV maker.

The EV and battery giant also has solar operations.

BYD Co. is largely known for its BYD Auto operations. BYD Electronics, which accounts for an increasingly smaller share of overall revenue, is involved in mostly low-margin businesses such as smartphone components and assembly, including for the Apple iPhone. But margins are improving there as well.

The Trump Effect

Elon Musk was a huge Trump supporter in 2024, with TSLA skyrocketing to record highs in late 2024 on bets that a Trump presidency would pay off for Tesla, with TSLA stock skyrocketing to record highs in late 2024.

Tesla regulatory probes were put on the backburner. President Trump rolled back fuel-economy standards, which will have a mixed impact on Tesla. A federal framework for self-driving vehicles doesn't override state regulation. Tesla faces no self-driving regulations in Texas and Florida.

Meanwhile, the House-passed Trump tax bill scraps the $7,500 tax credit on EVs and imposes a $250 annual fee on BEV ownership. Tesla also could lose big credits for the Tesla Semi, battery production and more. The Senate could make changes, but the ultimate legislation could have serious impacts on Tesla's financials.

Trump tariffs raise the cost of CATL batteries that Tesla uses for storage products.

And all that was before the Musk-Trump blowup. In theory, Trump could ramp up regulatory pressure on Tesla. A bigger problem is that Musk risks alienating Trump supporters. That's after Musk tarnished Tesla's brand with core upscale urban customers in the U.S. and Europe.

Tesla Earnings

In Q1 2025, Tesla earnings dived 40% vs. a year earlier while revenue fell 9% to $19.34 billion, both far below lowered views. Auto gross margins excluding regulatory tax credits were the lowest since 2012. Tesla Energy, still growing fast, boasts high margins.

Tesla would have had an operating loss excluding $595 million in regulatory credits, which seem likely to trend lower.

Tesla pulled 2025 delivery guidance after the Q1 release, after forecasting some growth on the Q4 call and 20%-30% on the Q3 call.

Analysts have slashed EPS and delivery targets in recent months, and now forecast Tesla earnings will fall for a third straight year. Consensus forecasts seem likely to keep sliding.

BYD Earnings

BYD's Q1 earnings per share leapt 98% to 43 cents, the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Revenue grew 36% to $23.5 billion, below forecasts.

Net income came in $1.26 billion, up 100.4% in local currency terms. That easily topped Tesla's adjusted net income — $934 million — for the first time.

Investors see 2025 EPS rising 34%, but the price war could crimp profits.

Tesla Stock Technicals

Tesla stock is down 26.9% in 2025 as of June 6.

Shares ran past an aggressive entry just above the 200-day line on May 9, then cleared another early entry in late May. But shares crashed 14.8% in the week ended June 6 amid the Trump-Musk feud.

BYD Stock Technicals

BYD stock is up 54% in 2025 as of June 6.

Shares hit a record 61.51 on May 23, then sold off on BYD's price war. Shares tumbled far below a buy point and undercut the 50-day line, though they've regained the latter.

The stock may need time to set up again.

BYD, listed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, trades over the counter in the U.S. Its U.S. shares often have mini-gaps as well as opening-trade mini-spikes or tumbles before settling down.

On May 19, Hong Kong's Hang Seng announced that BYD would join the Hang Seng Tech Index of the top 30 tech companies before the open on June 9.

Tesla Vs. BYD Market Cap

Tesla has a market cap of $950.6 trillion as of June 6. That's far above BYD's $142.8 billion. The overwhelming majority of Tesla's valuation is on self-driving.

Tesla Stock Vs. BYD Stock

BYD sells far more EVs than Tesla, and now leads in BEVs, revenue and net income. BYD makes a variety of EVs all through the price scale, with new models and big tech moves in recent months

BYD has entered most of the world outside of the U.S., with overseas sales soaring.

Tesla's EV pipeline is thin, with the Cybertruck a bust. Tesla's EV business faces enormous challenges with a damaged brand and aging lineup. Meanwhile, competitors keep moving forward while IRA tax credits are likely to go away.

Tesla stock is down sharply in 2025 amid that backdrop and now the Musk-Trump feud.

Self-driving is the big hope for Tesla and TSLA stock.

BYD stock has taken a hit, but is up sharply in 2025.

Keep your eyes on the BYD and Tesla rivalry, as well as the pros and cons of Tesla stock vs. BYD stock.

The government's strategic emphasis on cleaner energy sources serves dual objectives of reducing foreign exchange expenditure and decreasing emissions output.

The country emerged as the world's largest recipient of development finance funding for clean energy in 2024, securing approximately USD 2.4 billion in project-type interventions.

This financial support has contributed to achieving 44 percent non-fossil power generation capacity in 2024, demonstrating substantial progress toward the 50 percent target established for 2030.

Despite these achievements, the investment landscape presents mixed signals regarding foreign participation.

Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in the energy sector has declined over the past two years due to macroeconomic pressures and sector-specific challenges, although long-term trends indicate steady growth patterns.

India's cost of capital for grid-scale renewable energy remains 80 percent higher than advanced economies, despite ranking among the lowest within emerging markets and developing economies.

These elevated financing costs directly affect project viability and result in higher energy prices for end consumers.

New federal rules are contributing to a nationwide refrigerant shortage, meaning getting cool could cost you just as it’s about to get hot.

Starting this year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is mandating a switch to more climate friendly refrigerants, but the rush to roll out new coolants has set off a supply crisis.

“During the Biden administration, the EPA enacted an HVAC management rule,” said Jorge Alvarez, co-founder of iGas USA. “And why it was done, nobody knows. It was simply done in order to speed up the process, the EPA said. Let’s speed it up. Let’s bring this change to happen within 15 months in lieu of 10 years or 20 years.”

That fast-track shift means short supply and skyrocketing costs.

“Refrigerant cost, because there is no refrigerant available, is up 600%,” Alvarez said. “A 5-ton air conditioning system a year ago installed used to cost roughly $8000 today. That exact same system is a minimum of $11,000.”

The shortage is driven by regulation, global supply issues and surging demand, and a big chunk of the coolant supply now comes from China.

“Eighty percent of the refrigerant gas we need today is now coming from China. That’s 100% against Trump’s initiative,” he said.

So what can homeowners do? Experts say if your unit is more than 10 years old, it may be time to replace but act quickly. Waiting could mean paying even more or sweating it out.

The sprawling bill rolls back tax credits and low-interest loans for a variety of clean energy projects. The incentives were approved by lawmakers in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law.

The legislation would phase out the tax credits over time rather than end them immediately. Future wind and solar projects must break ground within 60 days of the budget bill’s passage and begin operations by 2029 to qualify for the clean energy incentives.

That’s a tight window. Colorado utilities say it’s not enough time to adjust to a new conditions without hiking rates. Paying for solar and wind projects to keep up with rising demands will be more expensive and those costs will be passed on to ratepayers.

Rep. Jeff Hurd asked House leaders to preserve the clean energy tax credits ahead of the vote. Today’s edition includes an op-ed that makes the case for the credits and another that catalogs Colorado’s reaction to the budget bill. They indicate that energy policy isn’t a partisan issue.

But the budget bill passed along party lines. Hurd, a Republican, voted for it and now lobbying efforts are trained on Colorado’s Democratic U.S. senators, Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper.

Bennet recently organized a roundtable of electrical utility executives in Colorado. They told him the bill will raise power bills for Coloradans. Uncertainty over the availability of the credits has also crippled long-term planning.

The Colorado-specific impact is unclear, but an analysis from Princeton University’s ZERO Lab estimates the budget bill will increase average U.S. household energy costs by roughly $100 to $160 per household per year in 2030 and roughly $270 to $415 per household per year in 2035.

It would also affect jobs and economic activity As noted in Rep. Matt Soper’s op-ed on the facing page. “In Colorado, a mature community solar market has generated $1.4 billion in economic activity and supported 6,800 jobs.”

The bill’s budget cuts would repeal or quickly phase out whole categories of tax credits and loans for things such as home improvements for consumers, electric vehicles, wind and solar energy production, hydrogen energy, nuclear energy and carbon capture.

Bennet and Hickenlooper have their hands full. They’ve gotten an earful from constituents concerned about cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits. Now the clean energy tax credits have surfaced as detrimental to Colorado’s economy and clean energy goals.

Expect them to fight the good fight, but more Senate Republicans have to understand and appreciate just how instrumental the tax credits are in boosting both the nation’s energy infrastructure and the economy.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b32d0574-1b24-11ec-a31e-77e4d5ecaec6.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-06-07 13:11:52.956839

Chiseling away at President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Rolling back the green energy tax breaks from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

At its core, the Republican “big, beautiful bill” is more than just an extension of tax breaks approved during President Donald Trump’s first term at the White House.

The package is an attempt by Republicans to undo, little by little, the signature domestic achievements of the past two Democratic presidents.

“We're going to do what we said we were going to do,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after House passage last month.

While the aim of the sprawling 1,000-page plus bill is to preserve an estimated $4.5 trillion in tax cuts that would otherwise expire at year's end if Congress fails to act — and add some new ones, including no taxes on tips — the spending cuts pointed at the Democratic-led programs are causing the most political turmoil.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this week that 10.9 million fewer people would have health insurance under the GOP bill, including 1.4 million immigrants in the U.S. without legal status who are in state-funded programs. At the same time, lawmakers are being hounded by businesses in states across the nation who rely on the green energy tax breaks for their projects.

As the package moves from the House to the Senate, the simmering unrest over curbing the Obama and Biden policies shows just how politically difficult it can be to slash government programs once they become part of civic life.

""When he asked me, what do you think the prospects are for passage in the Senate? I said, good — if we don't cut Medicaid,"" said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., recounting his conversation last week with Trump. “And he said, I'm 100% supportive of that.”

Health care worries

Not a single Republican in Congress voted for the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in 2010, or Biden’s inflation act in 2022. Both were approved using the same budget reconciliation process now being employed by Republicans to steamroll Trump's bill past the opposition.

Even still, sizable coalitions of GOP lawmakers are forming to protect aspects of both of those programs as they ripple into the lives of millions of Americans.

Hawley, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and others are wary of changes to Medicaid and other provisions in the bill that would result in fewer people being able to access health care programs.

At the same time, crossover groupings of House and Senate Republicans have launched an aggressive campaign to preserve, at least for some time, the green energy tax breaks that business interests in their states are relying on to develop solar, wind and other types of energy production.

Murkowski said one area she's ""worried about” is the House bill's provision that any project not under construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law may no longer be eligible for those credits.

“These are some of the things we’re working on,” she said.

The concerns are running in sometimes opposite directions and complicating the work of GOP leaders who have almost no votes to spare in the House and Senate as they try to hoist the package over Democratic opposition and onto the president’s desk by the Fourth of July.

While some Republicans are working to preserve the programs from cuts, the budget hawks want steeper reductions to stem the nation's debt load. The CBO said the package would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the decade.

After a robust private meeting with Trump at the White House this week, Republican senators said they were working to keep the bill on track as they amend it for their own priorities.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the president “made the pitch and the argument for why we need to get the bill done.""

The disconnect is reminiscent of Trump’s first term, when Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, only to see their effort collapse in dramatic fashion when the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, voted thumbs down for the bill on the House floor.

Battle over Medicaid

In the 15 years since Obamacare became law, access to health care has grown substantially. Some 80 million people are now enrolled in Medicaid, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reports 41 states have opted to expand their coverage. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to all adults with incomes up to about $21,500 for an individual, or almost $29,000 for a two-person household.

While Republicans no longer campaign on ending Obamacare, advocates warn that the changes proposed in the big bill will trim back at access to health care.

The bill proposes new 80 hours of monthly work or community service requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, age 18 to 64, with some exceptions. It also imposes twice-a-year eligibility verification checks and other changes.

Republicans argue that they want to right-size Medicaid to root out waste, fraud and abuse and ensure it’s there for those who need it most, often citing women and children.

“Medicaid was built to be a temporary safety net for people who genuinely need it — young, pregnant women, single mothers, the disabled, the elderly,” Johnson told The Associated Press.

“But when when they expanded under Obamacare, it not only thwarted the purpose of the program, it started draining resources.”

Initially, the House bill proposed starting the work requirements in January 2029, as Trump's term in the White House would be coming to a close. But conservatives from the House Freedom Caucus negotiated for a quicker start date, in December 2026, to start the spending reductions sooner.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has said the changes are an Obamacare rollback by another name.

“It decimates our health care system, decimates our clean energy system,” Schumer of New York said in an interview with the AP.

The green energy tax breaks involve not only those used by buyers of electric vehicles, like Elon Musk's Tesla line, but also the production and investment tax credits for developers of renewables and other energy sources.

The House bill had initially proposed a phaseout of those credits over the next several years. But again the conservative Freedom Caucus engineered the faster wind-down — within 60 days of the bill's passage.

“Not a single Republican voted for the Green New Scam subsidies,” wrote Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, on social media. “Not a single Republican should vote to keep them.”

“REPEAL THE GREEN NEW SCAM!” reposted Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a Freedom Caucus leader.

The meeting focused on accelerating their two countries’ partnership in renewable energy, electric interconnection, and low-carbon transition.

This high-level encounter builds upon Emmanuel Macron’s state visit to Morocco in October 2024, which the French president made at the invitation of King Mohammed VI.

That diplomatic milestone resulted in several major agreements, including an ambitious strategic partnership in energy, electrical interconnections, and low-carbon transition.

At the center of discussions was the innovative electrical interconnection project between France and Morocco. The bidirectional “off-grid” underwater connection requires installing a cable at unprecedented depths.

Both ministers reviewed the technical and regulatory steps needed to launch an international market test for this groundbreaking project.

Holding shared commitments

Industrial cooperation featured prominently in the talks. The ministers examined joint investment opportunities in renewable energy sectors, including cable manufacturing, solar and wind energy, battery production, and the development of strategic industrial components.

“Green molecules” such as hydrogen and ammonia were also on the agenda. Officials identified their potential use in land, air, and maritime transport, while calling attention to the need for coordinated industrial integration in these emerging sectors.

Both parties stressed the importance of collaborative research and innovation, particularly around cutting-edge technologies like energy storage, electrolyzers, and sustainable mobility. They shared a commitment to developing concrete and competitive solutions.

The meeting concluded with renewed political and institutional commitments from both countries. Their stated goal is to develop model projects that will contribute to energy sovereignty, industrial competitiveness, and climate transition acceleration.

Trump said Musk’s vocal opposition to Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” is based on its elimination of incentives for electric vehicles (EVs).

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

While the bill may not be all bad for Musk – including preserving Trump’s 2017 income tax cuts – it contains significant provisions that impact Musk’s flagship company. It also rolls back green-tax incentives.

Since he’s stepped away of the Trump administration, the entrepreneur has been a vocal critic of the legislation, including lamenting that “there is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

While the House narrowly passed its version of the bill in late May, it is facing hurdles in the Senate, where it is so far losing some momentum.

Here’s a look at the provisions that may be particularly impactful for the company – as well as other electric vehicle and climate-friendly energy companies:

Eliminates EV tax credits

One major way in which the “big, beautiful bill” harms Tesla is by making its cars more expensive.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act lifted a cap allowing manufacturers that had already sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles to once again be eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit. It also extended eligibility for the credit through 2032

The bill effectively made the cars $7,500 cheaper for consumers.

But, the credits are cut in the GOP’s bill. Without that credit, Tesla and other EV makers may make fewer sales. One major hurdle facing the adoption of electric vehicles is that they are oftentimes more expensive than gas-powered cars.

However, Musk has contended when he was supporting Trump that he does not need the tax credit.

Cuts credits for solar energy

Tesla Energy sells both rooftop solar energy and grid scale solar power – both of which are hampered by the Republican bill.

The legislation axes tax credits for rooftop solar after this year.

It also eliminates tax credits for any grid scale project that begins construction more than 60 days after the bill is enacted. Projects also need to begin producing energy by the end of 2028 to become eligible.

These utility scale cuts are controversial even within the GOP and could face changes in the Senate.

Axes Biden-era EV regulations

The legislation would eliminate a Biden-era regulation that forces the electric vehicle market to shift toward EVs.

While Tesla is already all-electric, doing so could still impact its bottom line, as the way the regulations are set up, automakers either have to make their vehicles greener or purchase credits from automakers like Tesla that already outperform the regulations.

If the regulation is weakened, traditional car manufacturers may not have to buy as many credits from EV-makers like Tesla.

However, it’s not clear whether this provision will make it into what’s ultimately passed because it will first need to be approved by the Senate parliamentarian, which sets the rules for what types of provisions are eligible in legislation passed through a procedure that requires just 50 votes.",https://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2025/06/Tesla_060725_Getty_Spencer-Platt.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-07 14:10:33.004857

We bring folks in front of these banks and insurance companies to say you’re insuring and financing environmental racism,” Ozane said.
Then we’re seeing these insurance companies continue to provide insurance for new fossil fuel projects,” said Breech.
The money will come from the insurance companies that did business with Chevron over the years.","Last Updated on:

The same insurance companies that are refusing to insure homes in many areas of the US because of climate related risks are doubling down on insuring LNG terminals that will make global heating worse. Talk about being two-faced! The problem is, the insurance companies are making so much money from the LNG projects that they have locked their consciences, their morals, their scruples, and their cojones in a vault and thrown away the key.

People who live along the Gulf Coast from Port Arthur, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana, have learned the hard way that fossil fuel and petrochemical companies have sacrificed them on the altar of greed. Nevertheless, they think they may get leverage over the insurance companies by subjecting them to public shaming. The Rainforest Action Network is helping their cause.

With the failed US president now floundering his way through a second term, almost two dozen new LNG terminals or expansions of existing ones are being pushed forward with the active encouragement of the US government. Most of them are located near Port Arthur, Texas, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana, areas where the residents are primarily Black or Brown and poor.

These are called “sacrifice zones,” which are defined by the UN as “extremely contaminated areas where vulnerable and marginalized groups bear a disproportionate burden of the health, human rights and environmental consequences of exposure to pollution and hazardous substances.” According to Truthout, research shows local Black, Brown, and Indigenous workers do not benefit equitably from the jobs and other economic benefits the fossil fuel industry often promises when building new facilities.

The Rainforest Action Network issued a report in April that made use of data from Freedom of Information requests and court filing to put together a picture of the insurers who are making the LNG expansion in the Gulf of Mexico possible. It says some of the insurers behind one of the projects, known as Cameron LNG, are Chubb, AIG, Allianz, Liberty Mutual, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich, Tokio Marine, and The Hartford, among others. Over the past decade, banks and investors such as JPMorgan, Citi, BlackRock, and Vanguard have also funded such projects.

“The banks and the insurance companies are the ones actually supporting the fossil fuel industry behind the scenes,” Ruth Breech of RAN told Truthout. “They’re financing and insuring environmental racism because these projects are overwhelmingly situated in Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities they feel are the path of least resistance,” added Roishetta Ozane, a community organizer in Lake Charles, Louisiana. She told Truthout, “We get all the cumulative impacts living in a fenceline community. My children have asthma and eczema. My son has epilepsy, which I believe was exacerbated by the pollution from the facilities.”

Over time, she started making connections between the environmental racism, the extreme weather her community experienced, and the wider climate crisis and realized they were all associated with local industries. “I was trying to connect the dots for people. All of these facilities are releasing gas into the air, and it’s what’s warming our planet. It’s what’s causing these storms to be more severe.” Isn’t it amazing how something can be so blindingly obvious to ordinary people but beyond the ability of supposedly educated people to comprehend? Money will do that.

“If our elected officials are going to approve these projects, then our hope lies in the banks and the investors and the insurance companies. We bring folks in front of these banks and insurance companies to say you’re insuring and financing environmental racism,” Ozane said.

Both Breech and Ozane put a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the insurance industry. “We’re seeing people across the nation lose their home insurance coverage because of the impacts of climate change. Then we’re seeing these insurance companies continue to provide insurance for new fossil fuel projects,” said Breech. “For insurance companies to insure one of these climate monsters, and then turn around and not insure the people who live in the communities at a reasonable rate, is outright wrong,” Ozane added.

Chubb On LNG

Chubb is mentioned prominently in the Truthout report because it is considered an industry leader. To be fair, it has backed away from insuring some methane projects where its peers have not. In 2024, it dropped 32 major oil and gas clients who didn’t meet its methane emissions standards. It has also declined to insure Rio Grande LNG, a proposed export terminal in Brownsville, Texas, and ruled out insuring the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. As recently reported by Inside Climate News, the company has also declined to insure Calcasieu Pass LNG, a project of Venture Global.

Kudos to Chubb for those decisions, but Ozane wants it to do more. Specifically, she wants it to decline coverage for another Venture Global project known as CP2. According to the Sierra Club LNG Export Tracker, the annual emissions from CP2 will equal those of 54 coal-fired generating stations once it is completed. Chubb has declined to say whether it is insuring CP2.

“If you’re insuring this project, you’re ensuring this community’s destruction. It would be easy for Chubb to say, if CP2 gets all of its permits, we’re not going to insure them,” Ozane said. Rainforest Action Network concluded its April 2025 report this way:

“A human rights due diligence process would inform Banks and Insurance companies to act swiftly; stopping support for any methane export terminal that exacerbates environmental injustice to ensure that low-income communities and/or communities of color are not suffering disproportionately from hazardous pollution. Financial institutions have a responsibility ensuring the projects they support do not entrench these systemic harms, by providing any direct or indirect financial services or insurance coverage to the operating and proposed methane export terminal projects in Southwest Louisiana. The impact of this would save lives and livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of residents.

“To curb the deepest impacts of climate change, banks and insurance companies must stop support, through any direct or indirect means for fossil fuel expansion, in line with the conclusions of the International Energy Agency “Net Zero by 2050” report. Banks and financial institutions must align their overall corporate policy, portfolios and dealbooks with a 1.5 degree global temperature scenario.”

A Legal Victory For The Environment In Louisiana

The impact of the oil and gas industry on coastal areas in Louisiana has been extreme. Much of the land that borders the Gulf is made up of estuaries that act as a transition zone between the freshwater inland and the seawater next door. Those estuaries act as filters that remove pollutants from the water and are home to an amazing variety of aquatic animals and shore birds. But they often interfere with the ability of oil and gas companies to move their drilling rigs about, and so the companies have routinely torn new channels through the area to make it easier to move their equipment.

According to the US Geological Survey, Louisiana’s coastal wetlands are among the most critically endangered environments in the US. From 1932 to 2016, about 25 percent of the land along the coast of Louisiana — 1900 square miles — was lost. Much of that loss is attributed to the channel through the bayous created by oil and gas companies. Those channels allow storm surges from hurricanes to move directly inland, bypassing the bayous that have protected the coastline for millennia. According to the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, the state could lose another 3,000 square miles of coastal land over the next 50 years.

In 1978, Louisiana passed legislation that said sites used by oil companies must “be cleared, re-vegetated, detoxified, and otherwise restored as near as practicable to their original condition” after they were completed. In 2013, the parish of Plaquemines sued Chevron, the parent company of Texaco, claiming it was in violation of that state statute. On June 5, 2025, a jury awarded the parish $744 million in damages — $575 million for land loss, $161 million for contamination, and $8.6 million for abandoned equipment.

The jury found that Texaco violated state regulations and contributed to the disappearing coastline by dredging canals, drilling wells, and dumping massive amounts of wastewater into the marsh, which in Louisiana is known as a bayou. The attorney for the parish told the jurors Chevron did not consider the land worth preserving. That apparently did not sit well with the members or the jury.

Mike Phillips, an attorney for Chevron, said after the verdict was read that the company intends to appeal. According to a report by The Guardian, he claimed that Chevron was “not the cause of the land loss” and that the law does not apply to “conduct that occurred decades before the law was enacted.” He called the verdict “unjust,” and claimed there were “numerous legal errors.” Maybe in another decade or so those appeals will be exhausted and Chevron will actually have to pay some of the money the jury said is owed the parish.

But it won’t be Chevron’s money, of course. The money will come from the insurance companies that did business with Chevron over the years. That, combined with the civic activism by RAN and Roishetta Ozane, may finally convince those insurance companies to withdraw their support for oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico.

Punjab Power Minister Harbhajan Singh ETO said this after attending a conference of power ministers from North India, which was organised by the Union Ministry of Power.

Power ministers and officials from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Delhi took part in the conference chaired by Khattar.

During the conference, the Punjab minister demanded an increase in the existing power generation capacity of the Ropar thermal power plant. He said while the state had its own coal mines, the Centre’s condition to not transport coal beyond 1,000 kms was creating difficulties in expanding the capacity of thermal plants.

Accepting the demand, the Union Power Minister instructed officials to extend the coal transportation limit to more than 1,500 kms and approved the establishment of two additional 800-MW power generation units at the Ropar plant. An approval was also granted for setting up a new 800-MW unit in Punjab. With this, the path has been cleared for setting up 2,400-MW thermal plants in the state.

Regarding the Union Government’s target to generate 7,000 MW of solar power in the state, the Cabinet Minister said achieving the target was a challenging task considering the high cost of land. However, the state government was making efforts to set up solar energy projects in the neighbouring states from where power would be supplied to Punjab.

In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.
Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.
But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.","WASHINGTON When the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced a wide-ranging rollback of environmental regulations, he said it would put a “dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and introduce a “Golden Age” for the American economy.

What Lee Zeldin didn’t mention: how ending the rules could have devastating consequences to human health.

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated; they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

But experts say the numbers are conservative and that even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants. “More of this type of pollution that we know kills people will be in the air.”

What Went Into AP’s Examination of the Pollution Rules

The AP set out to look at what could happen if all the rules were eliminated, by first examining exhaustive assessments the EPA was required to produce before the rules were approved. Though the agency’s priorities can change as presidential administrations change, the methods for the assessments have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan’s presidency and are deeply rooted in peer-reviewed scientific research.

The AP used those and eight different government and private group databases for its estimate of financial costs, some death estimates and analysis of pollution trends. AP performed additional analysis of potential deaths by drawing on peer-reviewed formulas and scientific research on the impacts of increased heat and pollution. And AP vetted its work with multiple outside health experts, who said it is scientifically justified, but likely an undercount.

Multiple experts say the science behind the rules is strong, and they pointed to the rigorous process that must be followed to change them, including requirements for public comment.

Zeldin acknowledged as much last month.

“I’m not going to prejudge outcomes with what will be a lot of rulemaking,” Zeldin said in April.

Virtually all the benefits from the rules come from restricting the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel industry was a heavy contributor to President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and Republicans overall. In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.

Calculating Costs and Benefits Is Contentious

Asked for comment on the AP findings, an EPA spokesperson said the agency’s plans would “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes’ on U.S. families.”

“Unlike the Biden EPA attempts to regulate whole sectors of our economy out of existence, the Trump EPA understands that we do not have to choose between protecting our precious environment and growing our economy,” spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said.

Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell LLP who represents energy and manufacturing interests, suggested that EPA analyses under the Biden administration emphasized worst-case scenarios, inflated health benefit claims and missed the big-picture economic benefits of booming industry.

“If you only count lives saved by regulation, not lives harmed by regulation, the math will always favor more regulation,” Segal said. “This framing misses the larger point: public health isn’t just about air quality — it’s also about job security, housing, access to medical care, and heating in the winter.”

The EPA regulatory analyses are immense documents that numerous health and environment researchers and former officials say are grounded in science, not politics. For example, in January 2024, the EPA produced a 445-page analysis of tightening standards on dangerous particle pollution that cited more than 90 different scientific publications, along with scores of other documents. The Biden EPA presented four different regulatory scenarios and ultimately chose one of the middle options.

Two experts who reviewed AP’s work said the EPA documents that underpinned the analysis were themselves conservative in their estimates. University of Washington health and environment professors Kristi Ebi and Howard Frumkin said that’s because EPA looked at added heat deaths and air pollution mortality, but did not include climate change’s expected deaths from increased infectious disease, flooding and other disaster factors.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,” said Frumkin, who was appointed director of the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health during George W. Bush’s administration. “It makes clear that regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration will have major, direct consequences for health and well-being. Because of these regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts, Americans will die needlessly.”

That’s a sentiment echoed by two former Republican EPA administrators, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George Bush and George W. Bush administrations respectively.

“This administration is endangering all of our lives — ours, our children, our grandchildren,” said Whitman, who led EPA under George W. Bush.

How Regulations Helped Clear the Air

A visit to Evansville, Indiana, helps show how EPA regulations have made a difference.

The city of about 115,000 lies where the state’s southwest tip meets Kentucky at the curving Ohio River. Industry lines the banks and coal barges float past carrying loads destined to fuel power plants.

Kirt Ethridge, 30, grew up in Evansville and still lives there. As a child, he recalls looking down from high ground into the bowl-shaped valley where the heart of the city lies and seeing a haze of pollution atop it. He thought that was normal.

He didn’t think much of the looming smokestacks of the coal-fired power plants and factories that ringed the city, nor the line of inhalers waiting on a bench before he and his classmates ran the mile. He suffered asthma attacks in class, sometimes more than once a week, that sent him to the nurse’s office. Once, he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

“It’s a very scary feeling, particularly as a kid, to not be able to get enough air in your lungs,” he said, describing it as like “breathing through a straw.”

In southwestern Indiana, coal-fired power plants were to blame for between 19,000 and nearly 23,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, according to work by Zigler published in the journal Science that examined death rates among Medicare recipients and modeled where plants’ pollution would spread.

Nationally, he and his team found a sharp decline in air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants after the mid-2000s, from an average of 43,000 a year to just 1,600 a year in 2020, with a similar cut in particle pollution. That’s when two different forces came into play: Cheaper and less polluting natural gas pushed aside dirtier and costlier coal, while at the same time stricter regulations required more pollution control devices such as scrubbers.

Duke Energy operates its biggest power plant near Evansville — Gibson Station, which can power about 2.5 million homes. Emissions have declined significantly as the company installed scrubbers that pull unwanted chemicals out of smokestacks, along with other pollution control technology. Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protegere said the scrubbers were a response to “regulations over the years as well as market factors.”

Put simply, the air got cleaner around places like Evansville. Vanderburgh County and neighboring counties violated national annual air standards for fine particles from 2005 to 2010, but no longer do, even as standards have tightened.

The same is true across the United States. The amount of tiny airborne particles in the last 10 years nationwide is one-third lower than 2000-2009, EPA statistics show. Smog pollution is down nearly 15% and sulfur dioxide has plunged 80%.

“The Clean Air Act, the EPA’s founding legislation, has been a powerful engine for improving public health as our air has grown visibly clearer and cleaner,” said Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under President Barack Obama and served as Biden’s White House climate adviser. “Millions of Americans have avoided illnesses, hospital visits, and premature deaths thanks to EPA’s cleaner car and truck standards in concert with rules that limit industrial pollution.”

Five rules together were estimated to have more than $200 billion a year in net benefits, based on EPA documents that estimated reduced illnesses and deaths and the costs for companies to comply.

Three rules dealt with cars and trucks. The “clean car rule” is a tightening of EPA emission standards for vehicles that was supposed to take effect for 2027 model years and eventually have annual net benefits of more than $100 billion a year, according to the agency’s 884-page regulatory analysis. The EPA estimated that over the next three decades this rule alone would prevent 7.9 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, 8,700 tons of particulate matter and 36,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.

Two other proposed rules — one that deals with car models from 2023 to 2027 and another aimed at heavy trucks and buses — are estimated to save nearly $38 billion a year combined through reduced health problems from air pollution, according to EPA’s own detailed calculations.

Almost none of those benefits are to be found in 10 fact sheets the EPA produced in conjunction with Zeldin’s announcement. Nine make no mention of benefits from the rules, while eight mention the costs.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

For example, Biden’s proposed power plant rule was designed to save more than $24 billion a year, prevent about 3,700 annual premature deaths and 3 million asthma incidents from fossil fuel-powered plants, according to EPA documents last year and work by the Environmental Protection Network. Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.

Another rule the EPA updated last year sets standards for pollution permitted in the air, called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The update, required by the Clean Air Act, cuts allowable soot particles by 25% to reflect new science on the harms from such pollution. The EPA in Biden’s time calculated the change would annually save as much as $46 billion, 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents.

But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.

“The human body count and human health toll of particulate matter alone is just absolutely massive,” said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top federal regulatory officer from 2021 to 2023. “Literally tens of thousands of people will lose their lives” if the standard is rolled back, he said.

In southwest Indiana, many people have noticed a positive difference from the EPA regulations. And they’re concerned about changes.

In Bloomfield, Jessica Blazier’s 11-year-old son Julian has multiple health conditions that make him more sensitive to air quality, including nonallergic rhinitis, which inflames his nasal passage and makes breathing “feel like a knife sometimes,” in his words. Jessica Blazier said the proposed EPA rule rollbacks are “almost adding insult to injury in our particular circumstance.”

In Evansville, Ethridge is now raising kids of his own, including a 5-year-old daughter who was born early and doesn’t tolerate respiratory illnesses well. Whenever Eliza gets sick, she uses a children’s nebulizer that is shaped like a penguin and stored in an igloo-shaped case.

“I want to raise my kids in Evansville,” he said. “I don’t want to raise my kids in a bowl of pollution.”

DETROIT: (Jun 6) (AP) Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule Friday that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks were illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation's use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

LANSING, Mich. — June 7, 2025 — A sweeping legislative package introduced this week by Michigan Senate and House Democrats seeks to overhaul the state’s pollution cleanup laws, shifting financial and legal responsibility onto polluters. The legislation would close key loopholes that environmental advocates say have enabled corporations to avoid accountability for decades, particularly for legacy contamination and newly recognized threats such as PFAS.

Backed by more than a dozen lawmakers from Ann Arbor, Detroit, Flint, and other Michigan communities, the 2025 “Polluter Pay Package” includes provisions to increase transparency, strengthen cleanup requirements, and make medical monitoring accessible to residents exposed to hazardous substances. Michigan pollution law in House Bills 4636–4640, with additional measures forthcoming, targets both legal and regulatory failures that have allowed over 4,500 polluted sites to remain in limbo, often fenced off but not truly cleaned.

Michigan Lawmakers Say Current Rules Let Polluters Off the Hook

Under current Michigan law, companies responsible for chemical spills or toxic waste leaks are not always required to report releases, remove contamination, or compensate affected residents unless narrowly defined conditions are met. According to Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), who is spearheading the Senate effort, the state’s environmental policy has long been biased toward protecting polluters.

“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Irwin said in the announcement. “These bills put liability where it belongs: with the polluters, not the public.”

Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), co-sponsoring the companion legislation in the House, added, “If you pollute our water, poison our soil, or threaten public health — you pay to clean it up.”

Michigan Pollution Law Address PFAS and Delayed Toxic Exposure Claims

One of the more notable components of the legislative package is a provision that would reset the statute of limitations for pollution claims. Current Michigan law starts the clock at the time of the contamination, even if victims don’t know they’ve been exposed. That means residents harmed by substances like PFAS—often called “forever chemicals”—may have no legal recourse if symptoms appear years later.

Michigan pollution law House Bill 4639, sponsored by Rep. Phil Skaggs (D-East Grand Rapids) and Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), would adopt a “discovery rule” similar to federal standards, allowing lawsuits to proceed when the plaintiff becomes aware of the harm. A companion bill, HB 4637, would also require polluters to pay for medical monitoring for exposed individuals before a diagnosis is made, helping detect pollution-linked illnesses early.

Environmental and Public Health Groups Back EGLE-Refined Reform Plan

The legislative effort is informed by work conducted through a 2024 stakeholder group led by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE). Participants included representatives from environmental organizations, local governments, and brownfield developers. The result is a reform package that balances accountability with redevelopment opportunities by ensuring that cleanup responsibilities fall on those who caused the damage—not future site owners.

The Michigan pollution law bills include requirements to:

Report all hazardous material releases and contaminated sites, even if privately managed.

Increase post-cleanup groundwater monitoring to track contaminant migration.

Prohibit reliance on land or water-use restrictions as a substitute for actual cleanup.

Enable EGLE to regularly update health-based cleanup standards based on new science.

Restore the public’s right to sue for environmental damages tied to previously unregulated chemicals.

Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) said the status quo has allowed industries to manipulate cleanup standards and suppress exposure risk data. “We need this legislation so EGLE can update inputs to cleanup criteria as scientists learn more,” she said.

Lawmakers Push Back Against “Honor System” Approach to Contamination

The Democratic sponsors frame the legislation as a response to decades of industrial negligence compounded by weak regulatory enforcement. Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth) criticized current law for allowing self-managed, unreported cleanups, saying House Bill 4640 would bring much-needed transparency.

“Michigan enacted pollution cleanup laws because we had all too many examples of polluters who failed to do the right thing,” Koleszar said. “People have a right to know.”

Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who chairs the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, plans to hold a hearing on the bills in the coming week.

In light of this history and continued industrial pollution, GASP had obtained a $75,000 air monitoring grant from the Biden EPA in 2023.
“I knew at some point they would notice the language of our grant,” Milton said, in that it made reference to services intended to help Black people.
“The majority of these workers were Black, and we can see the disparate impact that still has today,” Milton said.
In the end, Milton said the impact of the administration’s decision to terminate the north Birmingham air monitoring grant is racist.","BIRMINGHAM, Ala.—When Jilisa Milton received the grant termination letter, she wasn’t surprised. She suspected this day would come.

The language the Greater Birmingham Alliance to Stop Pollution (GASP) had used in its application to the Environmental Protection Agency had been clear. “We’re talking about helping a community,” Milton, GASP’s executive director, said last week, “where Black people have been disproportionately impacted.”

Black residents had breathed heavily polluted air from a nearby coke plant for decades, and their neighborhoods had been declared a federal hazardous waste Superfund site after it was determined that waste soil laced with arsenic, lead and benzo(a)pyrene, a human carcinogen, from several nearby coke plants had been spread around their homes as yard fill.

In light of this history and continued industrial pollution, GASP had obtained a $75,000 air monitoring grant from the Biden EPA in 2023.

Milton received the letter earlier this month from officials in President Donald Trump’s EPA terminating the grant because it no longer aligned with the agency’s priorities.

“I knew at some point they would notice the language of our grant,” Milton said, in that it made reference to services intended to help Black people.

Still, she said she doesn’t regret the way GASP characterized the situation on the ground in north Birmingham—that the need for air monitoring stemmed from the city’s history of corporate exploitation of majority-Black workers and residents.

Growing up in Birmingham, Milton said her grandparents often discussed the legacy of workers in the Magic City—so-nicknamed because of the seemingly supernatural economic boom spurred by steel production following the end of the Civil War.

“The majority of these workers were Black, and we can see the disparate impact that still has today,” Milton said. “And it’s really important for Birmingham to talk about our legacy and our history.”

Sanitizing that history, then, to comply with the Trump administration’s stated opposition to all things DEI and environmental justice—as if they were the same thing, just because they both often involve Black people—doesn’t sit well with her.

“I think the narrative work is gone then,” Milton said. “And we have to think about history so we don’t live it again.”

The grant, awarded through EPA’s small grants program, was set to fund GASP’s efforts to train residents in using air monitoring equipment to help establish a community air monitoring program, allowing those in north Birmingham access to critical information about the pollutants filling their lungs every day.

In addition to what is now the 35th Avenue Superfund site, encompassing the neighborhoods of Collegeville, Harriman Park and Fairmont, north Birmingham remains home to several polluters, leaving its residents in the 90th percentile for particulate matter, according to EJ Screen, a government tool also recently shuttered by the Trump administration.

That context of present and past pollution was what made securing funds for air monitoring so important, Milton said, giving residents an opportunity to learn more about the continued impact of industry on their health.

“For decades, residents of North Birmingham and other historically marginalized communities have been forced to live in the shadow of toxic industries with little support or transparency,” Milton wrote in a statement after receiving the termination letter. “The grant made it possible for us to monitor and document the pollution people live with everyday. Revoking this support sends a message that the health of Black, Brown, and low-income communities in Alabama is disposable.”

In its letter, EPA officials said the agency no longer supported the grant’s objectives.

“The purpose of this communication is to notify you that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is hereby terminating Assistance Agreement No. EQ-02D22522 awarded to GASP,” the letter said. “This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated in its entirety effective immediately on the grounds that the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

GASP’s isn’t the only environmental justice effort in Alabama nixed by federal officials. In April, Trump announced the termination of what the administration termed an “illegal DEI” settlement aimed at addressing sewage issues in the state’s black belt that have left its majority-Black residents sometimes unable to flush their own toilets.

The agreement, reached under the Biden Administration, required the state’s Department of Public Health to improve sanitation efforts in the region. It’s still unclear what that termination will ultimately mean on the ground.

In the end, Milton said the impact of the administration’s decision to terminate the north Birmingham air monitoring grant is racist.

“Look at the way they talk about environmental justice,” she said of administration officials. “They say it’s illegal to address these issues. So you hear the things they say, and it’s reasonable to discern from that that the impact is racist, and that what they’re doing is intentional.”

People of all races are forced to face the consequences of polluted air and water, Milton emphasized, but ignoring the reality that people of color have borne and continue to bear the brunt of industrial exploitation isn’t helpful. In fact, she explained, doing so could undermine the relationship organizations like hers have built with residents of color living through the impacts of pollution every single day.

“I don’t want to sacrifice the trust we have in communities that want to be heard because they notice that we start to change the way we talk about these issues,” she said. “Because they are the most important stakeholders. They’re who we’re here to serve.”

Moving forward, GASP plans to appeal the termination with EPA officials, Milton said, though she suspects the agency is unlikely to change its mind. If that’s the case, the nonprofit will do what they’ve always done—look to individual donors to fill in the gaps. It’s work that can’t be abandoned, Milton said. Not if she can help it.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bluestone19-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 16:07:24.097164

“I joke a lot that I took this job knowing that I would love to put the Permitting Council out of business, because we fix federal permitting for everyone and we don’t need it,” Domenech told the Washington Examiner.
In a statement provided to the Washington Examiner, Eric Beightel, the permitting council director under former President Joe Biden, said he was pleased with the president’s choice.
“The Permitting Council is still a young agency with a broad and ambitious mission and Emily is well qualified to lead the Council through a dynamic time for infrastructure development,” Beightel said.
TRUMP ORDER REQUIRES FASTER ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING PROCESS, ENDING PAPER APPLICATIONS She told the Washington Examiner that the administration needs to use all the tools at its disposal, including the council, to compete with China.","The 16-person council was established during the second Obama administration through the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act to improve transparency and predictability for certain infrastructure projects making their way through the federal permitting process.

As required by the National Environmental Policy Act, most of these projects are required to secure federal permits and environmental reviews from numerous agencies before they can begin construction — a process that can take years thanks to legal challenges and bureaucratic red tape.

In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Domenech said the Permitting Council acts as a “Sherpa” to help large projects through the process in a timely manner, by anticipating various problems and ensuring agencies are able to stick to agreed-upon timelines for reviews.

Not all energy infrastructure and manufacturing projects are eligible for this expedited process. To qualify, they must meet a $200 million investment threshold.

The council is then able to establish a timeline for the project developer and figure out how many and which permits they will need, as well as what milestones the developer and federal agencies will need to hit for the project to break ground in, ideally, a matter of months instead of years.

Under this process, the council has been able to move 25% faster than the traditional federal permitting process since 2021, when the agency was made a permanent federal agency through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

But in a perfect world, Domenech said, the council should not have to exist.

“I joke a lot that I took this job knowing that I would love to put the Permitting Council out of business, because we fix federal permitting for everyone and we don’t need it,” Domenech told the Washington Examiner.

She said the council works well because of its transparency and its ability to connect directly with agency leads on reviews required for each project.

“We really serve as that Sherpa through the whole federal process to ensure that a project developer can get to groundbreaking,” Domenech said.

Top priorities

Until Congress is able to pass meaningful permitting reform into law, Domenech plans to utilize the council’s authority to help break ground on as many projects as it can during the second Trump administration.

The council manages roughly 19 different categories of projects, including energy production, critical mineral mining, pipelines, waterways, and transmission.

Domenech said manufacturing, within and outside the energy sector, will be a top priority for the council under her leadership, including helping expedite artificial intelligence data centers, quantum computing facilities, and much more.

As of Friday, the council has 38 “covered” projects under its purview that meet the requirements established by the FAST Act. It also manages a separate set of 24 projects through its transparency program, many of which are related to critical minerals mining but might not meet all the requirements to be considered “covered.”

Potential roadblocks

Domenech said she hopes to see that number grow exponentially within the next two years, but she is expecting to face hurdles brought on by decades-old environmental laws that she said are “overdue for updating.”

“They don’t really work with today’s environment, and the regulatory process that has been attached to those laws has grown far beyond what I think Congress intended when they were first passed,” she said.

Drew Bond, chairman and CEO of public policy nonprofit C3 Solutions, said that the council will likely face pushback from environmental groups that he described as being “anti-growth” and anti-development.”

Bond warned that Domenech could face legal challenges as she looks to increase the number of projects in the council’s portfolio.

“There’s a whole host of environmental lawyers and lobbyists that make plenty of money off of the complexity of these processes,” Bond told the Washington Examiner.

Bipartisan engagement

Before joining the Trump administration, Domenech worked as a senior policy adviser to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy. She worked closely on permitting and energy policy and served as the lead negotiator on NEPA reforms enacted by the bipartisan Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.

Given her background, Domenech’s appointment has been well received by industry and policy leaders across the aisle.

In a statement provided to the Washington Examiner, Eric Beightel, the permitting council director under former President Joe Biden, said he was pleased with the president’s choice.

“The Permitting Council is still a young agency with a broad and ambitious mission and Emily is well qualified to lead the Council through a dynamic time for infrastructure development,” Beightel said.

“I’m hopeful that the foundation we laid will be a strong starting point for her to put her mark on the agency and provide industry with the transparency, predictability, and accountability that is so critical to delivering the infrastructure needed to grow our economy,” he added.

Domenech said she believes there is bipartisan support for getting permitting done faster in the U.S., particularly as concerns grow over the speed at which China and other adversaries are ramping up their own industries.

She told the Washington Examiner that the administration needs to use all the tools at its disposal, including the council, to compete with China.

TRENTON TAKES New Jersey manufacturing also takes a hit in the proposed FY26 budget.
The spending plan eliminates a $2 million line-item for the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program (NJMEP) and $10 million budget line-item for NJEDA’s wildly successful Manufacturing Voucher Program (MVP).
The good news for New Jersey manufacturing, Emigholz said, is Murphy’s proposed budget also has a new manufacturing tax credit proposal to incentivize next-generation manufacturers from around the world to come to New Jersey.","With less than a month to go before the finalization of the FY26 State Budget, the focus for many is how much of the $1.2 billion in new and expanded taxes in Gov. Phil Murphy’s proposal sticks.

But NJBIA Chief Government Affairs Officer Christopher Emigholz said a bright light also needs to be turned to restoring funding in two key workforce areas that took a big hit in the initial proposal – manufacturing and higher education.

“This is crunch time for our county colleges and our manufacturing industry,” Emigholz said. “When we talk about education, workforce development and giving residents a chance to earn good paying jobs that hopefully keeps them in the state, these are funds that are desperately needed.

“The good news is most of the lawmakers we’ve spoken to on both sides of the aisle seem to understand the importance of restoring this funding in the final budget. But at the same time, this is also a challenging budget to balance.

“At the end of the day, we need to ensure Governor Murphy and the Legislature realize that shorting community colleges and manufacturing will have long-term reverberations on our overall economy.”

THE COLLEGE TRY

The governor’s proposed FY26 budget calls for a cut of $20 million, or 12%, in operating aid for New Jersey community colleges.

There are also proposed cuts that scale back New Jersey’s commitment to free or reduced tuition for low- and moderate-income community college students, with an 18% cut to the Community College Opportunity Grant, and a 50% cut to the small, but important Student Success Incentive Funding.

In response to the proposed cuts, New Jersey Council of County Colleges President Aaron Fichtner said the state’s 18 community colleges serve as a foundation for everywhere the state wants to grow – namely innovation and entrepreneurship, healthcare, renewable energy, biotech, pharmaceuticals, fintech, and film and television.

“The workforce that our state’s entrepreneurs, innovators, and businesses rely on for their success in these and other sectors runs through our state’s 18 community colleges, which power the state’s economy and provide lifechanging education and career pathways to 240,000 students of all ages and backgrounds every year,” Fichtner said.

“Governor Murphy also said we need to ‘seize on this economic momentum and create a new generation of economic opportunities for everyone.’ We couldn’t agree more. And no institutions in New Jersey provide more opportunities than our state’s community colleges,” Fichtner added.

Emigholz said such cuts to county colleges would also make New Jersey less competitive as states like New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, and California are greatly increasing their investments.

“We cannot understand the importance these schools serve for our young residents as they choose their direction in the world,” Emigholz said. “They provide opportunities for those who may not be able to afford a four-year college, or those who are still deciding their path. And New Jersey is blessed to have such strong community colleges to find a pathway to success.

“But at the same time, these schools cost more and more to operate, especially when you’re looking at increases in healthcare costs, energy costs and service costs to run a quality campus. These schools need to be able to compensate their faculty, adjunct professors and staff to give the students the tools they need to succeed.

“It really is critical that this funding is restored in the final budget,” Emigholz said.

TRENTON TAKES

New Jersey manufacturing also takes a hit in the proposed FY26 budget.

The spending plan eliminates a $2 million line-item for the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program (NJMEP) and $10 million budget line-item for NJEDA’s wildly successful Manufacturing Voucher Program (MVP).

While NJMEP President and CEO Peter Connolly has expressed cautious optimism that the state funding will return in the final budget, it’s still very much a time of anxiety for the organization as federal funding for all MEPs has been on the chopping block for next year under President Donald Trump.

MEP centers are a public-private partnership network that provides small and medium-sized manufacturers with tools, training, and expertise to improve processes, increase capacity, and bolster their workforce.

Since 2019, NJMEP has helped to achieve the following:

20,278 jobs created or retained

A massive $1.42 billion in wage impact

$130.03 in economic impact for every $1 invested

More than $515.6 million in new sales supported, $1.46 billion in retained sales, and $125.9 million in cost savings to small-medium manufacturers

“This is going to sound like home cooking, but it really is truth – the NJMEP is one of the best and most impactful of its kind in the nation,” Emigholz said. “It’s important that the funding comes back.”

The zeroing of NJEDA’s $10 million for the Manufacturing Voucher Program, which has successfully provided manufacturing investment in capital equipment over the past two years, is another blow for the industry in New Jersey, Emigholz said.

The good news for New Jersey manufacturing, Emigholz said, is Murphy’s proposed budget also has a new manufacturing tax credit proposal to incentivize next-generation manufacturers from around the world to come to New Jersey.

But the funding cuts still does not send a good message to the industry.

“If the Governor and Legislature are serious about supporting manufacturing and innovation, the funding for these two manufacturing line items should be restored to complement the proposed tax credit and not offset it,” Emigholz said.",https://njbia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-2025-06-05T234056.363.png,N,,2025-06-07 19:06:31.001881

With continued investments in CCS, along with economic growth and pro-energy policies, Louisiana is well positioned to lead in this golden age of America-first energy production.","Louisiana has been a pioneer in our nation’s energy sector for more than a century. Its natural resources, strategic location, skilled workforce and robust infrastructure are key factors in maintaining our state’s position as a global energy provider.

Fueled by investments in innovative technologies like CCS, economic growth and pro-energy leadership, Louisiana is poised to enter a new era of America-first energy production.

There’s nothing new about Louisiana embracing energy advancement. From the first pipelines to the start of the offshore O&G industry in the 1940s, innovation has always been our strength. Because of Louisiana’s tremendous ability to innovate, energy leaders champion CCS technology and are implementing it throughout the state.

CCS is complementary to O&G, not its competitor, and a crucial technology that Louisiana has been developing since the early 1990s. Louisiana’s ideal geology and infrastructure make it a favorable location for CO2 injection and storage. Additionally, our state has a manufacturing sector and workforce equipped with the skills and experience gained from our petrochemical and O&G industries.

Implementing CCS technology allows companies to meet the global market demand for low-carbon energy production. Major industry leaders are heavily invested in CCS projects, with Louisiana attracting over $20 billion in private investments. These investments not only help reduce emissions but also support the local economy, creating thousands of jobs and generating millions in revenue for the state. In fact, several Louisiana communities have already seen significant economic growth, including $4.5 billion in Ascension Parish for Air Products to build a clean energy complex, as well as $200 million in Vermilion Parish for CF Industries, EnLink and ExxonMobil’s CCUS project.

Despite strong industry support for this essential technology, CCS projects in Louisiana continue to face challenges, mainly from a public misperception about safety and environmental impact. These challenges could prevent good CCS jobs and billions of investment dollars from staying in Louisiana. We have to do a better job of listening to concerns, providing answers and sharing the facts about CCS.

Last year, Louisiana was granted primacy, giving the state permitting authority over Class VI wells. This move to streamline regulatory oversight reduces bureaucratic delays and ensures the safe and efficient management of CCS projects. Currently, Shell, Exxon Mobil and Venture Global have already made progress in the permitting process, showcasing the industry’s commitment to incorporating CCS technology to support advanced energy production.

Today, our national energy interests show no signs of slowing down. The Trump administration’s ""drill baby drill"" culture has revitalized American energy independence and dominance by reducing regulations, expanding LNG exports, opening offshore energy leases in the Gulf and increasing domestic O&G production. In Louisiana, the industry’s efforts to advance Americanmade energy through innovation are also well supported. Under Governor Landry’s leadership, and in partnership with the Louisiana Department of Energy & Natural Resources and Louisiana Economic Development, the state ensures safe and responsible management of CCS activities. It does so while promoting transparency and community engagement to support federal energy initiatives and secure the long-term expansion of Louisiana’s energy sector.

American energy and Louisiana energy will thrive through innovation — we know this because that’s what we’ve done for over 100 years. With continued investments in CCS, along with economic growth and pro-energy policies, Louisiana is well positioned to lead in this golden age of America-first energy production. As we work to maintain and secure our domestic energy independence, Louisiana can pave the way for a more sustainable future of American energy prosperity.",https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/34161/download/AdobeStock_Carbon_Capture_Refinery.jpg?cb=1afc2f41556ba045f13c78376fea4b7f&w=1200,N,,2025-06-07 13:12:07.876673

As a mission champion for the North East, it’s my responsibility to make sure the government’s agenda for change is working for our region and that we’re moving at pace to meet key goals around economic growth. I’m confident in the progress we’re making.

In my constituency of Darlington, local organisations are already making a big impact – both here and globally. Last month, I had a fantastic visit to the Thermal Insulation Contractors Association (TICA) at their training centre in Darlington. It was great to meet their apprentices and see the high-quality training being delivered.

I was really impressed by the technical skills, enthusiasm, and the clear paths to well-paid, meaningful jobs. Supporting trades like thermal insulation is so important, not just for boosting the economy and social mobility, but for hitting our long-term environmental goals.

TICA’s apprenticeship programme has bucked the national trend of falling numbers. This year, they’re welcoming a record 200 apprentices and pushing for more women to join a traditionally male-dominated sector. With nearly 30% of the workforce set to retire soon, they shared their plan to encourage each contractor to take on one more apprentice – a smart, forward-thinking move to secure the future of this vital low-carbon industry and to bring more long-standing, high-skilled jobs to our area.

Another key player in Darlington is Cummins, whose “Destination Zero” strategy is driving the transition to net-zero. Through the development of cleaner internal combustion engines compatible with low-carbon fuels like hydrogen and HVO, as well as zero-emissions technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, Cummins is not only advancing innovation but also creating high-quality jobs that support a more sustainable future for the region.

This Labour government has already proved time and again that it is on the side of working people in our region. Ministers have successfully secured a £500mn deal with Hitachi, safeguarding hundreds of local jobs, boosting our economy, and reinforcing our strong ties with the railway industry as it continues to lead in rail technology.

Partnerships like these are positioning our region to become a true powerhouse of modern industry. The announcement of a £22bn investment in cutting-edge carbon capture technology in Teesside marks a major milestone in the UK’s journey to net-zero. This transformative initiative will directly create 4,000 jobs, support an additional 40,000 roles, and attract £8bnin private investment, providing a significant boost to Britain’s industrial heartlands. It’s a game changer for our communities, driving sustainable growth and providing well-paid, skilled jobs for the future.

The people of our region know the value of hard graft; they know the value of good secure work, and we're proud of our contribution. We were at the forefront of the last industrial revolution, and I'm determined that we'll be at the forefront of Labour's bold strategy for energy independence. We know our value and we deserve these opportunities. We’re at a turning point. Public and private investment is coming in, our area is ready to make the most of it. People voted for a better future for them, their families and our communities and Labour is delivering just that.

She made the comments in an interview for Guardian Australia’s Australian Politics podcast, released on Friday.

“This Labor government, so far, is still walking both sides of the fence and it’s confusing as hell for the private sector in terms of investing their money. Do we continue to invest in coal and gas, and for how long, or do we double down on the renewables?

“If we just had some certainty – some long, loud and legal signs from the government about a direction and pace of travel on climate – we could have literally tens, if not hundreds of billions of [dollars of] investment from superannuation, private wealth, flowing into those solutions in large scale wind, and solar, and storage and batteries, and energy efficiency, and all of those things,” she said.

“But we haven’t had it, and that is where it’s not so much big or small government – it’s about just smart government.

“Government has a role to be clearer with what its policy directions and settings are, and you’ll see just how amazing the business community can be … because as soon as they smell an opportunity to make some money, and do good and have fun, people want to go on board that bandwagon for sure.”

Boele said the environment minister, Murray Watt, should face tougher scrutiny over his decision to approve Woodside’s expansion of the North West Shelf gas project to 2070, a development she called “a climate bomb”.

“This is a party that I thought did understand the climate science. I’ve been watching the treasurer managing the economy in the last term, and [he’s] done, frankly, quite a formidable job in that,” she said.

“This decision, for example, just makes no sense to me economically, scientifically. There’s got to be a political reason why it’s happened.”

Anthony Albanese defended the North West Shelf decision on Friday, telling ABC radio in Melbourne that Watt had to assess the application based on strict interpretation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.

Bradfield was the last outstanding seat from the 3 May election, but the result could still be challenged by the Liberals in the court of disputed returns.

Kapterian said in a statement she would carefully review the count, stopping short of congratulating Boele. Any candidate or elector from the seat can challenge the result within 40 days of the return of the election writ.

But Boele said she was confident the result would withstand by possible legal challenge.

“I had intrinsically felt that our democracy is one of the best in the world, that the electoral commission is not only independent, but very well run, and very thorough. And watching this process has given me that confidence.

“Built into the system is the court of disputed returns and that is an important check and balance as well. So if the other side wants to challenge, that’s completely their prerogative.

Trump said Musk’s vocal opposition to Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” is based on its elimination of incentives for electric vehicles (EVs).

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

While the bill may not be all bad for Musk – including preserving Trump’s 2017 income tax cuts – it contains significant provisions that impact Musk’s flagship company. It also rolls back green-tax incentives.

Since he’s stepped away of the Trump administration, the entrepreneur has been a vocal critic of the legislation, including lamenting that “there is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

While the House narrowly passed its version of the bill in late May, it is facing hurdles in the Senate, where it is so far losing some momentum.

Here’s a look at the provisions that may be particularly impactful for the company – as well as other electric vehicle and climate-friendly energy companies:

Eliminates EV tax credits

One major way in which the “big, beautiful bill” harms Tesla is by making its cars more expensive.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act lifted a cap allowing manufacturers that had already sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles to once again be eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit. It also extended eligibility for the credit through 2032

The bill effectively made the cars $7,500 cheaper for consumers.

But, the credits are cut in the GOP’s bill. Without that credit, Tesla and other EV makers may make fewer sales. One major hurdle facing the adoption of electric vehicles is that they are oftentimes more expensive than gas-powered cars.

However, Musk has contended when he was supporting Trump that he does not need the tax credit.

Cuts credits for solar energy

Tesla Energy sells both rooftop solar energy and grid scale solar power – both of which are hampered by the Republican bill.

The legislation axes tax credits for rooftop solar after this year.

It also eliminates tax credits for any grid scale project that begins construction more than 60 days after the bill is enacted. Projects also need to begin producing energy by the end of 2028 to become eligible.

These utility scale cuts are controversial even within the GOP and could face changes in the Senate.

Axes Biden-era EV regulations

The legislation would eliminate a Biden-era regulation that forces the electric vehicle market to shift toward EVs.

While Tesla is already all-electric, doing so could still impact its bottom line, as the way the regulations are set up, automakers either have to make their vehicles greener or purchase credits from automakers like Tesla that already outperform the regulations.

If the regulation is weakened, traditional car manufacturers may not have to buy as many credits from EV-makers like Tesla.

However, it’s not clear whether this provision will make it into what’s ultimately passed because it will first need to be approved by the Senate parliamentarian, which sets the rules for what types of provisions are eligible in legislation passed through a procedure that requires just 50 votes.",https://www.wspa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/53/2025/06/Tesla_060725_Getty_Spencer-Platt.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-08 00:01:28.080523

Ten years ago, Pope Francis told the world we needed to take climate change seriously with Laudato Si.","This year marks the 10th anniversary of Pope Francis’ 2015 encyclical Laudato Si, a groundbreaking letter to the entire world addressing global warming and the unjust pillaging of our common home.

Laudato Si inspired humanity to see climate change as far more than a fringe concern for environmentalists, but as the fundamental “life” issue of our time and an existential threat to humanity. Laudato Si forever linked the ecological collapse unfolding around us with scarcity conflicts, forced migration and the plight of the world’s poor, marginalized and forgotten.

On May 8, the first American was elected to succeed Pope Francis and immediately signaled his continued commitment to Catholic social justice by taking the name Leo XIV, invoking the author of Rerum Novarum, which outlined modern Catholic teaching on social justice. While it remains to be seen how Pope Leo XIV moves the message of Laudato Si through his papacy, initial indications are encouraging.

On May 19, Pope Leo XIV stated: “If we Christians and members of other religious traditions stand together, free from ideological and political conditioning, we can be effective in saying ‘no’ to war and ‘yes’ to peace, ‘no’ to an economy that impoverishes people and the Earth and ‘yes’ to integral development.”

On May 22, the House of Representatives narrowly passed a budget bill that drastically cuts U.S. commitments to the working poor and hard-won progress on clean energy and climate. Maine’s two congressional representatives, Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden, proudly stood against the injustices and negligence of this legislation, with the extremely careful Rep. Golden even calling it “one of the easiest ‘no’ votes I’ve ever taken.”

The cruelty and recklessness of this legislation couldn’t be more transparent: (1) cutting $800 billion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act; (2) cutting food assistance (which feeds 1 in 8 Mainers), putting 18 million kids nationally at risk of losing school meals; (3) increasing health care costs by an average of $180 per month for tens of thousands of Mainers; (4) adding $3.1 trillion to the national debt to benefit the affluent (giving households earning more than $1 million a year an annual tax cut around $90,000, while low-income households receive an average of just $90 from the tax cuts — while burdening them with increased costs from Medicaid and SNAP rollbacks).

On energy and climate, experts warn this budget raises energy costs for Mainers by 4.7% in four years, increases pollution and local health costs, and decimates clean energy investments transforming our statewide and national energy grid (to the glee of our rivals like China, which increasingly corners the clean energy market, where the winner of the 21st-century economy is being decided).

Mainers will suffer greatly under this legislation. Ending clean energy tax credits will put energy-efficient heat pumps, insulation and rooftop solar out of reach just when we need their help to save money, reduce pollution and stabilize our energy grid.

Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will add $13 billion and support 39,000 full-time jobs in Maine annually. That’s not hypothetical — that’s real money and real livelihoods for Mainers. Rural job creators like Lincoln Battery Storage Project, Northern Maine Renewables Program, County Line Wind Farm and others would likely be shuttered with this legislation.

Maine has become a true climate leader and energy leader, thanks to the outstanding work of the Maine Climate Council; bipartisan lawmakers like Gov. Janet Mills and Sens. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, and Stacy Brenner, D-Scarborough; and business and community groups like ClimateWorks Maine and E2Tech. We are grateful for Maine U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King, who have likewise led admirably to address climate change and clean energy. Compliance with the current budget’s painful unraveling of the progress would only hurt Maine’s economy, people and environment.

Ten years ago, Pope Francis told the world we needed to take climate change seriously with Laudato Si. Ten years ago, Sens. King and Collins were in the audience when Pope Francis personally called on the U.S. government to protect the poor, the marginalized and God’s life-giving gift to us all, our common home.

Abraham Lincoln, our nation's first Republican president, created the U.S. Department of Agriculture to promote U.S. farming and laid the groundwork for the National Park System when he signed a law protecting the Yosemite Valley in 1864. Ulysses S. Grant went on to establish Yellowstone National Park, the first of its kind.

Benjamin Harrison set aside the first national forest reserves in 1891, creating the framework for conservation of today's national forests.

Our nation's most celebrated conservation champion, Theodore Roosevelt, preserved more than 230 million acres of land and led the reintroduction of the American buffalo.

In more recent years, Richard Nixon in 1970 created the Environmental Protection Agency by executive order and signed into law a dozen major environmental statutes, including the Endangered Species Act. Ronald Reagan led global efforts to save the ozone layer with the Montreal Protocol. President George H.W. Bush fought acid rain, pushing forward despite strong opposition from industry. Donald Trump had significant environmental and energy wins in his first term, including the Great American Outdoors Act and paved the way for new developments in nuclear energy.

This list goes on, but what makes the Republican Party truly a leader is our ongoing commitment to conservation and careful stewardship of what we value most. At our core, Republicans are preservationists.

We have long advocated that individuals and communities should make decisions about their land and resources. Private landowners, farmers and ranchers have often been the first environmental stewards, managing their land with an understanding of its needs and limits. From managing wetlands, creating wildlife corridors and promoting sustainable forestry, conservatives understand that local solutions often work best. Government intervention should be a last resort. In many cases, the free market and local communities are the most successful drivers of change.

Rather than relying on top-down regulations, conservatives support incentivizing sustainable practices through tax credits, grants and market-driven solutions. This allows individuals to make decisions while contributing to broader environmental goals. More than 20 years ago, I recognized the value of preserving my farmland and placed the first voluntary conservation easement in Hamilton County. Since then, in my roles as a board member and chairman of The Land Trust for Tennessee, the organization has protected more than 4,400 acres in Hamilton County and nearly 140,000 acres of farmland and forests across the state.

This year, I was proud to guide passage of the Farmland Preservation Act, historic legislation that establishes a grant fund to support farmers who voluntarily choose to protect their land for future generations. Together, these efforts continue to shape a stronger, more sustainable future for our state.

From an economic perspective, conservation makes sense for conservatives. A free-market economy relies on stable, long-term resources. The loss of biodiversity, depletion of natural resources and degradation of ecosystems all have economic costs that affect everyone. Whether it's the collapse of wetlands, the decline of soil productivity or the destruction of forests and farms from unchecked development, environmental degradation threatens the economic foundation of society.

Protecting natural resources is essential to maintaining food security, a concern that touches every American household. Productive farms rely on healthy soil, clean water, pollinators and a stable climate. Without these natural resources, farmers, many of whom operate family owned, generational farms, struggle to grow crops and raise livestock. Strengthening domestic food production reduces reliance on foreign imports and upholds the conservative values of self-reliance, economic stability and national strength.

Conservation also plays a role in national security. For decades, conservatives have advocated for energy independence, which requires careful management of natural resources. Relentless fossil fuel extraction without regard for environmental impact makes the U.S. more vulnerable to foreign energy dependence and destabilizes the energy infrastructure. Promoting energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy and protecting carbon storing natural areas can ensure America remains self-reliant in a changing world. Finally, conservation is deeply tied to patriotism. America's natural beauty is key to our national identity, from the Great Smoky Mountains, Yellowstone and the vast American West. Protecting these lands preserves the American spirit and ensures we may continue to enjoy the outdoors.

As the challenges of environmental degradation grow, it's crucial for all of us to step up and make conservation a priority. Conservatives will continue to lead the way in this important cause.

Sean Duffy, who was appointed as Secretary of Transportation on the back of the transportation “expertise” he showed as a contestant on Road Rules: All Stars, a reality TV travel game show, announced the rule on his first day in office.

His original memo promised a review of all existing fuel economy standards, which require manufacturers to make more efficient vehicles which save you money on fuel.

Specifically, the rule finalized today targets the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard (CAFE), which was just improved last year by President Biden’s DOT, saving American drivers $23 billion in fuel costs by meaning they need to buy less fuel overall. The savings from the Biden rule could have been higher, but were softened from the original proposal due to automaker lobbying.

Sierra Club’s Transportation for All director, Katherine Garcia, responded to the new Duffy rule’s finalization with a statement:

“The Trump administration’s deregulatory, pro-polluter transportation agenda will only increase costs for Americans. Making our vehicles less fuel efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump. This action puts the well-being of our communities at risk in every way imaginable. It will lead to fewer clean vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health, and increase climate pollution. The Sierra Club will continue to push back against this administration’s dangerous clean transportation rollbacks.”

The rule had been filed on Mar 16, and review was completed yesterday. Oddly enough, the rule was filed as “not economically significant,” a categorization for government rules that won’t affect the US economy by more than $100 million – which is less than the $23 billion that the DOT’s own analysis says the new rule will cost Americans.

Both we at Electrek and the Sierra Club had a meeting with the government to point out this inconsistency, but both of our meetings were scheduled for today and were cancelled late last night. There seems to have been no public comment period regarding this change in regulations.

DOT isn’t done raising your fuel costs, it wants to do more

Duffy’s original DOT memo says he wants to target all similar standards, rather than just the improvements made last year – so in fact, our headline likely underestimates how much higher Duffy wants to make your fuel costs.

A recent analysis by Consumer Reports shows that fuel economy standards are enormously popular with Americans, and that maintaining the current standards could result in lifetime savings of $6,000 per vehicle, compared to current costs, by 2029. And that fuel economy standards implemented since 2001 have already saved $9,000 per vehicle. Now, imagine the net effect of removing all of those standards, which Duffy has directed the DOT to examine doing.

As we’ve already seen to be the case often with Trump’s allies, the DOT memo lied about its intentions. Just like EPA head Lee Zeldin, who said he wants to make the air cleaner by making it dirtier, Duffy, says he wants to make fuel costs lower by making them higher. The memo attempts to argue that your car will be cheaper if it has lower fuel economy, even though it wont, because buying more fuel will mean you spend more on fuel, not less.

Unequivocally, over here in the real world, dirtier air is actually dirtier, and higher fuel costs are actually higher.

The result of this increased fuel usage also inevitably means more reliance on foreign sources of energy. The more oil America uses, the more it will have to import from elsewhere. Other countries looking to exercise power over the US could certainly choose to raise prices as they recognize that the US has just become more reliant on them.

And, as we know from the most basic understanding of economics, adding more demand means prices will go up, not down. Reducing demand for a product in fact forces prices down, and EVs are already displacing oil demand which depresses oil prices.

Meanwhile, Biden’s higher fuel economy standards would mean that automakers need to provide a higher mix of EVs, which inherently get all of their energy to run not just domestically, but regionally as well. Most electricity generation happens regionally or locally based on what resources are available in your area, so when you charge a car, you’re typically supporting jobs at your local power plant, rather than in some overseas oil country.

But these are just attempts to follow-through on the dirty air, inflation causing promises that the republicans made during the campaign. Mr. Trump signaled he intended to raise your fuel costs (and costs of everything else) during the 2024 US Presidential campaign, when he asked oil executives for $1 billion in bribes in return for killing off more efficient vehicles.

Since he made his way back into the White House (despite that there exists a clear legal remedy stopping insurrectionists from holding office in the US), republicans have tried to follow through on this promise and more – not only trying to make your cars more expensive, but also threatening US energy dominance, sending US jobs to China and illegally attacking clean air laws.

However, whiplash changes in regulatory regimes like this are typically seen as bad for business. Above all, businesses desire regulatory certainty so they can plan products into the future, and there are few businesses with longer planning timelines than automakers.

This is why automakers want the EPA to retain Biden’s emissions rules, because they’re already planning new models for the EV transition. They went through this once before, in the chaos of 2017-2021, where they originally asked for rollbacks but then realized their mistake, and now still complain about the broken regulatory regime caused by the last time a former reality TV host squatted in the White House.

Further, if American manufacturing turns away from the EV transition, or continues to make tepid movement towards it, this will only hand more of a manufacturing lead to China, meaning more decline of American manufacturing (compared to the huge manufacturing boom seen under President Biden).

Finally, the most important problem with DOT’s final rule is that it will increase emissions, which harms your health and increases climate change. Much like the other trends we’ve seen here, this administration doesn’t know much about the basics of climate science, which is already costing America $150 billion a year in increased infrastructure costs related to damage from natural disasters.

And that’s not even counting health costs, which will be even higher. The aggregate of these damages could cost each American born today $500,000 over their lifetime.

But all of these harms will happen to real people. This isn’t reality television, where the intent is to make up drama for views. This is actual harm that’s actually going to be done to Americans, who are having a rough time as the global economy continues to grapple with the long-term disruptions resulting from a pandemic that was exacerbated by the same reality TV host, and of course the ever-present worsening climate change.

In a filing Friday in the U.S. Court of International Trade, Detroit Axle urged swift action in the case, suggesting its business is near crumbling in the current tariff environment.
The order said the government attorneys must respond to Detroit Axle's requests for relief by June 20, with Detroit Axle needing to file a reply by July 7.
""So by the end of June, Detroit Axle will likely be forced to close its doors and lay off hundreds of employees in Michigan.""
The Justice Department and an attorney for Detroit Axle didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.","Detroit Axle, a large aftermarket auto parts dealer based in Ferndale, says it may go out of business within weeks unless it gets certain tariff relief on the goods it imports from China.

The company sued President Donald Trump's administration last month over a tariff policy that ended the ""de minimis"" exemption, which previously allowed small-value packages from China to enter the country duty-free. In a filing Friday in the U.S. Court of International Trade, Detroit Axle urged swift action in the case, suggesting its business is near crumbling in the current tariff environment.

""Detroit Axle’s situation is dire; it will likely be forced to shutter most or all of its business and lay off hundreds of employees if it does not receive relief by the end of June,"" attorneys for the company wrote. ""And every day that passes without relief brings new irreparable harm to the company in the form of lost business opportunities, customer goodwill, and reputation.""

The court filing was discovered by the website Court Watch.

The family-run company, which says it employs more than 500 people total and more than 230 in Michigan, is a nationwide retailer and distributor of car parts for mechanics and do-it-yourselfers with a pair of locations in Metro Detroit.

But it says that the problem with the small-value package exception centers on its distribution operation in Juarez, Mexico, which receives parts from China before shipping them out to U.S. customers. Before, shipments worth under $800 could avoid being taxed at the U.S. border, but in early May, Trump's move to end that exemption took effect.

That has left the company to pay a ""crippling 72.5% tariff on goods that it ships from its Mexico facility to consumers in the United States,"" its attorneys wrote. The company argues that the administration exceeded its authority and didn't follow proper rule-making procedure when it axed the small-value goods exception.

The retailer said in court filings that it has temporarily kept its doors open — including at the Michigan locations, which also distribute parts — by fulfilling customer orders from inventory it already had on hand that wasn't subject to tariffs. But now those supplies are running out.

On Thursday, the court denied a U.S. Justice Department motion to pause the litigation amid a larger legal fight over Trump's tariffs that is pending. The order said the government attorneys must respond to Detroit Axle's requests for relief by June 20, with Detroit Axle needing to file a reply by July 7.

But the company said Friday that's simply not a fast enough timetable as it tries to save the business from ""destruction.""

""The company cannot absorb the massively increased costs from the 72.5% tariffs and cannot meaningfully raise prices on its cost-conscious customers,"" company attorneys wrote. ""So by the end of June, Detroit Axle will likely be forced to close its doors and lay off hundreds of employees in Michigan.""

Justice Department lawyers, as they requested to temporarily halt the case proceedings as other tariff legal challenges moved forward, argued that Detroit Axle is ""hard-pressed to argue that it is suffering actual and immediate hardship"" because it didn't file its case very quickly, instead waiting until about two weeks after the new policy took effect.

The Justice Department and an attorney for Detroit Axle didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.

This monumental achievement highlights the brand’s intensified commitment to sustainability and ecological restoration, taking its environmental efforts to new heights.

Marriott India has made a powerful environmental statement by planting 100,000 trees across more than 150 of its hotels nationwide, aligning this large-scale sustainability initiative with World Environment Day 2025. This bold achievement not only commemorates the global day dedicated to environmental awareness but also reinforces Marriott’s long-term commitment to corporate social responsibility and ecological restoration. By executing one of the most extensive tree-planting campaigns within the Indian hospitality sector, Marriott India has set a new industry benchmark, showcasing how corporate action can drive meaningful change in the face of environmental challenges.

The initiative reflects the brand’s core values around sustainability, conservation, and community engagement. Each tree planted contributes to combating deforestation, improving local air quality, supporting biodiversity, and strengthening the green infrastructure surrounding Marriott’s properties. Beyond environmental benefits, the campaign also demonstrates Marriott’s intent to lead by example—mobilizing its workforce, guests, and local communities in a shared mission of environmental stewardship. As climate concerns rise globally, this milestone places Marriott India at the forefront of eco-conscious hospitality, proving that luxury and sustainability can coexist. With this impactful initiative, the brand not only meets its ambitious green target but also inspires the broader industry to take tangible steps toward a more sustainable future.

This significant milestone follows the success of last year’s “Two Trees per Room” initiative, introduced on World Environment Day 2024. That program, a key element of Marriott India’s sustainability strategy, saw more than 32,600 trees planted by over 4,900 volunteers. This year, Marriott India elevated its impact, setting a new benchmark for environmental action and reinforcing its resolve to contribute to a healthier, more sustainable planet.

Each Marriott India hotel played a vital role in the initiative by engaging in local tree-planting campaigns. Working alongside well-established reforestation organizations, the program aimed to greatly expand the company’s green footprint. The trees were carefully planted in locations selected to restore ecosystems, support biodiversity, mitigate climate change, and uplift local communities.

“Marriott India is incredibly proud to have successfully achieved our goal of planting 100,000 trees, a testament to our profound dedication to environmental responsibility,” said Sanjay Gupta – Chairman of the Marriott India Business Council. “This ambitious goal truly underscores our belief that sustainability is not just a passing trend, but a fundamental pillar of responsible hospitality. We are committed to making a lasting, positive impact on our environment for generations to come.“

Marriott India’s prestigious hotels, including The St. Regis Goa, JW Marriott Goa, and W Goa, made a notable contribution to World Environment Day by planting a total of 1,564 trees, underscoring the brand’s unwavering dedication to promoting environmental sustainability.

This effort is just one part of Marriott India’s broader commitment to sustainable practices. In addition to this tree-planting initiative, the company continually embraces innovative solutions to reduce its ecological footprint. These efforts include energy-efficient operations, comprehensive waste reduction strategies, and a focus on responsible sourcing. Through these initiatives, Marriott India strives to set new standards for sustainable hospitality in the industry, leading by example in the pursuit of a greener future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/W-Goa-Tree-Plantation-Drive-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 16:07:27.874683

The House bill had initially proposed a phaseout of those credits over the next several years.","Washington: Chiselling away at President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Rolling back the green energy tax breaks from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. At its core, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” is more than just an extension of tax breaks approved during President Donald Trump’s first term at the White House.

The package is an attempt by Republicans to undo, little by little, the signature domestic achievements of the past two Democratic presidents.

“We’re going to do what we said we were going to do,” Speaker Mike Johnson said after House passage last month.

While the sprawling 1,000-page-plus bill aims to preserve an estimated USD 4.5 trillion in tax cuts that would otherwise expire at year’s end if Congress fails to act, and add some new ones, including no taxes on tips, the spending cuts pointed at the Democratic-led programmes are causing the most political turmoil.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said this week that 10.9 million fewer people would have health insurance under the GOP bill, including 1.4 million immigrants in the US without legal status who are in state-funded programs. At the same time, lawmakers are being hounded by businesses in states across the nation who rely on the green energy tax breaks for their projects.

As the package moves from the House to the Senate, the simmering unrest over curbing the Obama and Biden policies shows just how politically difficult it can be to slash government programmes once they become part of civic life.

“When he asked me, what do you think the prospects are for passage in the Senate? I said, good, if we don’t cut Medicaid,” said Sen Josh Hawley, R-Mo, recounting his conversation last week with Trump. “And he said, I’m 100 per cent supportive of that.”

Health care worries

Not a single Republican in Congress voted for the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in 2010, or Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Both were approved using the same budget reconciliation process now being employed by Republicans to steamroll Trump’s bill past the opposition.

Even still, sizable coalitions of GOP lawmakers are forming to protect aspects of both of those programs as they ripple into the lives of millions of Americans.

Hawley, Sen Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and others are wary of changes to Medicaid and other provisions in the bill that would result in fewer people being able to access health care programs.

At the same time, crossover groupings of House and Senate Republicans have launched an aggressive campaign to preserve, at least for some time, the green energy tax breaks that business interests in their states are relying on to develop solar, wind and other types of energy production.

Murkowski said one area she’s “worried about” is the House bill’s provision that any project not under construction within 60 days of the bill becoming law may no longer be eligible for those credits.

“These are some of the things we’re working on,” she said.

The concerns are running in sometimes opposite directions and complicating the work of GOP leaders who have almost no votes to spare in the House and Senate as they try to hoist the package over Democratic opposition and onto the president’s desk by the Fourth of July.

While some Republicans are working to preserve the programs from cuts, the budget hawks want steeper reductions to stem the nation’s debt load. The CBO said the package would add USD 2.4 trillion to deficits over the decade.

After a robust private meeting with Trump at the White House this week, Republican senators said they were working to keep the bill on track as they amended it for their priorities.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the president “made the pitch and the argument for why we need to get the bill done.”

The disconnect is reminiscent of Trump’s first term, when Republicans promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, only to see their effort collapse dramatically when the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, voted thumbs down for the bill on the House floor.

Battle over Medicaid

In the 15 years since Obamacare became law, access to health care has grown substantially. Some 80 million people are now enrolled in Medicaid, and the Kaiser Family Foundation reports 41 states have opted to expand their coverage. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid to all adults with incomes up to about USD 21,500 for an individual, or almost USD 29,000 for a two-person household.

While Republicans no longer campaign on ending Obamacare, advocates warn that the changes proposed in the big bill will trim back access to health care.

The bill proposes new 80 hours of monthly work or community service requirements for able-bodied Medicaid recipients, age 18 to 64, with some exceptions. It also imposes twice-a-year eligibility verification checks and other changes.

Republicans argue that they want to right-size Medicaid to root out waste, fraud and abuse and ensure it’s there for those who need it most, often citing women and children.

“Medicaid was built to be a temporary safety net for people who genuinely need it, young, pregnant women, single mothers, the disabled, the elderly,” Johnson told The Associated Press.

“But when they expanded under Obamacare, it not only thwarted the purpose of the program, it started draining resources.”

Initially, the House bill proposed starting the work requirements in January 2029, as Trump’s term in the White House would be coming to a close. But conservatives from the House Freedom Caucus negotiated for a quicker start date, in December 2026, to start the spending reductions sooner.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has said the changes are an Obamacare rollback by another name.

“It decimates our health care system, decimates our clean energy system,” Schumer of New York said in an interview with the AP.

The green energy tax breaks involve not only those used by buyers of electric vehicles, like Elon Musk’s Tesla line, but also the production and investment tax credits for developers of renewables and other energy sources.

The House bill had initially proposed a phaseout of those credits over the next several years. But again, the conservative Freedom Caucus engineered the faster wind-down, within 60 days of the bill’s passage.

“Not a single Republican voted for the Green New Scam subsidies,” wrote Sen Mike Lee, R-Utah, on social media. “Not a single Republican should vote to keep them.”

Mr. Trump has signed executive orders aimed at expanding coal mining in the United States, including prioritizing coal mining on federal land.","The Trump administration on Friday greenlighted the expansion of a scandal-hit underground coal mine in Montana, one of the nation’s largest, cutting short a federal environmental review and putting into action a key element of President Trump’s plan to revive America’s coal industry.

In the past, the mine has been embroiled in allegations involving bribery, cocaine trafficking, firearms violations and the faked kidnapping of an executive.

The administration’s decision would extend the life of the Bull Mountain coal mine, which employs 250 people outside Billings, by nine years, the Interior Department said. It would allow the mine’s operator, Signal Peak Energy, to mine nearly 60 million tons of coal, mostly for export to Asia.

“This is what energy leadership looks like,” Doug Burgum, the Interior Secretary, said in a statement. He said Mr. Trump’s declaration, in January, of a national energy emergency “is allowing us to act decisively, cut bureaucratic delays and secure America’s future through energy independence and strategic exports.”

Environmental groups, which had pushed to halt the expansion of the Bull Mountain mine, condemned the decision. They pointed to how its operator had repeatedly violated worker-safety, pollution and environmental regulations.

Coal is also the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, and a major driver of global climate change. The coal industry’s decline had been helping to drive down the country’s carbon dioxide emissions.

“This is yet another disastrous decision by an administration that does not respect the rule of law,” said Shiloh Hernandez, senior attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental nonprofit. “Allowing it to expand will inflict further harm on the residents of the Bull Mountains and deepen the climate crisis.”

In a statement, Signal Peak said the action “breathes life into a mine that was within months of significantly curtailing operations.” It said the mine remained “committed to the environmentally responsible development of high-quality coal.”

Signal Peak Energy had separately sued the federal government, saying the Interior Department needed to speed up its approval of the mine’s expansion plans.

A federal judge last year dismissed the mine’s request to force a speedier review of its expansion, which involves federal coal leases. The Interior Department had said it would complete its environmental review by May 2026.

Where clean energy fits into the picture Some crypto mining companies use renewable power.","Crypto mining has sparked outrage in a small New York community near Seneca Lake.

The effects led Yvonne Taylor, founder of the nonprofit Seneca Lake Guardian, to warn, ""It's time to have a national conversation about the true cost of crypto mining,"" per City Magazine.

What is crypto mining?

Crypto mining is how cryptocurrency transactions get verified. Essentially, powerful computers solve math problems to keep the network secure and so miners can earn rewards.

This system, called ""proof-of-work,"" burns enormous amounts of energy, and that's where the backlash begins.

In Dresden, New York, a former gas plant was brought back to life by Greenidge Generation to power a crypto mining operation. The company says it helps the economy. However, locals say it's affecting their air, lake, and future.

Why crypto mining matters now

Crypto mining uses up to 2.3% of all U.S. electricity, according to a preliminary estimate from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That number could hit 8% by 2030, per City Magazine.

The publication noted Greenidge alone uses over 15 megawatts, also taking up to 139 million gallons of water daily from Seneca Lake, according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

Water is released back to the lake at temperatures as high as 108 degrees Fahrenheit, and that appears to be contributing to toxic algae blooms that threaten wildlife and recreation opportunities.

""The northwest quadrant of Seneca Lake, where Greenidge is located, had the highest incidence of harmful algae blooms last summer,"" Taylor said, per City Magazine. ""This is not just a New York State or Finger Lakes issue. Communities across the country are dealing with the same problems — air, noise, and water pollution.""

How crypto mining affects people and the environment

To many in Dresden, Greenidge isn't reviving the community. It's squeezing it.

The company says it creates jobs and adds value, but residents say those benefits are overstated and short-lived. Tourism is a major economic driver in the Finger Lakes, and locals worry that polluted air, noisy operations, and algae-choked water could turn visitors away.

The people who live there are dealing with the uncertainty about their health and property values. Many feel they're left cleaning up after an operation that's more interested in short-term profits than long-term stewardship.

Bill Roege of the Seneca Lake Pure Waters Association put it plainly to City Magazine: ""The company reaps the rewards, not the community.""

Where clean energy fits into the picture

Some crypto mining companies use renewable power. For example, Mara Holdings in Texas uses wind, while Genesis Mining moved to Iceland, where it can use hydroelectric and geothermal power, per the Guardian and City Magazine.

But Greenidge still burns natural gas, spewing harmful pollution into the atmosphere. It also has said it is carbon neutral thanks to offsets, but that's a tactic environmental groups don't trust.

Cristiano Bellavitis, a Syracuse University professor, cautioned in the City Magazine report: ""When the market crashes, these operations often scale back or shut down, leaving behind empty buildings and unmet local obligations.""

As digital money spreads, Dresden is asking a bigger question: Who's really paying for it?",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/crypto-miningimage-rec1YxVg99huteJ55-e1749260977783.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 10:02:11.994634

Trump said Musk’s vocal opposition to Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” is based on its elimination of incentives for electric vehicles (EVs).

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

While the bill may not be all bad for Musk – including preserving Trump’s 2017 income tax cuts – it contains significant provisions that impact Musk’s flagship company. It also rolls back green-tax incentives.

Since he’s stepped away of the Trump administration, the entrepreneur has been a vocal critic of the legislation, including lamenting that “there is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

While the House narrowly passed its version of the bill in late May, it is facing hurdles in the Senate, where it is so far losing some momentum.

Here’s a look at the provisions that may be particularly impactful for the company – as well as other electric vehicle and climate-friendly energy companies:

Eliminates EV tax credits

One major way in which the “big, beautiful bill” harms Tesla is by making its cars more expensive.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act lifted a cap allowing manufacturers that had already sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles to once again be eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit. It also extended eligibility for the credit through 2032

The bill effectively made the cars $7,500 cheaper for consumers.

But, the credits are cut in the GOP’s bill. Without that credit, Tesla and other EV makers may make fewer sales. One major hurdle facing the adoption of electric vehicles is that they are oftentimes more expensive than gas-powered cars.

However, Musk has contended when he was supporting Trump that he does not need the tax credit.

Cuts credits for solar energy

Tesla Energy sells both rooftop solar energy and grid scale solar power – both of which are hampered by the Republican bill.

The legislation axes tax credits for rooftop solar after this year.

It also eliminates tax credits for any grid scale project that begins construction more than 60 days after the bill is enacted. Projects also need to begin producing energy by the end of 2028 to become eligible.

These utility scale cuts are controversial even within the GOP and could face changes in the Senate.

Axes Biden-era EV regulations

The legislation would eliminate a Biden-era regulation that forces the electric vehicle market to shift toward EVs.

While Tesla is already all-electric, doing so could still impact its bottom line, as the way the regulations are set up, automakers either have to make their vehicles greener or purchase credits from automakers like Tesla that already outperform the regulations.

1.Battery X Rebalancing Technologies successfully validates its next-generation battery rebalancing machine on a commercial electric truck battery that had experienced significant real-world imbalance, expanding functionality to include a Class 3 light-duty EV model.

2.Prototype 2.0 achieved 100% recovery of imbalance-related capacity loss and a 37.7% increase of the rated capacity, underscoring the machine's effectiveness on a significantly imbalanced battery pack.

3.Successful trial conducted on a significantly imbalanced battery pack provided by an authorized Canadian distributor of the electric truck, highlighting market interest and broader demand for cost-effective solutions to restore electric vehicle battery capacity and avoid costly full-pack replacements.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news releases dated May 9, 2025, May 23, 2025, and May 30, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has expanded the functionality of its next-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform to include a fully electric, Class 3 commercial electric vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck""), and has achieved successful preliminary trial results (the ""Trial"") on an 144-battery cell Electric Truck battery pack which had exhibited significant natural imbalance caused by real-world conditions, demonstrating 100% recovery of a naturally occurring imbalance-related capacity loss, and a 37.7% increase of the Rated Capacity (as defined herein) of the Electric Truck's battery pack, composed of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) materials (the ""Electric Truck Battery Pack"").

The Trial results (the ""Results"") were performed using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' second-generation, patent-pending battery rebalancing machine (""Prototype 2.0"") on the Electric Truck Battery Pack. The Electric Truck Battery Pack has been assessed to have a rated full capacity of 176 ampere-hours (Ah) (the ""Rated Capacity""), as specified on the nameplate affixed to the Electric Truck Battery Pack.

Initially, the Electric Truck Battery Pack was fully charged using a J1772 (Type 1) AC charging port, delivering 40 amperes (A) of current. This Level 2 AC charging step, consistent with North American EV standards¹, was managed by the vehicle's onboard systems. Once the dashboard displayed a 100 percent state of charge and the charger application indicated the vehicle was no longer requesting current, Prototype 2.0 initiated its patent-pending battery rebalancing process. A rebalancing current between 0 and 3 amperes was then individually applied to each of the battery cells, charging them simultaneously to a target voltage of 4.20 volts (the ""Voltage Target""). The Voltage Target falls within the standard operating range for NMC lithium-ion cells (3.0V to 4.20V), with 4.20V commonly recognized as full capacity in the industry².

The Results show that 66.3 Ah of capacity, previously lost due to battery-cell imbalance, was successfully restored on the Electric Truck Battery Pack. This represents approximately 37.7 percent of the Rated Capacity of the unbalanced Electric Truck Battery Pack.

The restored capacity corresponds to the full theoretical rebalancing potential based on achieving the Voltage Target across all cells and reflects complete recovery of the significant imbalance identified. These results were validated using Prototype 2.0's integrated software feature, which measures ampere-hour capacity restored through rebalancing on a per-cell basis. The software also identified the maximum individual cell discrepancy to be 66.3 Ah, relative to the Rated Capacity.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies interprets these Results as confirmation of Prototype 2.0's ability to recover significant imbalance-induced battery-cell capacity loss through precise voltage alignment and active cell-level rebalancing.

The expanded functionality development for the Electric Truck builds on a series of prior advancements by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, as disclosed in the Company's news release dated May 9, 2025, which announced that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies had entered into a non-commercial, collaborative scope of services agreement (the ""Factor E Agreement"") with Factor E Motors Ltd., a Vancouver-based automotive service centre specializing in out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles. The Factor E Agreement is intended to support the continued development of Prototype 2.0, with an initial focus on Tesla Model 3 and Model X battery packs currently held by Factor E Motors.

This progress was further advanced, as disclosed the Company's news releases dated May 23, 2025, and May 30, 2025, which announced the expansion of Prototype 2.0's development to include Nissan Leaf battery packs and confirmed the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack. This achievement marked a key milestone in validating Prototype 2.0's compatibility with the #2 most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle model in the United States.

Together, these initiatives underscore Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' commitment to demonstrating the adaptability of its technology across multiple real-world electric vehicle platforms and highlight the increasing demand for practical, cost-effective battery reconditioning solutions.

Results

Significance of Results & Market Opportunity for the Electric Truck

The Results of the Trial demonstrate that Prototype 2.0 is capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring battery cell imbalance. This successful outcome builds upon prior validation of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending rebalancing technology, including independent validation by the National Research Council of Canada (as detailed below), and the Company's previously disclosed news release dated May 30, 2025 announcing successful rebalancing of naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack, the #2 most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle model in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only confirm the technical functionality of Prototype 2.0 in a real-world electric vehicle platform, but also highlight its potential to restore substantial lost capacity-an outcome that supports the growing demand for practical, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Electric Truck Trial reinforces the relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending Prototype 2.0 in real-world environments and signals a broader opportunity to extend the useful lifespan of aging electric vehicle battery packs.

The Electric Truck and Electric Truck Battery Pack were provided at no cost to Battery X Rebalancing Technologies for testing and validation by an authorized Canadian distributor of the Electric Truck (the ""Distributor""), who advised that it owns a fleet of approximately 20 Electric Trucks (the ""Electric TruckFleet""). Several vehicles within this fleet have reportedly experienced significant capacity degradation due to battery cell imbalance. The expanded functionality development and subsequent Trial were initiated in response to the Distributor's interest in identifying a viable alternative to full battery replacement, which it noted could be prohibitively expensive.

The objective of the Trial was to assess whether Prototype 2.0 could successfully rebalance a battery pack from the Electric Truck Fleet. The positive Results are expected to inform ongoing discussions with the Distributor regarding the potential deployment of Prototype 2.0 across its broader fleet to restore and extend battery life while mitigating potentially costly battery replacements.

Further, the Company has been advised by the Distributor that approximately 700 Electric Trucks are currently deployed across Canada, owned by a combination of the Electric Truck's parent company, authorized dealers, commercial fleet operators, and private fleet owners. According to the Distributor, many of these vehicles have encountered similar battery pack capacity degradation attributed to battery cell imbalance. This highlights a market opportunity for Battery X Rebalancing Technologies to provide a cost-effective rebalancing solution for electric vehicle owners seeking to avoid premature battery replacement.

In parallel with these developments, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is advancing the implementation of standardized operating procedures (SOPs) for rebalancing the Electric Truck Battery Pack, along with user interface and workflow optimizations for Prototype 2.0. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies is also progressing efforts to formalize a commercial manufacturing agreement to support scalable production and deployment capabilities. These initiatives are part of a broader commercialization strategy and are not limited to any single third-party opportunity, with the exception of the Electric Truck-specific SOPs, which are being developed in direct response to the potential opportunity identified through the Trial.

There can be no assurance that Battery X Rebalancing Technologies will establish commercial arrangements with any third party at this time. While the Company is encouraged by the progress to date and the evident market need, any future commercial arrangement remains subject to further validation, negotiation, and operational readiness.

LAKE ORION TOWNSHIP, Mich. — In a nondescript supplier park in suburban Detroit, an electric vehicle startup backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is building what it hopes will be America's newest automaker.

The facility is filled with dozens of prototypes, crash-tested vehicles, a crude lab vehicle skeleton adorned with wires and, most importantly, a busy ""beta"" assembly line that has been building electric vehicles since December for the startup, Slate Auto.

Slate is using the location — a stone's throw away from a massive General Motors assembly plant — to produce more than 70 vehicles for internal testing, certification and everything else a company needs to prepare to produce and sell vehicles in the United States.

The beta production line features roughly a dozen labeled stations for things such as the vehicle's doors, tailgate and front ends that sit in bins or on surface areas made out of wood and steel parts.

Employees move back and forth between the bins, tables and assembly line as songs such as Whitney Houston's ""Saving All My Love for You"" and Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" echo throughout the lively facility.

The largely hand-built vehicles being made are bare-bones, two-seat, two-door electric pickup trucks that can also be converted to different body styles of SUVs, such as a five-seat fastback or into a squared-off look like a Jeep Wrangler.

The vehicles have injected-molded composite exteriors, crank windows, no infotainment systems and a litany of do-it yourself options. The plan is for every vehicle coming off the line to be the same to reduce complexity, before adding any additional features or different covers/tops.

Auto executives have tossed around the idea for such a modular, stripped-down vehicle amid the rise of connectivity and affordability concerns, but so far the challenges have outweighed the potential opportunities, or companies have struggled to keep prices down.

Slate believes it can succeed where others have failed through simplified manufacturing and lower costs – two areas where other EV startups have failed in recent years.

""This one's going to be different for a number of reasons,"" Eric Keipper, an auto veteran and Slate's head of engineering, told CNBC after a tour of the company's manufacturing facility. ""We took the back-to-basics, only-the-essentials approach, and, really, we're building a completely new category of product.""

Slate exited its ""stealth mode"" in late April by revealing its first vehicles — several two-door electric pickup trucks and converted SUVs — that it expects to begin deliveries of by the end of next year. It's in the process of building out a full production facility at a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana, where it expects to have capacity for up to 150,000 vehicles a year.

It's a daunting timeframe even for an established automaker, let alone a new startup that's establishing its supply chains, production processes and workforce, among other things. Hand-building vehicles at a small facility is one thing; mass producing them is another.

""We've put together a really solid plan, and we're working to achieve the plan,"" Slate CEO Chris Barman told CNBC. ""It doesn't mean that we follow the plan exactly. We gotta pivot when different information comes, but we understand what we've got to do to ultimately get to the goal of having vehicles that meet all of our requirements.""

Slate revealed its unnamed vehicle (the company is telling customers to name it themselves) to notable fanfare, attracting more than 100,000 reservations that required a $50 deposit. For other companies, however, vehicles reservations have fallen significantly short of actual sales.

The company said it is conducting a Series C round of financing after raising $700 million in its first two rounds of financing. TechCrunch first reported the Series A round in 2023 raised $111 million from 16 investors, including Bezos.

Other EV startups have needed significantly more funding and have quickly blown through billions of dollars annually attempting to get a vehicle into production. But Slate believes it can be far less capital intense thanks to the engineering and production of the vehicle.

""We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered,"" Barman said during the April 24 debut. ""But with a twist, it's a vehicle people are actually going to love and be proud to own.""

The company declined to discuss future targets such as sales and profitability, as well as expected capital requirements, other than that it plans to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in its Indiana plant.

'A blank Slate'

Barman and Keipper — veterans of Stellantis predecessor Fiat Chrysler, among other companies — met nearly three years ago to discuss the vehicle and Slate's business plan as the first employees of the startup.

""It started with a blank slate,"" said Keipper. ""The CEO and I sat together on the fifth of July in 2022 and looked at a blank whiteboard, and I filled it. I said, 'Here's the plan. Let's do this.'""

Courtesy: Slate

During the reveal, the company positioned itself and its vehicle as a ""a radically simple, radically affordable, radically personalizable car.""

The vehicle — which has a targeted starting price of under $20,000 with an up to $7,500 EV credit — features many ""off the shelf"" parts from suppliers, lowering costs. Its body also is exclusively injected molded composite instead of steel or aluminum, bringing down cost and weight.

It does not feature any ""connectivity"" such as a modem or large screens, just a small driver information screen. Instead of a center infotainment system, drivers can use their own devices such as a smartphone or tablet for navigation and music. Speakers also are optional.

The exteriors of the Slate vehicles also won't be painted. The company says it was engineered to be wrapped with a vinyl film, eliminating the need for a costly paint shop — a massive investment for automakers.

The basis for the company is for consumers to be able to easily change the vehicle themselves or add whatever they'd like to it after purchase through the removal or addition of bolts. The company plans to offer some services such as the vehicle wrapping, but customers aren't required to do those things through Slate and can purchase add-ons later.

Slate says the vehicle — about the length of a two-door Ford Bronco — only features roughly 2,500 parts, including only 500 to 700 ""end items,"" or parts, for final assembly. That compares with a Slate estimate of 2,500-end item parts for other competitors and thousands of more overall pieces.

""Fundamentally, there's no new technology because technology costs money to develop,"" said Jamie Standring, formerly with Karma Automotive and Stellantis/Fiat Chrysler, standing by the beta assembly line.

Standring said the initial idea was to have the vehicle's frame that everything is built upon be bolted together – almost like an erector set – to remove the need for a full body shop, much like it's attempting to not use a paint shop. But the drawbacks eventually outweighed the benefits, he said.

The Slate truck is expected to ship with a standard 52.7-kWh battery with an estimated range of around 150 miles, or a 84.3-kWh pack with a target of 240 miles of range. Its battery supplier is SK On, according to the company. Its top speed is only 90 miles per hour.

""I'm really proud of the team for how they really thought out of the box,"" Barman said. ""We'll have kits, and we're doing it in a way that's lean as well, but we want to offer people many choices.""

Significant hurdles remain

But more choices for consumers mean more complexity.

On the company's website, there are 11 categories for customers to customize with a combined 160 options, excluding customizable exterior colors for wraps. That's a lot of options – ranging from dozens of decals to lighting, audio and tires and wheels – for a customer to pick and a company to store and offer.

Slate executives say the point of the customization is for customers to be able to make the vehicle their own and easily upgrade or change it when they'd like, but auto analysts see it as one of many potential problem areas.

In addition to traditional startup challenges such as capital, profitability and scaling up, other hurdles include: A limited market for two-door vehicles, slower-than-expected adoption of EVs and regulatory uncertainty regarding federal tax credits that Slate is relying on for the vehicle's affordability, among other things.

""They have an interesting idea,"" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director in AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility. ""The question is, how many people really want to do that much themselves, and how big is the adjustable market?""

The sale of two-door regular cab pickup trucks like Slate's debut vehicle only accounted for less than 90,400 registrations in 2024. That compares to more than 2.5 million registered four-door crew cab trucks.

Brinley, who attended Slate's reveal event in California, said if the company wants to be sustainable, it would need to expand its product lineup to four-door models, which the platform seems to be able to support, as well as additional vehicles in the future.

""Just like every other startup before it, their sustainability is not going to be determined by the first product in the first six months,"" Brinley said. ""The first product just gets you in the door.""

A handful of auto startups such as Lordstown Motors, Electric Last Mile Solutions, Fisker, Canoo and Nikola all made it into various forms of production but went bankrupt. Even better capitalized EV startups such as Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group have continually had to raise capital to stay afloat.

Industry insiders also have raised concerns about the affordability of Slate's vehicle once customers add options or a new SUV top, which can be installed and uninstalled using bolts.

""I think it's super interesting. The idea behind it, we've talked about that idea a million times,"" Tim Kuniskis, CEO of Stellantis' Ram Truck brand, said recently when asked about Slate. ""Now, what's it going to actually transact at in the marketplace … when people start to option them up, it's not going to be $20,000. It's going to be $35,000, and by the time you get to $35,000, you're in midsize truck territory. ""

Slate has not announced pricing for customizations or exact pricing of the vehicle without a federal tax credit that's in jeopardy under President Donald Trump.

""Slate is an example of why and how hard it is to produce a cheap EV"" said Karl Brauer, a veteran auto analyst with iSeeCars.com. ""They are producing an electric vehicle with only two seats, 140-mile range, manual windows, no touch screen, and it's still $27,500 … To me, it's not a competitive vehicle at that point.""

Brauer said there are other EVs close to that price, as well as smaller pickups such as the Ford Maverick hybrid with a lot more features that could be a better buy for consumers.

Both Brauer and Brinley gave Slate credit for trying something new and attempting to address affordability concerns, but the auto industry isn't an easy busy to break into, even when starting from a blank slate.

""It's modular. It's cool. It's a really clever idea,"" Brinley said. ""The question for me comes down to how many people want to do that? And we'll find out, but I don't know that it's as high as they think it is.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108156199-1749270719458-BETAS_AT_BETA--8.jpg?v=1749270974&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-07 09:02:33.768738

Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.
Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation's planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.
The Biden-era standards ""were 'improperly predicated' on alternative fuel vehicles,"" said John Bozzella, the group's president and CEO.
But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department's action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.","Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation's use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV ""mandate,"" referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden's target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell -- or car buyers to purchase -- EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules -- an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department's memorandum Friday said the previous administration ""ignored statutory requirements"" that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

""We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,"" Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months. Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas by 2031 -- up from about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles today -- in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons (265 billion liters) of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules -- in place since the 1970s energy crisis -- work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation's planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy's announcement ""a positive development"" that adds ""important clarity"" to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards ""were 'improperly predicated' on alternative fuel vehicles,"" said John Bozzella, the group's president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department's action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

""Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,"" she said. ""It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.""

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the proposed budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don't meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don't meet the standards. Manufacturers whose vehicles exceed the standards earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers.

The memo and bill text landed this week as Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump engage in a public spat online, with Trump suggesting that Musk ""only developed a problem"" with his budget bill because it rolls back tax credits for EVs. Musk disputes that.

The facility, designed to supply high-voltage cylindrical battery cells to BMW for its next-generation electric vehicles, now faces an indefinite delay due to what the company describes as “policy and market uncertainty.”

The announcement, made Thursday, underscores the fragility of international investment in America’s EV sector as political winds shift in Washington. “Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” AESC said in a brief statement. While the company pledged to fulfill its commitment to create 1,600 jobs and deliver the promised investment, it stopped short of giving a timeline for resumption.

Politics Cast a Shadow Over Progress

The Florence plant is part of a larger strategy by BMW and AESC to localize battery production for upcoming Neue Klasse EVs. BMW has invested $700 million into a battery assembly plant in Woodruff, South Carolina, where the AESC cells were set to be installed. That facility remains on track to open in 2026, according to a company spokesperson.

Scaling Back Ambitions

AESC has already begun to trim its original ambitions in South Carolina. Initially planning two factories on the Florence site, the company announced earlier this year that a single plant would suffice for BMW’s needs. That decision prompted the state to withdraw $111 million in incentives tied to the now-cancelled second phase. However, AESC remains eligible for over $255 million in public funding—including $135 million in grants and $121 million in state-issued bonds—which South Carolina’s Department of Commerce says are not currently at risk despite the pause.

To date, AESC says it has invested more than $1 billion into the project. With other active plants in Tennessee, Kentucky, and abroad—including China, Germany, and the U.K.—the company’s move signals that South Carolina’s political climate may be giving international investors pause.

BMW’s Plans Continue Undeterred

BMW, for its part, remains steadfast. The automaker says the construction halt at AESC will not delay its own timeline. The battery assembly plant in Woodruff is slated to begin production in 2026, and the cells from Florence are still part of that plan—albeit now from just one factory instead of two.

These cells will be critical for BMW’s Neue Klasse platform, featuring an 800-volt architecture designed to enable faster charging and increased range. Vehicles built at BMW’s Spartanburg plant and its San Luis Potosi factory in Mexico will eventually receive these U.S.-produced batteries.",https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bmw-battery-cells-evolution-00.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 12:14:33.345031

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (IRN) — Illinois generates more electricity from nuclear power than any other state in the country, but some say it isn’t enough to meet the state’s energy needs.

Legislation that would have lifted a moratorium on the building of large-scale nuclear facilities failed to get through the Illinois General Assembly this spring.

“Nuclear energy is safe, efficient and essential for a stable energy grid and lower costs for consumers,” said the bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris. “It’s time to move forward and finally end the ban on nuclear energy.”

In 2023, Illinois lifted a partial moratorium on nuclear power development, specifically for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).

Gov. J.B. Pritzker has said that he would be open to expanding nuclear power in the state.

“We’re looking forward to having a bill that comes to my desk that will allow us to expand the options for nuclear in the state of Illinois, but it has to be done in the right way,” said Pritzker.

But David Kraft, director of the Illinois-based Nuclear Energy Information Service, said in light of President Donald Trump signing Executive Orders which effectively gut the regulatory power of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), there is no “right way.”

“The questionable level of current regulation, and now the further erosion of even that via the Executive Orders are not the conditions calling for more nuclear power,” said Kraft.

He added that current reactors are showing signs of aging and new reactors would require greater oversight during start-up phase, and with reduced regulatory oversight, neither will be safe.

A nuclear facility in central Illinois is making headlines. An agreement was just announced by Facebook’s parent company and Constellation Energy Illinois that involves the Clinton Nuclear power plant, which was set to close in two years. Meta said it reached the 20-year deal to meet surging electric demand for artificial intelligence.

The bill is drawing both praise and concern from officials and policy experts statewide.

If enacted, the legislation would bring significant changes to Mississippi’s health care, food assistance, energy sector and tax policies.

Here is a breakdown of the ways in which Mississippi be affected:

The The state of Mississippi reports that more than 438,000 Mississippians are enrolled in Medicaid managed care program as of December 2024, representing about 65% of the state’s population. and 286,410 residents signed up for Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace plans during the 2024 open enrollment period, marking a record high for the state.

Healthcare

If the bill is passed the CBO predicts:

Millions more could become uninsured nationwide by 2034, including a significant number of Mississippians

Deep cuts to Medicaid could impact the 805,500 Mississippi residents, including children, who rely on the program, either by reducing services or eliminating coverage entirely, according to an ACA Factsheet for Mississippi

States may not be able to fully offset the federal cuts, so coverage losses could be substantial.

Food Assistance

Changing eligibility requirements could put a greater burden on state resources for those in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USAFacts states that Mississippi has one of the highest rates of food assistance participation in the country. In fiscal year 2024, approximately 13.1% of the state’s population received SNAP benefits.

As is, the bill would:

Shift at least 5% of costs to states, which could mean an millions in additional annual expenses for Mississippi, based on the state’s current SNAP spending

Expand work requirements that limit eligibility for thousands who currently rely on SNAP

Cuts to SNAP would hit working families and children the hardest, as Mississippi ranks 15th nationally for SNAP participation

Taxes

The legislation would permanently extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts, lower income tax rates and increase the standard deduction.

It also introduces new provisions:

No federal taxes on tips, overtime or certain auto loan interest

Temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit

Expanded deductions for seniors and higher SALT deduction caps

Higher education

One of the most immediate impacts for Mississippi could be in higher education.

In a report to the House Committee on Education, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated a $350 billion cut to Pell Grants, which help low-income students afford college.

According to the Educational Data Initiative, “51% of Pell Grant funds go to students whose families earn less than $20,000 annually – the largest majority,” and “88% of Pell Grant funds go to public universities.”

It also restructures the federal student loan system, eliminating subsidized loans, capping borrowing and narrowing repayment options.

The fallout of this could include:

New federal loans would accrue interest while students are in school and during deferment periods.

The lifetime borrowing cap would change for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as parental borrowers.

Future flexibility in repayment plans will be reduced.

Hardship deferments would be eliminated and general forbearance would be capped.

It could limit future presidential administrations from expanding borrower relief.

Sara Partridge, a higher education policy researcher at the Center for American Progress, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution, “These proposals would disproportionately hurt students from low- and middle-income families, without a doubt.”

Clean energy and jobs

To offset tax cuts, the bill would phase out clean energy tax credits established under the Biden administration.

According to the Mississippi section of American Clean Power, more than 5,000 Mississippians are employed in the clean energy sector and over 72,000 workers are part of the broader energy sector. This industry could see job losses and stalled projects as a result of the new bill.

The Senate is expected to debate the bill through June, and if passed, Mississippi families, students, and state agencies should prepare for major changes. Until then, if you would like your voice heard, contact your representatives.

President Donald Trump celebrated the strong May jobs report, calling the figures “great numbers,” while renewing his public attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, urging him to lower interest rates.

According to Trump, borrowing costs should be “much lower” as they are costing the U.S. economy “a fortune,” suggesting the need to refinance maturing debt.

His remarks came after the Congressional Budget Office released updated estimates for Trump’s sweeping tax bill, which is projected to add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

A clash between Musk and Trump erupted on June 5 after the tech billionaire publicly slammed the tax bill, claiming it was pushed through Congress too fast and never shared with him during his brief tenure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

Musk advocated for a leaner federal budget and painted the legislation as reckless spending.

Trump claimed Musk had gone crazy over provisions calling for reduced government support for electric vehicles. The president also floated the idea of scrapping all government contracts with Musk’s companies, including SpaceX and Starlink, as a cost-saving measure for the budget.

Tensions reached a boiling point when Musk posted: “Time to drop the really big bomb: Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,” yet offering no evidence to support the claim.

The feud sent shockwaves through markets, triggering Tesla’s worst trading session of the year.

Trump said Musk’s vocal opposition to Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” is based on its elimination of incentives for electric vehicles (EVs).

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

While the bill may not be all bad for Musk – including preserving Trump’s 2017 income tax cuts – it contains significant provisions that impact Musk’s flagship company. It also rolls back green-tax incentives.

Since he’s stepped away of the Trump administration, the entrepreneur has been a vocal critic of the legislation, including lamenting that “there is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

While the House narrowly passed its version of the bill in late May, it is facing hurdles in the Senate, where it is so far losing some momentum.

Here’s a look at the provisions that may be particularly impactful for the company – as well as other electric vehicle and climate-friendly energy companies:

Eliminates EV tax credits

One major way in which the “big, beautiful bill” harms Tesla is by making its cars more expensive.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act lifted a cap allowing manufacturers that had already sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles to once again be eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit. It also extended eligibility for the credit through 2032

The bill effectively made the cars $7,500 cheaper for consumers.

But, the credits are cut in the GOP’s bill. Without that credit, Tesla and other EV makers may make fewer sales. One major hurdle facing the adoption of electric vehicles is that they are oftentimes more expensive than gas-powered cars.

However, Musk has contended when he was supporting Trump that he does not need the tax credit.

Cuts credits for solar energy

Tesla Energy sells both rooftop solar energy and grid scale solar power – both of which are hampered by the Republican bill.

The legislation axes tax credits for rooftop solar after this year.

It also eliminates tax credits for any grid scale project that begins construction more than 60 days after the bill is enacted. Projects also need to begin producing energy by the end of 2028 to become eligible.

These utility scale cuts are controversial even within the GOP and could face changes in the Senate.

Axes Biden-era EV regulations

The legislation would eliminate a Biden-era regulation that forces the electric vehicle market to shift toward EVs.

While Tesla is already all-electric, doing so could still impact its bottom line, as the way the regulations are set up, automakers either have to make their vehicles greener or purchase credits from automakers like Tesla that already outperform the regulations.

If the regulation is weakened, traditional car manufacturers may not have to buy as many credits from EV-makers like Tesla.

However, it’s not clear whether this provision will make it into what’s ultimately passed because it will first need to be approved by the Senate parliamentarian, which sets the rules for what types of provisions are eligible in legislation passed through a procedure that requires just 50 votes.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/06/Tesla_060725_Getty_Spencer-Platt.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-07 10:02:27.787357

Scientists agree that capping warming at 1.5 degrees is necessary to avoid the most severe effects of climate change.
Be guided by the vision of a brighter tomorrow.","By Holly Swiglo, CCL School Electrification Challenge Intern

Tomorrowland, a 2015 Disney movie, is an objectively bad movie — it lost Disney $120-140 million, and hardly anyone I mention Tomorrowland to has heard of it. Regardless, it’s my favorite movie, partly due to nostalgia but mainly because its message resonates with me and the climate advocacy work I do.

In a nutshell, Tomorrowland follows a kid as she pursues entry to a futuristic, utopian world, only to find it not as wonderful as it appears. Leaders of this world create a machine that projects visions of a horrific future — one of rampant climate change, pandemics, famine — into the minds of all people on Earth. The idea is that communities will take action to prevent these catastrophes once they become aware of their possibility.

It backfires entirely. People assume that this future is inevitable, so they don’t do anything to stop it. In fact, their behaviors make devastation all the more likely. In the end, the machine is destroyed and invitations to join the utopian world are sent out, providing individuals with a positive vision of the future.

Tomorrowland’s message reminds me of Alfie Kohn’s writings in his book The Brighter Side of Human Nature. Kohn argues that the assumption that humans are naturally war-loving leads us toward violent tendencies. Most psychologists agree that aggression is learned, not inherent. However, if we believe violence is a natural instinct, there is no need to feel guilty for aggressive responses and no motive to work toward peace. This creates a vicious cycle: people act violently, causing others to believe aggression is inevitable, leading to more violence. What we believe is what we become.

Last semester, I took a course in environmental policy. One would think this would be a rather discouraging course, but it actually gave me significant hope. I realized that the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), combined with current policy, was expected to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by around 40 percent of 2005 levels by 2030. Before the IRA, we were on track to cut emissions by roughly 30 percent. To meet our country’s goals under the Paris Agreement and stay on track to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, we would need to reduce emissions by around 50 percent by 2030. So, we’re not that far off.

The climate provisions of the IRA are at risk from the new presidential administration and the new Congress. The House just passed a bill that would roll back major clean energy tax credits, and the bill is now under consideration in the Senate. CCL is working hard to protect these climate provisions. But no matter what happens, I’m encouraged to know that these measures have already made a positive impact that can’t be erased. The IRA has already awarded over $61 billion in funding for over 6,100 climate projects. In 2023, 3.65 million Americans benefited from IRA tax credits for electric vehicles and residential energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades.

The IRA demonstrates that large-scale action to combat climate change is not only possible but has already been done. If we can take major legislative action once, we can do it again. And if we take that action in a bipartisan way, it can last through future political changes, and we can fully achieve our climate goals.

Despite the success of the IRA so far, we still have a long way to go to reach net zero emissions by 2050, the U.S.’s other, more ambitious commitment under the Paris Agreement, which is required to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists agree that capping warming at 1.5 degrees is necessary to avoid the most severe effects of climate change. If the climate provisions of the IRA are removed, we will have even further to go.

Still, we certainly have come a long way. Perhaps if we focus on the progress we have made, instead of how far we have to go, we can inspire action. There are some federal policies, such as taxing imports based on their carbon emissions, that would also help slow climate change and have a concrete chance of passing in the next four years. The worst thing we can do is to set our sights on a miserable future.

Instead, let’s get involved. I personally love Citizens’ Climate Lobby because optimism is heavily embedded in its culture, and CCL regularly provides volunteers with effective ways to make a difference. Anyone can be an advocate, no matter their schedule. Activities like emailing a policymaker using a provided template can take less than a minute. As the peace activist Joan Baez says, “Action is the antidote to despair.”

So the next time someone makes a cynical or pessimistic comment about climate change, tell them about the impacts of the IRA in just a few short years. Tell them that people care and are making a difference in groups like CCL. Give them a reason to have hope. Be guided by the vision of a brighter tomorrow.

With fire danger at very high levels throughout much of Canada, we can anticipate that these major smoke-emitting fires will continue to burn for an extended period. Furthermore, the long-range fire forecast calls for above-average fire risk over much of the forested areas of western Canada and the Western U.S. this summer, and we should anticipate frequent bouts of poor air quality from wildfire smoke across much of North America.

Unlike the activity during the record Canadian wildfire season of 2023 – when wildfire activity was focused in the west (Alberta) and east (Quebec) – the fires in 2025 are also plaguing the central provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

Why are the Canadian wildfires so bad this year?

As the climate warms, fire danger increases, mostly because the atmosphere gets “thirstier” – more water vapor can evaporate into warmer air. This results in more water vapor evaporating from plants, which dries them out and creates an increased risk of large and intense fires that can generate huge smoke plumes.

The first major Canadian wildfire smoke event for the U.S. during 2025 invaded North Dakota on May 30. Between May 30 and June 4, portions of nine states – North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Michigan, Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, and Montana – experienced smoke that brought levels of fine particle pollution (PM 2.5, particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter) in excess of the 24-hour EPA standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter. This corresponds to an Air Quality Index, or AQI, above 100 – in the “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups” range (color-coded orange).

Portions of five states experienced 24-hour levels of PM 2.5 in the “Unhealthy” (red) range, with even higher levels – in the purple “Very Unhealthy” range – were measured on an hourly basis. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, at the red “Unhealthy” level, everyone may begin to experience health effects, and members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.

As of Thursday, there were 202 active wildfires burning in Canada, with 109 of these considered to be “out of control,” according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The fires had burned 6.4 million acres, killed two, forced over 26,900 people to evacuate, and destroyed at least 191 structures. The area burned is now the second-largest on record for this time of year, trailing only the record fire season of 2023.

As reported by the Hotshot Wake Up Substack feed, a very dry and windy airmass set up over Saskatchewan on Tuesday and “caused massive wildfires to run across the province. Entire communities were devastated. At one point, it was reported that HALF of Saskatchewan was without communications or internet due to infrastructure damage. The largest town in the northern part of the province was evacuated. The town of Denare Beach (population 700) was eviscerated after the Wolf Fire ran through the community. There are reports of over 164 structures lost and half of the town destroyed. Hospitals in the area received a CODE ORANGE alert indicating that they could receive a major influx of patients due to a disaster situation.”

The summer forecast: above-average fire risk over much of Canada and the Northwest U.S.

The latest seasonal fire forecast (Fig. 1) from the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center (with assistance from Canada and Mexico), predicts that there will be above-average fire risk over much of western Canada and portions of California and the Northwest U.S. during June. The area of risk is forecast to expand in July, with a separate area of above-average risk spreading from Texas into Oklahoma. The forecast for August and September (Fig. 2) warns of a further expansion of the above-average fire risk area over the Western U.S., with a continuation of the Southern Plains risk in August plus a new area in northern Minnesota.

The fire season so far in the U.S. has been near-average, with 1.1 million acres burned as of June 2 across the 50 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That’s close to the 10-year average of 1.2 million acres. But with the summer fire season just beginning, and central Canada already experiencing near-record wildfire activity similar to that in 2023, the latest seasonal forecasts suggest that a long summer of wildfire smoke – similar to what we saw two years ago – may be in store for residents of the U.S. and Canada in 2025.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.","LEOPOLD, Ind. (AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state, including members of Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life, aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

And yet President Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill has stopped the Solarcycle factory in its tracks.
Democrats built the clean energy tax credits into the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which they passed without any Republican votes.
Jamie Morris, who chairs the city and county’s development authority, said many in Cedartown were excited about the Solarcycle plant.
The Cedartown factory, he said, will be able to process 10 million annually, or about 28,000 panels a day.","Outside the husk of a shuttered yarn factory, thousands of old solar panels lie stacked on the gravel. Local leaders say they can see the future here: 1,200 people recycling millions of those panels each year and making the glass to build new ones.

This is no field of dreams. A company, Solarcycle, has already spent about $50 million of $500 million it plans to invest to turn the empty space into a recycling operation and build an adjacent glass manufacturing plant. Land has been purchased, permits have been secured, and hiring for jobs starting at $40,000 annually could be just months away.

It’s the kind of project that scientists say could ultimately reduce carbon emissions and that economists call a major step in bringing manufacturing back to the United States from China. And it spells opportunity in Cedartown, Ga., a city of about 10,000, where Pirkle’s Deli on Main Street does a brisk lunch business but other establishments see little foot traffic. Once operational, Solarcycle would be the area’s largest employer.

And yet President Trump’s “big, beautiful” bill has stopped the Solarcycle factory in its tracks. The legislation, which passed the House and is now being debated in the Senate, would essentially eliminate the tax breaks that companies have been counting on to build new wind and solar projects, electric vehicle battery factories and more.

Republicans in the House voted to get rid of the clean energy subsidies in order to pay for Mr. Trump’s income tax breaks, even if it meant hurting investment in their districts. The Cedartown plant is on hold until the Senate decides the fate of the credits.

It was not supposed to be this way. Democrats built the clean energy tax credits into the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which they passed without any Republican votes. Since then, nearly 80 percent of the $843 billion in new electric vehicle factories, battery plants and solar and wind projects has flowed to Republican-led districts, something Democrats believed would insulate the tax credits from politics.

But in Cedartown, many people interviewed said they’d never heard of the Inflation Reduction Act and did not connect it to the Solarcycle factory. Some of those who had heard about the law described it as wasteful spending.

“They spent billions of dollars on the wind, and it didn’t work,” said Miller Green, 93, who had stopped in at the Polk County Historical Society Museum with his wife. She admonished him to stop talking about politics.

It seems unlikely that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican whose northwest Georgia district includes Cedartown, will face any political blowback from voting to eliminate the clean energy tax breaks that Solarcycle was banking on.

“We’re still at the point where the economic benefits are still pretty vague,” said Scott Lincicome, a trade economist at the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization. “It’s not like the factory has been a staple of the town for a generation.”

Charlie Bailey, the chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, maintains that there will be consequences in the upcoming elections for Republicans “including the entire congressional delegation of fools who voted in lock step to take these jobs away.”

But so far there hasn’t been much fallout.

One union-backed organization posted an online advertisement accusing Mr. Carter of voting to “kill thousands of jobs.” As of Friday it had gotten 45 views.

Ms. Greene argued in an interview that her district needed more workers, not more manufacturing. Polk County has a 3.1 percent unemployment rate, lower than the national average, and Ms. Greene said she believed that companies using green tax incentives were “importing foreign labor” because there weren’t enough local employees. “It’s fake job creation,” she said.

Ms. Greene said she would like to see Solarcycle succeed — but not if it requires federal incentives. She said she didn’t feel similarly about subsidies for fossil fuels, which have been in place for a century, because she felt oil and gas are central to the economy.

“I am not interested in giving handouts to companies that are not essential to our society and our survival,” she said. “I wish Solarcycle and every single company, I wish them the greatest success, but if they are unable to open a factory because they didn’t get a tax credit, then that means they weren’t able to stand on their feet to begin with.”

If local officials in Ms. Greene’s district object to her position, they’re not saying it.

Jamie Morris, who chairs the city and county’s development authority, said many in Cedartown were excited about the Solarcycle plant. “All I hear is ‘When are we getting these jobs?’ and ‘When can I send my son to get a job up there at that plant?’” he said. “It’s been years since anything of this magnitude has come to Polk County.”

And yet all he would say regarding Ms. Greene’s vote to kill the tax credits — and possibly the Solarcycle plant — was that “it was a tough vote.”

Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican, has said that new industries were already moving into Georgia before the Inflation Reduction Act and that he objected to its tax credits because they were “forcing the market on people.” Georgia offers state and local tax incentives and abatements, and Mr. Kemp’s office has credited those with luring Hyundai and other companies.

That’s something Tyler Grimes said he had found, too. Mr. Grimes, who is Solarcycle’s facility manager, grew up in Alabama. His parents were raised in Polk County, and his grandfather was a pastor at two churches in the area.

“Everybody that’s from Cedartown, or from the community I’m from, they go off to college and get an engineering degree, and then they stay around Atlanta and Birmingham,” Mr. Grimes said. “This is an opportunity for a technology company to come to Cedartown and keep some of that brainpower that’s from here.”

Edward Guzman, Cedartown’s city manager, said the promise of the Solarcycle factory had lured other investments. New townhouses are being built, and Mr. Guzman said the city was in discussions with a “large-scale commercial development” that was not yet public.

At the Solarcycle offices, Rob Vinje, the chief operating officer, recently received word that the company’s plant in Odessa, Texas, can now handle the recycling of one million aging and battered solar panels each year.

The Cedartown factory, he said, will be able to process 10 million annually, or about 28,000 panels a day. And then in a circular process, it will use the materials to make new solar glass, diverting the supply chain from China, which currently provides about 80 percent of the glass used in solar panels.

“Rather than buy it from China, let’s go employ people from Cedartown, Ga., and go make glass domestically,” Mr. Vinje said. He estimated that the company could start hiring in July, but for the uncertainty around the Republican tax bill.

“If you told me tomorrow that President Trump said ‘Everything’s OK,’ we are shovel ready,” Mr. Vinje said. “We are ready to roll.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/04/multimedia/00cli-georgia-07-zkfc/00cli-georgia-07-zkfc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 07:01:40.082258

With Mr. Musk on the outs, officials at the agency may now have little to fear from the White House as they pursue their work.","Elon Musk’s bitter falling-out with President Trump could be costly for Tesla.

As long as he is persona non grata in the Trump administration, Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, will struggle to persuade Republicans not to gut climate policies worth billions of dollars to the electric car and battery company.

Mr. Musk may also lose sway over federal regulators who could make or break his plans to deploy driverless taxis, which he has described as the future of the company.

Tesla is already suffering steep declines in sales and profit. The company’s share price plummeted 14 percent on Thursday, its biggest one-day decline, after Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump began insulting each other on social media. The stock recovered somewhat Friday, rising nearly 4 percent, perhaps on hopes that the men would reach a truce or because investors thought the stock was now a bargain after the previous day’s drop.

There was always a disconnect between Mr. Musk and his Republican allies on electric cars. The domestic policy bill passed by House Republicans and being considered by the Senate will hurt the electric car market in the United States, where Tesla is the largest manufacturer by far.

The bill would eliminate tax credits of up to $7,500 for people who buy electric cars. It would quickly phase out subsidies for battery factories and lithium refineries, and end financial support for electric vehicle charging stations. The bill imposes an annual fee of $250 on electric vehicle owners that environmental groups say is punitive.

Those measures would hurt all carmakers that sell electric vehicles. But the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are also trying to kill regulations that are especially beneficial to Tesla. Those rules allow Tesla to sell clean air credits to other carmakers that fail to meet environmental standards.

During the first three months of the year, Tesla sold regulatory credits worth $595 million, which was more than the company’s net profit of $409 million. In other words, without the credits, Tesla would have lost money.

“In many years, it’s the difference between being in the black and being in the red for Tesla,” said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor at Princeton University who studies the electric vehicle industry.

Mr. Jenkins has calculated that the Republican measures would result in sales of 7.7 million fewer electric vehicles by 2030 than would be the case if Biden administration policies remained in place. Tesla would sell 3.4 million fewer electric vehicles, or almost two years’ worth of sales, assuming it maintained its current U.S. market share of 44 percent of all new electric cars sold. Republican legislation would also eliminate programs that subsidize the cost of large battery storage projects, which has been a growth business for Tesla.

At least until this week, Mr. Musk appeared to accept that the Republican measures were a necessary sacrifice to avoid a soaring federal deficit, which he maintains will bankrupt the nation.

He may also have reckoned that benefits to his other businesses, like SpaceX, would more than compensate for the hit Tesla took. Or he may have assumed that the rollback of electric vehicle incentives would hurt Tesla less than they hurt companies like General Motors and Ford Motor, which are still losing money on the electric cars they sell.

On Thursday, however, Mr. Musk seemed to decide that the costs of the bill were too great to Tesla.

“Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,” he wrote on X.

Mr. Trump, who claimed on Truth Social that Mr. Musk “went CRAZY!” over the rollbacks, threatened to cancel government contracts with and subsidies for SpaceX and other businesses Mr. Musk controls.

Mr. Musk had also expressed hope that the administration would create a more favorable climate for autonomous vehicles, crafting federal standards to replace state rules. Tesla is expected this month to begin operating self-driving taxis in Austin, Texas, part of an initiative that Mr. Musk has said will eventually generate trillions of dollars of revenue.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is already investigating crashes involving Tesla’s autonomous driving technology. With Mr. Musk on the outs, officials at the agency may now have little to fear from the White House as they pursue their work.

“Tesla’s whole valuation rides on his vision of autonomy and A.I.,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, directory of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

There could be some benefits for Tesla if Musk steps back from right-wing politics. He might blunt some of the liberal outrage that has contributed to plunging sales in Europe and the United States.

“If he can neutralize the polarizing effect he has had on people, the anti-Trump group, that could be helpful,” said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research.

Mr. Rose pointed out that Tesla’s revenue from clean air credits probably wouldn’t disappear entirely because some of the buyers were acquiring them to comply with European Union regulations.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06biz-tesla-musk-bfjp/06biz-tesla-musk-bfjp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 09:01:21.651862

While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by State Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.

Trump vowed in early April to “supercharge our domestic industrial base.”

“Jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,” he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.

But as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.

Critics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.

They have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

U.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.

Kevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.

“We’re just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we’ll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,” Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.

Doffling’s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.

Moving away from fossil fuels

The suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.

For example, the IRA’s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output.

Battery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.

Most credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.

A group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam” — echoing Trump’s rhetoric — pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.

The House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled “foreign entities of concern,” making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.

The legislation also repeals “transferability,” which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.

For example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.

Schneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals “reflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.”

Silfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.

Investment soared

Spurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.

Of the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.

The credit spurred a “sea change” in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.

Despite solar technology’s roots in the U.S., the nation “didn’t even have a toe” in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.

“But after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,” Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.

Active manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association’s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.

The renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.

Active solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.

Advanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.

But various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country — for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.

Lithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.

China largely dominates the world’s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.

When accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 — including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits — just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power’s 2024 report on clean energy employment.

Troy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.

“​​We’re getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,” said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.

“What troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can’t get anything done, and that’s been very difficult to deal with,” he said.

Industry slowdown

The industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.

Six announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor’s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.

Van Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.

“We had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,” Van Beek said. “And when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.”

Van Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.

Several companies declined States Newsroom’s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.

Spencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.

“Whether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you’re doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,” said Pederson, the association’s senior vice president of public affairs.

Too expensive, Republicans say

Some House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits — for example by removing the “overly prescriptive” restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.

Kiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that “the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.”

Her co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.

Far-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company’s ability to transfer credits.

The right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the “commonsense changes” championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.

The organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.

“The longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it’s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,” Thomas Aiello, NTU’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.

Hope in the Senate?

But representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.

Jeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that “The Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.”

Pederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are “particularly restrictive coming out of the House.”

“So we’re hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,” Pederson said.

Doffling believes senators have a “longer term vision” of the nation’s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.

“They see what’s happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,” Doffling said.

EPA action on the Endangerment Finding could call into question the legitimacy of GHG standards for automobiles, power plants, and oil and gas sector facilities, which rely, in part, on the Endangerment Finding.","On March 12, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it would initiate ""a formal reconsideration"" of its ""Endangerment Finding,"" a 2009 rule under the Clean Air Act (CAA) in which EPA found, for the first time, that the combined atmospheric concentration of six greenhouse gases (GHGs) was ""air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare."" In 2016, EPA affirmed that finding based on its review of updated science. The agency has since relied on its 2009 and 2016 findings to set a series of GHG emission standards for cars and light trucks, power plants, and facilities in the oilandgas sector. A repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding thus might undermine those substantive regulations, though that outcome is not certain.

EPA's deliberations on whether and how to amend the Endangerment Finding may be shaped by the judicial decisions that prompted EPA to issue the Endangerment Finding in the first instance and that subsequently upheld the 2009 rule against legal challenge. Any attempt to revise the Endangerment Finding would also be subject to CAA-mandated procedures and would likely implicate administrative law principles governing agencies' changes in position. This Sidebar provides an overview of these legal considerations and summarizes potential congressional responses to EPA's planned reconsideration.

Massachusetts v. EPA and the Roots of the Endangerment Finding

The Endangerment Finding grew out of a 1999 petition for rulemaking in which 19 private organizations called on EPA to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles under CAA Section 202(a)(1). That statutory provision states that the EPA Administrator ""shall"" issue standards for air-pollutant emissions from new motor vehicles that ""cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.""

In 2003, EPA denied the petition, giving two reasons for its decision. First, the agency maintained that it lacked statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions because GHGs were not ""air pollutants"" subject to the CAA. Second, even if it had the authority to act, EPA explained that it would decline to do so based on a variety of policy concerns. For example, EPA claimed that regulating GHG emissions under CAA Section 202(a)(1) would conflict with the George W. Bush Administration's decision to address climate change through further research and through incentive-based programs. EPA also claimed that regulation could interfere with the President's efforts to negotiate with other countries to reduce their emissions and could complicate the Administration's efforts to set motor vehicle fuel efficiency standards under other statutory authority.

The petitioners—joined by intervenor states, including Massachusetts—sought judicial review of EPA's petition denial. Their case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court under the name Massachusetts v. EPA. The threshold question in Massachusetts was whether any of the petitioners had standing to sue. To establish standing, a plaintiff in federal court must show that it has an actual or imminent, concrete, and particularized injury-in-fact; that injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct; and it must be likely that a favorable ruling would redress the injury. Five justices concluded that Massachusetts had made the requisite three-part showing. They stressed, however, that the state was in a ""special position"" because it was suing to protect its ""quasi-sovereign interests"" and was thus ""entitled to special solicitude"" in the standing analysis. Against that backdrop, the Court held that (1) Massachusetts was injured because sea level rise would destroy state land; (2) the state's injury was traceable, in part, to EPA's refusal to regulate motor vehicle GHG emissions; and (3) a judgment in Massachusetts' favor would reduce ""to some extent"" the risk of harm.

Having found standing, the Court rejected EPA's reasons for denying the rulemaking petition. Because it read the CAA's ""sweeping definition"" of ""air pollutant"" to cover ""all airborne compounds of whatever stripe,"" the Court first held that GHGs were ""without a doubt"" air pollutants under the act. EPA thus had ""the statutory authority to regulate the emission of [GHGs] from new motor vehicles.""

According to the Court, EPA could not decline to exercise its statutory authority by invoking ""a laundry list"" of policy concerns. This was so, the Court explained, because EPA's stated concerns lay outside the scope of EPA's authority under the statute. Because CAA Section 202(a)(1) directs the EPA Administrator to form a scientific judgment only about whether an air pollutant ""causes, or contributes to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,"" it ""constrains agency discretion to pursue other priorities of the Administrator or the President.""

Given EPA's limited scope of discretion under Section 202(a), the Court held that the agency could ""avoid taking further action only if it determine[d] that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provide[d] some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do."" Because EPA had done neither of those things when it denied the petitions, the Court remanded the matter to the agency for further consideration.

Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito dissented. The dissenting justices did not believe that Massachusetts was entitled to any ""special solicitude"" in the standing inquiry. In their view, the state failed the ordinary test for standing because its asserted injury was too conjectural to be imminent, too widely shared to be particularized, and too far removed from EPA's regulation of motor vehicle GHG emissions to be fairly traceable to EPA's denial of the rulemaking petition. The dissenters thus would have dismissed on standing grounds.

On the merits, the dissenting justices viewed EPA's policy concerns as ""perfectly valid reasons"" to ""defer making"" an endangerment finding. They also believed that EPA had reasonably read the CAA not to regulate GHGs as air pollutants and that the agency's statutory interpretation was therefore entitled to deference under the Chevron framework, which required courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.

Legal Challenges to the Endangerment Finding

Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA

In response to Massachusetts v. EPA, EPA initiated a notice-and-comment rulemaking under CAA Section 202(a)(1) that resulted in the Endangerment Finding. Within six months of the Endangerment Finding, EPA issued three related but distinct GHG regulations addressing emissions from cars and light trucks and phasing in regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary sources. All four rules were challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and the challenges were consolidated under the name Coalition for Responsible Regulation v. EPA. The petitioners there argued that the Endangerment Finding should be set aside for five reasons. None succeeded.

First, the petitioners maintained that EPA's endangerment inquiry was flawed because it did not weigh ""the benefits of activities that require greenhouse gas emissions, the effectiveness of emissions regulation triggered by the Endangerment Finding, and the potential for societal adaptation to or mitigation of climate change."" The D.C. Circuit deemed that argument ""foreclosed"" by the language of CAA Section 202(a)(1) and by the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, both of which require EPA ""to answer only two questions: whether particular 'air pollution'—here, greenhouse gases—'may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,' and whether motor-vehicle emissions 'cause, or contribute to' that endangerment."" According to the court, the all-things-considered cost-benefit analysis that the petitioners sought was simply ""not part of the § 202(a)(1) endangerment inquiry.""

Next, the petitioners argued that EPA erred by delegating its authority to outside entities on whose scientific assessments the agency relied and then erred again by making an endangerment finding despite lingering uncertainty about the links between human activity and climate change. The court dismissed the first of those claims as ""little more than a semantic trick."" EPA did not delegate decisionmaking to any outside entities. Rather, it ""sought out and reviewed existing scientific evidence"" and used that evidence to form its own judgment. As to the second claim, the court held that EPA could act despite ""residual uncertainty"" about the causes of climate change because CAA Section 202(a)(1) was ""precautionary in nature"" and did not demand ""rigorous step-by-step proof of cause and effect."" Uncertainty might justify inaction, the court allowed, but per Massachusetts, it would need to be ""scientific uncertainty . . . so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."" Because the petitioners had not demonstrated that level of uncertainty, and because EPA drew ""rational"" inferences from the ""substantial"" scientific record before it, the court refused to second-guess the agency's ""science-based decisions.""

Third, the petitioners claimed that EPA had to define quantitative thresholds that separate ""'safe' climate change from climate change that endangers"" and that its failure to do so rendered the Endangerment Finding a mere ""subjective conviction."" The court rejected this argument, observing that the statute called for no such ""precise numerical value."" ""Quite the opposite,"" the court concluded, ""the § 202(a)(1) inquiry necessarily entails a case-by-case, sliding-scale approach to endangerment"" because ""danger"" is ""not set by a fixed probability of harm, but rather is composed of reciprocal elements of risk and harm, or probability and severity."" EPA's ""failure to distill"" an ""ocean of evidence into a specific number"" was a sign of the breadth and complexity of the agency's inquiry, the court held, ""not a sign of arbitrary or capricious decision-making.""

Fourth, the petitioners noted that while EPA had defined the ""air pollution"" subject to the Endangerment Finding as the combined concentration of six GHGs, motor vehicles emitted only four of those gases. EPA thus erred, the petitioners argued, by including the other two GHGs in its analysis. The court found that no petitioner had demonstrated an injury in fact from EPA's alleged error and so it dismissed the claim on standing grounds without reaching the merits.

Finally, the petitioners argued that the Endangerment Finding was procedurally unsound because EPA did not submit a draft of the rule for review by the Science Advisory Board, which reviews and comments on scientific and technical information supporting certain EPA regulations. The court held it was ""not clear"" if Science Advisory Board review was required. Even if that review was required, the court noted that the petitioners had not cleared the high bar that CAA Section 307(d)(8) sets for invalidating rules based on procedural error.

The consolidated challenges to EPA's three other rules fared no better in the D.C. Circuit, which dismissed or denied all petitions. The petitioners then sought Supreme Court review. The Court granted certiorari but only as to the D.C. Circuit's decision on two of the three rules that EPA issued shortly after the Endangerment Finding. The Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA vacated in part and affirmed in part those rules but on grounds that did not directly address the Endangerment Finding. Coalition for Responsible Regulation thus remains the last judicial word on the merits of that finding.

Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council v. EPA

Between 2017 and 2019, EPA received four petitions urging it to revise or repeal the Endangerment Finding. EPA initially denied those petitions on January 19, 2021, but later withdrew the denial after determining that its response ""did not provide an adequate justification."" After reassessing the petitions, EPA issued a new denial in 2022, concluding that the petitions rested on ""inadequate, erroneous, and deficient arguments and evidence."" EPA explained that the science supporting the Endangerment Finding was ""robust, voluminous, and compelling"" in 2009. EPA also noted that the 2009 Endangerment Finding had ""been strongly affirmed by recent scientific assessments,"" including the assessments that supported the agency's separate 2016 finding under CAA Section 231(a)(2)(A) that GHG emissions endanger public health or welfare.

The petitioners sought judicial review of EPA's denials, and the cases were consolidated in the D.C. Circuit as Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council v. EPA. There, the petitioners argued ""that '[s]cientific research since the adoption of the Endangerment Finding has invalidated' the EPA's earlier conclusions regarding the link between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change."" The D.C. Circuit declined to reach the merits of that claim. Instead, the court dismissed on standing grounds because the petitioners failed to show ""that they or any of their members have been injured by the Endangerment Finding"" or by ""a single regulation based on the Endangerment Finding."" Petitioners sought Supreme Court review, but the Court declined to hear the case.

Legal Considerations for Revisiting the Endangerment Finding

When EPA revises CAA rules like the Endangerment Finding, CAA Section 307(d) requires that the agency publish notice of the proposed change ""accompanied by a statement of its basis and purpose"" that summarizes ""(A) the factual data on which the proposed rule is based; (B) the methodology used in obtaining and analyzing the data; and (C) the major legal interpretations and policy considerations underlying the proposed rule."" EPA must also take public comment on the proposed rule. When it finalizes the rule, EPA must respond ""to each of the significant comments, criticisms, and new data submitted in written or oral presentations during the comment period."" This process, known as ""notice-and-comment rulemaking,"" typically takes months if not years to complete. The EPA Administrator has been quoted as saying that he ""anticipate[s]"" going through a notice-and-comment rulemaking to reconsider the Endangerment Finding.

EPA has not identified a basis for revising or rescinding the Endangerment Finding, but the agency has suggested aspects of the Endangerment Finding that it may now view as flawed. For example, in a March 2025 press release, EPA referred to the Endangerment Finding's consideration of six GHGs collectively rather than individually as potentially erroneous, a statement that the EPA Administrator reiterated in comments to Congress. EPA has also stated that ""new guidance"" on statutory interpretation contained in recent Supreme Court decisions such as Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo would inform its reconsideration, as would ""major developments in innovative technologies, science, economics, and mitigation.""

Any EPA final action to alter (or not alter) the Endangerment Finding would be subject to judicial review. A reviewing court would decide legal questions—including questions of statutory interpretation—""by applying [its] own judgment,"" without deferring to EPA's views. By contrast, EPA's fact-based policy decisions would be accorded deference, and a reviewing court would ask only whether the agency had ""acted within a zone or reasonableness."" EPA's basis for acting on the Endangerment Finding would thus determine the standard of review.

Because a revision or repeal of the Endangerment Finding would constitute a change in position, EPA would need to offer a reasoned explanation for its new approach. The Supreme Court has held that, in practice, this requires agencies to consider ""serious reliance interests"" that are affected by the change. If EPA were to revise or repeal the Endangerment Finding based on ""factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy,"" it would also need to confront the ""contrary or inconvenient factual determinations that it made in the past,"" including, for example, the evidence supporting its 2016 and 2022 reaffirmations of the Endangerment Finding.

EPA action on the Endangerment Finding could call into question the legitimacy of GHG standards for automobiles, power plants, and oil and gas sector facilities, which rely, in part, on the Endangerment Finding. While a repeal of the Endangerment Finding would not, by itself, repeal those later-issued regulations, EPA has announced that it intends to separately reconsider its operative GHG standards. It is uncertain whether or how EPA's reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding will inform its review of those other rules.

Considerations for Congress

Congress could respond in several ways to EPA's reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding should it choose to do so. For example, Congress could legislatively nullify the Endangerment Finding or, conversely, could codify it. Congress could also restrict EPA's authority to act—for instance, by prohibiting EPA's use of appropriated funds to reconsider the Endangerment Finding. More broadly, Congress could provide EPA with specific statutory instruction on whether or how to regulate GHGs under the CAA.

Alternatively, Congress could shape EPA's reconsideration process by altering applicable procedural requirements or by requiring EPA to weigh certain policy or economic considerations when deciding whether to modify the Endangerment Finding. The Employment Protection Act of 2011 (S. 1292), a bill introduced in the 112th Congress, would have done both of these things.",https://www.EveryCRSReport.com/reports/LSB11320.png,N,,2025-06-07 15:09:01.556196

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

Since he’s stepped away of the Trump administration, the entrepreneur has been a vocal critic of the legislation, including lamenting that “there is no change to tax incentives for oil & gas, just EV/solar.”

While the House narrowly passed its version of the bill in late May, it is facing hurdles in the Senate, where it is so far losing some momentum.

Here’s a look at the provisions that may be particularly impactful for the company – as well as other electric vehicle and climate-friendly energy companies:

Eliminates EV tax credits

One major way in which the “big, beautiful bill” harms Tesla is by making its cars more expensive.

The Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act lifted a cap allowing manufacturers that had already sold more than 200,000 electric vehicles to once again be eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit. It also extended eligibility for the credit through 2032

The bill effectively made the cars $7,500 cheaper for consumers.

But, the credits are cut in the GOP’s bill. Without that credit, Tesla and other EV makers may make fewer sales. One major hurdle facing the adoption of electric vehicles is that they are oftentimes more expensive than gas-powered cars.

However, Musk has contended when he was supporting Trump that he does not need the tax credit.

Cuts credits for solar energy

Tesla Energy sells both rooftop solar energy and grid scale solar power – both of which are hampered by the Republican bill.

The legislation axes tax credits for rooftop solar after this year.

It also eliminates tax credits for any grid scale project that begins construction more than 60 days after the bill is enacted. Projects also need to begin producing energy by the end of 2028 to become eligible.

These utility scale cuts are controversial even within the GOP and could face changes in the Senate.

Axes Biden-era EV regulations

The legislation would eliminate a Biden-era regulation that forces the electric vehicle market to shift toward EVs.

While Tesla is already all-electric, doing so could still impact its bottom line, as the way the regulations are set up, automakers either have to make their vehicles greener or purchase credits from automakers like Tesla that already outperform the regulations.

If the regulation is weakened, traditional car manufacturers may not have to buy as many credits from EV-makers like Tesla.

However, it’s not clear whether this provision will make it into what’s ultimately passed because it will first need to be approved by the Senate parliamentarian, which sets the rules for what types of provisions are eligible in legislation passed through a procedure that requires just 50 votes.",https://www.wjbf.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/47/2025/06/Tesla_060725_Getty_Spencer-Platt.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-07 21:06:20.225592

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy's announcement “a positive development"" that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department's action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. Manufacturers whose vehicles exceed the standards earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers.

South Carolina is investing heavily in electric vehicles.","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A Japanese company has halted construction on a $1.6 billion factory in South Carolina to help make batteries for electric BMWs, citing “policy and market uncertainty.”

While Automotive Energy Supply Corp. didn’t specify what those problems are, South Carolina’s Republican governor said the company is dealing with the potential loss of federal tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and incentives for EV businesses as well as tariff uncertainties from President Donald Trump’s administration.

“What we’re doing is urging caution — let things play out because all of the these changes are taking place,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.

AESC announced the suspension in construction of its plant in Florence on Thursday,

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” the company’s statement said.

AESC promised to restart construction, although it didn’t say when, and vowed to meet its commitment to hire 1,600 workers and invest $1.6 billion. The company said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence plant.

The battery maker based in Japan also has facilities in China, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. In the U.S., AESC has a plant in Tennessee and is building one in Kentucky. The statement didn’t mention any changes with other plants.

The South Carolina plant is supposed to sell battery cells to BMW, which is building its own battery assembly site near its giant auto plant in Greer. BMW said the construction pause by AESC doesn’t change its plans to open its plant in 2026.

AESC has already rolled back its South Carolina plans. They announced a second factory on the Florence site, but then said earlier this year that their first plant should be able to handle BMW’s demand. That prompted South Carolina officials to withdraw $111 million in help they planned to provide.

The company is still getting $135 million in grants from the South Carolina Department of Commerce and $121 million in bonds and the agency said a construction pause won’t prompt them to claw back that offer.

South Carolina is investing heavily in electric vehicles. Volkswagen-owned Scout Motors plans to invest $2 billion and hire 4,000 people for a plant to build its new electric SUVs scheduled to open in 2027.

The state has for decades made big bets on foreign manufacturers like BMW, Michelin and Samsung that have paid off with an economic boom this century, but there is uneasiness that Trump’s flirtation with high tariffs might stagger or even ruin those important partnerships.

McMaster told people to relax as state and business leaders are talking to Trump’s administration and things will work out.

This growth happens even with geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. It shows that the world is still focused on energy security and moving to cleaner energy sources.

This article explores the main trends, drivers, and challenges shaping energy investment this year, with the main findings from the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report. It provides a clear picture of where global energy capital is flowing and what challenges lie ahead.

Clean Energy Surges Past Fossil Fuels in Investment Race

In 2025, an expected $3.3 trillion will be invested in global energy generation. Of this, around $2.2 trillion will support renewables, nuclear power, electricity grids, storage, low-emission fuels, energy efficiency, and electrification. This is double the amount set for oil, natural gas, and coal, which will receive around $1.1 trillion.

Clean energy investment surged after the COVID-19 pandemic. This growth continues thanks to technology, economic factors, and policy support, not only climate policies.

Solar Power Leads the Way

Investment in low-emission power has nearly doubled in five years. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is driving this growth. By 2025, global spending on solar energy, including utility-scale and rooftop systems, is set to hit $450 billion. This will make it the largest energy investment category.

Solar panels, especially those imported from China, are becoming more affordable and are driving energy investment in many developing countries. For example, Pakistan imported 19 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity in 2024, about half its total grid-connected capacity.

Growth in Batteries and Nuclear Energy

Spending on batteries for power sector storage will hit $66 billion by 2025. This will help integrate renewable energy sources into electricity grids. Nuclear investment is also rising, with spending on new plants and refurbishments expected to exceed $70 billion this year. Interest in new nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), is growing, especially in the United States and the Middle East.

Global Giants Drive the Clean Energy Boom

About 70% of the recent increase in clean energy investment comes from countries that import fossil fuels, led by China, Europe, and India. China is investing heavily in reducing its reliance on imported oil and gas and becoming a leader in clean energy technologies.

A separate report by energy think tank Ember also shows the same trend – China takes the lead in clean energy investment in early 2025.

Meanwhile, Europe sped up its investment in renewables and energy efficiency. This change came after Russian gas supplies were disrupted due to the Ukraine invasion. The United States has boosted investment. This is partly to compete with China in the supply chains for new clean technologies.

Emissions reduction is a big reason to invest, but it’s not always the main one for mature and cost-competitive clean technologies. Investors are also influenced by concerns about energy security and the desire to lead in new industries.

Uncertainty in the global economy and trade is making some investors hold off on new project approvals. However, spending on current projects is still strong, especially in the field of rising artificial intelligence (AI) dominance.

AI + Energy: The Data Center Effect

The fast rise of AI and data centers is driving up electricity demand. This trend is also boosting investment in power generation. Annual investment in data centers has risen by 67% over the past two years, and from 2025 to 2030, an additional $4.2 trillion is expected globally.

By 2030, data centers might use 950 terawatt-hours of electricity, doubling their current amount. This could lead to over $170 billion in investments for new generation capacity. Renewables will meet most of this demand, as shown below.

However, interest is rising in next-generation solutions like small modular nuclear reactors. SMRs provide stable power and fit the constant energy needs of data centers.

Technology companies are also exploring geothermal energy partnerships, supported by rising venture capital. Tech giants and energy developers are teaming up for new nuclear and geothermal projects. However, challenges like cost uncertainties and regulatory hurdles for SMRs still exist.

Gridlock Ahead: Infrastructure Struggles to Keep Pace

Investment in the electricity sector is set to reach $1.5 trillion in 2025, about 50% higher than the total spent on bringing oil, natural gas, and coal to market. Spending on electricity grids is around $400 billion each year. But this isn’t enough to match the fast rise in power demand and the growth of renewables.

Delays in permitting, supply chain bottlenecks for components like transformers and cables, and the weak financial health of utilities, especially in developing countries, are slowing progress.

Coal and Gas Remain Significant

Despite the focus on clean energy, coal and gas continue to play a major role in some regions. In 2024, China greenlit nearly 100 GW of new coal-fired power plants. India added another 15 GW. This raised global approvals to their highest since 2015.

In contrast, advanced economies did not order any new coal-fired power plants last year.

Notably, investment in new gas-fired power is rising. The United States and the Middle East make up nearly half of the new project approvals.

Fossil Fuel Investment Trends: Oil and Gas Investment Declines

Oil prices and demand are set to drop, leading to a 6% decrease in investment in upstream oil projects in 2025. This will be the first annual decline since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the largest since 2016.

Upstream oil and gas investment is expected to drop by around 4%. This brings the total to just under $570 billion. Of this amount, 40% will go toward maintaining production at current fields. Investment in oil refineries is also set to reach its lowest level in a decade.

Spending on new LNG facilities is rising despite some delays and cost overruns. Projects in the United States, Qatar, and Canada are getting ready to start. From 2026 to 2028, the world may experience huge yearly jumps in LNG capacity, with the United States set to nearly double its export capacity.

Meanwhile, investment in coal supply is expected to increase by 4% in 2025, continuing a trend of steady growth over the past five years. This reflects ongoing demand in parts of Asia, even as advanced economies move away from coal.

The Outlook for 2025 and Beyond

The global energy investment scene is changing fast, as reported by the IEA. Clean energy technologies are drawing more money and interest. Fossil fuels are still important in some areas. However, the trend is shifting.

More investment is going into renewables, electrification, and energy efficiency. This transition is being shaped by technology advances, economic factors, and the need for energy security, as well as by climate policies.

To meet rising electricity demand and ensure energy security, investment in grids and storage should accelerate. As such, continued support for innovation and infrastructure will be crucial for a successful energy transition in the years ahead.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_1027756495.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 07:02:11.899058

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden's target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department's memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,"" Duffy said.

(Getty Images)WASHINGTON — Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.

While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by State Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.

Trump vowed in early April to “supercharge our domestic industrial base.”

“Jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,” he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.

But as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.

Critics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.

They have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

U.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.

Kevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.

“We’re just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we’ll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,” Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.

Doffling’s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.

Moving away from fossil fuels

The suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.

For example, the IRA’s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output.

Battery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.

Most credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.

A group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam” — echoing Trump’s rhetoric — pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.

The House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled “foreign entities of concern,” making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.

The legislation also repeals “transferability,” which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.

For example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.

Schneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals “reflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.”

Silfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.

Investment soared

Spurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.

Of the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.

The credit spurred a “sea change” in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.

Despite solar technology’s roots in the U.S., the nation “didn’t even have a toe” in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.

“But after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,” Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.

Active manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association’s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.

The renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.

Active solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.

Advanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.

But various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country — for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.

Lithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.

China largely dominates the world’s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.

When accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 — including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits — just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power’s 2024 report on clean energy employment.

Troy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.

“​​We’re getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,” said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.

“What troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can’t get anything done, and that’s been very difficult to deal with,” he said.

Industry slowdown

The industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.

Six announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor’s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.

Van Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.

“We had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,” Van Beek said. “And when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.”

Van Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.

Several companies declined States Newsroom’s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.

Spencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.

“Whether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you’re doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,” said Pederson, the association’s senior vice president of public affairs.

Too expensive, Republicans say

Some House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits — for example by removing the “overly prescriptive” restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.

Kiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that “the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.”

Her co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.

Far-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company’s ability to transfer credits.

The right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the “commonsense changes” championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.

The organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.

“The longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it’s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,” Thomas Aiello, NTU’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.

Hope in the Senate?

But representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.

Jeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that “The Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.”

Pederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are “particularly restrictive coming out of the House.”

“So we’re hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,” Pederson said.

Doffling believes senators have a “longer term vision” of the nation’s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.

“They see what’s happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,” Doffling said.

The House bill just sets the U.S. “further behind,” he added. “This bill is all about going backwards in time and hoping for the best.”

“I wish they could look at the numbers and understand the economic impacts it’s gonna have. … But somehow we’re talking about the fact of hamstringing a whole entire industry itself over verbiage of the word ‘clean.’”",https://delta.creativecirclecdn.com/perryville/original/20250606-232305-c58-solarpanelworker2025-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 09:03:34.486706

Since 2023, air quality planners with the North Central Texas Council of Governments have been drafting the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Quality Improvement Plan. The document outlines measures to improve air quality in North Texas across several sectors, including transportation, energy, water, waste management, agriculture, forestry and open space.

The plan is broken up into two parts:

The Priority Climate Action Plan is a short-term planning guide to improve air quality through 2030.

The Comprehensive Climate Action Plan projects emissions and targets sources of air pollution to improve air quality through 2050.

In a June 5 meeting, council of governments air quality planners Savana Nance and Irlenia Hermosillo said the agency is working to add more measures to the Comprehensive Climate Action Plan to focus on emissions generated through transportation.

The measures include reduced idling, improving traffic flow, reducing congestion, mitigating airplane emissions and using low emissions vehicles.

The agency’s air quality planners are working with other departments within the council of governments to ensure those new measures align with other regional projects, including the Unified Planning Work Program for Regional Transportation. The document summarizes the amount of funding available to go toward transportation and air quality activities planned by the region’s municipalities or agencies.

So far, the work program names 47 recommended projects, including those submitted by Trinity Metro and Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.

The second portion of the air quality improvement plan will include projects or initiatives to install more street lighting, add more sidewalks and bike routes, improve rail crossings and make public transit more accessible and convenient.

Transportation and vehicles produced the most greenhouse gas emissions out of any other source, making up 41% of emissions in 2022, according to data from the council of governments.

Through 30 public meetings and a survey, Dallas-Fort Worth officials and residents ranked lack of public transportation as one of their biggest concerns in North Texas. Climate change and local air quality were among their top concerns, too.

“This reinforced our decision to make sure that the (air quality improvement plan) was 0comprehensive and addresses criteria pollutants and (greenhouse gases),” said Hermosillo.

The development of the air quality improvement plan has been largely supported by a $1 million grant the council of governments received from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program in 2022.

In spring 2024, the council of governments sought a $199 million federal grant from the $4.6 billion awarded through the EPA’s Inflation Reduction Act. The only entity in Texas chosen to receive a portion of the funding was the city of Austin.

The $199 million would have funded 19 of the 44 initiatives and projects outlined in the air quality improvement plan.

One of the primary reasons that led the council of governments to participate in the EPA’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program is due to 10 North Texas counties currently failing to meet federal air quality standards, said Hermosillo.

While the region is within attainment for air pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, the Dallas-Fort Worth area has exceeded federal ground-level ozone limits as far back as the 90s.

The region has until 2027 to bring ozone levels to 70 parts per billion or under. If the region is in violation of air quality standards, polluters or major sources of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides could face annual fines of $45 million under the EPA’s Clean Air Act, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

The area could also be in violation of federal caps on particulate matter but air quality planners have not yet identified a designation due to pending standards on the air pollutant, said Hermosillo.

Ground-level ozone forms when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds are released in the air and mix in sunlight. These emissions largely stem from several sources, such as vehicles, construction equipment, locomotives and aircraft, according to the council of governments.

Particulate matter consists of microscopic solids or liquid droplets that can be inhaled and lead to serious health problems, according to the EPA. Particulate matter is often generated from construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.

Both ozone and particulate matter can lead to serious health problems, particularly respiratory conditions.

While the air quality plan continues to undergo drafting, the council of governments has prioritized short-term projects to cut both greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants in North Texas, said Hermosillo.

The council of governments will host meetings throughout the summer where the public is invited to provide feedback and comments on the transportation initiatives, according to Hermosillo.

To continue to receive funding through the EPA’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, the air quality plan needs to be finalized and submitted by Dec. 1.

More information on the plan can be found at the North Central Texas Council of Governments website.

Though eDesign Dynamics engineers rarely work on dunes, they often work on projects focused on habitat restoration and climate resilience.","Adriana Jovanovic clambered cheerfully over the metal railing next to the dunes along Rockaway Beach. She landed in a patch of sand where she and her team, nicknamed the “dune squad,” had sown native roses and goldenrod among other native plants.

“We’re hand watering those that need a little extra help,” she said as about a dozen helpers walked around with large water jugs that they filled from a hydrant across the street.

The local nonprofit Rockaway Initiative for Sustainability and Equity (RISE) is restoring a three-mile stretch of beach in Far Rockaway to help battle coastal erosion from sea level rise and storm surge. The dune squad, all local residents, work part time from spring to fall.

But RISE’s efforts on that beach relied on one crucial source that was recently lost: a portion of a three-year $11.2 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency. The cache was slated for local restoration efforts and upgrades for New York City Parks Department’s native plant nursery and seedbank in Staten Island.

The grant also covered training for 60 unemployed people from disadvantaged communities for climate-related jobs, mentoring for 75 high school students and the removal of four tons of waste and marine debris across Rockaway beaches.

In April, the Washington Post reported that, according to a court document, the EPA was cancelling 781 grants, many of which were related to environmental justice.

RISE’s funding, which was to continue through January 2028, dried up within weeks. RISE, legally known as the Rockaway Waterfront Alliance, had received about $100,000 of its $11.2 million grant, according to the USASpending.gov website, before the funding was shut down.

For Rockaway as well as the city’s Parks Department, the EPA edict is a devastating blow.

RISE has established a new 13-acre nursery along Rockaway Beach to grow native coastal species, specifically for conservation efforts along the Rockaway shoreline and serve not only their own restoration efforts, but that of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NYC Parks and other local groups.

A spokesperson for the New York City Parks Department said its Native Plant Center had expected RISE funds to upgrade its plant nursery facilities and improve a pipeline of plants appropriate for coastal habitats.

The dune squad’s effort is a small part of a holistic effort to improve and conserve Rockaway beaches, said Alana Danieu, RISE’s program manager. The work to replace stubborn invasive plants, like wheatgrass, knotweed and mugwort, with plants that are native to the ecosystem added color and increased biodiversity, Danieu said.

“All of our plantings are looked after by community members. When people have contributed to a natural space, they’re more likely to be invested,” she said. Plantings are usually community events where residents from across the area join for hours of neighborly gardening. Since the nonprofit’s own nursery is in an early stage, most plants this spring were purchased from a nursery in New Jersey.

With the EPA grant terminated, RISE staff are scrambling to find funding sources to continue their work. Executive director Jeanne DuPont says she plans to focus on the dune restoration and the nursery for now.

“Most of our eggs are all in this one basket now,” DuPont said. “We don’t have money for any more Covid or health related outreach. We don’t have any more money for food distribution, so all the other stuff that we were doing, we’ve actually completely cut back on.”

“We Didn’t Really Know What to Do”

The RISE grant, funded under the Biden administration’s 2024 Inflation Reduction Act Community Change Grants Program, was available at the beginning of February. A week later, according to DuPont, she withdrew a small amount of money. By the end of week two, she said, RISE no longer could access the funds.

“Our entire account was shut down and suspended so we couldn’t draw down money,” said DuPont. “We didn’t really know what to do.”

The grant was supposed to help create green jobs for local residents through its coastal resilience work.

“Rockaway is isolated, there aren’t many paid positions in the peninsula,” said Danieu, who oversees programs.

DuPont said she has spent what grant money she had on the organization’s nursery and restoring local dunes. Other plans, like a waste management initiative, a food equity program and a partnership with the city’s Parks Department were dropped.

“If this money does not come through—and it looks like now it won’t—there are a lot of government agencies, including the Parks Department, that are going to be very hard hit,” DuPont said.

The grant portal reopened in April, and DuPont was able to draw some funds to reimburse her organization’s work before receiving a termination notice on May 2.

In response to questions from Inside Climate News, Parks Department spokesperson Judd Faulkner wrote in an email that the agency “will continue the coastal native plant production using existing funds while we seek alternative funding sources for facility improvements.”

The EPA provided an email that said “as with any change in Administration, EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with Administration priorities.”

The email added: “Maybe the Biden-Harris Administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

The EPA also confirmed that it is committed to reimbursing grantees for funds spent prior to the termination notice in May. Beyond that, RISE will likely not see much more from the federal grant. Even the dune squad, which is still weeding and replanting, will likely have to be “scaled back” as the organization adjusts its budget and priorities through 2028, Danieu said.

“It really limits what we can plan for,” Danieu said.

Rockaway Peninsula Challenged on All Fronts

The Rockaway Peninsula, a long strip of land that juts out of Queens, is experiencing coastal erosion on the beach side, which faces the Atlantic Ocean, and on the bay, according to a 2019 report by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

“Sea level rise, without intervention, is eventually going to flood communities in the back bay,” said Rob Freudenberg, the vice president of energy and environment programs at the Regional Plan Association, a civic organization that looks at how to improve the quality of life in the tri-state area. “There is a chance to live with flooding in the Rockaways, but it will look different.”

The oceanside of the peninsula is also particularly vulnerable to coastal storm surge, an issue that became extremely clear during Hurricane Sandy, which devastated the area. Afterwards, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began an initiative to place an estimated 3.5 million cubic yards of sand onto the ocean side of the Rockaways to restore the coastline and bolster flood mitigation.

Since 2020, the Corps has also placed 14 groins—stone structures that help limit coastal erosion—on the beach, and are working on reinforcing a stretch of sand dunes on the water-facing side. The reinforcement will add cores of steel, rock and concrete to the structure.

Danieu said RISE’s restoration efforts work in tandem with the Corps, with native plants as a complement to the infrastructure upgrades.

Far from the dunes, on the bayside where the Rockaway Park-Jamaica Bay Conservancy works, marshland is being eroded by a combination of sea level rise and storms. Diminishing marshland undercuts natural flood protection, conservationists point out, and the hope is to stabilize the marsh.

“I lived in the community before Sandy, and I think anybody that has gone through a natural disaster will understand that the community is fiercely protective of what it means to live here,” said Elizabeth Stoehr, the deputy director of the nonprofit Rockaway Park-Jamaica Bay Conservancy.

“Living in such a coastal environment is pretty hard. It’s cold, wet, streets flood, people’s basements flood, people are moving their cars at high tide events,” she said. “We would only do this if the effort was worth it.”

Stoehr and DuPont said their nonprofits have worked with Rockaways neighborhoods which include public housing and a large number of low-income residents.

“When Storm Sandy hit and when Covid hit, we were one of the only organizations that were there and able to serve the community,” DuPont said. “We’re not just there to plant sand dunes. We really have been there to help in terms of health, wellness, connecting people to resources for health care or for food.”

Beaches as Tools for Climate Resilience

Coastal sand dunes are dynamic landforms. They need three things to form: sand, wind to move the sand and plants to keep the sand in place.

“[Dunes] have this ability to trap sand and continue to grow on top of themselves and increase in sand volume and height and elevation over time,” said Karina Johnston, a doctoral student at the Marine Science Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “They can provide this living, growing buffer of sand protection from waves and flooding.”

Johnston is a member of the California Coastal Dune Science Network, which connects scientists examining how dunes can bolster coastal resilience. In a 2023 study in Southern California, Johnston found dunes thrived with limited maintenance if weeding and replanting were implemented.

“The whole process is a little bit of a culture shift to start thinking about beaches, not just in terms of recreation, but also in terms of their protective capacity to be more resilient to climate impacts and sea level rise,” Johnston said.

The dune restoration effort in the Rockaways aims for such a result. RISE has worked with eDesign Dynamics, an environmental engineering firm, to create a coastal resilience plan to help frame its operations.

Though eDesign Dynamics engineers rarely work on dunes, they often work on projects focused on habitat restoration and climate resilience. Since Hurricane Sandy, senior partner Eric Rothstein said its engineers have been more focused on how habitat can thrive with new flood protection structures.

There are choices to make, he said, when considering beach conservation. Rothstein said he often asks, “What do you do when the driver is habitat versus what do you do when the driver is flood protection.”

In Rockaway, the engineers identified the most vulnerable areas of the beach and explained how the community could bolster protections.

For a small operation like RISE, such resilience planning is essential—and EPA has upended a timely effort and opportunity to prepare for climate change, DuPont said.

Commonly known as “rare earths,” these materials are required for a variety of components used in various industries.

These play an important role in automotive production and the export restrictions are already having an impact. Reuters reports that Suzuki has been forced to cease production of the Swift due to component shortages related to the restrictions. Production reportedly ended on May 26 and may partially resume on June 13.

More: There’s A New Trade Deal But China’s Cheap EVs Are Still Locked Out

Suzuki isn’t the only automaker facing challenges as the publication reported BMW‘s supplier network has also been hit by shortages. However, production continues as normal for now.

Unfortunately, that’s not the case for everyone as the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA) warned the supply chain is “already experiencing significant disruption due to China’s recent export restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets.” They added this impacts “both combustion engine and electric vehicles,” which threatens “automotive production and thousands of jobs in the European Union.”

This already appears to be panning out as some supplier production lines have reportedly been shutdown. However, certain automakers appear to be better off than others as Mercedes and Volkswagen told CNBC they’re not experiencing shortages at this time. The luxury brand also said they’re working to “significantly reduce” the amount of rare earths used in its vehicles.

While there likely won’t be immediate relief, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping talked about rare earths in a recent phone call. Trump later said, “We have a trade deal with China, as you know, but we were straightening out some of the points having to do mostly with rare earths, magnets and some other things.”

These talks are occurring amid Trump’s global trade war and China has been among the hardest, if not the hardest, hit. This suggests China could be using rare earths to pressure the United States into lifting heavy tariffs on its goods.

Update: Reuters is reporting China has granted temporary rare earth export licenses to suppliers of Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. Details are limited, but the publication said some of the licenses last for six months. This could give automakers some breathing room and it comes after Ford Explorer production was halted in May due to a rare earths shortage.

AESC has halted the construction of its $1.6 billion battery factory in Florence County, South Carolina, due to ongoing policy and market uncertainties affecting EV production. Despite the pause, AESC remains committed to the project and continues to receive substantial financial support from the state. Governor Henry McMaster has raised concerns about federal tax breaks and tariff ambiguities impacting the electric vehicle sector. The factory aims to create around 1,600 jobs and primarily supply battery cells to BMW, who is developing a separate assembly site nearby.

South Carolina – AESC, a leading Japanese company specializing in battery technology, has paused construction on its planned $1.6 billion battery factory in Florence County, South Carolina. The suspension stems from ongoing “policy and market uncertainty” affecting electric vehicle (EV) production and sales.

The announcement comes as South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster pointed to concerns over potential losses of federal tax breaks for EV buyers, alongside ambiguities surrounding tariffs imposed during the Trump administration, which have contributed to a tense investment climate in the sector.

So far, AESC has invested approximately $1 billion into the Florence facility. The factory is intended to significantly boost the local economy by creating around 1,600 jobs. Despite the current construction halt, AESC has indicated its commitment to resume building the facility at an unspecified future date.

The Florence plant will primarily supply battery cells to BMW, which is concurrently developing a battery assembly site in nearby Greer, South Carolina, that is projected to commence operations in 2026. Initially, AESC had proposed the construction of two factories at the Florence site to meet BMW’s anticipated battery needs. However, upon reassessment, the company concluded that a single factory would suffice, which led to state officials retracting $111 million in projected economic incentives aimed at supporting the project’s growth.

Despite this layoff in construction efforts, AESC will continue to receive substantial financial support from the state. This includes $135 million in grants and $121 million in bonds from the South Carolina Department of Commerce. These funds are designed to facilitate ongoing initiatives despite the stall in construction.

Moreover, the electric vehicle landscape in South Carolina remains vibrant with other significant investments. Scout Motors, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, is poised to invest $2 billion to establish a plant manufacturing electric SUVs. That operation is set to open in 2027, indicating robust interest in the state as a hub for electric vehicle production.

Concerns about the integrity of international investments in the U.S. electric vehicle market have arisen due to the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s tariff policies. Governor McMaster has expressed a balanced outlook, urging patience as local and business leaders actively engage with the Trump administration regarding trade and policy issues impacting the EV industry.

AESC, which operates facilities in various countries including China, the UK, France, Spain, Germany, and has existing plants in Tennessee and a developing site in Kentucky, has noted that it does not plan to alter operations at any of its other plants outside South Carolina, maintaining a stable production trajectory elsewhere.

BMW has reassured stakeholders that the timeline for its projects remains intact, affirming that the battery assembly plant in Woodruff is still scheduled to launch in 2026, independent of any delays pertaining to AESC’s construction status in Florence.

While this pause poses challenges, it underscores the ongoing evolution of the manufacturing landscape for electric vehicles and the delicate interplay between state policy, market dynamics, and international investment in South Carolina’s burgeoning EV sector.

,American Energy,2025-06-07 08:06:08+00:00,CBC,Is the Yukon's ambitious plan to connect to B.C.'s power grid even a good idea? | CBC News,"Chris Windeyer, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-bc-power-grid-analysis-1.7552201,"Late last month, the Yukon and B.C governments signed a memorandum pledging to work together to study the idea of a 765-kilometre power line that would connect the territory to the rest of the North American power grid.
""A grid intertie between both the Yukon and British Columbia is something that is extremely expensive,"" Pillai acknowledged this week.
""It's a major project, but it's a nation-building project.""
The province is also trying to fast-track major projects, including critical mineral mines, which will have major power requirements.
""A potential future pathway to hydro grid power would be transformative, allowing the project's critical minerals to be produced while minimizing its carbon footprint,"" said CEO Sandeep Singh.","It's big, bold and expensive: just the kind of project that would appear to meet the moment for Prime Minister Mark Carney's call for nation-building projects from Canada's premiers.

Late last month, the Yukon and B.C governments signed a memorandum pledging to work together to study the idea of a 765-kilometre power line that would connect the territory to the rest of the North American power grid. Ottawa is putting up $40 million to help fund a feasibility study.

And earlier this week, Pillai lobbied both his fellow premiers and federal cabinet ministers for infrastructure money, including for the grid connection.

""A grid intertie between both the Yukon and British Columbia is something that is extremely expensive,"" Pillai acknowledged this week. ""It's a major project, but it's a nation-building project.""

But is it a good idea?

A 2016 study put the cost of a line to Iskut, B.C., at $1.7 billion. The Yukon government admits the cost has only gone up since then, but one Whitehorse engineer says he's worried officials don't fully grasp how expensive the project would actually be.

John Maissan said a decade of inflation would put the cost at more than $2.1 billion today. But he said it makes more sense to calculate the growth in costs using the Handy Whitman Index, which specifically tracks the costs of electrical equipment and installation.

Using that index, Maissan said the cost is likely to top $3.2 billion and even that might be a conservative estimate. And unless Ottawa is willing to to foot the entire capital cost of the project, he said, Yukon consumers could be facing major rate hikes, on top of one already before the Yukon Utilities Board.

""I think right now, under present conditions, it just doesn't add up,"" Maissan said.

The idea, from the Yukon side, is to tap into B.C.'s grid for a new supply of electricity, mostly generated by B.C. Hydro. But Maissan said it's not even clear that B.C. would have the spare power to sell.

""My understanding is their renewable energy is pretty much fully committed and any surplus they might have for whatever reason typically gets sold, I believe, into California, where the electricity rates are quite a bit higher,"" he said.

The Vancouver Sun reported Wednesday that B.C. Energy Minister Adrian Dix issued a call for private-sector projects to add baseload power to the provincial energy grid as the government also plans to shut down natural gas power plants to help meet emissions targets.

The province is also trying to fast-track major projects, including critical mineral mines, which will have major power requirements. The Yukon is trying to pitch itself as a major source of critical minerals, with Pillai touting ""a potential of $200 billion in mineral production.""

""It's about mining, it's about sustainable energy sources for the Yukon so there can be growth,"" he said. ""There's going to be growth.""

Pillai denied the grid tie is related to any one single mining project. But the Casino project, a massive gold-silver-copper-molybdenum mine planned for Crown land northwest of Carmacks, will need huge amounts of power. And the $40 million for the grid tie's feasibility study came from a federal fund to promote critical mineral development.

Company documents project Casino will need installed generating capacity of 200 MW. By comparison, existing capacity in the Yukon is 148 MW. Right now, Western Copper and Gold, the company behind Casino, plans to build its own power plants that would run on liquefied natural gas, with a small amount of diesel backup.

Western Copper and Gold was also sure to issue a news release welcoming the $40 million for the grid tie study.

""A potential future pathway to hydro grid power would be transformative, allowing the project's critical minerals to be produced while minimizing its carbon footprint,"" said CEO Sandeep Singh.

But Casino is years away from regulatory approval, to say nothing of production. The company is expected to file its environmental and socio-economic statement to the Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board in July and the project is undergoing a panel review, the most exhaustive level of regulatory screening in the territory.

Rosa Brown, an energy analyst with the Pembina Institute, said the sheer scale of the grid tie project might be what makes it appealing to Ottawa.

""The words that are being used [are] energy security, resiliency, that sort of thing,"" she said. ""So it definitely seems to fall under the mandate of what we're hearing from the federal government.""

But Maisson, the retired engineer, thinks it would make more sense for the Yukon to look after its own power needs with smaller projects like grid-scale batteries hooked to wind turbines and the waylaid Atlin hydro expansion.

""The feds wouldn't have to pay for the entire cost for these projects, but helping them along could could make them economic and could keep our our electricity prices stable in the longer term,"" he said.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7501761.1743731440!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/ranj-pillai.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-06-07 07:02:16.183401

As highlighted in various forums, Kenya’s high power costs are not only undermining industrial competitiveness but also threatening to derail the country’s ambition of becoming a regional manufacturing hub.

Yet as the manufacturing sector grapples with escalating cost of electricity, there is a critical and urgent call for bold steps toward clean and energy-efficient alternatives.

In the face of such challenges, manufacturers must lead the charge toward energy transition, given that clean energy is not just an environmental imperative — it is now an economic one.

Electricity accounts for a significant portion of production costs, especially in energy-intensive sectors such as food processing and personal care manufacturing. According to Kenya Power, commercial and industrial users consume 55% of all energy sold, making them key players in any successful reform.

By adopting and producing renewable energy technologies, manufacturers can reduce their carbon footprint and stimulate green job creation. For instance, Pwani Oil made a strategic decision to invest in cleaner and more efficient energy systems. Today, 66% of the energy used across our operations comes from renewable sources, primarily our on-site solar power plant.

This has allowed us not only to reduce our dependency on the national grid but also to surpass our 2025 clean energy target by 16% — a milestone that affirms our long-term sustainability agenda. The solar plant powers critical manufacturing processes at our Kikambala facility in Kilifi County, dramatically reducing our carbon emissions and shielding us from frequent energy fluctuations. It has also enabled us to lower production costs, a benefit we aim to pass on to our customers while enhancing our competitive edge in both local and export markets.

Lest we forget, climate change poses significant risks to industrial operations, including supply chain disruptions and resource scarcity. By embracing renewable energy and sustainable practices, manufacturers can build resilience against these risks, ensuring long-term operational stability and sustainability.

While the private sector can innovate and invest, energy sector reforms are essential to sustain progress. We welcome the Parliamentary Energy Committee’s commitment to address power supply challenges. Chairman Hon. Vincent Musau’s assurance that the committee is working with the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA), Water Resources Management Authority (WARMA), and Kenya Power to find lasting solutions is timely and encouraging.

But more can be done. Incentives such as tax relief on renewable energy equipment, expedited licensing for private power generation, and investments in grid modernization are vital to fast-track the transition.

Kenya’s Vision 2030 hinges on the strength of its industrial sector. If manufacturers are to thrive and create the jobs that power our economy, energy must be reliable, clean, and affordable. Transitioning to renewable energy is no longer optional — it is a survival strategy.

The shares fell 14.3 percent for the day as Mr. Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, ramped up his public criticism of the House Republican domestic policy bill, calling it an “abomination.” The tumble — the company’s worst day since March and its second worst since 2020 — wiped out about $150 billion from Tesla’s market valuation.

A dispute over the policy bill spiraled in a matter of hours into a broader rupture in Mr. Musk’s relationship with the president, raising concern among investors about how the tensions might harm Mr. Musk’s businesses. Mr. Trump threatened to slash federal contracts and tax subsidies for Mr. Musk’s companies, which amount to billions of dollars.

“Investors fear that this Musk/Trump battle will stop their friendship and change the regulatory environment for Tesla on the autonomous front over the coming years under the Trump administration,” analysts at Wedbush Securities said in a research note on Thursday. Their deteriorating relationship is “a shock to the market and putting major fear for Tesla investors on what is ahead.”

The Republican spending bill would end a $7,500 tax credit from the federal government that has helped reduce the cost of buying electric vehicles. Mr. Trump said on Thursday that Mr. Musk was upset about the electric vehicle tax credit repeal — a claim that Mr. Musk swiftly rejected. He shared a video clip of Mr. Trump speaking during a March promotional event for Tesla at the White House. The clip showed the president speaking, with Mr. Musk standing nearby: “I ended the EV mandate. He never even complained to me.”

The latest drop in Tesla’s shares adds to several months of turbulence for the company. Its stock rallied in the aftermath of Mr. Trump’s election, before falling in the early months of this year as consumer protests against Mr. Musk’s role in the Trump administration intensified.

The tax credit repeal would hurt Tesla, which is the largest seller of electric vehicles in the United States. It could amount to a $1.2 billion hit to Tesla’s annual profit, according to JPMorgan analysts. Ending the credits would come as Tesla sales fall, the result of consumer backlash to Mr. Musk’s political involvement and the brand’s lack of new, more affordable models.

But repealing tax credits might not hit Tesla as hard as it would other automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor, both of which have invested heavily in factories and supply chains with the hope of eventually producing millions of electric vehicles a year. Tesla, unlike many of its competitors, might manage to reduce prices to prop up demand if the credits end.

Tesla wasn’t the only stock to plummet as the feud unfolded.

Trump Media and Technology Group, Mr. Trump’s social media company, also fell on Thursday, dropping 8 percent. The sell-off accelerated after Mr. Musk claimed the administration had stalled on releasing more of the government’s files on Jeffrey Epstein because Mr. Trump’s name would appear in them.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.","LEOPOLD, Ind. (AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to ... document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know’’ how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren’t satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

,Clean Energy ,2025-06-07 07:40:25+00:00,Inside Climate News,UN Scientists Propose a Plan to Meet Global Demand for Critical Minerals,"Carrie Klein, Lauren Dalban",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06062025/united-nations-scientists-propose-global-minerals-trust/,"Yesterday, a group of academics from seven countries released a policy brief and companion article in Science proposing a solution: a global minerals trust.
More than 70 percent of global production for key critical minerals is concentrated in a handful of countries.
There are benefits to being part of a global minerals trust both for countries with mineral reserves and for countries in need of minerals, Ali said.
Interest in critical minerals doesn’t come solely from motivations around clean energy.
For example, different types of wind turbines, solar panels or battery chemistries could significantly lessen the need for critical minerals, the report notes.","Minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper are essential to building clean energy technology. Without them, there can be no solar panels, no electric vehicles, no wind turbines and no batteries.

As more sectors and countries invest in renewable energy and electric vehicles, along with artificial intelligence and data centers, the global appetite for these critical minerals has skyrocketed—and it’s only predicted to keep growing. Demand is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency.

United Nations scientists warn that without the proper protocols in place, growing political tensions around minerals could quickly lead to conflict, threatening clean energy transitions around the globe. Yesterday, a group of academics from seven countries released a policy brief and companion article in Science proposing a solution: a global minerals trust.

The trust would treat minerals essential for renewable energy as “shared planetary assets,” according to the brief. It would aim to create fair and reliable access to critical minerals, improve environmental and social safeguards around mining and create a supply reserve to protect against shortages.

“If we have greater supply security and much more assurance on downstream processing, we will have more efficient outcomes,” said Saleem Ali, lead for Critical Minerals and Inclusive Energy Transition at the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health.

The problem is, “the easy-to-extract stuff is gone,” said Liz Dennet, CEO of Endolith, a startup looking to extract copper from existing copper mines using microbes. “What’s left is trapped in low-grade ores,” Dennet said, or deposits containing a small amount of materials. Extraction in such areas is more costly and more energy intensive.

New mines also take a long time to develop. The average mining project takes 16 years to get from discovery of the minerals to first production.

Just this week, the European Union made major moves to expand mineral mining. On June 4, the European Commission announced 13 new critical mining projects in countries outside of the EU for materials including graphite, nickel and cobalt. The Union’s demand for lithium batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage is set to increase 12 times by 2030, according to the Commission; demand for rare-earth metals used in wind turbines and electric vehicles is set to rise five to six times by 2030, and six to seven times by 2050.

This week’s announcement follows the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act, passed last year in an effort to secure supply chains for minerals and metals necessary for the region’s climate objectives, along with defense and space uses.

More than 70 percent of global production for key critical minerals is concentrated in a handful of countries. The largest lithium reserves are in Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. Indonesia is a hotspot for nickel, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo holds the most cobalt.

There are benefits to being part of a global minerals trust both for countries with mineral reserves and for countries in need of minerals, Ali said. For nations with ample mineral resources, a trust would provide stable and predictable demand, as well as access to a global market. For countries that consume minerals, the trust would ensure resources are available and priced fairly.

Interest in critical minerals doesn’t come solely from motivations around clean energy. In an April executive order, President Donald Trump directed the Secretary of Commerce to recommend ways to strengthen domestic supplies of minerals used for defense purposes, in jet engines, missile guidance systems and radar systems.

To shore up U.S. mineral supplies, Trump is expediting the process for securing deep sea mining licenses and permits. Environmental advocates are firmly opposed to deep sea mining, which they say poses drastic risks to marine ecosystems in the process of digging hundreds to thousands of feet below the ocean floor to access mineral deposits.

So far, there has been no commercial deep sea mining. Norway was on its way to becoming the first country in the world to do so, but halted its plans in December 2024 after extensive political opposition.

A minerals trust could help prevent new extraction and new mines, Ali said, by ensuring consistent access to minerals for countries without adequate resources of their own.

Improved technology, along with recycling materials, could also significantly reduce the need for new energy transition minerals. A 2022 report from the World Wildlife Foundation found that the demand for seven critical raw minerals for green technology—lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, rare earth elements, platinum and copper—could be reduced by 58 percent by 2050 with new technology, circular economy models and recycling.

For example, different types of wind turbines, solar panels or battery chemistries could significantly lessen the need for critical minerals, the report notes. A circular economy would place a greater focus on recycling, reducing demand and extending the lifetime of products.

Eventually, “we can have recycled metals that go back into the trust, like a bank,” Ali said. “We do hope that ultimately there will be more recycling and that we will be able to meet more of the demand through a circular economy.”

Ali and other report authors plan to propose the global minerals trust at the G7 Summit in Canada next week and at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Brazil this November.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1418004388-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 07:01:52.198156

Planning for data centers is a challenge for the utility industry. According to ICF International, U.S. electricity demand is projected to increase 25% between 2023 and 2030, driven by the growth of data centers, manufacturing and EVs. At the same time, data center growth projections are all over the map, and many proposed data centers may never be built.

“If all these data centers — or the majority of data centers — come to fruition, we’re going to see growth like I have not seen in my 40-year career,” said David Sorrick, Senior Vice President for the Southern Region at Pike Corporation, a company on the front lines of all this data center expansion. Pike helps utilities build the grid infrastructure that data centers need, from design and permitting to the physical construction of transmission lines, substations and renewables.

Sorrick, for his part, knows what it’s like on the utility side of the fence, with stints at Duke Energy, TVA and Oglethorpe Power before taking on a leadership role at Pike.

Through Pike’s work with utilities, as well as his background, Sorrick acknowledges data center growth as both a significant opportunity and a potential threat. The opportunity lies in serving massive new loads, often in the hundreds of megawatts. The threat comes from the risk that utilities may not be able to move fast enough to meet data center power needs, or that data center developers may not be able to deliver the load that utilities plan for.

When it comes to getting these projects off the ground, it is a well-known fact that utility interconnection timelines, permitting processes and supply chains run the risk of being too slow to keep up with data center customer expectations. However, according to Sorrick, the biggest choke point is actually further upstream – it is the lack of commitment and poorly-coordinated decision-making between the parties involved.

Sorrick emphasized that both sides—utilities and developers—are often hesitant to make large financial commitments early in the process without firm guarantees.

“Nobody wants to build a data center and then not have the electricity to provide it,” he said. “And then, on the other hand, nobody wants to build a generation plant and transmission to a 500-acre field where nothing gets built.”

On the developer side, Sorrick noted that many are still grappling with how to reconcile their clean energy goals with physical constraints. This mismatch has led to starts and stops in negotiations. One day, a data center might agree to a mix of renewables and traditional generation, only to walk it back days later.

In other cases, data centers are concurrently exploring or developing behind-the-meter solutions, from gas turbines to renewables to nascent solutions like small modular reactors.

“To build conventional generation and renewable generation behind the meter is a very real threat to utilities who would like to supply them,” Sorrick said.

Sorrick emphasized that Pike’s 80-year utility history and process knowledge is a key bridge to getting these data center projects done. “For a developer to try to do it independently, it’s cost and time prohibitive,” he said. Ultimately, this is what leads to the hesitation and project delays and stalls.

From permitting and engineering designs, to supply chain and construction, what both the utilities and developers need now is a third-party expert with end-to-end expertise that can project manage and implement these big data center initiatives for both sides, so that project timelines and feasibility are no longer concerns.

The report highlights significant shifts in electricity generation sources, natural gas dynamics, and renewable energy growth.

Electricity Generation Trends

In 2025, the U.S. power sector is expected to generate 2% more electricity compared to 2024. This increase is driven by rising demand across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.

Natural Gas

Despite being the largest source of electricity generation, natural gas-fired power plants are projected to see a 3% decline in generation in 2025. This decrease is attributed to rising natural gas prices, which are expected to average $4.10 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025, up from $2.20 in 2024.

Coal

As natural gas becomes more expensive, coal-fired generation is anticipated to increase by 6% in 2025. However, this is a temporary trend, as coal generation is expected to decline by 9% in 2026 due to planned retirements of coal plants and environmental regulations.

Renewables

Renewable energy sources, particularly solar, are set to experience substantial growth. Utility-scale solar generation is forecasted to increase by 34% in 2025 and an additional 18% in 2026. This growth is supported by the addition of 26 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity in 2025 and 22 GW in 2026.

Source 2024 2025 2026 Natural Gas 42% 40% 40% Coal 16% 16% 15% Renewables 23% 25% 27% Nuclear 19% 19% 19%

Natural Gas Market Dynamics

Natural gas prices are projected to rise due to increased demand and lower storage levels. The Henry Hub spot price is expected to average $4.10/MMBtu in 2025 and $4.80/MMBtu in 2026.

Factors Influencing Prices

Increased LNG Exports: U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are forecasted to grow by 22% in 2025 and 10% in 2026, driven by new facilities like Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi Stage 3.

Higher Domestic Demand: Residential and commercial sectors are expected to consume more natural gas due to colder weather patterns and increased heating needs.

Lower Storage Levels: Natural gas inventories started the summer season lower than the previous year, adding pressure to supply.

Renewable Energy Expansion

Renewable energy, especially solar, is poised for significant growth:

Utility-Scale Solar: Expected to add 26 GW in 2025 and 22 GW in 2026.

Small-Scale Solar: Residential and commercial sectors are projected to increase capacity from 44 GW in 2023 to 55 GW by the end of 2024.

Wind Energy: Anticipated to add 8 GW in 2025 and 9 GW in 2026.

Electricity Consumption Forecast

U.S. electricity consumption is projected to reach record highs:

2025: 4,201 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh)

2026: 4,244 billion kWh

This increase is driven by:

Data Centers: Growing demand from artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency operations.

Residential and Commercial Use: Increased electricity usage for heating and transportation.

Conclusion

The U.S. energy landscape is undergoing significant changes, with a clear shift towards renewable energy sources. While natural gas and coal continue to play roles in electricity generation, their shares are expected to decline as solar and wind capacities expand. Rising natural gas prices and increased demand underscore the importance of diversifying energy sources and investing in sustainable alternatives.",https://microgridmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2187259657.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 12:16:23.107154

Texas has long been a magnet for manufacturing and data center development, thanks to its business-friendly climate, abundant land, and low-cost energy infrastructure. But as the state’s electric grid faces new challenges from rapid load growth—driven in large part by data centers, crypto mining, and other large-scale users—the Texas Legislature has been grappling with how to manage the changing landscape in the State, most notably surging electrical demand in the ERCOT power region and the need for transmission and generation to meet the demand.

On May 29, 2025, the Texas Legislature passed SB 6, which enacted new requirements governing the planning, interconnection, and operation of large electrical loads and generation resources in ERCOT. SB 6 is now awaiting Governor Abbott’s signature. The bill will significantly impact how large electrical loads are planned, interconnected, and managed throughout ERCOT. Understanding SB 6’s impact on the regulatory and economic landscape is critical for anyone involved in siting, building, developing, or operating large-scale data centers or new industrial manufacturing facilities in Texas.

Key Takeaways

The new law is designed to balance Texas’s economic growth with the need for grid reliability, load growth planning, and fair cost allocation. Here’s what developers, investors, and operators of data centers and other large loads need to know:

Cost Sharing and Interconnection Standards

SB6 requires the Public Utility Commission of Texas to establish a rule for investor-owned utilities to address cost sharing and interconnection standards for new large load customers. Large load customers (defined at a 75 MW threshold, which can be lowered by the PUC), including data centers, will be required to contribute to the costs that utilities incur to connect them to the grid. The legislation also requires electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities that have not adopted customer choice to pass through the reasonable costs to interconnect large loads.

The PUC is directed to establish uniform standards for interconnecting large loads with the goal of supporting business development while minimizing the risk of stranded/increased costs from overbuilt infrastructure.

Subject to certain confidentiality protections, large load customers must disclose if they are pursuing similar interconnection requests elsewhere in Texas that could impact the planning and timing of their interconnection request so that utilities, ERCOT, and the PUC will have better information on which to base load projections and infrastructure planning.

Key Provisions for Large Electrical Loads

On-Site Backup Generation: Large load customers with on-site backup generation (capable of serving at least 50% of on-site demand but not exporting to the grid) must provide information about these facilities to their utility and ERCOT. During grid emergencies, ERCOT may require these customers to deploy their backup generation or curtail load.

Financial Commitments and Study Fees: A flat fee of at least $100,000 will be required for initial transmission screening studies for large loads, with additional fees for expanded capacity requests.

Net Metering and Co-Location Arrangements: New net metering arrangements between an existing generation resource and a new large load must be disclosed to ERCOT, which will study the system impacts. The PUC must approve, deny, or impose conditions on the arrangement.

Demand Management and Reliability Services: Utilities must establish protocols for curtailing load during emergencies for large loads interconnected after December 31, 2025 (excluding critical industrial and natural gas facilities), including requiring the installation of necessary equipment or technology before the customer is interconnected to allow the load to be curtailed during firm load shed.

Implications for Water and Sewer Corporations: These corporations may generate and sell electricity to ERCOT, using proceeds for operational costs or other authorized purposes.

Transmission Cost Allocation Review: The PUC is directed to study, and, if necessary, revise the methodology for assigning wholesale transmission costs to ensure all customer classes—including large industrial loads and data centers—are paying their fair share. This review will consider alternatives to the current four coincident peak method and must be completed by the end of 2026.

What This Means for Data Center Stakeholders and Other Large Power Users

These changes represent a shift in how large electrical loads are interconnected into the Texas grid and the regulatory approval process for co-locating large power users with existing generation. Large power users may ultimately face new requirements for cost allocation for grid interconnection, disclosure of development plans, and operational flexibility during tight grid conditions. Land developers, equity investors, and energy providers should pay close attention to the evolving standards for site control, financial commitments, interconnection planning, and regulatory requirements related to on-site and co-located generation.

We recommend that all participants in the data center ecosystem review their current and planned projects in light of these new requirements. Our team is available to help you navigate these changes and position your business for success in the rapidly evolving Texas energy landscape.

Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., joined Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and 11 other lawmakers in a letter urging the Senate to revise key provisions in the energy section of H.R. 1, known as the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Act. The group raised concerns about how the current bill treats clean energy tax credits, particularly around expiration dates, ownership restrictions and foreign entity rules.

In the letter, the lawmakers warned that unless the Senate adopts reforms, the bill could jeopardize billions in planned investments. They pointed to more than $14 billion in energy projects that have already been canceled or delayed since January, including $4.5 billion in April alone.

Kiggans said the bill in its current form leaves “significant room for improvement” and called for a clean energy policy that prioritizes American families, workers and manufacturers.

“That means reducing our reliance on foreign adversaries, protecting taxpayers, and giving U.S. businesses the certainty they need to keep investing in the projects that power our economy,” she said in the release.

The letter comes as Virginia developers face growing delays in grid access and interconnection studies, a required step before large-scale energy projects can connect to the power system. These studies help grid operators evaluate whether new projects can safely operate without affecting nearby homes or businesses.

As energy demand continues to rise, particularly in Northern Virginia, the volume of proposed projects has increased, extending review timelines. Lawmakers have pointed to this trend as another reason to clarify federal tax credit rules and provide long-term certainty for energy investments.

The letter specifically calls for changes to three provisions:

•.Foreign Entity of Concern rules, which restrict involvement from Chinese-linked companies and others deemed national security risks.

• Transferability rules, which affect how companies can sell or transfer energy tax credits.

• The “placed in service” requirement, which the lawmakers say creates timing uncertainty for developers.

The group recommends replacing the “placed in service” rule with a “commence construction” standard, which they argue would provide more flexibility for delayed or large-scale projects.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/55/15536f6e-da89-11ef-943f-3f2d5db89ded/6793e98b20e3a.image.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 09:03:41.998697

The Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, a nonprofit coalition of industry leaders, trade associations, and other stakeholders, released survey results Thursday showing New Jersey voters, by a 37-point margin, are more likely to support a political candidate who advocates for including more natural gas in the Garden State’s energy mix (63%).

Only 26% of those surveyed said they would support a candidate who wanted to continue the current Murphy administration's zero-carbon policies, and 11% were unsure. Among independent voters, 69% said they favored candidates who advocate for including more natural gas in the energy mix to increase power supply and lower prices.

An overwhelming majority of New Jersey voters (72%) said consumers should be able to choose what energy source works best for them, compared to those who support moving away from natural gas toward electrification of buildings and homes (16%).

In fact, the most popular of six proposed solutions to fix the energy supply-and-demand crisis facing New Jersey is an “all-of-the-above energy strategy” that includes natural gas working in partnership with renewable energy (66% support).

Key survey findings include:

82% of New Jerseyans are concerned about their economic situation

80% of New Jerseyans think their electric bills are too high

84% of New Jerseyans say that when it comes to energy consumption, affordability is most important, followed by reliability (66%) and climate change (40%).

A 20% increase in electric rates, approved by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, went into effect on June 1 because increased demand and lower supply caused a rise in electricity auction prices.

Although the Murphy administration had placed the blame on the region’s electric grid operator, PJM, NJBIA Deputy Chief Government Affairs Officer Ray Cantor said the administration shares some responsibility because it has shut down generation and discouraged the development of clean natural gas facilities.

“As energy bills increase across the Northeast in an already uncertain economic environment, it is no surprise that residents care first and foremost about affordable and reliable energy,” former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and Natural Allies Leadership Council co-chair said in a statement on Thursday.

“Coming out of the 2024 election, Democrats need to find their way back to common sense policies that put affordability and kitchen table issues first,” Nutter said. “It’s where independent and working-class voters are. Advancing balanced energy policies that include renewables and natural gas is key to tackling our energy affordability crisis and climate challenges together.”

The survey found that natural gas and solar are the two most popular forms of energy. Solar power is viewed favorably by 66% of the state’s voters, followed closely by natural gas (60%). Nuclear (47%) and offshore wind (44%) are popular, but less so. Even among Democrats, natural gas is viewed favorably by a 30-point margin (47-17%) and nearly 50-point margin among Independents (59-10%).

“New Jersey voters across the political spectrum want to return to a balanced energy policy that prioritizes affordability and reliability while also reducing emissions, and that only happens when natural gas works with nuclear and renewables to lower emissions, stabilize costs, and keep the lights on,” said Mike DuHaime, founder and CEO, MAD Global Strategy, which conducted the survey.

This is an election year in New Jersey, when voters will elect a new governor and Assembly members. Term limits in the state Constitution prevent Gov. Phil Murphy from running for a third term.

The construction of a $1.6 billion battery plant in South Carolina by Japanese company AESC has been paused due to policy and market uncertainties. The announcement comes amidst concerns over the potential loss of federal tax incentives for electric vehicle buyers and businesses, as well as tariff uncertainties from the previous administration. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has advised caution as these changes unfold.

AESC, which is committed to hiring 1,600 workers and investing $1.6 billion, has already invested $1 billion in the Florence facility. The company has plants in China, the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Tennessee, and is building another in Kentucky. The pause does not affect BMW's plans to open its battery assembly site in 2026.

Despite this setback, South Carolina continues to attract significant investments in the electric vehicle sector. Scout Motors, owned by Volkswagen, plans to invest over $4 billion and create 10,000 jobs for a new electric SUV plant by 2027. The state's strategy of partnering with foreign manufacturers like BMW and Samsung has historically bolstered its economy, though there are concerns about the impact of potential high tariffs on these relationships.

South Carolina is investing heavily in electric vehicles.","By JEFFREY COLLINS

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A Japanese company has halted construction on a $1.6 billion factory in South Carolina to help make batteries for electric BMWs, citing “policy and market uncertainty.”

While Automotive Energy Supply Corp. didn’t specify what those problems are, South Carolina’s Republican governor said the company is dealing with the potential loss of federal tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and incentives for EV businesses as well as tariff uncertainties from President Donald Trump’s administration.

“What we’re doing is urging caution — let things play out because all of the these changes are taking place,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.

AESC announced the suspension in construction of its plant in Florence on Thursday.

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” the company’s statement said.

AESC promised to restart construction, although it didn’t say when, and vowed to meet its commitment to hire 1,600 workers and invest $1.6 billion. The company said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence plant.

The battery maker based in Japan also has facilities in China, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. In the U.S., AESC has a plant in Tennessee and is building one in Kentucky. The statement didn’t mention any changes with other plants.

The South Carolina plant is supposed to sell battery cells to BMW, which is building its own battery assembly site near its giant auto plant in Greer. BMW said the construction pause by AESC doesn’t change its plans to open its plant in 2026.

AESC has already rolled back its South Carolina plans. They announced a second factory on the Florence site, but then said earlier this year that their first plant should be able to handle BMW’s demand. That prompted South Carolina officials to withdraw $111 million in help they planned to provide.

The company is still getting $135 million in grants from the South Carolina Department of Commerce and $121 million in bonds and the agency said a construction pause won’t prompt them to claw back that offer.

South Carolina is investing heavily in electric vehicles. Volkswagen-owned Scout Motors plans to invest $2 billion and hire 4,000 people for a plant to build its new electric SUVs scheduled to open in 2027.

The state has for decades made big bets on foreign manufacturers like BMW, Michelin and Samsung that have paid off with an economic boom this century, but there is uneasiness that Trump’s flirtation with high tariffs might stagger or even ruin those important partnerships.

McMaster told people to relax as state and business leaders are talking to Trump’s administration and things will work out.

“I think the goal of the president and the administration is to have robust economic growth and prosperity and there is no doubt there has to be changes made in our international trade posture and President Trump is addressing that,” McMaster told reporters Thursday.",https://www.thetimes-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Battery_Plant-Construction_Halted__28663.jpg?w=1024&h=665,N,,2025-06-07 10:02:52.558741

Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently canceled 24 grants approved by the Energy Department under former President Joe Biden. The action netted over $3 billion in savings. Earlier in May, Wright axed an additional $7 billion of green energy loans approved by Biden.

Unfortunately for taxpayers, the savings that Wright has identified are only a drop in the bucket of the wasteful spending that the Biden Energy Department approved. Here are five of the most egregious examples:

1. $10 Billion for Ford's Electric Vehicle Push and Eminent Domain Abuses

In December 2024, the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office (LPO) closed a $9.63 billion direct loan to BlueOval SK LLC, a joint venture between Ford and South Korean conglomerate SK On. The loan was approved to fund ""the construction of three manufacturing plants, to produce batteries for Ford Motor Company's future Ford and Lincoln electric vehicles [E.V.s],"" according to the award announcement.

BlueOval has begun or completed construction for these facilities—one in western Tennessee called BlueOval City—and two in Hardin County, Kentucky, known as Kentucky 1 and 2.

In addition to allocating millions of dollars in tax credits for the rights to house BlueOval City, the Tennessee Legislature also created the Megasite Authority of West Tennessee, reports Reason's Joe Lancaster. The board was granted the authority to execute contracts on behalf of development, which includes the power to seize private property through eminent domain. In most cases, the board lowballed local property owners, including Ray Jones, who was offered ""a measly $8,165"" for his acre of land, even though the going rate was $200,000 per acre. There is no set date for when the plant will open.

Kentucky 1 has faced numerous occupational safety and health complaints from its workers. A review from The Courier-Journal found ""dozens of workplace injuries; hospitalizations related to respiratory issues; unshakeable mold contamination; a bat-infested training facility; blocked emergency exit doors; and chemical exposure risks."" The state has opened investigations into the plant, which is scheduled to begin production later this year. Kentucky 2's opening has been indefinitely delayed. Michael Adams, CEO of BlueOval SK, recently told WDRB, that the plant's opening date will be a market decision, but ""the market is telling us that Kentucky 2 is not ready.""

2. Facility Upgrades for ExxonMobil

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021 created a new office within the Energy Department called the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), whose goal is to finance first-of-a-kind clean energy projects through private-public partnerships. One of the largest beneficiaries of the program has been Exxon Mobil.

The oil major was awarded a $332 million grant from OCED to ""enable the use of hydrogen in place of natural gas"" at a textile and plastics facility in Baytown, Texas. At the time of the announcement, the Biden administration said the project would prevent 2.7 million metric tons of carbon emissions per year. While an interesting technology, the project did not need taxpayer support. In the same year that Exxon received this disbursement (2024), the company reported annual earnings of $33.7 billion. The project's funding was canceled on May 30 by Wright.

3. Reducing the Carbon Footprint of Ketchup

No industry was spared from corporate welfare under the Biden administration, including condiments. In October 2024, Kraft Heinz was awarded a grant of up to $170.9 million from OCED. The award was intended to fund energy efficiency upgrades, the installation of heat pumps and electric boilers, and renewable energy technologies at 10 of the company's facilities.

The grant was also rescinded on May 30. Kraft Heinz says it will continue to invest in upgrading 30 of its manufacturing facilities and will invest $3 billion over the next five years ""to modernize"" its domestic supply chain infrastructure.

4. Financing for Lithium Processing in Nevada

In October 2024, the LPO announced a $2.26 billion direct loan to Lithium Nevada Corp., a subsidiary of Lithium Americas Corp., to build facilities to produce lithium carbonate—a critical component of E.V. batteries. The facilities will be sited next to and get their lithium from Thacker Pass, a mine site in Nevada that is estimated to hold the largest lithium reserves in the world.

The U.S. largely relies on imports to meet its lithium needs. These facilities could reduce this dependence, but that doesn't mean the loan isn't wasteful. The demand for lithium, and lithium-carbonate, is expected to significantly climb in the next few decades as the use of green technologies increases. In 2024 alone, demand for the metal grew by 30 percent.

Lithium Americas expects the mine, which began construction in February, to generate $2.2 billion per year in annual earnings. Taxpayers don't need to spend billions of dollars to support a project that the market seems to think will be successful.

5. Federally-Backed Green Steel Making

One of the largest steel makers in the U.S. was another beneficiary of Biden-era federal funding. In 2024, Cleveland-Cliffs, which generated $19.2 billion in revenue that year, was awarded up to $575 million in grants (which are still active) from the Energy Department.

One of these awards, worth up to $500 million, would implement hydrogen fuel into the steel making process and install two electric melting furnaces at the company's Middletown Works facility in Ohio. The project is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the plant by 1 million tons per year and received a $9.5 million disbursement in September 2024.

A second grant worth up to $75 million would electrify Cleveland-Cliffs' facility in Butler, Pennsylvania, which produces steel for transforms, motors, and generators. This project got a $19 million disbursement in August 2024. The company says these projects are expected to be live before 2030.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/06/6-6-25-v3-2-a.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 07:01:56.995819

TAE Technologies, a pioneer in commercial fusion power, has raised over $150 million in its latest funding round, surpassing expectations. Major names like Chevron, Google, and NEA contributed to the raise, joining both new and returning investors who see serious promise in TAE’s unique fusion approach.

The company announced that this fresh funding pushes the company’s total equity raised to more than $1.3 billion since it began operations in 1998.

TAE’s momentum sends a strong message: clean fusion energy is no longer just a futuristic idea. It’s shaping up to be a real-world solution.

TAE Technologies’ Fusion Breakthrough

Earlier this year, TAE achieved a breakthrough that stunned the fusion world. It created stable plasma at temperatures exceeding 70 million degrees Celsius using a simplified experimental setup. That’s even hotter than the core of the sun.

Reaching such temperatures is a critical part of making fusion viable for commercial energy production. TAE named this successful setup “Norm,” and the achievement brought the company one giant step closer to building reactors that can generate net energy.

Fusion Energy: The Holy Grail of Clean Energy

Fusion is often called the holy grail of clean energy! It’s the same process that powers the sun and stars. In fusion, light elements combine under extreme heat and pressure, releasing massive amounts of energy.

Unlike conventional nuclear power, fusion doesn’t involve chain reactions or radioactive waste that sticks around for thousands of years. The process is inherently safe. If anything goes wrong, the reaction simply stops.

Michl Binderbauer, CEO of TAE Technologies, said:

“Fusion has the potential to transform the energy landscape, providing near-limitless clean power at a time when the world’s energy needs are growing exponentially due to the growth of AI and data centers. TAE’s technology uses the soundest physics to deliver superior performance in a compact machine, with attractive economics and best-in-class maintainability. We are leading the charge to develop revolutionary fusion technology for full-scale commercial deployment.”

What Makes TAE’s Fusion Approach Different

TAE isn’t chasing the same fusion model as everyone else. While many companies rely on deuterium-tritium fuel, which creates radioactive waste, TAE is betting on a cleaner path.

Here’s what makes their method unique:

Hydrogen-Boron Fusion (p-B11)

TAE uses hydrogen and boron—also known as proton-boron-11 or p-B11—as fusion fuel. This combination produces three helium atoms and zero radioactive waste. It’s abundant, safe to handle, and doesn’t require the costly cleanup associated with traditional nuclear power.

Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC)

TAE developed a proprietary fusion design called the advanced beam-driven Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC). It uses neutral particle beams to heat and stabilize plasma inside a magnetic field. Unlike tokamaks or lasers, FRC is linear, compact, and modular—perfect for mass production.

This approach allows for easier construction, lower costs, and more flexibility when scaling fusion power around the world.

Built for the Real World

TAE’s fusion reactors can fit with existing energy infrastructure. They work like today’s power plants but without emissions or meltdown risk. Heat from the fusion reaction is used to make steam, spin a turbine, and generate electricity.

The design also allows for modular deployment, so units can be added as needed. This makes it ideal for various geographies and grid setups.

Google’s AI Collaboration Helped Push Fusion Technology Forward

Google has played a central role in TAE’s progress. The tech giant has been working closely with the fusion company since 2014, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to fine-tune plasma behavior. Google engineers even worked on-site with TAE teams, helping to co-develop key technologies like the Optometrist Algorithm—a tool that dramatically improves the quality and stability of plasma.

This close integration between fusion science and advanced computing has given TAE a unique edge in an industry that often struggles with complexity.

Binderbauer expressed further,

“We’re delighted to continue our relationship with Google, who have not only provided funding to TAE but collaborated closely in research and development over many years. With this latest fundraise, we look forward to accelerating our efforts to deliver commercial fusion power.”

TAE Fusion Tech Ready to Power Today’s Grid

TAE’s fusion system can connect directly with today’s power grid. Like traditional plants, it uses heat to spin turbines, but instead of burning fossil fuels, it fuses atoms to create clean energy.

The heat from fusion warms the reactor walls. Pipes transfer that heat to a steam generator, which spins a turbine and produces electricity, just like existing infrastructure, but without the emissions.

TAE has steadily advanced its technology, building five powerful demo units and partnering with top scientists. In early 2025, it unveiled a simpler, faster plasma control method, bringing commercial fusion closer than ever.

Copernicus Reactor Aims for Net Energy Breakthrough

With the Norm breakthrough achieved, TAE is now focused on its next big goal—building a fusion machine that creates more energy than it uses. The new device, called Copernicus, is already under construction. If it proves net energy gain, it will be a major step forward for clean energy and one of the most important milestones in fusion history.

Da Vinci Prototype to Supply Clean Power to the Grid

TAE is also working on its first full-scale fusion power plant, called Da Vinci. This prototype will plug directly into the grid and provide clean, reliable electricity with zero carbon emissions.

If everything stays on track, Da Vinci could start running in the early 2030s, bringing fusion power to the real world.

Fusion’s Moment Is Finally Coming

For decades, fusion energy felt like a dream just out of reach. But now, the story is changing. Thanks to breakthroughs like TAE’s, fusion is moving from lab tests to real-world applications. It’s no longer “someday.” It’s “soon.”

Fusion energy isn’t just another clean energy option. It’s something much bigger. It’s safe, limitless, and doesn’t create any harmful waste. If successful, it could completely reshape how the world powers itself—cutting emissions, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and giving countries a stable, homegrown energy source.

Industries where fusion energy will be useful

What prompted me was our experience in assigning [private] ratings to offshore wind projects in Europe and wanted to figure out what was different [for rating] with onshore and offshore wind. It was the result of our recent work, which is private, but we’ve seen the trend – a lot of the big players in the offshore wind space are kind of trying to partner up with private equity firms to sell their interests, their operating offshore wind assets. But to raise that they’ll need credit ratings and we’ve seen those transactions. This is a growing area in Europe, because Europe has to rely on offshore wind to achieve its climate goals and secure their energy independence.

The report goes through risks in many ways, including challenging conditions for construction. Tell me about the challenges that offshore wind faces specifically as an investment risk.

The principle behind offshore wind is so different than onshore wind. You’re converting wind energy to electricity but obviously there are a bunch of areas where we believe it is riskier. That doesn’t mean you can’t fund those projects but you need additional mitigants.

This includes construction risk. It can take three to five years to complete an offshore wind project. The marine condition, the climate condition, you can’t do that [work] throughout the year and you need specialized vehicles, helicopters, crews that are so labor intensive. That’s versus onshore, which is pre-fabricated where you have a foundation and assemble it. Once you have an idea of the geotechnical conditions, the risk is just less.

There’s also the permitting process, which can be very challenging. How do you not interrupt the marine ecosystem? That’s something the regulators pay attention to. It’s definitely more than an onshore project, which means you need other mitigants for the lender to feel comfortable.

With respect to the permitting risk, how much of that is the risk of opposition from vacation towns, environmentalists, fisheries?

To be honest, we usually come in after all the critical permitting is in place, before money is given by a lender, but I also think that on the government’s side, in Europe at least, they probably have to encourage the development. And to put out an auction for an area you can build an offshore wind project, they must’ve gone through their own assessment, right? They can’t put out something that they also think may hurt an ecosystem, but that’s my speculation.

A country that did examine the impacts and offer lots of ocean floor for offshore is the U.S. What’s your take on offshore wind development in our country?

Once again, because we’re a rating agency, we don’t have much insight into early stage projects. But with that, our view is pretty gloomy. It’s like, if you haven’t started a project in the U.S., no one is going to buy it. There’s a bunch of projects already under construction, and there was the Empire Wind stop order that was lifted. I think that’s positive, but only to a degree, right? It just means this project under construction can probably go ahead. Those things will go ahead and have really strong developers with strong balance sheets. But they’re going to face additional headwinds, too, because of tariffs – that’s a different story.

We don’t see anything else going ahead.

Does the U.S. behaving this way impact the view you have for offshore wind in other countries, or is this an isolated thing?

It’s very isolated. Europe is just going full-steam ahead because the advantage here is you can build a wind farm that provides 2 or 3 gigawatts – that’s just massive. China, too. The U.S. is very different – and not just offshore. The entire renewables sector. We could revisit the U.S. four or five years from today, but [the U.S.] is going to be pretty difficult for the renewables sector.

But between the lines, and beneath the talking points and hopium, executives are fretting that lots of future investments are in jeopardy. And the most pessimistic take: almost all projects will have their balance sheets and time-tables impacted in some way that’ll at minimum increase their budget costs.

“It’s hard to imagine, if the legislation passes in its current form, that it wouldn’t impact all projects,” said Rob Collier, CEO of renewable energy transaction platform LevelTen.

Even industry analysts with the gloomiest views of the repeal say there’s plenty of projects that will keep chugging along and might even become more valuable to investors if they’re close enough to construction or operation. This aligns with recent analysis from BloombergNEF, which found the House bill would diminish our nation’s renewables build-out – but not entirely end its pace.

“The more useful way to break down which project may be hit the hardest is where the projects are going to fall in their development life-cycle,” Collier said. “Projects that have either started construction or have the ability to start construction … are going to very likely rise in terms of their appeal and attractiveness and those projects will be at a premium, if they’re able to skate through the legislative risk and qualify for tax credits.”

There is a more optimistic industry view that believes increased project costs will just be passed along to consumers via higher electricity prices. The American people will in essence have to pick up the tab where the federal tax code left it. Optimists also cite the increased use of power purchase agreements, or PPAs, between renewables developers and entities who need a lot of electricity, like big tech companies. By signing these PPAs, buyers are subsidizing the construction of projects but also insulating themselves from the risk of rising electricity prices.

The most bullish perspective I heard was from Nick Cohen, the CEO of Doral Renewables, who told me deals like these combined with rising premiums for quick energy on the grid may obviate lost credits in a “zero-incentive environment.”

“It’s not the end of the world,” Cohen told me. “If you’re in construction or you’re going to be in construction very soon, you’re fine.”

But Collier called Cohen’s prediction an “experiment” in customers’ willingness to pay for new energy: “If we’re talking about 40%, 50%, 60% of a project’s capital stack now being at risk because of tax credits, those are pretty large price increases.”

I spoke to multiple companies that have been inking massive deals as this legislation has progressed — although many were not nearly as sanguine about the industry’s future prospects as Doral. Like rPlus Energies, which disclosed last week that it closed a commitment for more than $500 million in tax equity investments for a solar and storage project in Utah. rPlus CEO Luigi Resta told me that the legislation “certainly has posed concern from our investors and from the organization” but the project was so far along that the tax equity investment market wasn’t phased by the bill.

“Many people in my company, myself included, have been doing this for more than 20 years. We’ve seen the starts and stops related to ITC and PTC in solar and wind, in multiple cycles, and this feels like another cycle,” Resta told me. “When the IRA passed, everybody was exuberant. And now the runway looks like it may have a cliff. But for us, our mantra since the beginning of the year has been ‘proceed with caution, preserve and protect.’”

However, crucially, it is important to focus on how that caution looks: Resta told me the company has completely paused new contracting while the company is completing the projects it is currently developing.

One government affairs representative for a large and prominent U.S. renewables developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships, told me that “whatever rollback occurs will just result in higher electricity prices over time.” In the near term, the only language that would truly gut projects in progress today would be “foreign entity of concern” restrictions that would broadly impact any component even remotely connected to Chinese industries. Similar language all but kneecapped the entire IRA electric vehicle consumer credit.

“It included definitions of what it means to be a foreign company that were really vague,” the government affairs representative said. “Anyone who does any business with China essentially can’t benefit from the credit. That was a really challenging outcome from the House that hopefully the Senate is going to fix.” If this definition became law, this source said, it would be the final straw that “freezes investment” in renewable energy projects.

Ultimately, after speaking to CEO after CEO this week, I’ve been left with an impression that business activity in renewables hasn’t really subsided after the House bill passed, and that it’ll be the Senate bill that undoubtedly defines the future of renewable energy for years to come.

Whether that chamber remains the “cooling saucer” it once was will be the decider.

How much do we know about developers’ reactions to the anti-IRA bill that was passed out of the House last week?

So it’s only been a few days. What I can tell you is there’s a lot of surprise about what came out of the House. Industries mobilized in trying to improve the bill from here and I think a lot of the industry is hopeful because, for many reasons, the bill doesn’t seem to make sense for the country. Not just the renewable energy industry. There’s hope that the voices in Congress — House members and senators — who already understand the impact of this on the economy will in the coming weeks understand how bad this is.

I spoke to a tax attorney last week that her clients had been preparing for a worst case scenario like this and preparing contingency plans of some kind. Have you seen anything so far to indicate people have been preparing for a worst case scenario?

Yeah. There’s a subset of the market that has prepared and already executed plans.

In Q4 [of 2024] and Q1 [of this year] with a number of companies to procure material from projects in order to safe harbor those projects. What that means is, typically if you commence construction by a certain date, the date on which you commence construction is the date you lock in tax credit eligibility, and we worked with companies to help them meet that criteria. It hedged them on a number of fronts. I don’t think most of them thought we’d get what came out of the House but there were a lot of concerns about stepdowns for the credit.

After Trump was elected, there were also companies who wanted to hedge against tariffs so they bought equipment ahead of that, too. We were helping companies do deals the night before Liberation Day. There was a lot of activity.

We saw less after April 2nd because the trade landscape has been changing so quickly that it’s been hard for people to act but now we’re seeing people act again to try and hit that commencement milestone.

It’s not lost on me that there’s an irony here – the attempts to erode these credits might lead to a rush of projects moving faster, actually. Is that your sense?

There’s a slug of projects that would get accelerated and in fact just having this bill come out of the House is already going to accelerate a number of projects. But there’s limits to what you can do there. The bill also has a placed-in-service criteria and really problematic language with regard to the “foreign entity of concern” provisions.

Are you seeing any increase in opposition against solar projects? And is that the biggest hurdle you see to meeting that “placed-in-service” requirement?

What I have here is qualitative, not quantitative, but I was in the development business for 20 years, and what I have seen qualitatively is that it is increasingly harder to develop projects. Local opposition is one of the headwinds. Interconnection is another really big one and that’s the biggest concern I have with regards to the “placed-in-service” requirement. Most of these large projects, even if you overcome the NIMBY issues, and you get your permitting, and you do everything else you need to do, you get your permits and construction… In the end if you’re talking about projects at scale, there is a requirement that utilities do work. And there’s no requirement that utilities do that work on time [to meet that deadline]. This is a risk they need to manage.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDUwNzIxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4ODczODA0M30.PM5fRVxnerl44zeEssorA2rcQ-eJshThm_b1d3LY0_I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C143%2C0%2C143,N,,2025-06-07 09:03:51.963625

Gov. McMaster points to uncertainty in Washington, but urges people to “relax”

A battery cell maker is pausing work on its manufacturing plant under construction in the Pee Dee, delaying its pledge of 1,600 new jobs for South Carolinians.

Envision Automotive Energy Supply Co. (AESC) announced the work stoppage Thursday, two years after breaking ground on the facility near Florence.

“AESC has informed the state of South Carolina and our local partners that due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement. “We anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize.”

The Japanese-headquartered firm already has invested more than $1 billion into the Florence facility, Grantham said.

He said the company “fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years,” but did not indicate what the new timeline might be. The company declined to provide further comment.

Gov. Henry McMaster, while speaking to reporters, pointed to uncertainty in Washington, D.C., as a reason.

“We hate to see that happen, but a pause is OK,” he said, noting a temporary suspension last week at Volvo’s Lowcountry plant.

The staunch supporter of President Donald Trump said “there’s no doubt” that changes must be made to international trade policy, while recognizing the administration’s roller coaster tariff announcements will have an effect.

“The tariffs are going up and down, and some of those are being paused,” McMaster said.

He also addressed the uncertainty of what Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending will do for the electric vehicle industry. As passed by the U.S. House, the bill would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits, both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those who install EV charging stations at their homes or business. It’s unclear what the Senate will do.

Regardless, McMaster said he’s confident that South Carolina’s economy, “despite all the ups and downs, is still going up, up, up.”

He said he’s communicating with South Carolina’s delegation, company officials, and the White House.

“Let things play out, because all of these changes are taking place,” the governor said. “So, I’d say, relax if you can. … We believe that, give it some time, and it’ll work out.”

The industry already wasn’t meeting early growth expectations before Trump took office.

However, electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally.

But the lag in growth has led to multiple setbacks for the fledgling industry, with canceled investments both nationally and in the Palmetto State. Automakers have also eased away from goals of going all-electric in favor of a mix of electric and plug-in hybrids.

A repeal of consumer tax credits could further slow progress.

AESC’s pause comes just four months after the battery cell manufacturer pulled back on earlier plans to expand the plant beyond its original scope.

BMW contracted with AESC to produce battery cells for the German auto giant’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in the Upstate. The automaker has already invested $700 million dollars in its own battery plant in Woodruff, planning to place the cells it receives from AESC into the batteries it assembles there.

BMW spokesman Steve Wilson said those battery assembly plans are still on schedule to begin in 2026.

Between the initial announcement in 2022 and March 2024, AESC rolled out three separate rounds of investment and promises of jobs in Florence. In addition to supplying BMW’s Spartanburg County assembly plant, the company made plans for a second building that was supposed to produce battery cells for a BMW plant in Mexico.

But in February, AESC told the state the first factory would be enough to meet the demand for both of BMW’s facilities. It pulled out of plans for a second, $1.5 billion building, along with the 1,080 jobs that came with it.

In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.

The incentives claw back was a rare move for the state. But even with the pull back, AESC’s remaining plant had still been on track to become the largest economic development deal in the Pee Dee region, according to the state Department of Commerce.

The remaining $121 million in bonds and $135 million in grants Commerce offered as an initial incentive to lure AESC to South Carolina are so far unaffected by the shutdown, Commerce spokeswoman Alex Clark.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks.
The Transportation Department's memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.
Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.
The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.","Detroit — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule Friday that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks were illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden's target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department's memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,"" Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months. Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons (265 billion liters) of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy's announcement “a positive development"" that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department's action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. Manufacturers whose vehicles exceed the standards earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers.

The memo and bill text landed this week as Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump engage in a public spat online, with Trump suggesting that Musk “only developed a problem” with his budget bill because it rolls back tax credits for EVs. Musk disputes that.

As soon as his disagreements with his former cost-cutter-in-chief, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, spilled into public view, Trump pulled out some of his most time-tested anti-electric vehicle takes.

""I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!,"" the president posted on his social media platform Truth Social yesterday.

And speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump added: “All of a sudden [Musk] had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars.""

It is true that since leaving his post as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Musk has railed against Trump's signature budget legislation, dubbed the ""Big, Beautiful Bill."" It is also true that—at least according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis—that bill could add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, which Musk says is his problem with the legislation. And it is also true that the Big, Beautiful Bill will end the federal EV tax credit program and likely hurt the growth of the electric market in America.

Everything after that gets a bit murky. But since this feud likely won't end well for EVs or for Tesla, it's worth asking where Musk stood on the electric tax credit question in all the months he spent funding Trump's presidential campaign and then operating out of his White House.

Aside from the Tesla-only car show he put on in March as the automaker's stores became known more for protests than as places to actually buy cars, Trump's stance on EVs has been largely consistent over the years. In a 2023 Christmas message, he told those supporting ""All Electric Car Lunacy"" to ""ROT IN HELL."" He routinely criticized President Joe Biden's pro-EV policies as promoting a ""hoax"" that would destroy the auto industry. He frequently repeats the claim that EVs ""can't go far,"" even as range and performance increase dramatically with each passing year. And his administration has been adamantly pro-fossil-fuel, as well as staffed extensively with veterans of that industry.

But politics makes strange bedfellows, as they say. Given Trump's pro-gas proclivities, the partnership between him and Musk—CEO of the world's largest- or second-largest EV maker and godfather of the modern EV industry—always felt unusual. At most, Trump offered a concession that he ""[has to be]... for electric cars, because Elon endorsed me very strongly,” which is not exactly a ringing endorsement.

Their relationship was always more rooted in Musk's far-right political turn in recent years, and his apparent hatred for excessive government spending, than anything else. That was how things looked on the surface, anyway. Anyone looking a little closer could quickly realize that Musk's support of Trump was heavily transactional and stemming from his desire to clear out regulations in the way of his businesses—namely, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and space travel.

Musk was quite direct about this last October: ""There should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,"" Musk said on a third-quarter earnings call, instead of a state-by-state patchwork of rules. Then Trump won the election and Tesla's stock price surged on the idea that the ""First Buddy"" would ensure that future autonomous vehicle rules would specifically benefit the technology he's betting the company's future on.

EVs themselves didn't seem to come up much in the Trump-Musk bromance. Certainly, there was never a moment where Trump appeared to be visited by three ghosts one evening and then decided it was essential to keep the Biden-era EV buying and manufacturing credits even as a way to stay ahead of China in the space, or even help Musk keep the cash flowing. “I’ll tell you, he’s never called me and said, could you lay off the electric car?” Trump told Fox News last year.

And given the choice between following the president's will and keeping EV manufacturing jobs alive in their districts, members of Congress firmly went with Option One.

If anyone could have prevented this outcome, it was Musk. And yet, that's not where the United States seems to be headed.

Musk never seemed to address this disconnect, either. In a late January Tesla earnings call, he was asked by an analyst about his views on what EV policy should be in the Trump era. Musk demurred and essentially said: the EV transition is going to happen anyway, so I'm not worried about it. ""At this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable,"" Musk said. ""I'm highly confident that all transport will be autonomous, electric, including aircraft, and that simply, it can't be stopped.""

During that time, as sales to Tesla's typically liberal, coastal buyers declined, it's not like heartland conservatives rushed in to pick up the slack. There was a fundamental misalignment between Musk's politics and the audience for the cars he sells, a circle he could never quite square.

It also wasn't always his first priority. Musk moved mountains in recent months to shift American policy and government spending to better align with his worldview. The country, and perhaps everyone on Earth, may feel the lasting effects of DOGE for a very long time. If Musk wanted to secure a future for zero-emission transportation in America, he likely could've done it more, better and harder than anyone else. But now he and Trump are on the outs, and Trump is back to business as usual when it comes to EVs.

One other thing is objectively true: when Trump feels he's been slighted, he does not just let it slide. Unless the two find a way to make nice, this feud doesn't feel like it will bode well for Musk, or Tesla, or EVs in America, or even Tesla's role in the autonomy race. When we'll see any fallout from the end to this bromance remains to be seen.

For now, Trump is apparently already looking to unload that Tesla he bought from Musk.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/ojGKx2/s1/musk-trump.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 09:02:05.653806

Several studies from this year indicate the average electric bill for families could rise as much as $400 under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA), according to The Independent. The Clean Energy Buyer’s Association (CEBA) raised the red flags in a recently commissioned report on May 15 on the repeal of federal energy tax credits.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reports that under the bill, $249 billion in energy investment, production and manufacturing credits would be phased out. Additionally, the bill would strip funding for various environmental projects.

Cutting federal investment and production tax credits could raise electricity and natural gas prices and lead to an economic slowdown, according to the CEBA. The report claims that cutting the credits could lower household incomes in 19 states between 2026 and 2032.

“If these tax credits disappear, American households and businesses in both red and blue states would experience economic harm,” CEBA CEO Rich Powell wrote in the report from May 15. “This is not a partisan issue. Americans voted to combat the cost-of-living crisis in the 2024 election. Now is the time for Congress to incentivize private investment in more sources of low-cost, reliable energy that fuels economic growth and jobs, helps the United States secure energy dominance and independence, and decreases energy costs nationwide.”

Kansas could lose 5,250 jobs and see energy prices increase 14.3% for households and 16.7% for businesses, according to CEBA. CEBA also reported that Kansas could see an average loss of $420 in household incomes and a $600 million decrease in state GDP.

27 News reached out to Evergy to see what federal tax credits they receive, have applied for, and whether they’ll lose them under the OBBBA. The company didn’t answer questions regarding tax credits but said it’s working with the Edison Electric Institute to see how changes in legislation would impact the industry.

“The bill is not final and predicting what effect it may have on prices is unknowable given the changing nature of generation sources and increased usage,” Evergy spokesperson Gina Penzig wrote.

Evergy has submitted a request with the Kansas Corporation Commission for $196.4 million, or an 8.62% rate increase, to cover the cost of increased operating expenses. If the proposal is approved as-is, the new electric rates would take hold in September 2025. Residential customers could see an average monthly increase of $13.05. Evergy will be holding public hearings on the rate hike proposals later this month.

Those aren’t the only things that could hurt wallets.

On Tuesday, April 1, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) terminated the employment of everyone working on the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), according to a now-former employee. Kansas’s Low-income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) helped distribute funds from LIHEAP to lower-income families under the Department of Children and Families. Those programs won’t be continued under the OBBBA, according to the Independent.

“To date, the Kansas Department for Children and Families (DCF) has not received information from federal partners about any potential impacts to Kansas’ Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP),” DCF Deputy Director of Media Relations Erin La Row told 27 News in April. “The current LIEAP application period ended on March 31, 2025.

In three hours Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.

Shares of Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14% in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world’s richest man. By the end of the trading day, $150 billion of Tesla’s value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded U.S. companies.

In after-hours trading, Tesla shares rose 0.8%.

The disagreement started over the president’s budget bill, then quickly turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn’t haven’t gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.

“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”

The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless “robotaxi” service in Austin, Texas, this month.

Investors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the U.S., and that could slam Tesla. So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized— and fast.

“The whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla’s biggest fans, but now worried. “If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.”

He added, “There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.”

Trump’s threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk’s businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.

A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk’s once-close relationship with the president.

On a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.

One measure of SpaceX’s success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.

Now all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk’s close relationship with Trump, initially at least.

After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk’s plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.

After hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk’s time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla’s reputation. They’ve recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.

U.S. House Republicans are pursuing similar aims but with a different approach. Last month they proposed repealing planned hikes in fuel economy requirements as well as vehicle emissions rules adopted under the Biden administration.

The House bill would also kill a $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles, impose a new $250 annual fee on EVs for road repair costs and would phase out EV battery production tax credits in 2028.

Should energy be a partisan issue?

“No, energy policy is strictly nonpartisan. It's all about cost and benefits,” University of Houston energy economist said.

But Rice University energy economist said energy tends to get politicized, even though it doesn’t need to be that way.

“In the end, however, individuals want affordability, reliability, and environmental sensibility ... to all matter,” said Medlock, calling those factors “three legs of a stool.”

Politicians will pick a leg of the stool to focus on based on their constituency, Medlock said.

But energy policy should recognize the trade-offs that exist with various energy sources.

And he said wind, solar, oil, natural gas and coal all have a role to play in giving the country a balanced and diverse portfolio.

“Policy must find a way to successfully manage that balancing act,” he said via email.

, the Political Management program director at George Washington University, said support for renewable energy has long been tied to concerns about global warming and climate change.

“If you believe the science, then it becomes imperative to take ... action,” Belt said via email. “It’s hard to admit that the world is facing disasters and not to support a remedy. Conservatives’ faith in science has been decreasing, especially since COVID.”

Belt said Biden’s legislation promoting renewable energy made the topic more salient for Republicans.

“One way to stimulate the base of one party is through disdain for what the other party promotes,” Belt said.

Medlock said geography also matters, not just political affiliation.

“When jobs are connected to activities and infrastructure, that tends to have a larger impact than political affiliation,” he said. “There is evidence that blue districts in energy rich locations also tend to have a more favorable view of oil and gas.”

Hirs said energy decisions are driven by consumers and by regulators, and one size doesn't fit all.

The electric grid that powers people's homes and businesses isn’t a national enterprise, he said.

The grid varies from state to state.

That grid can be powered by natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind and solar.

Natural gas is the leading source now.

But Hirs said he expects solar to eventually win out, because it’s the low-cost option.

Political forces aside, he said the economics always matter most.

“There's a 1.3-gigawatt solar plant going in north of Dallas on 18,000 acres,” Hirs said. “It's going to have 12 full-time employees, and I think half of those are shepherds. For the same size nuclear power station, 1.3 gigawatts, we're talking about 500 employees. And, of course, there's a cost of fuel. The coal power plants, the natural gas power plants, obviously are somewhere in between. Plus, they have a cost of fuel. Economists will tell you that the low marginal cost supply will eventually dominate. That would mean a solar farm. But without adequate batteries and supporting backup, we’re not going to get there for five to 10 years. It's going to require a significant build-out. And this is not a partisan issue. It relates really to the way we've constructed electricity markets across the United States.”

Meanwhile, Hirs said both gas-powered cars and electric cars can make sense for different people based on the costs to operate.

Electric cars cost more to buy, so a customer might have to drive for five to seven years before they start saving money on a battery-powered vehicle.

Hirs said Americans will need more power in the coming years, and they’ll want the cheapest options they can get.

“We need more for this grid,” he said. “Our demand is going up, and it's not because of EVs. It's because we have electrification of darn near everything in the house, everything in manufacturing facilities.”",https://mynbc15.com/resources/media2/16x9/8667/986/0x447/90/7d965791-04cb-4cd9-9ae7-10ad994bd245-GettyImages2209279303.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 06:03:52.936365

Portland Plan Commission made no recommendation Thursday regarding a proposed one-year moratorium on carbon sequestration facilities. It also recommended a one-year moratorium on data centers. Portland City Council will make the final decision on both matters.

Ethanol plant POET Bioprocessing has been looking into a carbon sequestration facility for the last two years. POET Bioprocessing representatives and related personnel pleaded with plan commission during a public hearing Thursday not to move forward with recommending a one-year moratorium on carbon sequestration facilities in Portland.

Carbon sequestration involves “capturing” carbon dioxide — a byproduct of ethanol production — transporting it, typically via a piping system, and injecting and storing it deep underground.

POET Bioprocessing’s Class 6 well project, a $50-million investment, would involve drilling nearly 4,000 feet below the surface. The well would include four layers of steel pipes and three layers of cement to isolate the carbon dioxide from other layers of rock and drinking water.

Mark Henning, a petroleum geologist with DTE Vantage, explained there are 1,877 oil and gas wells in Jay County according to Indiana Department of Natural Resource’s database, with two Class 2 disposal wells for injecting produced brine.

Most of the oil in Jay County has already been produced, he added.

“The opportunity for landowners to make money off the subsurface of their ground has kind of come and gone (until now),” said Henning.

Over time, the carbon dioxide injected under POET Bioprocessing’s facility would expand beyond its property lines, reaching underneath neighboring private properties.

“Those landowners have to be compensated that, so here we are, we’ve got a unique opportunity for landowners covering a couple thousand acres to once again make some money off of rocks that they own deep inside the surface of the earth,” he explained.

Henning talked about research that has been done by his company to ensure POET’s land is suitable for the project. DTE Vantage obtained 2D seismic data — he explained it’s like an ultrasound of the earth — in Jay County. The data, he said, showed Jay County’s geology would allow for safely conducting carbon sequestration.

“That seismic data allowed geologists like myself to see inside the earth and see that there are no faults or no disruptions inside the rock layers that would cause any sort of a worry or concern about some sort of leakage,” he said.

Adam Homan, general manager of POET Bioprocessing, explained the company previously had been releasing carbon dioxide from the ethanol process into the atmosphere. Three years ago, it started a new process, allowing approximately 25% of the carbon dioxide to be captured and sold into the liquid, food and beverage market.

He noted 40% of Indiana’s corn goes to biofuels and said the industry needs new markets for corn and new markets for ethanol. Carbon sequestration would put POET Bioprocessing in a position to offer products to other markets, such as aviation and marine fuel. Referencing other ethanol facilities in Indiana, he said if POET Bioprocessing didn’t move forward with a carbon sequestration project, it could have a negative impact on its future.

POET Bioprocessing started working in Jay County nearly 18 years ago. It purchases roughly 30 million bushels of local corn each year, Homan added, paying roughly $120 million into the local agricultural community.

He pointed out he and others at the plant are Jay County residents, and he vouched for the project’s safety.

“We wouldn’t do anything that we feel is putting the community in danger,” he said.

Tim Phelps of Indiana Ethanol Producers Association said ethanol facilities are “economic development engines,” offering more than 35,000 jobs and supporting more than 19,000 farms in Indiana.

Carbon dioxide capture, he said, is the next step in the American bioprocessing economy.

“Indiana has the unique geology that no one else in the corn belt has,” he said.

Homan noted the vetting process for the project that they’re currently undergoing through United States Environmental Protection Agency and Indiana Department of Natural Resources. He pointed out the process takes years, and he shared a willingness to work with local officials as needed. Homan, Phelps and Henning urged plan commission not to recommend a moratorium.

Jay County and Portland Building and Planning director John Hemmelgarn and assistant director Pati McLaughlin both said a moratorium wouldn’t ban the project entirely but would give officials time to draft an ordinance regulating such operations.

Plan commission member Ron Laux noted the company has offered to work alongside the city, with Hemmelgarn questioning whether it’s fair to allow POET Bioprocessing to do so when other companies wouldn’t get the same chance before an ordinance is created.

Plan commission member Randy Geesaman — he previously served two terms as Portland mayor — talked about how local residents have harped on missed opportunities in the past.

“Jay County and Portland’s been their own worst enemy as far as hindering economic development growth,” he recalled. “I’ve heard that.”

Plan commission member Kent McClung noted this would be the first carbon sequestration project in Portland and Jay County. He defined it as an adjacent industry to ethanol production and suggested plan commission do more research on the topic. He also noted the discussion came to Portland recently, saying Thursday was the first time POET Bioprocessing had talked to plan commission about the project.

“It’s not a no, but also I understand we need time just to look at it,” he said.

Geesaman said he believed the commission had enough information to make a decision.

Plan commission then took a vote to declare it would not be in favor of recommending a one-year moratorium on carbon sequestration facilities, with the vote failing to pass at 2-3. After no other motions were made, county attorney Wes Schemenaur noted that meant plan commission would offer no recommendation to city council.

Also Thursday, plan commission recommended a one-year moratorium on data centers.

Hemmelgarn noted data storage centers store various information from CPU units, ranging from medical records to permits to artificial intelligence. Such facilities can span multiple stories and buildings, he explained.

Hemmelgarn talked about establishing an ordinance that would lay out guidelines for data centers while a moratorium is in place, with plan commission members agreeing to “get ahead” of the matter.",,N,,2025-06-07 02:00:59.603903

MISO has recently developed a capacity market design that should facilitate long-term decisions that achieve resource adequacy, according to Patton.
And so projections and blood red [reliability] maps that we get from NERC … that [are] not accurate, are their tools.”","The North American Electric Reliability Corp. is overstating the reliability risks faced by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, according to David Patton, president of Potomac Economics, the grid operator’s market monitor.

In its 2024 Long-Term Reliability Assessment released in December, NERC said MISO was at a high risk of having a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season in the next five years — the worst ranking of all North American regions.

“I'd love to work with NERC to figure out where they got their numbers from, because I don't think they're accurate,” Patton said Thursday during a technical conference on resource adequacy challenges in the United States held by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

NERC understates MISO’s capacity for demand response, behind-the-meter generation and firm capacity imports by more than 8 GW, Patton said in written testimony to FERC. Also, NERC considered possible power plant retirements that have not occurred, according to Patton.

Potomac Economics also acts as the market monitor for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ISO New England and the New York Independent System Operator. “MISO is the most reliable of any of them,” Patton said. “If I was concerned about the lights going out somewhere, it would not be MISO.”

In recent winter storms, MISO exported power to neighboring grid operators to help meet their needs, Patton said, noting the exports reflected the value interconnections between grid operators can have.

Further, MISO has been vastly overestimating the power supplies it will need in coming years to meet demand for electricity, Patton said. In its 2024 Regional Resource Assessment, MISO said its footprint may need 17 GW of new resources every year for the next 20 years.

“That's a result of a clearly flawed planning process,” Patton told FERC. In its modeling, MISO assumed utilities would build almost exclusively intermittent renewable resources, even though their reliability value under MISO’s future marginal accreditation approach will fall to close to zero, according to Patton’s testimony.

If utilities and others in MISO build hybrid renewables, storage and dispatchable resources, the annual need for new resources falls to about 2 GW to 3 GW, Patton said. Some near-term needs will likely be met by delayed power plant retirements, he said.

In the last 10 years, MISO has lost about 9.5 GW of accredited capacity, according to a chart shown by FERC Chairman Mark Christie at the conference.

Even so, MISO has adequate power supplies for now — and the pace of the decline in capacity has slowed in recent years, according to Todd Ramey, MISO senior vice president of markets and digital strategy.

“The concern looking forward still is that there's work to do, even for next year, to still get as much added as we can, to try and keep up with load growth that we think is coming at us,” Ramey said.

However, Steven Lieberman, American Municipal Power vice president of transmission and regulatory affairs, contends that current trends in the region are unsustainable. “MISO’s [interconnection] queue is backlogged, retirements are outpacing additions and load is growing,” he said.

Grid operators should procure resources with specific attributes, such as quick start ability, fuel security and ramping capability, according to Lieberman.

MISO has recently developed a capacity market design that should facilitate long-term decisions that achieve resource adequacy, according to Patton. The market's design elements include a prompt, seasonal framework; reliability-based demand curves; and a marginal reliability-based resource accreditation that takes effect in 2028, Patton said in his testimony.

“We think we've arrived at what is getting close to probably the best available market design,” Ramey said.

Data centers and load growth forecasts

In a question to a panel of mainly state utility regulators, FERC Commissioner Lindsay See asked whether it would be helpful to have some level of uniformity in load forecasting data assumptions.

Load forecasting “is such a complicated hot mess,” partly driven by uncertainty around data centers, said James Huston, Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission chairman.

“Load forecasting is a part of the process to try and look out over the 20 year horizon, but that horizon past three years is almost virtually unpredictable if a hyperscaler is involved in it,” Huston said.

Almost all data centers are developed with nondisclosure agreements, so getting information on what is happening is difficult, according to Doug Scott, Illinois Commerce Commission chairman. Hyperscalers consider multiple sites for a single project, and utilities have different approaches for determining what potential data center load is “real,” he noted.

“We really don't know what the actual load growth is going to be,” Scott said, while calling for uniformity in load assessments, including potentially allowing MISO and other grid operators to “get behind the NDA.”

Marcus Hawkins, a Public Service Commission of Wisconsin commissioner, cautioned against having a single approach to load forecasting. “I've been hearing about near-term resource adequacy crises in MISO since 2015,” Hawkins said. “The RTOS and NERC don't have the lever on resource adequacy. We do at this table. And so projections and blood red [reliability] maps that we get from NERC … that [are] not accurate, are their tools.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/kfIYVfvyMoyIbbPwnWwo-8Tr-yAYuwHy5Aso-ybdkvs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8xX3diT25oNDYuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-07 00:03:15.038429

In a significant development for South Carolina’s electric vehicle (EV) industry, Japanese battery manufacturer AESC has announced a pause in the expansion of its Florence-based EV battery plant. The decision stems from prevailing market uncertainties, including potential changes to federal EV tax credits and tariff policies. Originally, AESC planned a $1.5 billion investment to construct a second facility adjacent to its initial plant, aiming to create over 1,000 additional jobs. However, the company has now halted these expansion plans, citing the need for a more stable policy environment.

State Withdraws $111 Million in Bonds Following Project Delay

In response to AESC’s decision, the South Carolina Fiscal Accountability Authority has rescinded $111 million in bonds that were allocated to support the expansion. These funds were intended for infrastructure improvements, site preparation, and the development of a training center. Governor Henry McMaster described the withdrawal as a responsible move, emphasizing the importance of prudent financial management in light of the project’s indefinite timeline.

“This legislation just helps all of Texas,” said State Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills.
The Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance (TAEB) estimates in total the state spends more than $3 billion on these programs.
“We still have a winter problem in Texas,” Boms said.
“We need our state agencies to be coordinating their efforts and not be working in silos.”","AUSTIN (KXAN) — With Texas headed into another summer of record-breaking heat forecasts, state lawmakers took steps to better coordinate billions of dollars in energy conservation programs amid warnings that power demand could outstrip supply as early as 2026.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) recently forecast that the state’s growing demand for power could surpass available energy supply beginning in summer 2026, with demand nearly doubling by 2030 due to population growth, extreme weather and large industrial users including cryptocurrency mines and data centers.

In response, the Legislature passed House Bill 5323, creating the Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee to coordinate state programs that reduce energy waste and improve electric grid reliability.

“This legislation just helps all of Texas,” said State Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills. “The legislation focuses on energy efficiency. It talks about reduction in electricity utilization across the state. After all, we are the largest employer in the state of Texas.”

The new committee will bring together eight state agencies including the Public Utility Commission, ERCOT and the State Comptroller’s office, to coordinate the existing funding for demand reduction programs across different agencies. The Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance (TAEB) estimates in total the state spends more than $3 billion on these programs.

“We have millions of dollars across different state agencies, in state funding and in federal funding that are being directed towards demand reduction,” said Matthew Boms, executive director of the TAEB. “All these different programs are happening at different state agencies, but there’s no one really steering the ship.”

Currently, those programs could reduce peak demand by up to 4.5 gigawatts if properly coordinated, according to Boms. While that represents a small fraction of Texas’ 86-gigawatt peak demand, Boms said that “4.5 gigawatts could be the difference between a grid emergency and normal conditions” during extreme weather events.

The coordination gap became apparent during Winter Storm Uri in 2021, when inadequate weatherization and resistance heating in multi family homes contributed to grid failures.

“We still have a winter problem in Texas,” Boms said. “All the resistance heating that we have, especially in multi family homes, are consuming a ton of energy during these winter storm events.”

ERCOT’s most dire forecast predicts energy supply could fall 6.2% short of peak summer demand in 2026, widening to a 32.4% shortage by summer 2029. The grid operator attributed much of the projected demand growth to cryptocurrency mining operations, data centers and artificial intelligence infrastructure.

Hancock acknowledged the challenge of balancing economic growth with grid reliability as Texas continues attracting energy-intensive businesses.

“Energy needs are going to grow across the state with the growth of AI and all that comes with it,” Hancock said. “What we’re trying to do here is lead as an example, both on maximizing energy efficiency, [and] reduction in electricity utilization.”

The advisory committee will meet quarterly and submit biennial reports to the Legislature starting December 2026. Members can designate employees to serve in their place, with administrative support provided by the Public Utility Commission.

Current state conservation programs save about four megawatts of power, which Hancock called important during tight grid conditions when “everybody pitches in and does their part.”

The bill takes effect Sept. 1, 2025, as Texas prepares for another summer of potentially record-breaking energy demand.

“If we want to prevent a future catastrophe from happening, this is exactly the kind of work that needs to happen,” Boms said. “We need our state agencies to be coordinating their efforts and not be working in silos.”",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2023/11/AP21051748100718-e1699458612650.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-06-07 06:03:58.066147

Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.
A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.
A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032.

Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.

Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production.

Kristina Costa, who formerly worked at the White House implementing the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and climate policies, said the IRA established at least 10 years of tax credits to support clean energy industries, which launched new projects and expanded the industry.

“The House bill that the Republicans passed explodes that entire paradigm,” Costa said. “It functions as a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Costa, during a Thursday press conference with Climate Power, said the bill “really radically” changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to “lock in” a tax treatment at the start of construction.

“This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,” Costa said. “It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.”

How the bill impacts clean energy projects

Clean energy tax credits impact transportation, power generation, industry and construction and create incentives for projects like renewable vehicle fuels, solar, wind, nuclear power generation and more.

Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors.

Some of the restrictions include strict construction timeline requirements, like beginning construction within 60 days of enactment, and bringing the projects online by 2028.

Costa said these timelines create an “incredibly sharp cliff” for developers to work within for projects that often take years and can face lengthy setbacks from supply chain disruptions.

The budget bill also has extensive language pertaining to and restricting projects that have any ties to foreign entities.

Costa said these restrictions are “very complicated, unworkable, Byzantine requirements” that impose “a lot of red tape” for developers and would have the “immediate effect of freezing the market.”

She said it would require companies to understand where “literally every nut, bolt, screw and wire in a project they are building comes from” and certify that it does not have any ties to China or to Russia.

Costa said gutting these policies will lead to increased energy costs for American customers. A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.

Part of the problem is an anticipated 2% energy demand increase nationwide, in 2025 and again in 2026, according to the EIA. Much of that energy demand is a result of battery manufacturing and data centers.

Iowa alone has roughly 100 data centers, which is one of the largest concentrations in the midwest.

“The near term additions to the grid are going to come from renewables, or they’re supposed to come from renewables under the current tax regime,” Costa said. “That is why you would see these consumer electricity price increases.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s utility companies with significant investments in solar and wind energy, said the company is monitoring the bill.

A spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy declined to comment on the pending legislation.

Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A representative from the company did not answer questions about the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project.

A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032.

Repeal of the credits would also affect associated manufacturing companies, like those that make solar panel parts, or wind turbine blades.

Analysis from Climate Power found 400,000 jobs nationwide would be in jeopardy without the tax credits supporting the expanding industry.

Joe Zimsen, an Iowa resident with 10 years of construction experience in the wind industry, said the IRA created a “tremendous amount of hope” among his colleagues in the industry that has now “disintegrated” because of budget bill.

Zimsen formerly worked on wind projects near Grinnell, but now works for Renew Energy as a construction manager for off-shore wind projects. He and his family still live in Iowa, and he urged Iowa senators to oppose the bill as it is currently written.

“This policy of killing offshore and onshore wind and solar energy is going to have tremendous detrimental effects and set us back another 10 to 15 years behind our competitors, like China and Europe,” Zimsen said. “We can’t afford to do that.”

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday that wind energy incentives have been at risk since 2015 when he worked to extend them, and he said he senators would try to find a “compromise” on them again, Radio Iowa reported.

But, the so-called, “big beautiful bill” comprises much more than just clean energy concerns, which Grassley said means one issue can’t “stand in the way” of the rest of the bill.

U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

In fact, both Alaskans and the principles of sustainability were notably absent from the conference’s central themes and many of its attendees. From the outset, the federal government’s priority appeared to be reassuring foreign interests of the United States’ continued ability to sell off Alaska piece by piece.

Conference organizers, led by Gov. Mike Dunleavy appeared eager as regulatory protections continue to be rolled back by the Trump administration. Federal officials, including U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, expressed strong support for the further weakening of environmental safeguards to unilaterally advance long-contested development projects across Alaska.

Many attendees represented corporate interests excited to profit from new extraction opportunities or potential buyers, watching to see if the administration follows through on promises to mine Alaska’s oil, gas, and critical minerals. These companies appeared enthusiastic to exploit the land with minimal oversight and a lack of local consent. The audience was left with a misleading impression of Alaskan support.

At the center of ongoing and proposed projects, such as Red Dog mine, Graphite One, and Ambler Road, was the largest item for sale: a natural gas reservoir on the North Slope.

The proposed Alaska liquid natural gas pipeline, currently led by the Alaska Gasoline Development Corp. and New York-based Glenfarne Group LLC, would extract natural gas from subsurface carbon and transport it 800 miles south to Nikiski for export. The estimated almost $40 billion project promises only temporary jobs and infrastructure.

Environmentally, natural gas poses risks similar to coal and oil. It is composed primarily of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Inevitable gas leaks during extraction and transportation can release up to 10% of methane before combustion, with the remainder ultimately emitted as carbon dioxide. These outcomes reflect outdated, combustion-based energy models.

Regarding Alaska’s wildlife and people, cabinet members seemed to dismiss concerns after brief visits, suggesting the animals are happy and that communities would benefit from further resource development despite evidence to the contrary.

The “resource curse” is a paradox that explains the economic dynamics of regions rich in natural resources, but limited in democratic representation. Extraction projects often introduce new workers, housing, and other infrastructure at great cost to local communities. Despite generating profits for corporate sponsors, these projects typically result in a net loss for the public. Workers are imported from out of state, while profits are exported. Local towns are then responsible for maintaining infrastructure without receiving corresponding benefits like revenue to support housing, health care or affordable energy. As finite resources are exhausted, companies maintain profit margins while community returns diminish. Once operations end, communities are often left with environmental damage and abandoned development, economically and socially worse off than before.

Alaska’s economy remains heavily reliant on oil and gas. As existing operations decrease in yield, public education and health care routinely face budgetary cuts. The natural gas reserve would only provide exports for a few decades, but its development would cause irreparable environmental damage, and leave Alaska facing another energy crisis within a generation. Why Gov. Dunleavy labeled this conference “sustainable” remains unclear.

It is unrealistic to claim the pipeline would benefit any of the roughly 190 communities beyond the Railbelt. While the state invests in LNG exports, rural towns reliant on diesel will face rising costs and health issues, including cancer risks.

Regardless of one’s stance on oil and gas, Chris Wright, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, himself stated: “Energy… it’s about people and math.” However, his equation solves for profit, while Alaska’s equation for energy must begin and end with the voices and needs of the people.

Scientists attending the summit this week in an official capacity were restricted to framing oil and gas as the primary development priority. This narrowed the conversation and sidelined discussions around advances in technology such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy. Still, a handful of sustainability advocates attended as guests, business owners, protesters, and speakers. One speaker, Lesil McGuire, senior advisor with New Energy Alaska, an advocacy coalition that promotes renewable energy noted, “Solar arrays can be propped up in a number of weeks.” As of 2020 solar energy has become cheaper to install and maintain than fossil fuels.

Alaska needs energy infrastructure tailored to its unique environment, focused on long-term self reliance through renewable sources. Current examples include solar installations in the Northwest Arctic Borough, microgrid cooperatives, and heat pump incentives in Southeast Alaska. A cursory glance shows Alaska’s capacity for renewable energy that could be faster to build and more cost effective than the LNG pipeline.

In reality the conference didn’t need to be held in Alaska, as Alaskans themselves played a minimal role. Led by Gov. Dunleavy, the “Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference 2025” resembled government-backed promotion of the oil and gas industry and signaled extraction projects could move forward without oversight and regardless of local stakeholder’s needs or opposition. International representatives seemed to be promised fuel for import, and out-of-state corporations appeared to be invited to profit at the expense of Alaska’s environment.

Renewable energy has been viable for decades and continues to become more efficient. Given a voice and a seat at the table, many Alaskans and Americans would likely favor local, self-sufficient renewables for lower prices and long-term reliability. Natural gas in Alaska will run out in this lifetime, do nothing to reduce costs in the majority of Alaskan communities, and may cause permanent harm to the environment. The United States and Alaska are not in need of a technological revolution in fossil fuels, but an information revolution in renewable energy. It is vitally important that all Alaskan voices are heard. Alaska values pristine wilderness, supports true sustainability, and is not for sale.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/natdiglib_30980_full-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 01:04:42.207461

In three hours Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.

Shares of Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14% in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world's richest man. By the end of the trading day, $150 billion of Tesla's value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded U.S. companies.

In after-hours trading, Tesla shares rose 0.8%.

The disagreement started over the president's budget bill, then quickly turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn't haven't gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,"" Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. ""I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!""

The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless ""robotaxi"" service in Austin, Texas, this month.

Investors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the U.S., and that could slam Tesla. So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized- and fast.

""The whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla's biggest fans, but now worried. ""If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.""

He added, ""There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.""

Trump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.

A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.

On a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.

One measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.

Now all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk's close relationship with Trump, initially at least.

After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk's plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.

After hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk's time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla's reputation. They've recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.

Now investors aren't so sure, a worry that has translated into big paper losses in Tesla stock held by Musk personally - down $20 billion for the day.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/16676996_trump-elon-tesla-clean-AP-TN-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-06-07 05:06:12.301922

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Yesterday, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality posted Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC’s Clean Water Act Section 401 application for its proposed methane gas pipeline “Southgate.” The developers recently altered their plans for Southgate, changing the route and increasing the capacity and pipe diameter. Southgate would extend the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline, and has faced significant opposition since the original project was first proposed in 2018.

During its original permit review in 2020, DEQ determined MVP Southgate was an unneeded risk, and denied the developer’s application for a Clean Water Act permit. The Southgate pipeline would extend from Pittsylvania County, Virginia, into Rockingham County, North Carolina. It is currently subject to an amendment review process by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the recently requested changes to the project. The FERC recently opened a “Notice of Scoping,” soliciting new feedback from the public on the pipeline’s impacts.

Especially concerning for North Carolina communities is Southgate’s project route, which is very similar to the proposed Southeast Supply Enhancement Project from Williams Companies’ expansion of their network of Transco pipelines. The co-location of two additional high-pressure, large diameter pipelines, next to already aging pipes, adds to safety risks for both proposed pipelines.

The application process for Southgate from DEQ will include a public comment period and closes on July 5, 2025.

“MVP Southgate is and has been a bad idea. Residents have stood united in opposition to Southgate, fighting against its potential damage to our environment, our health and our communities,” said Caroline Hansley, Campaign Organizing Strategist at Sierra Club. “We cannot sacrifice our neighbors for the sake of lining the pockets of corporate executives.”

“MVP Southgate is a dangerous project that would threaten the safety, waterways and land usage opportunities of communities nearby,” said Juhi Modi, North Carolina Field Coordinator at Appalachian Voices. “Southgate would fuel Duke Energy’s massive proposed expansion of methane gas power plants across our state, causing higher electric bills and putting us on the highway to climate destruction. We know that there are safer, more affordable renewable energy options that can serve North Carolinians.”

“For years MVP Southgate — a proposed extension of MVP mainline—has never moved forward and has been denied multiple permits,” said Dr. Crystal Cavalier Keck, Co-Founder and CEO at 7 Directions of Service. “Community members along the MVP mainline route repeatedly tell us how their lives, their land and their waterways continue to suffer as a result of these pipeline developers, their violations and the lack of accountability. Our regulators must do everything in their power to protect North Carolinians from a similar fate.”

The company previously paused “Facility 2,” an expansion of the site at the Florence Global Technology Park that would have been a $1.5 billion investment and would have created an additional 1,080 local jobs. AESC had not begun hiring when that phase of the project was put on hold, according to previous reports.

A spokesperson with AESC told The Post and Courier in February that Facility 1 was still on schedule to begin production next year.

A spokesperson couldn't be reached for further comment June 5.

Full statement from Brad Grantham, AESC spokesperson:

“AESC has informed the state of South Carolina and our local partners that due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time. AESC has invested over $1 billion into the Florence facility, and we anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize. AESC fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/ed/aed4bd4b-8f15-4d35-8322-f6b1793abd04/66ff2ca021f4e.image.jpg?crop=1981%2C1040%2C0%2C2&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-06-08 09:10:46.014409

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

""We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,"" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.

""It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

""The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

Bipartisan pushback Perhaps no two South Carolina political figures are better known for their opposition to offshore drilling than Mount Pleasant Republican Sen. Chip Campsen and former.
“Offshore drilling brings Republicans and Democrats in South Carolina together like no other issue,” Cunningham said.","Palmetto State political and environmental leaders say it’s too soon to know how serious the renewed threat of offshore oil drilling is for the South Carolina coast.

The Trump administration has officially put the issue under review at the federal level, according to federal officials. But in 2020, Trump signed an executive order that banned drilling off the South Atlantic seaboard through 2032. Now just five years later, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has started a long review process that could change that order — and replace the state’s famous slogan, “Smiling faces, beautiful places,” with “Drill, baby, drill.”

With a $30 billion tourist industry and some of the nation’s most pristine beaches and ocean ecosystems at stake, state leaders aren’t taking a wait-and-see approach to the issue. Instead, they’re speaking out now — and they’re making their position as clear as the waterways they’re trying to protect.

“Governor McMaster has long opposed drilling off South Carolina’s coast,” said Brandon Charochak, a spokesman for Gov. Henry McMaster. “And he continues to do so today.”

Lowcountry Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, whose First District stretches from Charleston to Beaufort, was equally definitive on social media.

“We’ve always opposed offshore drilling off South Carolina’s coast,” she said in a June 2 post on X. “President Trump banned it … to protect our tourism, our fisheries, and our way of life. We stand with the people of South Carolina who oppose it too.”

So why is offshore drilling back on the table, given the 2020 ban and ongoing state opposition?

First, a more recent Trump order that was signed on his first day in office in January, directed federal officials to “unleash American energy,” which led to the current BOEM review. And second, the move to expand offshore drilling enjoys strong support from powerful industry players.

“We applaud … the administration for taking action to unleash America’s vast offshore oil and natural gas resources and restore a pro-American energy approach to federal [offshore oil] leasing,” said the American Petroleum Institute (API), which represents oil and natural gas companies, in an April 18 statement lauding the BOEM review.

The API did not reply to a request for comment for this story.

Bipartisan pushback

Perhaps no two South Carolina political figures are better known for their opposition to offshore drilling than Mount Pleasant Republican Sen. Chip Campsen and former. Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham of Charleston.

For Campsen, an avid outdoorsman who helped lead the charge to secure the 2020 ban, the issue boils down to a tale of two coasts.

In South Carolina, he said, our clean beaches and waterways support sun-and-fun recreation, high-end real estate and a multibillion dollar tourist industry. But in Louisiana, which has a dirtier and more industrial coastline on the Gulf of Mexico, the massive refinery infrastructure and perpetually fuel-slicked waterways primarily serves one big business — the oil industry.

“Seventy years ago, we made our choice and they made theirs,” Campsen told Statehouse Report on June 4. “They hung their hat on oil. We hung our hat on a pristine coast. And we have a much more profitable coastal economy as a result.”

Any effort to reverse that choice now would make “absolutely no sense” environmentally or economically, Campsen added.

“With drilling, you’d see the massive industrialization of our coast,” he said. “We don’t want South Carolina to turn into that.”

Across the political aisle, Cunningham, who won an uphill congressional race in 2018 due largely to his opponent’s rare support for offshore drilling, said the reemergence of the issue shows the dangers of a political moment when all politics is national.

“Offshore drilling brings Republicans and Democrats in South Carolina together like no other issue,” Cunningham said. “To see it rearing its ugly head again is really frustrating, but it shows how vigilant you have to stay on these kinds of issues.”

Still, he sounded optimistic about the issue, particularly given Trump’s closeness to the state and many of its leading GOP officials.

“Sitting here objectively, South Carolina helped propel Trump into office in 2016,” Cunningham said. “I hope that he would understand that this is a core issue to the people of our state, and that he’d return their support by taking it off the table.”

Taking action

The first step in BOEM’s review process is a public comment period, which is currently underway.

And according to political and environmental leaders, it’s a critical opportunity for South Carolinians to make their voices heard before any decisions are made.

“We encourage everyone to reach out and comment,” said Taylor Allred, the Coastal Conservation League’s energy and climate program director. “You don’t have to have a lot of expertise or a lengthy comment for it to be impactful.”

But like Cunningham, Allred stressed the importance of staying vigilant.

“Just because it’s deeply unpopular in our state doesn’t mean that it’s not a real risk,” Allred said. “We need to do everything we can to push back against this possible destruction of our coastal way of life.”

She said Brazil’s current environmental licensing model needs to be reviewed, as it has failed to keep up with the demands of a changing world.","RIO DE JANEIRO (CN) — A bill that has been under discussion in Brazil’s Congress for 21 years and aims to establish general rules for environmental licensing has become the focus of heated debate following its approval by the Senate late last month.

The proposal is now moving through the lower house of Congress, with no date set for a vote. If approved, it will move to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to sign into law or veto.

On Thursday, World Environment Day, seven former environment ministers released a joint letter describing Bill No. 2159/2021 as a dismantling of Brazil’s environmental protection framework, warning of risks to ecosystems, traditional communities and the country’s international reputation.

While legal scholars and environmental advocates argue the proposal — dubbed the “Devastation Bill” — weakens constitutional safeguards and expands grounds for legal challenges, the congressional agribusiness caucus is pushing for expedited approval, claiming the new framework would bring legal certainty and accelerate investment.

“This bill began as a response to environmentalists' demands for a general environmental licensing law,” said Suely Araújo, former president of Brazil’s environmental agency, IBAMA, and now public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory. “But it gradually turned into something else. The lawmakers who took over were more interested in a law of non-licensing and self-licensing. What we have now is the worst legislative rollback since Brazil began organizing its national environmental policy in 1981.”

Brazil currently lacks a federal law to regulate environmental licensing. Each state and municipality has its own rules, leading to a fragmented system and frequent clashes between local regulations and national guidelines.

At the federal level, licensing is governed by non-statutory regulations, including a 1997 resolution by the National Environmental Council. Cynthia de Souza Cardoso, an attorney specializing in environmental law who has worked in agencies including the National Environmental Council, said the lack of uniform rules creates legal uncertainty, fuels litigation and hampers coordination among different levels of government — especially in large-scale projects or those that affect more than one jurisdiction.

“This is a necessary, complex and highly contestable regulatory initiative,” Cardoso said. “The bill reflects the deep political and social polarization we live in. It incorporates much-needed updates to licensing procedures but also includes provisions that could undermine key regulatory protections.”

One of the most contentious elements is the proposed “License by Adhesion and Commitment,” which would allow automatic licenses to be issued based solely on a developer’s self-declaration, with no requirement for prior studies or technical review. The mechanism could even apply to mid-impact infrastructure projects, raising concerns about reduced oversight and heightened environmental risk.

Alice Dandara, an attorney with the Socioenvironmental Institute, warned that this could apply to up to 80% of licensing cases and potentially allow projects like the Brumadinho dam, which collapsed in 2019, killing 272 people, to operate under self-licensing.

A controversial provision would create a “Special Environmental License” for projects deemed strategic. The executive branch would define what qualifies by decree, a move critics say opens the door to politically motivated exemptions. The license would be subject to a simplified approval process, with fixed deadlines and reduced input from environmental agencies and oversight councils.

The bill also eliminates the obligation to evaluate indirect, cumulative or synergistic impacts. Environmental agencies would no longer need to assess, for example, whether a road might facilitate nearby deforestation or whether multiple projects in the same region could together strain water resources.

It would also allow developers to challenge environmental conditions in court by arguing there is no direct link between the requirement and the project’s impact. Legal experts say this could weaken mitigation measures aimed at long-term or off-site damage.

The bill further limits mandatory consultations with Indigenous peoples and quilombola communities — Afro-Brazilian descendants of enslaved people — to lands that have already been officially recognized. That would exclude areas still undergoing regularization. Dandara noted that 40% of Indigenous lands and 96% of quilombola territories in Brazil remain without formal recognition. Twenty-six other types of traditional communities are not mentioned in the bill.

A separate clause exempts agricultural activities listed in the federal Rural Environmental Registry or the Environmental Regularization Program from licensing. Environmental groups argue this would allow rural properties in sensitive areas to operate without technical assessments for water use, soil contamination or proximity to conservation zones.

The proposal also conflicts with the Atlantic Forest Law, a federal statute that protects one of Brazil’s most threatened biomes. Allowing more flexible rules to override that law’s specific requirements opens the door for deforestation and interventions in areas currently protected by native vegetation laws.

Supporters of the bill argue it modernizes and simplifies Brazil’s licensing process. Senator Tereza Cristina, a leader of the Senate’s agribusiness caucus and the bill’s rapporteur, said it would provide legal certainty for strategic infrastructure projects and unlock long-delayed investments. According to her, the current licensing system is slow, unpredictable and in need of clearer rules to balance development and environmental protection.

In a technical note to Congress, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change warned the bill would dismantle current regulations, ignore the climate crisis and compromise legal certainty by removing oversight mechanisms built over decades. On May 27, Environment Minister Marina Silva advocated for changes to the bill during a Senate infrastructure committee hearing. After being targeted by ruralist senators, she left the session, prompting protests in support of the minister and against the bill in eight state capitals on June 1.

Araújo and Dandara argue that, beyond environmental risks, the bill’s legal fragility is one of its major flaws. “There are at least 20 provisions in the bill that are likely to be challenged in court,” Dandara said.

That includes claims that the bill violates Brazil’s Constitution, which guarantees a balanced environment and requires environmental impact studies for projects with significant effects. Brazil’s Supreme Court has previously ruled that automatic licensing for mid-impact projects is unconstitutional. The exclusion of Indigenous and quilombola communities from the consultation process also appears to contradict international agreements signed by Brazil.

At a Tuesday event hosted by Piauí magazine in Brasília, Supreme Court Justice Flávio Dino said the bill would inevitably be challenged in court. “The 'Devastation Bill' will be contested in the Supreme Court as surely as Botafogo won the Libertadores last year,” he said, referencing the soccer team he supports.

Araújo believes the current draft is beyond repair. “The only way forward is to sit on this ticking time bomb and draft a new proposal with government backing,” she said. According to her, Congressman Nilto Tatto, leader of the environmentalist caucus, is already working on an alternative text.

“The idea is to push the vote past the upcoming congressional recess [which runs from July 17 to 31]. Then, with COP30 approaching, we might buy some time.”

COP30, the United Nations climate summit, is scheduled to take place in Belém, in the Brazilian Amazon, in November 2025.

If the delay strategy fails, activists plan to lobby for a full presidential veto. If Congress overrides the veto, the focus will shift to a direct challenge before the Supreme Court. In a press conference on Tuesday, President Lula said he had not yet reviewed the proposed changes.

Dandara said the chances of the bill passing before the recess remain high. “The government is moving too slowly for the pace of Congress,” she said. According to her, the Socioenvironmental Institute and other organizations such as Greenpeace and the Climate Observatory are already preparing constitutional challenges.

Cardoso said that while the bill poses risks by weakening key regulations, it also reflects an effort to modernize a system that has proven slow and disjointed in practice. She said Brazil’s current environmental licensing model needs to be reviewed, as it has failed to keep up with the demands of a changing world. “Still, that cannot justify overriding constitutionally guaranteed rights, particularly the right to a balanced environment,” she said.

President Trump has championed the idea that a key part of making America great again is bringing back industries that left the country in recent decades. With his tariff-driven trade policy, the White House has promoted “Made in America” as a way to create jobs and boost the economy.

Based on April 2025 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this map highlights the U.S. states leading and lagging in manufacturing employment.

California Leads in Manufacturing

Manufacturing remains geographically diverse across the U.S., with major hubs on both coasts and in the interior.

In terms of absolute numbers, California leads the nation, with 1.22 million manufacturing jobs. Texas follows with 970,600 jobs, while Ohio and Michigan maintain their traditional industrial strength with 687,500 and 597,600 jobs, respectively.

Several Southern states have also built strong manufacturing bases. North Carolina (459,300), Georgia (426,500), and Tennessee (364,300) each rank among the top states, supported by industries such as automotive, aerospace, and food processing.

Wisconsin, ranked in the top 10 for total manufacturing employment, stands out for outperforming its size. Although it’s only the 20th most populous state, its manufacturing base remains strong, thanks in part to food and dairy processing. In per capita terms, it’s number one in the nation with 7,763.8 manufacturing jobs for every 100,000 people.

Florida, another top 10 state, has emerged as a growth story. Between 2019 and 2023, the state’s manufacturing employment grew by nearly 10%, highlighting the sector’s expansion in one of the country’s largest economies.

At the other end of the spectrum, Wyoming (10,600 jobs), Alaska (11,900), and Washington, D.C. (1,200) recorded the lowest levels of manufacturing employment. The latter (D.C.) also has the lowest numbers per capita.

The new 70,339 sq ft (approx. 6,530 m²) facility is located on a 110-acre site adjacent to the company’s existing operations. It marks a strategic investment in the company’s food-grade and non-food-grade additives business in the Americas.

The expansion includes a 32,000 sq ft, 32-foot-high processing hall, a 26,800 sq ft warehouse equipped with an automated guidewire system for forklift operations, a 10,000 sq ft laboratory, 8,000 sq ft of office and welfare space, a 4,500 sq ft utility building, and a 1,300 sq ft area for tanker unloading. The site is equipped with nine dock positions and is certified under the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI).

Strengthening production capacity and local supply

The new facility is designed to increase Münzing’s regional production capabilities across a range of applications. Products manufactured include liquid and powder additives formulated for food use, with options for organic, non-GMO and identity-preserved processing. The expansion complements the company’s existing Clover plant, which produces defoamers for printing inks, coatings and adhesives, as well as wetting agents, waxes and foam control products.

According to the company, the additional capacity will improve production flexibility, regional supply resilience and customer service in North America.

Sustainability and energy efficiency as core principles

Münzing’s new facility was constructed on land previously used as a tree farm – a decision aligned with the company’s climate goals. Münzing has set a target to become carbon neutral by 2050. Sustainability measures at the site include heat recovery systems for process equipment, Sage Glass smart glazing for daylight and temperature control, infrastructure for electric vehicle charging and preparations for a rooftop solar array.

In line with its sustainability strategy, Münzing also continues to develop additive technologies based on biopolymers and water-based systems, including low- and zero-VOC formulations, to reduce environmental impact during application and use.

Global company with local commitment

Headquartered in Abstatt, Germany, Münzing was founded in 1830 and today operates six production sites and five R&D centres worldwide. The company employs over 650 people globally.

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy has targeted the fuel economy rules as part of a wide-ranging effort to roll back Biden-era energy policy.
On Friday, Duffy separately issued a legal opinion that would restrict NHTSA’s ability to include electric vehicles in its real-world estimates of the country’s fuel economy rules.
Under current law, automakers must pay a fine when the average fuel economy of the vehicles they sell exceeds the fuel economy standard set for that year.
In essence, no matter how much an automaker exceeds the fuel economy rules, the GOP reconciliation bill will now multiply their fine by zero.","A new provision in the Senate reconciliation bill would neuter the country’s fuel efficiency standards for automakers, gutting one of the federal government’s longest-running programs to manage gasoline prices and air pollution.

The new provision — which was released on Thursday by the Senate Commerce Committee — would essentially strip the government of its ability to enforce the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, or CAFE standards.

The CAFE rules are the government’s main program to improve the fuel economy of new cars and light-duty trucks sold in the United States. Over the past 20 years, the rules have helped push the fuel efficiency of new vehicles to record highs even as consumers have adopted crossovers and SUVs en masse.

But the Republican reconciliation bill would essentially end the program as a practical concern for automakers. It would set all fines issued under the program to zero, stripping the government of its ability to punish automakers that sell too many polluting vehicles.

“It would essentially eviscerate the standard without actually doing so directly,” Ann Carlson, a UCLA law professor who led the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 2022 to 2023, told me.

“It says that, ‘We have standards here, but we don’t care if you comply or not. If you don’t comply, we’re not going to hold you responsible,’” she said.

Representatives for the Senate Commerce Committee did not respond to an immediate request for comment. A talking points memo released by the committee on Thursday said that the new bill would “[bring] down automobile prices modestly by eliminating CAFE penalties on automakers that design cars to conform to the wishes of D.C. bureaucrats rather than consumers.”

Since 1975, Congress has required the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (pronounced NIT-suh) to set annual fuel efficiency standards for new cars and light trucks sold in the United States. The rules generally require new vehicles sold nationwide to get a little more fuel efficient, on average, every year.

The rules have remained in effect — with varying levels of stringency — for 50 years, although they have generally encouraged automakers to get more efficient since Congress strengthened the law on a bipartisan basis in 2007.

In model-year 2023, the most recent period for which data is available, new cars and light trucks achieved a real-world fuel economy of 27.1 miles per gallon, an all-time high. The vehicle fleet was set to hit another record high in 2024, according to last year’s report.

Opponents of the fuel economy rules argue that the regulations increase the sticker price of new cars and trucks and push automakers to build less profitable vehicles. The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that published Project 2025, has called the rules a “backdoor EV mandate.”

The rules’ supporters say that the standards are necessary because consumers don’t take fuel costs — or the environmental or public health costs of air pollution — into account when buying a vehicle. They say the rules keep gasoline prices low for all Americans by encouraging fuel efficiency across the board.

The strict Biden-era rules were projected to save consumers $23 billion in gasoline costs, according to an agency analysis. The American Lung Association said that the rules would prevent more than 2 million pediatric asthma attacks and save hundreds of infant lives by 2050.

Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy has targeted the fuel economy rules as part of a wide-ranging effort to roll back Biden-era energy policy. On January 28, as his first official act, Duffy ordered NHTSA to retroactively weaken the rules for all cars and light trucks sold after model-year 2022.

On Friday, Duffy separately issued a legal opinion that would restrict NHTSA’s ability to include electric vehicles in its real-world estimates of the country’s fuel economy rules. The opinion sets up the next round of CAFE rules to be considerably weaker than existing law.

But the new Republican reconciliation bill, if adopted, would render those rules moot.

Under current law, automakers must pay a fine when the average fuel economy of the vehicles they sell exceeds the fuel economy standard set for that year. Automakers can avoid paying that penalty by buying “credits” from other car companies that have done better than the rules require.

The fine’s size is set by a formula written into the law. That calculation includes the number of cars sold above the fuel-economy threshold, how much those cars exceeded it, and a $5 multiplier. The GOP tax bill rewrites the law to set the multiplier to zero dollars.

In essence, no matter how much an automaker exceeds the fuel economy rules, the GOP reconciliation bill will now multiply their fine by zero.

The original CAFE law contains a second formula allowing the government to set even higher penalties if doing so would achieve “substantial energy conservation.” The new reconciliation bill sets the multiplier in this formula, too, to zero dollars.

The CAFE law’s penalties can be significant. The automaker Stellantis, which owns Fiat and Chrysler, recently paid more than $426 million in penalties for cars sold from model year 2018 to 2020. Last year, General Motors paid a $38 million fine for light trucks sold in model year 2020.

The CAFE provision in the GOP mega-bill seems designed to skirt past the Byrd rule, a Senate rule that policies in reconciliation bills must affect revenue, spending, or generally have more than a “merely incidental” effect on the federal budget.

But Carlson, the former NHTSA acting administrator, doubted whether the provision should really survive a Byrd bath.

Zeroing out the fines is “not really about revenue,” she said, but about compliance with the law. “This is a way to try to couch repeal of CAFE in revenue terms instead of doing it outright.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDU2MTg0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTc2ODU2NX0.lvjsnBqdvCaYzarTc8WsfKe9J0hFI0JV_P7pPRGvWBY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-06-06 21:05:37.539994

The collaboration aims to align the growth of solar energy with the protection and viability of U.S. agricultural lands.

Meeting the nation’s renewable energy targets by 2050 will require more than 10 million acres of land, with an estimated 80 percent of that development expected to take place on agricultural property. The partnership between Doral and AFT recognizes both the challenges and opportunities presented by this shift. By integrating AFT’s Smart Solar principles into project planning, the two organizations aim to ensure that solar development contributes to long-term farm viability while supporting clean energy goals.

Smart Solar is built around three core objectives: safeguarding land well-suited for agriculture, strengthening farm viability, and accelerating responsible solar energy development. AFT, a national nonprofit focused on protecting farmland and supporting sound farming practices, is a recognized leader in advancing agricultural compatibility in renewable energy deployment.

Through this collaboration, Doral and AFT will explore and promote solar development models that maintain productive agricultural use, benefit farm families, and contribute to a more sustainable energy future.

“Since day one, Doral Renewables’ number one principle was to ensure long-term commitment to supporting farmers and communities nationwide by providing farmer-friendly energy development that maximizes their land-use, diversifies their revenue stream, drives economic development and allowing them to return to heritage farming practices by focusing on food production in their farms,” said Ed Baptista, Vice President of Development and Agrivoltaics. “Partnering with AFT only seemed like a natural step forward as we scale up our dual-use operations across our development pipeline and continue our efforts to support farmers in their quest to make the most out of their farming land and strengthen farm viability while advancing affordable and sustainable energy solutions.”

“American Farmland Trust’s partnership with Doral Renewables is an exciting step forward with an industry leader with a significant presence nationwide,” said Ethan Winter, AFT’s National Smart Solar Director. “America needs renewable energy and productive, resilient farms and ranches. Partnerships such as these are crucial for investing in the future of agrivoltaics and long-term farm viability”",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/17.png,N,,2025-06-07 00:03:37.910864

While AESC didn't specify what those problems are, South Carolina's Republican governor said the company is dealing with the potential loss of federal tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and incentives for EV businesses as well as tariff uncertainties from President Donald Trump's administration.

“What we’re doing is urging caution — let things play out because all of the these changes are taking place,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.

AESC announced the suspension in construction of its plant in Florence on Thursday,

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,"" the company's statement said.

AESC promised to restart construction, although it didn't say when, and vowed to meet its commitment to hire 1,600 workers and invest $1.6 billion. The company said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence plant.

The battery maker based in Japan also has facilities in China, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. In the United States, AESC has a plant in Tennessee and is building one in Kentucky. The statement didn't mention any changes with other plants.

The South Carolina plant is supposed to sell battery cells to BMW AG, which is building its own battery assembly site near its giant auto plant in Greer. BMW said the construction pause by AESC doesn’t change its plans to open its plant in 2026.

AESC has already rolled back its South Carolina plans. They announced a second factory on the Florence site, but then said earlier this year that their first plant should be able to handle BMW's demand. That prompted South Carolina officials to withdraw $111 million in help they planned to provide.

The company is still getting $135 million in grants from the South Carolina Department of Commerce and $121 million in bonds and the agency said a construction pause won't prompt them to claw back that offer.

South Carolina is investing heavily in electric vehicles. Volkswagen AG-owned Scout Motors plans to invest more than $4 billion and hire 10,000 people for a plant to build its new electric SUVs scheduled to open in 2027.

The state has for decades made big bets on foreign manufacturers like BMW, Michelin and Samsung that have paid off with an economic boom this century, but there is uneasiness that Trump's flirtation with high tariffs might stagger or even ruin those important partnerships.

McMaster told people to relax as state and business leaders are talking to Trump's administration and things will work out.

“This is what energy leadership looks like,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, adding that the move supports both American jobs and Indo-Pacific energy security. The timing is strategic: Japan’s crude imports are falling amid a refining sector under pressure, while South Korea is aggressively pursuing energy diversification.

Under Trump’s second term, the coal industry has gone from a political afterthought to a geopolitical asset. Since Day One, the President has declared war on what he calls environmental extremism, pushing executive orders to halt coal plant closures, expedite new construction, and reopen shuttered facilities.

And while critics focus on coal’s environmental cost, the administration is focused on grid reliability and foreign policy. Japan and South Korea—nations that import more than 80% of their energy—are viewed as critical frontlines in the battle for global energy dominance.

The Bull Mountains move is also a warning shot to China, whose coal-fueled growth has dwarfed Western capacity for years. By positioning U.S. coal exports as both an economic tool and a diplomatic lever, the Trump administration is signaling it won't cede the Indo-Pacific energy map without a fight.

Coal, long counted out, may be America’s most surprising comeback story yet.

This initiative by Google and Elementl will financially benefit consumers whose electricity is sourced from nuclear power.
Because of this, consumers pay less for nuclear energy than they do for energy sourced from polluting fossil fuels.

EnergySage, a solar energy consumer resource, simplifies the process of going solar.","Behind hydropower, nuclear energy is the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity in the world, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that as of August 2023, there were 93 operating nuclear reactors at 54 sites in 28 states.

Google is about to add three more to that list.

Through nuclear site developer Elementl Power, Google will fund the project and plans to add 600 megawatts of generating capacity at all three sites, as reported by TechCrunch.

While the development company has yet to develop any power plants, its experience and understanding of the nuclear power industry make Elementl well-suited for such an ambitious and beneficial project.

The project will rely on small modular reactors, which are nuclear reactors smaller than typical commercial ones in size and output. There are currently no SMRs outside of China, but developers in the United States are attracted to them for their cost-effectiveness, short construction times, and nonexistent carbon output.

This initiative by Google and Elementl will financially benefit consumers whose electricity is sourced from nuclear power. The World Nuclear Association said nuclear plants are expensive to build but cheap to run. Because of this, consumers pay less for nuclear energy than they do for energy sourced from polluting fossil fuels.

Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?

Free energy is a dream, but it is entirely possible. When consumers use nuclear power as well as solar panels, their energy bills can drop to near $0. EnergySage, a solar energy consumer resource, simplifies the process of going solar. The company compares quotes for consumers and can potentially save them up to $10,000.

Clean energy can be a money-saver, giving consumers more finances for other essentials. This collaboration between Google and Elementl will benefit the planet and the economy.

In a press release, Elementl Power Chairman and CEO Chris Colbert said: ""Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power, and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals.""

Amanda Peterson Corio, the global head of data center energy at Google, said in the same release: ""Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PPwjSe3L7s7EudrGRpEGhA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5970695484a42c9030c20160e4f4c725,N,,2025-06-07 07:02:02.010844

The work has key implications for human health as wood-burning stoves are a leading source of PM2.5 emissions in the United States. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream. Exposure to PM2.5 is a known cause of cardiovascular disease and is linked to the onset and worsening of respiratory illness.

Even though a relatively small number of households use wood stoves, they are the U.S.'s third-largest source of particulate matter pollution, after wildfire smoke and agricultural dust, said Nordica MacCarty of the OSU College of Engineering.

Residential wood combustion, especially the use of inefficient stoves, is also a significant source of other harmful emissions including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, benzene and formaldehyde.

""Wood is an affordable, local, renewable, low-carbon fuel that should be an important part of the U.S. energy mix, but it must be burned cleanly to effectively protect health,"" MacCarty said.

""Folks typically think of pollution as coming from vehicles and industry, but household wood stoves are a larger source—just a few smoky stoves can create a harmful effect on air quality in an entire community.""

MacCarty published a paper in the Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association showing that 70% of the pollution emitted from wood stove flues happens at two points in time: when a stove is first lit, and when it's reloaded. MacCarty's team gained that knowledge by developing a new monitoring technique and deploying equipment at a collection of wood stove users' homes in rural Oregon.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, there are an estimated 6.5 million inefficient stoves in the U.S., most of them models that predate EPA clean-burning standards. In all, there are roughly 10 million wood-burning stoves in the country, or one for every 35 people.

""A lot of the older stoves are essentially just metal boxes with chimneys and they don't incorporate modern engineering principles to optimize heat transfer and combustion,"" said MacCarty, the Richard & Gretchen Evans Professor of Humanitarian Engineering and an associate professor of mechanical engineering.

""They have no catalysts or secondary combustion to reduce emissions and lower the risk of creosote buildup that can cause chimney fires.""

MacCarty's group is developing automated technologies that inject jets of primary and secondary air into the fire to provide just the right amount of air and mixing at the right time and place in the fire. Prototypes are showing about a 95% reduction in particulate matter emissions compared to older models, she said.

The EPA has been reducing the allowable PM2.5 emissions rate regularly since the 1980s. In 2015 it was 4 grams per hour for cordwood stoves, and five years later it was reduced to 2.5 grams per hour. Regulation is driving innovation as stove makers improve their designs to meet certification requirements, MacCarty said.

But wood stoves perform differently in the lab than they do in real life, she noted, and stoves are certified based on laboratory tests—and often designed to pass the tests, rather than to operate well in someone's home.

""It's difficult to measure wood stove emissions in the field, so there has been relatively little in-use performance data available in the past to guide designs,"" MacCarty said. ""Our study introduces a new system that makes collecting real-world emissions data more practical.""

The project included Oregon State undergraduate student Jonah Wald and was a collaboration between OSU and the nonprofit Aprovecho Research Center based in Cottage Grove, Oregon. It builds on OSU and Aprovecho's ongoing work on efficient combustion for cooking with wood in the developing world.

Roughly 2.7 billion people rely on open fires for cooking, MacCarty said, and her team has been designing efficient cook stoves for them to use instead.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2025/new-technologies-help.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 02:00:39.353184

Aidala,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/big-beautiful-bill-means-big-cuts-clean-energy-manufacturers,"On March 20, 2025, House Republicans passed the “Big Beautiful Bill” (BBB) as part of H.R.
1, a sweeping legislative package that includes dramatic rollbacks of many of the clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Subtitle C of the bill, titled “Make America Win Again,” proposes to sunset, repeal, or restrict nearly every major clean energy tax credit under the IRA.
In addition to severing incentives for manufacturers with foreign ties, the BBB repeals the ability to transfer clean energy tax credits under IRA Section 6418 — a key tool for helping smaller developers and manufacturers monetize credits and attract financing.
The BBB has sparked pushback from industry stakeholders, including Elon Musk, who argue that the IRA’s tax credits have spurred historic levels of clean energy investment and domestic manufacturing.","On March 20, 2025, House Republicans passed the “Big Beautiful Bill” (BBB) as part of H.R. 1, a sweeping legislative package that includes dramatic rollbacks of many of the clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While the bill has little chance of advancing in the Senate in its current form, its proposed cuts offer a window into shifting political priorities and could have significant implications for the U.S. clean energy manufacturing sector.

Subtitle C of the bill, titled “Make America Win Again,” proposes to sunset, repeal, or restrict nearly every major clean energy tax credit under the IRA. Among those affected are credits for clean vehicle purchases (Section 25E), commercial clean vehicles (Section 45W), alternative refueling infrastructure (Section 30C), residential energy efficiency improvements (Sections 25C and 25D), new energy efficient homes (Section 45L), and advanced manufacturing (Section 45X).

For manufacturers, the most potentially damaging proposals are those that target the clean electricity production and investment credits under Sections 45Y and 48E, and the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X. The bill would not only accelerate the phase-out dates for these credits but would also impose new restrictions on facilities and companies that receive any form of “material assistance” from so-called “prohibited foreign entities,” including entities with even minor Chinese ownership or influence.

These foreign entity provisions mirror similar restrictions proposed in standalone legislation like the BIOSECURE Act, which passed in the House, but stalled in the Senate, and represent an aggressive policy shift toward economic decoupling. The expansive definitions of foreign influence and the scope of the restrictions in the BBB could have a chilling effect on clean energy investment, particularly in sectors like solar panel and electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing, where global supply chains are deeply interconnected.

While reducing “dependence on foreign countries” is an easy political statement with bipartisan appeal, the interconnected economic ties developed over past decades have made it literally impossible to reverse in the near term, if ever. The statements by (and actions of) Apple regarding manufacturing of iPhones is but one example. Many industries have similar “impossible” to recreate supply chains, as intentional global interconnectedness has been part of U.S. trade and foreign policy. Closer to home, proposed tariff policies for the auto and other industries threaten to upset foreign relations with Mexico and Canada (even though current trade provisions with our North American neighbors were negotiated under the first Trump term).

In addition to severing incentives for manufacturers with foreign ties, the BBB repeals the ability to transfer clean energy tax credits under IRA Section 6418 — a key tool for helping smaller developers and manufacturers monetize credits and attract financing.

The BBB has sparked pushback from industry stakeholders, including Elon Musk, who argue that the IRA’s tax credits have spurred historic levels of clean energy investment and domestic manufacturing. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, over $120 billion in new manufacturing investments have been announced since the IRA’s passage. The proposed repeals and restrictions could significantly undercut that momentum.

Although the BBB is unlikely to become law in its current form, its provisions could resurface in future negotiations or budget bills. Industry participants should monitor legislative developments closely and consider how foreign ownership structures, supply chain dependencies, and tax credit planning may need to adapt to an evolving policy landscape.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-06/Clean_Energy_Wind_US_SMALL.jpg?h=1d2e6443&itok=9rghNaQc,N,,2025-06-06 20:09:38.681971

As the US races against China to develop the most advanced capabilities in AI, energy is critical. In this second episode from the ACORE finance forum, we speak to experts about how US energy policy, and in particular the reconciliation bill now being debated in Congress, might affect that race.

Host Ed Crooks and regular guest Amy Myers Jaffe talk first to Joseph Webster, a Senior Fellow at the think-tank the Atlantic Council. They discuss the need for increased power supplies for data centers, the US reliance on clean energy supply chains that originate in China, and the challenges facing attempts to reduce that dependence.

Ed and Amy then talk to Seth Hanlon, a Senior Fellow at the New York University Tax Law Center, and to Lesley Hunter, the Senior VP for Policy and Engagement at ACORE. They dig into the politics around the reconciliation bill currently being worked on in the Senate. Seth previously worked at the US Treasury on the implementation of the energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, and shares his perspectives on the possible effects of the new legislation that could come out of Congress. Lesley provides her insight on the prospects for persuading senators to support a more favorable outcome for the clean energy industry.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions.
EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion.
That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, N.C., area.
CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.","On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate advisor now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of the Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to ... document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know’’ how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, N.C., area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state, including members of Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life, aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89cba16/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6152x3230+0+436/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2F23%2F1bb9bd5ca776fb3c4d9dc72b823c%2Fa0c60e7fb07a4705a55b7d904503de3e,N,,2025-06-06 22:03:07.093632

Pipe by 73 percent and at American Cast Iron Pipe by 62 percent.

Pipe project description states.
One of those was the Howard-Harrison Iron Company in Bessemer.","BIRMINGHAM, Ala.—Two iron pipe manufacturers in Alabama learned last week they lost a combined $150 million in promised federal funding that would have increased productivity and employment while slashing greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollution.

The grants, $75 million each, were issued to the American Cast Iron Pipe Company in Birmingham and the U.S. Pipe and Foundry Company in Bessemer through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations to replace older coke or gas-fueled blast furnaces with electric induction furnaces.

The projects were estimated to cut the greenhouse gas emissions at U.S. Pipe by 73 percent and at American Cast Iron Pipe by 62 percent.

“This project is expected to reduce the cost of operations, improve manufacturing capacity, and enhance overall melting process and reliability, demonstrating the viability of electrifying a core process for iron and steel manufacturing,” the U.S. Pipe project description states.

The two Alabama grants were among 24 clean energy awards terminated last week by the Department of Energy, totaling $3.7 billion.

The DOE said in a news release announcing the cuts that the terminated awards “failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in the release that the Biden administration “failed to conduct a thorough financial review” before approving the projects last year.

“While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment,” Wright said. “Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.”

Both companies have deep roots in Birmingham’s industrial center and have been operating in the area for more than a century. Both make ductile iron pipes used for water and wastewater infrastructure, among other products.

The projects would have decreased both facilities’ reliance on coke as fuel. Coke, a purified form of coal, is created by “baking” coal in high-temperature, low oxygen ovens to remove impurities. The ovens use large amounts of energy to make coke, and are often associated with numerous potentially hazardous emissions.

The National Cancer Institute warns that coke oven emissions “typically include carcinogens such as cadmium and arsenic,” and that “[e]xposure to coke oven emissions increases the risk of lung cancer and, possibly, kidney cancer.”

A coke plant in Birmingham was shuttered by local authorities due to alleged Clean Air Act violations in 2021 and has not reopened.

“By replacing the burning of coke with electric induction, this project would substantially improve air quality including reductions in particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides for nearby communities,” the U.S. Pipe project description states.

American Cast Iron Pipe, or ACIPCO, said it “remains committed to moving forward” with the project despite the loss of federal funding.

“American is disappointed to learn that our cooperative agreement with the Department of Energy for our Next Generation Melt Project has been terminated,” the company said in a released statement.

“Once completed, the Next Generation Melt Project and future downstream projects will increase capacity, provide flexibility with production scheduling and add high-quality, high-paying jobs,” the company said.

According to the company website, the project is estimated to be completed in 2029.

ACIPCO was founded in Birmingham in 1905 and employs approximately 1,600 people at its Birmingham facilities.

U.S. Pipe did not respond to requests for comment from Inside Climate News or other media outlets.

The company removed a 2024 press release touting the grant from its website and has not indicated whether it plans to continue the electrification project.

U.S. Pipe was created in 1899 by consolidating 14 iron and steel foundries in nine states. One of those was the Howard-Harrison Iron Company in Bessemer.

Just 16% of U.S. adults report being “very likely” or “likely” to make their next vehicle fully electric, down from previous years and the lowest figure since 2019. Meanwhile, 63% say they are “unlikely” or “very unlikely” to consider an EV — up sharply from 51% in 2022.

“While the automotive industry is committed to long-term electrification and providing a diverse range of models, underlying consumer hesitation remains,” said Greg Brannon, AAA’s director of automotive engineering.

The report includes several key barriers to adoption. The most cited concerns include high battery repair costs (62%), elevated purchase prices (59%), and EVs being unsuitable for long-distance travel (57%). Additional issues include a lack of convenient public charging (56%), range anxiety (55%), and safety concerns (31%).

Infrastructure challenges persist as well, with 27% of respondents reporting difficulties installing home charging stations, and 12% citing uncertainty due to potential changes to tax credits and rebates.

While interest surged in 2022 amid $5-per-gallon gas prices, dropping fuel costs have since dampened momentum. In this year’s survey, consumers still listed gas savings, environmental benefits, and lower maintenance costs as primary motivations. AAA’s data show EVs had the lowest fuel and maintenance costs among all vehicle types in 2024.

Public confidence in a fully electric future is also waning. In 2022, 40% of U.S. drivers believed most vehicles would be electric within a decade. That number has now fallen to 23%. Interest in EVs due to tax incentives also dropped significantly, from 60% in 2024 to just 39% this year.

As a potential bridge for hesitant consumers, AAA recommends hybrid or plug-in hybrid models, which offer some benefits of electrification without sacrificing familiarity or range flexibility.

AAA plans to continue monitoring consumer sentiment through surveys and research and encourages consumers to explore EV ownership resources like the 2025 AAA Car Guide and Driving Cost Calculator.

The administration's emphasis on advanced nuclear technologies presents opportunities for companies to invest in reliable, low-carbon energy sources that align with sustainability goals.
However, it's essential for companies to consider the evolving regulatory landscape, public perception, and potential risks associated with nuclear energy investments.
The EO deprioritizes renewable procurement, eliminates certain clean energy grant programs and removes climate-related requirements for federal funding eligibility.
It also directs agencies to restore fossil fuel leasing as a national priority.","EO 14302, along with three related orders released the same day, seeks to jumpstart a national strategy accelerating the deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. EO 14302 specifically aims to “to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy … that secure[s] our global industrial and digital dominance, achieve[s] our energy independence, [and] protect[s] our national security … .” The order directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to complete designs and begin construction of 10 new large reactors by 2030 and dramatically increase public-private partnership under the Defense Production Act (DPA), while mandating the secretaries of the Energy, Defense, and Transportation departments submit a report to the president highlighting key areas of policy and legislative action necessary for revamping American nuclear infrastructure.

EO 14299 instructs the DOE to, among many numerous policy directives in this lengthy order, designate AI data centers at DOE sites as critical defense facilities and to fast-track the deployment of advanced nuclear reactors to power such infrastructure, with the first reactor targeted to be operational within 30 months. These reactors may be privately funded and located on DOE-controlled land, with priority given to supporting national security and AI energy needs. To expedite development, the Departments of Energy and Defense are instructed to streamline environmental reviews under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) by using or creating categorical exclusions and emergency permitting processes.

EO’s 14300 and 14301 seek to streamline the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s permitting process for quicker approval of nuclear projects, direct the DOE to enhance testing protocols for nuclear reactors, ensuring safety and efficiency in the deployment of new technologies, and modernize safety requirements and testing facilities to keep pace with modern advancements in nuclear technology.

Facilitating the expansion of nuclear power may be relevant to companies considering integrating nuclear energy into climate strategies, such as technology companies that may view investments in this space as a potential strategy for adapting climate targets to the energy demands of increased AI-related activities.

The administration's emphasis on advanced nuclear technologies presents opportunities for companies to invest in reliable, low-carbon energy sources that align with sustainability goals. By participating in the development and deployment of modern nuclear infrastructure, companies can address the dual challenges of meeting escalating energy demands and achieving climate targets.

However, it's essential for companies to consider the evolving regulatory landscape, public perception, and potential risks associated with nuclear energy investments. Rapid progress in renewables, grid storage, and other emerging technologies may reduce the relative value of nuclear investments given the expense and timeline for nuclear infrastructure to become operational. Further, companies may face challenges with cyber and physical security as well as with the operation and reputational risks of nuclear waste management.

EO 14260 seeks to limit the ability of individual states to use permitting authorities – such as Section 401 of the Clean Water Act – to delay or block federally permitted infrastructure. The EO directs the attorney general, in consultation with the heads of executive departments and agencies where relevant, to identify and take action to prevent the enforcement of state energy permitting and other climate-related laws deemed to be unconstitutional or preempted. Such action is directed to focus litigation efforts on challenging state climate-related laws on preemption or other constitutional grounds. The order specifically targets New York, Vermont and California as examples of climate-related laws and initiatives that constitute state overreach. The order prioritizes the identification of any state laws purporting to address “climate change” or involving “environmental, social, and governance” initiatives, “environmental justice,” carbon or “greenhouse gas” emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes.

This EO would weaken the ability of states to block or impose conditions on major energy projects; however, any impacts would likely not be immediate, as the attorney general would need to pursue litigation challenges to prevent the enforcement of relevant state laws. This order is primarily focused on energy-related state laws, such as cap and trade schemes or permitting restrictions, and does not reference state disclosure statutes, such as the California climate disclosures under SBs 253 and 261. To the extent that the attorney general does target such statutes under this order, or otherwise, this would supplement ongoing litigation challenges, which include preemption claims, that have been unsuccessful to date.

EO 14262 addresses the increasing electricity demand driven by technological advancements, such as the expansion of AI data centers and increased domestic manufacturing, which have placed significant strain on the US electric grid. The order directs the secretary of energy to expedite the process for issuing emergency orders under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act during periods when grid operators forecast grid failures. The secretary of energy is further directed to create a procedure for analyzing current and anticipated reserve margins across all regions of the bulk power system regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), identify and assess regional generation resources critical to grid reliability, ensure that such resources are retained within at-risk regions, and prevent significant generation sources (over 50 megawatts) from converting fuel sources if it would result in a net reduction in capacity. The secretary is directed to issue a report on the procedures identified regarding reserve margin management and findings related to ensuring grid reliability, to be made publicly available on the DOE’s website within 90 days of the order.

EO 14192 directs all federal agencies and departments to identify and eliminate regulations deemed to impose “unjustified costs” on the energy, transportation, construction and manufacturing sectors by requiring a repeal of “at least 10 existing regulations” for every new rule or regulation adopted. Further, the EO directs all agencies to confirm that the cost of all new and repealed regulations is “significantly less than zero.” The EO revives and expands on a prior Trump administration regulatory rollback policy, requiring agencies to propose two deregulatory actions for every new regulation issued. It also directs the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to implement a regulatory reduction process within the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to oversee compliance and promote a cost-benefit analysis that prioritizes economic growth and energy affordability over environmental externalities.

This EO commits to a deregulatory posture across the federal government, especially in sectors with high energy usage or emissions profiles. However, a higher discount rate than applied in similarly themed policies of prior administrations means that the policy downplays the value of long-term environmental and health benefits, making regulations aimed at addressing future harms appear less cost-effective and resulting in future gains counting for less in the cost-benefit analysis. While businesses may benefit from reduced compliance costs and permitting delays, the directive increases the likelihood of agency-level rule rescissions that could be challenged in court under the Administrative Procedure Act. Environmental, labor and public health organizations are likely to contest high-impact rollbacks, particularly those affecting air and water quality standards or safety regulations.

EO 14154 reverses provisions in EO 14052 (bipartisan infrastructure law implementation) and EO 14082 (IRA execution), both of which advanced clean energy deployment and resilience. The EO deprioritizes renewable procurement, eliminates certain clean energy grant programs and removes climate-related requirements for federal funding eligibility. It also directs agencies to restore fossil fuel leasing as a national priority. The EO particularly focuses on reducing regulatory burdens on energy production and critical minerals, mandating the director of the OMB and the NEC begin implementing action plans to “suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome … as expeditiously as possible.” It directs federal agencies to expedite domestic energy and mining projects, expedite permitting, and freeze funding for Biden-era climate initiatives, including EV charging stations. The EO rescinds 12 climate-related EOs from the Biden administration and orders federal contracts advancing climate goals to be canceled where legally possible. It also limits judicial challenges to energy projects and streamlines National Environmental Policy Act review.

This EO also instructs agencies to review all grants, loans, and contracts to ensure policy alignment with traditional domestic energy production, critical minerals development, and the elimination of EV mandates. In procurement or disbursement, agencies must prioritize cost-effectiveness, competitiveness of American business and taxpayer value. The order requires the secretary of state to explore critical minerals mining partnerships with Japan, India and Australia.

Currently, this executive order is subject to several preliminary injunctions within the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and DC Circuit. Both have been partially stayed and are pending appeal in both circuits.

EO 14156 empowers the DOE to exercise emergency authority over energy production and distribution. Further, it directs the heads of other executive departments and agencies to take steps to advance domestic energy resources and issue emergency waivers to various regulatory burdens. It specifically targets permitting bottlenecks, regulatory burdens and market disruptions that the administration claims threaten domestic energy security and affordability, and directs agencies to use emergency powers to boost domestic energy production, including on federal land. It encourages the use of eminent domain and the DPA to support efforts. The EPA is instructed to consider fuel waivers allowing year-round sale of E15 gasoline. The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers also are directed to use emergency power to fast-track permitting for energy projects by streamlining regulations under the Clean Water Act, Rivers and Harbors Act and Endangered Species Act.",https://www.cooley.com/-/media/cooley/media-logos/cooley-social-image.png,N,,2025-06-06 20:09:54.053874

Thirteen members of Congress are now urging Senators to take a closer look at several provisions within the bill that they acknowledge will stall investment in and development of clean energy projects

While we were proud to have worked to ensure that the bill did not include a full repeal of the clean energy tax credits, we remain deeply concerned by several provisions, including those which would abruptly terminate several credits just 60 days after enactment for projects that have not yet begun construction, a highly restrictive and onerous FEOC regime, and restrictions to transferability. This approach jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country.

The letter, which is addressed to Majority Leader Thune and Chairman Crapo, states that the Senate has a “critical opportunity to restore common sense and deliver a truly pro-energy growth final bill that protects taxpayers while also unleashing the potential of U.S. energy producers, manufacturers, and workers.”

In April four moderate Republican U.S. senators wrote a letter of opposition to full-scale repeal the energy tax credits contained within the Inflation Reduction Act to incentivize renewable energy manufacturing, development and use.

Trump, who gave Musk unprecedented access to his Cabinet and the Oval Office during the first 100 days of his administration, told the press on Thursday that he was “very disappointed” by Musk’s remarks. The president said Musk previously had no problems with the legislation, and accused him of only opposing it once he learned that it would “cut the EV mandate.”

Electric vehicles are expected to take a hit under the existing reconciliation budget proposal, but that isn’t the only provision that would seemingly hurt Musk and his business if passed as written.

Solar subsidies and investments

The House-passed reconciliation bill currently includes a provision to repeal the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act’s residential solar credit.

This subsidy, also known as the residential clean energy credit, is equal to 30% of the costs of new, qualified clean energy property installed on residential homes between 2022 and 2032.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that eliminating the credit will generate over $77 billion between 2025 and 2034.

Musk and Tesla have advocated rooftop solar subsidies for years, particularly as the EV company merged with leading solar panel manufacturer SolarCity in 2016. Since the acquisition, Tesla’s energy division has quietly grown, selling various solar and battery storage projects while benefiting from federal subsidies.

Tesla Energy was the fastest-growing part of the company last year and saw its revenue increase by 67% year over year in 2024.

Last week, Tesla Energy called on the Senate to protect residential solar and other tech-neutral clean energy credits. While the company did not detail how its revenues could be affected without the tax credit, Tesla did say abruptly ending them would “threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.”

“We urge the Senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e. This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth,” the company said in a post on X.

Emissions rule rollback

The House bill would also repeal stringent emission standards set by the Biden administration to accelerate the transition toward EVs. The House version of the legislation would repeal several Inflation Reduction Act programs designed to reduce vehicle emissions.

The bill would also repeal Biden’s fuel economy standards, also known as CAFE standards, which require automakers to use a range of technologies to comply, including producing EVs. It would also slash the Environmental Protection Agency’s multipollutant standards for light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, which require automakers to meet emissions standards.

Tesla has benefited from the programs, as it receives regulatory credits that can be traded or sold to other automakers who need to meet the standards. Auto manufacturers receive credits by exceeding CAFE standards and, in some states, emissions standards. Tesla previously urged the Biden administration to set even more stringent fuel efficiency standards than the ones ultimately finalized.

Regulatory credits have been one of Tesla’s biggest sources of profits, Seth Goldstein, an equity strategist at Morningstar, said earlier this year.

“When Tesla’s underlying business was still unprofitable, it often used the credits as a way to bridge the gap to profitability,” Goldstein said.

EV tax credits

In addition, the bill would also repeal a slew of clean vehicle tax credits that incentivize consumers and businesses to purchase EVs and plug-in vehicles.

It would cut previously owned clean vehicle credits, clean vehicle credits, qualified commercial vehicle credit, alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, and the transferability of clean fuel production credits.

The CBO estimated that the termination of these EV-related tax credits would generate around $191.7 billion in revenue between 2025 and 2034.

Musk has advocated ending the tax credits for EVs and other sectors. Although the credits for EVs directly help Tesla, they provide a bigger advantage to competitors that are further from profitability.

Overall, Tesla has spent roughly $240,000 lobbying members of Congress on policies related to EVs, according to OpenSecrets.

While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in the House, the final bill’s text is anticipated to change as a number of key senators have expressed interest in saving various clean energy tax credits.

However, the Senate is expected to still deal a blow to the EV industry, as draft text released by the Environment and Public Works Committee this week includes a provision rescinding regulations on vehicle tailpipe emissions.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AP25070731017458-scaled.webp,N,,2025-06-06 22:02:30.514778

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks.

Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.
The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.","Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule Friday that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks are illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden's target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department's memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,"" Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months. Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons (265 billion liters) of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy's announcement “a positive development"" that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department's action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy regulatory credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don't rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

The memo and bill text landed this week as Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump engage in a public spat online, with Trump suggesting that Musk “only developed a problem” with his budget bill because it rolls back tax credits for EVs. Musk disputes that.

Risk management rules – EPA intends to revise at least some of the risk management rules that the Biden EPA promulgated, including the exposure limits in some cases.

Risk evaluations – EPA plans to reconsider at least one risk evaluation, and reconsideration of others is likely.

New chemicals – EPA is allocating resources to review of premanufacture notices (PMNs) under the amended rules.

Reporting requirements – EPA is likely to reduce some reporting burdens.

In the coming weeks and months, these announcements will lead to multiple opportunities to comment on EPA’s proposed changes and offer suggestions for additional changes. Potentially affected stakeholders should plan to submit comments.

Background

Within EPA, the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) administers TSCA and the pesticide program. Under the Biden administration, OCSPP continued to work up until the January 20 Inauguration to promulgate or propose TSCA rules (see our alerts here, here, here, and here) under the direction of Assistant Administrator for OCSPP, Michal Freedhoff.

In the first few months of the second Trump administration, the administration neither confirmed, nor named a nominee for that job. Nor has the administration appointed an interim Assistant Administrator. Instead, the administration appointed a Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator, Nancy Beck, and a Deputy Assistant Administrator, Lynn Dekleva.

Due to this situation, we believe that EPA has held off on making some of the substantial changes to the TSCA program that some had anticipated. Now, however, the changes that EPA plans to make are becoming clearer.

Section 6 – Existing Chemicals

Risk Management Rules

Shortly after President Trump’s inauguration, EPA asked all courts reviewing risk management rules finalized during the Biden EPA for more time to brief EPA management on the positions EPA should take. Recently, EPA has begun informing those courts of its intentions. EPA has already announced its intention to consider revisions to three Biden EPA risk management rules. Other final risk management rules may also undergo further rulemaking.

Methylene chloride, 40 C.F.R. Part 751, Subpart B EPA informed the Fifth Circuit that it intends to initiate a new rulemaking to reconsider the “single risk determination issue” (also known as the “whole chemical” issue) and “the no-assumption of personal protective equipment issue” (the PPE issue). On the other hand, at oral argument, EPA defended other aspects of the rule, including the assertion that the best available science supports the unreasonable risk determination.

Trichloroethylene, 40 C.F.R. Part 751, Subpart D – EPA informed the Third Circuit that it intends to reconsider the trichloroethylene rule through rulemaking, including the rule’s Existing Chemical Exposure Limit (ECEL) of 0.2 ppm for uses with TSCA section 6(g) exemptions. EPA may also reconsider other aspects of the trichloroethylene rule in a rulemaking expected to take 18-24 months. To facilitate that rulemaking, EPA has already published a notice announcing a postponement of the effective date (until June 20, 2025) of the conditions for each of the TSCA section 6(g) exemptions.

Perchloroethylene, 40 C.F.R. Part 751, Subpart G – EPA informed the Fifth Circuit that it also intends to reconsider the perchloroethylene rule through rulemaking, including the rule’s ECEL of 0.14 ppm, and whether the rule went beyond the extent necessary to eliminate unreasonable risk. We anticipate the rulemaking to take 12 to18 months.

Other risk management rules, 89 Fed. Reg. 51134 – EPA has not yet announced plans to amend the other challenged risk management rules whose court challenges remain under abeyance – those for chrysotile asbestos, carbon tetrachloride, and decabromodiphenyl ether (which may be a special case, as the decabromodiphenyl ether rule was adopted under TSCA section 6(h) rather than section 6(c)). Nevertheless, a rulemaking for at least the carbon tetrachloride rule is foreseeable.

The Biden EPA published a proposed risk management rule for 1-bromopropane in August 2024, meaning that the final rule is due in August 2025. The Biden EPA also published a proposed risk management rule on C.I. pigment violet 29 in January 2025, a week before the inauguration. The Trump EPA will likely make changes in both rules before adopting them as final.

Risk Evaluations

Risk evaluation framework rule, 40 C.F.R. Part 702, Subpart B

EPA has informed the Fifth Circuit in litigation challenging the risk evaluation framework rule that it intends to reconsider all aspects of the rule. EPA has filed declarations by Nancy Beck stating that EPA plans to propose a revised rule by June 2025; provide 60 days for public comment on the proposal; and finalize a revised rule by April 2026. Among the changes that the proposed rule may address are:

The requirement to make a single determination of unreasonable risk (the “whole chemical” issue).

The requirement to assume that workers are not using personal protective equipment in conducting the risk evaluation (the PPE issue).

The addition of “overburdened communities” to the definition of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations”.

The requirement that a risk evaluation must address all conditions of use.

The requirements and process by which chemical manufacturers may request that EPA conduct a risk evaluation on a chemical substance.

The circumstances under which EPA will undertake substantive revisions to TSCA risk evaluations. EPA intends to reconsider these requirements and seek public comment on the appropriateness of reconsidering TSCA risk evaluations under certain circumstances.

EPA’s commitment to make publicly available any risk-based occupational exposure values calculated as part of the risk evaluation.

1,4-Dioxane risk evaluation

In other Fifth Circuit litigation, EPA informed the court that it intends to reconsider the final 1,4-dioxane risk evaluation. This reconsideration will determine whether the Biden EPA completed the cancer risk analysis in the hazard assessment using the best available science, including whether it reviewed all relevant and available cancer mode of action information in a manner consistent with EPA’s Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment. Other changes, such as the “whole chemical” issue and the PPE issue, may also be considered. We expect the review process to take between 12 and 24 months.

This first announcement of reconsideration of a finished risk evaluation may signal reconsideration of other completed risk evaluations (such as that for formaldehyde) and draft risk evaluations (such as that for 1,3-butadiene).

Section 5 – New Chemicals

EPA is taking steps to speed up the processing time for PMNs. Administrator Zeldin announced that “OCSPP will gain more than 130 scientific, technical, bioinformatic, and information technology experts to work directly on the backlogs of over 504 new chemicals in review that are beyond the statutorily required timeframes and over 12,000 pesticide reviews that are well beyond their expected timelines.” Those employees will need training, but eventually, we expect the added personnel to expedite EPA’s reviews.

It is noteworthy that the Trump EPA did not stay the amendments to the new chemical regulations adopted by the Biden EPA a month before the inauguration. EPA expects that those amendments will improve the efficiency of its review processes. Those amendments, including the additional data elements for PMNs, are in effect, as are the provisions restarting the 90-day clock if a submitter provides important new information during the review period. EPA has been working to revise the Central Data Exchange (CDX) software to incorporate the new data elements in the electronic PMN form.

In the meantime, EPA released guidance on how to meet the amended new chemical regulations.

Reporting Rules

PFAS reporting rule, 40 C.F.R. Part 705

As discussed in our previous alert, the Trump EPA announced a 9-month delay in the submission period, which was originally set to open on November 12, 2024 and close (for most companies) on May 8, 2025. In 2024, the Biden EPA first delayed this submission period by 8 months, and with the Trump EPA’s second delay, the submission period is now to open on April 13, 2026 and close (for most companies) on October 13, 2026. The Trump EPA’s announcement also indicated that EPA intends to publish “a separate notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future.” The proposed rule will address the submission period timing and, presumably, other issues, including possibly the adoption of exemptions for importers of articles containing PFAS.

Section 8(d) reporting rule for 16 chemicals, 40 C.F.R. Part 716

Shortly before the inauguration, the Biden EPA published a final rule under TSCA section 8(d) requiring manufacturers to submit health and safety studies on 16 chemicals that were mostly either about to be designated as high-priority substances (triggering the risk evaluation process) or as candidates for that designation (triggering the formal designation process). Reports were originally due March 13, 2025. The Trump EPA extended that deadline to June 11, 2025, for vinyl chloride, and to September 9, 2025, for the other 15 chemicals. In litigation challenging the rule, EPA asked for and received an indefinite abeyance of the court proceedings to allow the parties to engage in settlement negotiations to resolve some or all of the matters at issue. Thus, changes to the rule are foreseeable.

Comments

Starting this month, companies and trade associations can expect a flurry of rulemaking proposals and other opportunities to comment on changes that the Trump EPA is considering making to Biden EPA actions under TSCA. If implemented, those changes could significantly affect company obligations.

“I’m cautiously hopeful. I wouldn’t use the word optimistic just because … things are all over the place now, so we will just have to see what comes out in the next couple of weeks,” Sandhya Ganapathy, CEO of EDP Renewables North America, said June 5 during the American Council on Renewable Energy’s Finance Forum. If the House version of the bill succeeds, “I would say it’s catastrophic for the industry as a whole.”

President Donald Trump wants the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill,” also known as the reconciliation bill, approved by Congress and on his desk for signature by July 4. However, numerous issues have been raised with the bill, which may ultimately increase the federal debt limit despite its many proposed cuts. The cuts not only impact pure play renewable energy companies. Many traditional oil and gas players are energy companies, having made substantial investments in low-carbon and renewable energy projects as well.

Big Bill Not Beautiful for Clean Energy Passes US House

As it stands now, many clean energy incentives will be eliminated. The legislation includes an accelerated phase out and termination of several energy-related tax credits. The legislation eliminates the IRA’s clean electricity production and investment tax credits, among others, for facilities not under construction within 60 days after Trump signs the bill and in service by the end of 2028. Power plants and battery projects, for example, wanting to claim the technology-neutral tax credits would have to meet the requirements.

Projects that use equipment or critical minerals from or with ties to China, Russia, North Korea or Iran would be ineligible for such tax credits due to foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules.

The restrictions and shortened start construction timeline could stifle new projects early in the development process at a time of rising energy demand and the continued need for low-cost, reliable energy.

Ganapathy, like others, sees a construction rush ahead in the near term if the legislation remains the same.

“There is going to be a mad rush. I think we are all going to be chasing the same strategy, the same equipment providers, the same sort of avenues,” Ganapathy said. She added, “we are all spending a lot of time talking about FEOC and talking about how unsupportive it is. But if you’re not able to get to the start of construction, then that debate completely goes out the door. To me that is almost like the nail in the coffin.”

‘Double whammy’

Such broad-based provisions make it difficult to get any incremental volumes—especially unfortunate given the demand and appetite to deploy capital, Ganapathy said.

EDP Renewables North America’s more than 11.4 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy span the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The company’s wind, solar and energy storage facilities power the equivalent of more than 3.1 million homes annually, according to its website. Its capital investment in North America is about $16.8 billion.

Jim Murphy, president and cofounder of Invenergy, said the company is being cautiously optimistic that the Senate will fix some of the flaws in the bill.

“If the House version was the final version, well, we need to get going on the start of construction on projects … and also not to be subject to the onerous FEOC provisions that are also in the bill,” he said. “There’s sort of that double whammy.”

In addition to prohibiting specified foreign entities from claiming energy tax credits, FEOC rules also disqualify taxpayers from tax credits who make certain payments—such as licensing fees—to prohibited foreign entities and facilities that receive material assistance from such entities.

“The FEOC was written so broadly down past component to subcomponents in these new terms like material assistance and the payment provisions,” Murphy said. “Certainly, there will need to be guidance. We don’t know what that guidance would look like sitting here today. So, it’s a really an unknown world of what the rules would be. … The supply chain cannot support that and is not probably going to be able to support that for several years. So, it’s just an unworkable provision.”

Privately-held Invenergy is a developer of renewable energy and transmission projects. Earlier this year, the Chicago-based company with international assets inked a deal with Verizon for 640 megawatts of renewable energy. The agreement boosted Verizon’s total procured energy from Invenergy to more than 1 GW.

Meeting demand

Both companies have safe harbored projects. When asked whether the potential construction start rush or FEOC provisions would lead them to prioritize certain projects over others, the executives agreed there was no hierarchy and decisions would be driven by customers.

“We have the pipeline to deliver any of the technologies and so it’ll be a customer decision,” Murphy said.

Ganapathy pointed out that wind installations have fallen but wind commands a premium, while solar is a wider market. “Having said that, there is demand no matter what, and we do have the appetite to deploy and so there is no pecking order.”

Led by solar, renewables generated nearly 25% of U.S. electricity in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and it continues to grow as costs fall.

Industry players have said all forms of energy will be needed to meet growing demand. Each has a role to play: whether it’s the fast construction completion and start-up times for renewables or the firm, reliable power of natural gas.

“We have a gas development business in addition to renewables and we’re getting a lot of customer inquiries for gas fired as well, mostly peaking, but we can’t deliver that immediately the way we can deliver renewables immediately,” Murphy said. About “95% of what’s in the queue right now is renewable projects and ... gas projects are not going to be ready until the end of the decade here for the most part.”

There will be some installations in the near-term; however, most of the activity being seen today are assets trading hands, not newbuilds coming online, Murphy said. Given challenges that include permitting as well as gas turbine equipment and EPC workforce constraints, he expects more newbuilds online between 2028 and 2030 at the earliest.

Meanwhile, energy demand continues to rise—driven by data center growth, the rise of electrification, an increase in manufacturing activity and a reshoring push.

But Ganapathy pointed out how the U.S.’ reputation of being the best place for investments—a “north star” or “safe haven” of sorts—is changing. Concerns about the reconciliation bill resurfaced along with uncertainty surrounding trade and tariffs impacting not just renewables but everyone.

“In a way, we are in this quagmire and we need to get out of that,” she said. “I’m just hoping that a good sense will prevail and then we will have a better version of the bill than what we have today.”",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/06/industry-warns-fallout-trumps-anti-clean-energy-bill.jpg?itok=O8UBT0sz,N,,2025-06-06 21:06:06.703182

Call your senators and tell them to vote NO on Republicans’ billionaire tax scam.","Republicans in the House jammed through their budget reconciliation bill (a.k.a. billionaire tax scam or the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill”) last month, and it’s the most anti-environmental legislation ever passed in a chamber of Congress. The bill, which is currently being considered by the Senate, would stop clean energy progress in its tracks, raise energy costs for everyday people, and exact a devastating toll on our environment. Here are the top five reasons we cannot allow this bill to become law.

1. Higher energy costs for our families and communities.

The bill passed by the House would cut clean energy and energy efficiency programs, rebates, and incentives, effectively putting an end to clean energy development across the country. At a time when we need to be producing more energy, not less, cutting clean energy programs would force communities to rely on dirty, expensive fossil fuels. This bill would exacerbate already sky-high energy prices by driving up costs by hundreds of dollars a year for families nationwide.

2. Harms public health.

This bill would eliminate pollution reduction programs that are cleaning up our schools, ports, and transportation, while at the same time cutting funding that allows communities to track harmful pollution. The loss of these programs would mean increased toxic air pollution that causes asthma, heart conditions, cancer, premature death, and more.

4. Putting billionaire polluters above the law.

The bill also establishes a system that allows oil and gas companies to avoid responsibility for the impacts of pollution they create and sidestep environmental review, community input, and judicial scrutiny simply by paying a fee. This would give polluters free reign to pollute as much as they want without regard for the impacts on communities and the environment.

5. Threats to the economy and national security.

With this bill, Republicans are poised to gut widely-supported clean energy tax credits and other investments. These public investments, paired with hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments, are crucial to supporting America’s manufacturing resurgence and have created hundreds of thousands of jobs, with more than half of those jobs in Republican-held districts. If these investments were cut, those jobs would be lost and American clean energy manufacturing would stall, tanking the economy and ceding global clean energy manufacturing leadership to China.

Passed in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act has “spurred the highest levels of factory construction in American history, with more than 400,000 new jobs announced across the country,” according to Climate Power. Families that have adopted solar as a result of the available credits in the IRA are on average saving more than $2,000 a year on energy costs. Clean energy technologies constituted 93% of new energy generation capacity added to the grid last year alone.

But despite the act’s success, especially in red states, key components of the IRA including clean energy tax credits face repeal in President Donald Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

As The New York Times reported on June 4, “Repealing those credits could increase the average family’s energy bill by as much as $400 per year within a decade, according to several studies published this year,” at a time when electricity prices are already surging. The Times piece noted that one of those studies found that “repealing the clean electricity credits could cause power prices to surge more than 13 percent in states like Arizona, Kansas, New Jersey and North Carolina and lead to thousands of job losses nationwide by 2032.”

Yet for years, Fox News figures have told their audience that implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, which they often incorrectly refer to as the Green New Deal, would raise costs for American consumers, while obsessing about energy costs under the Biden administration.

Right-wing media falsely claimed the Inflation Reduction Act and its supposed Green New Deal policies would raise energy costs for Americans

In the weeks surrounding the IRA’s August 2022 passage, Fox News repeatedly attacked the bill using a variety of disingenuous narratives, including claiming that it would raise energy costs. In the first two years after the act’s passage, the network mentioned the IRA more than twice as much as CNN and 40% more than MSNBC, often referring to the legislation as “the Green New Deal” and “the Green New Scam.”

Here are some examples of Fox News personalities claiming the Inflation Reduction Act or investing in clean energy would hurt Americans:

Fox & Friends Weekend co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy said the bill would “make Americans poorer.” “One of the most elitist moments that we actually saw was all of them cheering after they passed this fake Inflation Reduction Act, which was really a Green New Deal,” she said. “They lied to the American people. They cheered after, knowing that that bill was going to make Americans poorer.” [Fox News, The Faulkner Focus, 8/16/22]

Fox News host Sean Hannity called the IRA an “energy spending spree” to “appease the climate religious cult.” He said: “Now if she [Sen. Kyrsten Sinema) does ultimately cave, the Schumer-Manchin $500 billion Green New Deal energy spending spree that they purposely label as something it's not – the Inflation Reduction Act – will become the law of the land. … Now another $500 billion to appease the climate religious cult that rules the Democratic Party.” [Fox News, Hannity, 8/3/22]

Fox host Jesse Watters claimed the IRA would “increase your electricity bills.” He said: “Oh, and then they’re going to raise taxes on corporations and then they’re going to tax methane, which is going to increase your electricity bills. None of this is going to stop inflation because it’s not designed to. It’s like a skinny margarita. This is the skinny version of the Green New Deal.” [Fox News, Jesse Watters Primetime, 6/28/22]

Former Fox contributor Tammy Bruce, who now serves as the State Department spokesperson, claimed on Hannity that the Inflation Reduction Act has increased energy and gas prices. She said: “They’re admitting that the Inflation Reduction Act was a climate bill. … What we saw was mortgages increasing, rent increasing, food inflation, energy costs — it’s not going to be summer forever; we're heading into winter. The gas prices — the staples that allowed people to live their lives in a manner that they want to, freely have all been chopped off at the knees.” [Fox News, Hannity, 8/18/23]

It’s the lowest figure AAA has seen since 2019

Americans have more electric cars to choose from than ever before. Increasingly, they don’t plan to choose them.

A new study from AAA finds just 16% of Americans consider themselves “likely” or “very likely” to buy an electric vehicle (EV) for their next car. That’s down from 18% last year and 23% the year before.

“While the automotive industry is committed to long-term electrification and providing a diverse range of models, underlying consumer hesitation remains,” says Greg Brannon, AAA’s director of automotive engineering.

Hesitant Over Costs, Range

59% cited high prices, and 62% feared high battery costs as reasons to stay away

58% worried about long-distance travel being too hard with an EV

AAA surveyed 1,128 adults “using a probability-based panel designed to be representative of the U.S. household population overall” in early March. Researchers say their study has a 4% margin of error.

Money is holding drivers back from EVs. Sixty-two percent cited the high cost of battery replacement as the biggest reason they weren’t interested. Another 59% cited the high purchase price.

The average EV sold for $59,255 last month – $10,556 more than the $48,699 price of the average car.

Range proved a concern, too, with 58% saying EVs are unsuitable for long-distance travel. EV range is improving, but many industry insiders say it won’t change drastically until manufacturers perfect next-generation solid-state batteries.

The Shift Is Well Underway Elsewhere

A recent report said 25% of all new cars sold globally could be EVs this year

America is stuck below 7%

That could leave the American auto industry uncompetitive

A recent report from the International Energy Agency found that, worldwide, about a quarter of all new cars could be electric this year.

Americans have bought more EVs so far in 2025 than they did in the first six months of 2024. But EVs made up just 6.9% of the American market last month.

Automakers worry that they’re falling behind. However, China’s automotive industry is growing quickly, with Chinese automaker BYD now the world’s largest EV builder and Chinese brands selling well worldwide.

U.S. laws currently exclude Chinese automakers from the American market, but even industry insiders don’t expect that firewall to last forever.

But it Faces New Headwinds in the U.S.

Congress could eliminate EV tax credits for Americans soon

The Trump administration has frozen funds for new chargers

America’s automakers are increasingly hobbled as they try to fight back.

A law recently passed in the House of Representatives would end a $7,500 EV tax credit. It’s not clear that the proposal will pass the Senate. It’s currently tied up in Republican infighting as President Trump and his top donor, Elon Musk, clash over the bill.

But the White House has paused funds for new chargers.

American automakers are starting to signal a retreat from EVs. Ram recently revived its Hemi V8 engine, and several automakers have delayed new electric cars amid flagging consumer interest.

That risks an American auto industry that can only build cars Americans want. Ford CEO Jim Farley, once a booster of international growth, recently called the industry “increasingly a regional business.”",https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tesla-dealership-model-y-and-model-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 19:07:48.362728

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden’s target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department’s memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,” Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months. Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons (265 billion liters) of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy’s announcement “a positive development” that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department’s action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy regulatory credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don’t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

The memo and bill text landed this week as Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump engage in a public spat online, with Trump suggesting that Musk “only developed a problem” with his budget bill because it rolls back tax credits for EVs. Musk disputes that.

Markey joined by labor leaders, workers in Dorchester at IBEW Local 103

Boston (June 6, 2025) – Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, today hosted a press conference at IBEW Local 103 with labor union leaders and workers to highlight how Congressional Republicans’ proposed budget reconciliation cuts to climate and clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act would hurt workers in Massachusetts.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the House-passed Republican bill would cut more than $500 billion in investments for environment, energy, and climate, which could lead to 830,000 jobs lost by 2030 and shrink the national economy by $1.1 trillion over the next decade.

“In Massachusetts, we have over 115,000 workers in the clean energy sector. Thousands of union jobs will be at risk. Trump and Republicans are selling out the livelihoods of working people and the future of our children, all to pay for tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. The Trump agenda is clear: steal from the workers to give to the wealthy. But if Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans think that union workers are going to roll over as their jobs, families, and livelihoods are threatened—they have another thing coming,” said Senator Markey. “Together, we are going to make clear how Republicans are hurting people in their own states; slow and stop this bill—defending our jobs, our future, and our way of life; and put Republicans on the record. The fight ahead of us is hard, but the harder the fight, the more important it is that we take it on. We fight until we win. For every worker. For every American. For a livable future.”

“We need more energy, and we need more jobs in Massachusetts, plain and simple. Working families shouldn’t have to purchase energy from billionaire oil tycoons and foreign governments or let them set the price of our energy bills. We can generate massive amounts of energy right here in Massachusetts and we can create thousands of union jobs for Massachusetts residents while we do it. Over the last few years, thousands of our neighbors and our friends have been put to work on electric grid upgrades, battery storage facilities, and manufacturing plants. They’re building our clean energy future and we’re all benefiting: the family that these workers support, the homes, the schools, the businesses that need a reliable supply of energy, and every one of us that will live on a cleaner, safer planet because of it.” said Chrissy Lynch, President, Massachusetts AFL-CIO.

“Repealing clean energy tax credits is a union job killer. These tax credits help level the playing field, they drive investment, and they put IBW electricians, laborers, ironworkers, and pipe fitters to work building America’s energy future. If you take those tax credits away, you’re not just pulling funding: you’re pulling paychecks from working families, you’re pulling apprentices out of training facilities, you’re pulling opportunity straight out of our communities. Every solar panel installed, every wind turbine wired, every EV charger connected, that’s a job with wages, healthcare, and a pension that stands for dignity for the American worker. You don’t kill that kind of progress: you build on it.” said Lou Antonellis, Business Manager/Financial Secretary, IBEW Local 103.

“Hundreds of thousands of lives will be affected if these tax credits are repealed. Our members are the ones out here in the freezing cold and the blazing heat; laying foundations, wiring schools, setting steel, climbing wind turbines, and putting up solar panels. I’m here today representing those skilled union workers who build the schools our kids learn in, the bridges we drive on, and because of smart, clean energy investments, the solar and wind farms that will power our future. With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, we saw national investment in clean energy that wasn’t about corporate tax breaks. It was about people. It meant workers having access to construction projects that benefit communities and families and taking part in building a clean economy. But now the Republican Reconciliation package threatens to undo all of that. said Chaton Green, Business Agent, Greater Boston Building Trades Union.

“We need long-term, sustained investment in renewable energy to ensure this work continues well beyond the current round of offshore wind projects. Major solar and hydroelectric projects must also move forward to deliver clean power to our communities and meaningful, local jobs to our members. These are more than just jobs—they’re life-changing careers, especially for people who have historically been left out of economic opportunity. This is exactly the kind of progress we need to protect and expand for the future,”said Andy Benedetto, Business Representative, Local 1121 Millwrights.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department's action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy regulatory credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don't rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

The memo and bill text landed this week as Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump engage in a public spat online, with Trump suggesting that Musk ""only developed a problem"" with his budget bill because it rolls back tax credits for EVs. Musk disputes that.

,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-06-06 21:58:10+00:00,Grist,Youth climate activists won lawsuits in Montana and Hawai'i. Now they're targeting Trump.,Sophie Hurwitz,,,,,https://grist.org/justice/youth-climate-activists-new-suit-trump-executive-orders/,"Many of the young plaintiffs have taken part in similar lawsuits before, and won.
At issue are two orders Trump signed on his first day in office: one, declaring “a national energy emergency” and a second boosting production of “American energy”.
Many of the plaintiffs in the suit won key climate victories against the state of Montana and the Hawai‘i Department of Transportation in 2024 and 2025, respectively.
Ten of those young people from Montana are now among the 22 plaintiffs in the Trump lawsuit.
“What we really need to be doing,” Bellinger said, “is addressing the climate emergency, not unleashing fossil fuels that will worsen the plaintiffs’ injuries.”","Twenty-two young people are suing President Donald Trump, arguing that his executive orders to “unleash” fossil fuel development and achieve “energy dominance” are not only unconstitutional but life-threatening — a direct challenge to his rollback of efforts to address the climate crisis.

Many of the young plaintiffs have taken part in similar lawsuits before, and won. Now, they’re using the lessons learned in previous fights to improve their odds of success.

“Trump’s fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation,” Eva Lighthiser, the named plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. “I’m not suing because I want to — I’m suing because I have to. My health, my future, and my right to speak the truth are all on the line. He’s waging war on us with fossil fuels as his weapon, and we’re fighting back with the Constitution.”

Lighthiser v. Trump, filed May 29 in federal district court in Butte, Montana, names Trump; several Cabinet secretaries and agencies, including the Energy and Transportation departments; and the EPA as defendants.

At issue are two orders Trump signed on his first day in office: one, declaring “a national energy emergency” and a second boosting production of “American energy”. A third order, signed in April, aimed to reinvigorate “America’s beautiful, clean coal industry.” Together, the youth plaintiffs — who are between 7 and 25 years old — argue these actions prioritize fossil fuels, suppress climate science, and undermine federal laws designed to protect public health, promote environmental safety, and maintain scientific integrity. They also argue that the orders “amount to a wholesale attack on clean renewable energy and climate science — escalating the climate emergency” and violating their Fifth Amendment right to life and liberty.

“These are the three executive orders that are the basis for the administration’s efforts to both unleash new fossil fuels and block the build-out of renewable energy,” said Nate Bellinger, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs. “They’re often referencing these executive orders when they’re doing things like expedited environmental reviews for oil and gas development or expanding coal mines.”

Lighthiser v. Trump enumerates the many ways Trump’s orders adversely impact the plaintiff’s lives. The young people, described as “students, ranchers, scientists-in-training, artists, and educators,” claim their economic and academic opportunities have been jeopardized by the Trump administration’s aggressive campaign to wipe climate data from the internet. They’ve endured heat waves that kept them indoors and fled wildfires or floods that threatened their homes. Some have been hospitalized for lung problems, and five of them live with respiratory ailments exacerbated by pollution.

“Future generations should not have to foot the bill of the [left’s] radical climate agenda,” said White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers in response to the lawsuit. “The American people are more concerned with the future generations’ economic and national security.” Representatives for the federal agencies being sued did not respond to requests for comment.

Many of the plaintiffs in the suit won key climate victories against the state of Montana and the Hawai‘i Department of Transportation in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Then, as now, they argued that policies prioritizing the production of fossil fuels violated their right, enshrined in the constitutions of those two states, to a clean and healthful environment — rulings lawyers hope will set precedent for the case against Trump.

Like Lighthiser v. Trump, those suits were brought by Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to achieving legal recognition of children’s climate rights. This is not the first time it has taken the federal government to court — Our Children’s Trust spent a decade in court arguing Juliana v. United States, a pioneering case that argued the government wasn’t doing enough to protect them from climate change.

They lost that case in March, but their fight sparked a global movement to defend children’s rights to a healthy climate and shaped the strategy behind the current lawsuit.

“The hill that the plaintiffs need to climb here is not as steep as what they faced in Juliana,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “In Juliana, they were asking the court to direct the federal government to prepare and implement a plan to change the entire energy system in the U.S. Here they are simply asking for the revocation of certain executive orders.”

Beyond that, “This new case is really grounded in previously recognized constitutional rights, rather than trying to argue there’s a new constitutional right to a stable climate system,” said Bellinger. He played a key role in winning the Montana case, where a judge agreed that the state’s enthusiastic support of the fossil fuel industry violated his clients’ constitutional rights. Ten of those young people from Montana are now among the 22 plaintiffs in the Trump lawsuit.

“What we really need to be doing,” Bellinger said, “is addressing the climate emergency, not unleashing fossil fuels that will worsen the plaintiffs’ injuries.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-1258643945.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-06 22:04:41.342805

The public feud between Trump and his once-allied Elon Musk fueled a litany of reactions on social media. The split has also raised other questions: Where does Tesla and the electric vehicle market stand?

What happened between Elon Musk and Donald Trump?

Despite Trump's constant praise of Musk as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, Musk announced in early May that he would be stepping back from the job.

In late May, the Tesla CEO criticized the president's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" showing hints that the breakup might not have been so amicable.

The two have now engaged in a public back-and-forth, with Musk saying that President Trump did not release the Epstein files because he was mentioned in them.

While the real reason the two no longer get along has not been revealed, and may never be, there has been speculation that the president's cutting of the EV Mandate is one reason.

What is the 'EV Mandate'?

The electric vehicle ""mandate"" isn't so much of a mandate as it is a goal set by the Biden administration to ramp up the development and purchases of electric cars to phase out vehicles that use fossil fuels eventually.

One of President Trump's first moves in office was to reverse the Biden administration's decision.

Between the reversal and other incentives like up to $7,500 worth of tax credits for electric vehicle purchases being at risk, Tesla and Musk could stand to lose from further anti-EV moves.

This year, state lawmakers passed over 1,200 bills. Among them were several important pieces of legislation focused on energy and the environment. Barring a veto from Gov. Greg Abbott, these will soon become law in Texas.

Here’s a breakdown of some of those measures.

A push for water security and wildfire resilience

Abbott opened this year’s legislative session by naming water as one of his top priorities.

“We will make the largest investment in water in the history of Texas,” said Abbott in his State of the State address. “We will tap into new water supplies and repair pipes to save billions of gallons of water each year.”

The numbers back up the need: According to the Texas Water Development Board, groundwater availability is expected to drop by 25% by 2070. Supply will be decreasing even as demand is expected to double – possibly much sooner.

Across the Texas Plains and Panhandle, farmers rely heavily on groundwater for irrigation, putting enormous pressure on the state’s aquifers. But that’s also changing in Texas.

“Our municipal demand is steadily increasing and will surpass the irrigation,” said L’Oreal Stepney, chairwoman for the Texas Water Development Board, before lawmakers earlier in the session.

“Municipal is going to be the number one user, and it’ll be here before we know it,” she added.

A new bill, Senate Bill 7, would pump $1 billion each year into the Texas Water Fund. The money will go toward developing new water sources and shoring up old infrastructure — a lifeline for both farmers and growing cities.

Meanwhile, the Panhandle, still reeling from the state’s largest-ever wildfire last year, saw movement on another front. Lawmakers passed SB 34, aimed at strengthening rural firefighting capacity — most of which relies on volunteers. The bill boosts potential grant funding and support for those departments.

Both the water and wildfire bills are now on Gov. Abbott’s desk.

Lawmakers say no to renewable energy limits – but yes to grid investment

One of the big questions this session: would Texas put the brakes on renewable energy?

Proposals like Senate Bill 715 and Senate Bill 388 sought to limit the growth of wind and solar – or at least make them more expensive to develop. Supporters argued that would help stabilize the grid. Critics warned it would only drive up costs.

In a rare alliance, environmental, business and renewable energy groups pushed back and both bills failed. Bryn Baker, senior policy director for Texas Energy Buyers Alliance, was among those leading the opposition.

“This is about cost and reliability. Full stop. And if you’re talking about making things more expensive – you’ve got a whole bunch of folks interested and concerned,” Baker said.

Instead, lawmakers approved a major expansion of the Texas Energy Fund: $5 billion more to help build new power plants and fund grid resilience projects.

Keeping chemical storage away from homes

Texas lawmakers have approved a ban on certain types of outdoor chemical storage facilities being located close to homes, a response to an Odessa-area industrial fire nearly a year ago that allegedly filled a neighborhood with “black sludge.”

State Rep. Brooks Landgraf (R-Odessa) proposed the ban after the massive fire in July 2024 at Permian Basin Containers, a facility where a mix of oil industry-related chemicals and liquids were stored in stacked piles of large plastic tubs.

People living right next door to the facility said in a resulting lawsuit that the fire flooded their neighborhood with a mysterious sludge that seeped into homes and cars. The neighbors also reported a strong, noxious odor in the wake of the fire. Landgraf also raised concerns about the potential for groundwater contamination from the incident.

Landgraf’s legislation, House Bill 3866, was sent to the governor’s desk in the final days of the state’s 2025 legislative session. It creates a ban on “intermediate bulk container recycling” facilities being located within 2,000 feet of a private residence.

Key to this agenda is the approval of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities across Gulf Coast communities that are disproportionately Black, Brown, and low-income, long treated as expendable “sacrifice zones” by the fossil fuel industry.

Just recently, on May 23, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reauthorized the massive CP2 LNG in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which will be the biggest LNG export facility in the U.S.

Local organizers and climate groups have been fighting the expansion of these “methane export facilities” which they say will intensify climate chaos and environmental racism. To try to halt them, they’re focusing on key actors behind these fossil fuel projects: the big financiers and insurers whose services these projects need in order to gain regulatory approval and to be built and operated.

A new report by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) maps out the known insurers of the buildout of LNG export facilities in Southwest Louisiana and discusses the numerous financial and reputational risks these companies face in propping up an industry tied to a volatile market fueling climate crisis and threatening local communities.

“They’re financing and insuring environmental racism because these projects are overwhelmingly situated in Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities they feel are the path of least resistance,” Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project in Lake Charles, Louisiana, told Truthout.

Gulf Coast “Sacrifice Zones”

U.S. exports of LNG, or fracked gas that has been cooled into liquid to ship, have boomed over the past decade. LNG has been promoted by the fossil fuel industry as a cleaner “bridge fuel” toward renewable energy, a debunked claim that some view as a form of greenwashing. The production, transport, processing, and burning of fracked gas releases large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

The U.S. is the world’s top exporter of fracked gas. In recent years, the fossil fuel industry and its Wall Street investors have sought to expand U.S. LNG export facilities. Immediately after his January 2025 inauguration, Donald Trump restarted applications for new LNG export terminals that were paused by Joe Biden a year earlier.

The epicenter of the buildout has been the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast, where there are currently around two dozen LNG expansion projects being constructed or proposed. These facilities are located in places like Port Arthur, Texas, and Cameron Parish, Louisiana, communities that are overwhelmingly Black, Brown, and low-income, and where clusters of toxic refining and petrochemical plants have long operated.

The United Nations has called areas like these “sacrifice zones,” defined as “extremely contaminated areas where vulnerable and marginalized groups bear a disproportionate burden of the health, human rights and environmental consequences of exposure to pollution and hazardous substances.” Research shows that local Black, Brown, and Indigenous workers do not benefit equitably from the jobs and other economic benefits the fossil fuel industry often promises when building new facilities.

A 2024 Greenpeace report found that the building of planned LNG projects would result annually in 149 premature deaths and $2.33 billion in health costs, with areas in Southwest Louisiana “slated to suffer the worst air pollution impacts per capita” and with air pollution from LNG terminals disproportionately affecting Black and Brown residents.

Environmental Racism and Climate Crisis

According to a new report by RAN, over 20 additional LNG expansion projects have been proposed in the Gulf Coast region in addition to six existing export terminals. These enormous projects have names like Sabine Pass LNG, Cameron LNG, and Calcasieu Pass LNG. Their corporate backers include Sempra, Energy Transfer, Cheniere, Kimmeridge, and Venture Global.

These facilities, however, are far from uncontested, facing major opposition from community organizers like Roishetta Ozane.

A mother of six who lives just outside Lake Charles, Louisiana, Ozane founded the Vessel Project in 2020 amid her efforts to help the community respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and displacement from Hurricanes Laura and Delta. The Vessel Project uses mutual aid to build community and create the conditions for sustained organizing for environmental justice.

“We make sure that people’s immediate needs are met before we talk about stopping an LNG facility,” she told Truthout. “That way, we’ve been able to grow our base of community members who show up at meetings and town halls and who travel with us to D.C. or New York City.”

Ozane spoke of the environmental and health fallouts her community has suffered living “right in the midst of a mixture of industries,” including explosions, fires, and smoke clouds at petrochemical plants, with consequences for her own family. “We get all the cumulative impacts living in a fenceline community,” she said. “My children have asthma and eczema. My son has epilepsy, which I believe was exacerbated by the pollution from the facilities.”

As Ozane responded to crisis after crisis, she started making connections between the environmental racism and extreme weather her community experienced and the wider climate crisis tied to local industries. “I was trying to connect the dots for people,” she said. “All of these facilities are releasing gas into the air, and it’s what’s warming our planet. It’s what’s causing these storms to be more severe.”

Going After the Insurers

Organizing to halt the buildout of LNG export facilities and other fossil fuel infrastructure has led Ozane and others toward a concerted strategy: pressuring big financiers and insurers to stop propping up these projects.

“The banks and the insurance companies are the ones actually supporting the fossil fuel industry behind the scenes,” Ruth Breech of RAN, and a coauthor of the RAN report, told Truthout.

The past decade has seen the climate and environmental justice movement target the money behind the fossil fuel industry, such as banks JPMorgan and Citi, asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and insurers like AIG and Liberty Mutual. While ExxonMobil or Chevron may cling to its core business of oil and gas production, these financial firms are more diversified, risk-averse and susceptible to public shaming.

“If our elected officials are going to approve these projects, then our hope lies in the banks and the investors and the insurance companies,” said Ozane.

Ozane co-leads the Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub, a coalition aimed at bringing pressure from local communities to bear on these financial giants. “We bring frontline folks in front of these banks and insurance companies to say you’re insuring and financing environmental racism,” she said.

More than any other financial backers, insurance corporations may be most vulnerable around fossil fuels, since climate chaos presents an existential threat to the industry’s business model.

The RAN report, which the Vessel Project and Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub signed onto, maps out some of the known insurers, based on information from FOIA requests and lawsuit filings, behind Southwest Louisiana’s LNG export buildout. For example, insurers behind Cameron LNG include Chubb, AIG, Allianz, Liberty Mutual, Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich, Tokio Marine, The Hartford, and others, according to RAN.

The report highlights the significant risks for insurers in underwriting the Gulf Coast LNG buildout, including financial instability tied to regulatory and construction delays and the problem of oversupply and overcapacity with these facilities. Multiple reports warn that U.S. shale production is facing decline in prices and market volatility.

The report also notes the reputational and financial risks to insurers that prop up an industry that perpetuates harmful health impacts, safety hazards, climate risks, and disruptions to local ecosystems. LNG export facilities have been plagued by thousands of permit violations and extensive operational problems and accidents, with one of the most infamous being a 2022 explosion and fire at Freeport LNG that led to an eight-month shutdown.

“They Know Me by Name”

Both Breech and Ozane emphasized the hypocrisy behind the insurance industry’s continued underwriting of fossil fuels. “We’re seeing people across the nation lose their home insurance coverage because of the impacts of climate change,” said Breech. “Then we’re seeing these insurance companies continue to provide insurance for new fossil fuel projects.”

Ozane said it’s frustrating to see insurers prop up an industry in her community that is driving the very climate chaos that’s making home insurance in Louisiana unaffordable. “For insurance companies to insure one of these climate monsters, and then turn around and not insure the people who live in the communities at a reasonable rate, is outright wrong,” she said.

For RAN and the Vessel Project, the global insurance powerhouse Chubb has been a key focus. Breech says Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg is “an influencer personality” within the insurance industry, similar to JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon in banking. Chubb has also been open to engaging with community members. Ozane has met with representatives from Chubb several times, bringing her children to the meetings. “They know me by name,” she says.

In 2024, Chubb reported dropping 32 major oil and gas clients who didn’t meet its methane emissions standards. Chubb has dropped its coverage of the Rio Grande LNG, a proposed LNG export terminal in Brownsville, Texas, and it ruled out insuring the East African Crude Oil Pipeline. As recently reported by Inside Climate News, Chubb also dropped its coverage of Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG.

But for organizers like Ozane, Chubb isn’t going far enough. She wants them to rule out insuring another LNG export terminal, Venture Global’s huge CP2, which just received FERC approval. Ozane told Truthout that she’s currently trying to arrange a “toxic tour” for FERC so the commission can see the cumulative impacts of the fossil fuel industry on her community.

According to the Sierra Club LNG Export Tracker, CP2’s annual emissions will be the equivalent of 54 coal burning power plants once two phases of expansion are completed.

CP2’s insurers are currently unknown, RAN reports.

“If you’re insuring this project, you’re ensuring this community’s destruction,” Ozane said. “It would be easy for Chubb to say, if CP2 gets all of its permits, we’re not going to insure them.”

Truthout contacted Chubb to ask if the company was insuring CP2, and also if its decision to drop coverage of Calcasieu Pass LNG could mean Chubb would decide to not insure CP2, but received no response.

RAN told Truthout that it’s demanding Chubb drop its coverage of Cameron LNG by June and Freeport LNG by October, and that it stops insuring all “methane terminals.”

Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg took in $82 million in total compensation between 2022 and 2024. By contrast, the per capita income in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is $35,847, with a poverty rate of 23.2 percent, according to census data.

“We Can’t Take Anymore”

The RAN report demands that banks and insurers stop supporting fossil fuel expansion projects. It also demands that banks and insurance companies “follow a human rights due diligence framework” and consult with community leaders and organizations from municipalities and parishes where LNG export facilities are being sited to identify and assess human rights risks, and for these companies to do their own site visits to conduct human rights, environmental and environmental justice assessments.

“We’re talking about serious human rights implications in these projects,” said Breech. “Southwest Louisiana is not an energy sacrifice zone, and it’s not acceptable to have all of these proposals in this area.”

With hurricane season approaching, Ozane stresses the urgency of halting the LNG export buildout that’s blanketing her community. She is hosting a hurricane preparedness festival highlighting the intersection of fossil fuel pollution and climate-induced disasters.

Truthout asked Ozane what she would say to Chubb CEO Evan Greenberg if she could speak directly to him.

“I would say that if you insure CP2 you are insuring the death of my children and my community,” she said. “We are already suffering from the pollution that’s coming from the surrounding facilities. We can’t take anymore.”

Truthout also asked Ozane what victory would ultimately look like for her.

(AP) — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule Friday that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks were illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden’s target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department’s memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,” Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months. Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons (265 billion liters) of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy’s announcement “a positive development” that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department’s action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. Manufacturers whose vehicles exceed the standards earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers.",https://thebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/D8zIuMCVUAAjQ7R.jpg-large-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:09:38.301614

But that’s down from 79% support in 2020.

Democratic support for those renewable energy options is only slightly down from five years ago, 86% compared to 91% in 2020.

Republican support over the last five years has increased for offshore drilling, fracking and coal mining.

Both Republicans and Democrats are more in favor of nuclear power now than they were five years ago.

Should energy be a partisan issue?

“No, energy policy is strictly nonpartisan. It's all about cost and benefits,” University of Houston energy economist said.

But Rice University energy economist said energy tends to get politicized, even though it doesn’t need to be that way.

“In the end, however, individuals want affordability, reliability, and environmental sensibility ... to all matter,” said Medlock, calling those factors “three legs of a stool.”

Politicians will pick a leg of the stool to focus on based on their constituency, Medlock said.

But energy policy should recognize the trade-offs that exist with various energy sources.

And he said wind, solar, oil, natural gas and coal all have a role to play in giving the country a balanced and diverse portfolio.

“Policy must find a way to successfully manage that balancing act,” he said via email.

, the Political Management program director at George Washington University, said support for renewable energy has long been tied to concerns about global warming and climate change.

“If you believe the science, then it becomes imperative to take ... action,” Belt said via email. “It’s hard to admit that the world is facing disasters and not to support a remedy. Conservatives’ faith in science has been decreasing, especially since COVID.”

Belt said Biden’s legislation promoting renewable energy made the topic more salient for Republicans.

“One way to stimulate the base of one party is through disdain for what the other party promotes,” Belt said.

Medlock said geography also matters, not just political affiliation.

“When jobs are connected to activities and infrastructure, that tends to have a larger impact than political affiliation,” he said. “There is evidence that blue districts in energy rich locations also tend to have a more favorable view of oil and gas.”

Hirs said energy decisions are driven by consumers and by regulators, and one size doesn't fit all.

The electric grid that powers people's homes and businesses isn’t a national enterprise, he said.

The grid varies from state to state.

That grid can be powered by natural gas, coal, nuclear, wind and solar.

Natural gas is the leading source now.

But Hirs said he expects solar to eventually win out, because it’s the low-cost option.

Political forces aside, he said the economics always matter most.

“There's a 1.3-gigawatt solar plant going in north of Dallas on 18,000 acres,” Hirs said. “It's going to have 12 full-time employees, and I think half of those are shepherds. For the same size nuclear power station, 1.3 gigawatts, we're talking about 500 employees. And, of course, there's a cost of fuel. The coal power plants, the natural gas power plants, obviously are somewhere in between. Plus, they have a cost of fuel. Economists will tell you that the low marginal cost supply will eventually dominate. That would mean a solar farm. But without adequate batteries and supporting backup, we’re not going to get there for five to 10 years. It's going to require a significant build-out. And this is not a partisan issue. It relates really to the way we've constructed electricity markets across the United States.”

Meanwhile, Hirs said both gas-powered cars and electric cars can make sense for different people based on the costs to operate.

Electric cars cost more to buy, so a customer might have to drive for five to seven years before they start saving money on a battery-powered vehicle.

Hirs said Americans will need more power in the coming years, and they’ll want the cheapest options they can get.

“We need more for this grid,” he said. “Our demand is going up, and it's not because of EVs. It's because we have electrification of darn near everything in the house, everything in manufacturing facilities.”",https://cbsaustin.com/resources/media2/16x9/8667/986/0x447/90/7d965791-04cb-4cd9-9ae7-10ad994bd245-GettyImages2209279303.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:10:52.121685

While the bill has little chance of advancing in the Senate in its current form, its proposed cuts offer a window into shifting political priorities and could have significant implications for the U.S. clean energy manufacturing sector.

Subtitle C of the bill, titled “Make America Win Again,” proposes to sunset, repeal, or restrict nearly every major clean energy tax credit under the IRA. Among those affected are credits for clean vehicle purchases (Section 25E), commercial clean vehicles (Section 45W), alternative refueling infrastructure (Section 30C), residential energy efficiency improvements (Sections 25C and 25D), new energy efficient homes (Section 45L), and advanced manufacturing (Section 45X).

For manufacturers, the most potentially damaging proposals are those that target the clean electricity production and investment credits under Sections 45Y and 48E, and the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X. The bill would not only accelerate the phase-out dates for these credits but would also impose new restrictions on facilities and companies that receive any form of “material assistance” from so-called “prohibited foreign entities,” including entities with even minor Chinese ownership or influence.

These foreign entity provisions mirror similar restrictions proposed in standalone legislation like the BIOSECURE Act, which passed in the House, but stalled in the Senate, and represent an aggressive policy shift toward economic decoupling. The expansive definitions of foreign influence and the scope of the restrictions in the BBB could have a chilling effect on clean energy investment, particularly in sectors like solar panel and electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturing, where global supply chains are deeply interconnected.

While reducing “dependence on foreign countries” is an easy political statement with bipartisan appeal, the interconnected economic ties developed over past decades have made it literally impossible to reverse in the near term, if ever. The statements by (and actions of) Apple regarding manufacturing of iPhones is but one example. Many industries have similar “impossible” to recreate supply chains, as intentional global interconnectedness has been part of U.S. trade and foreign policy. Closer to home, proposed tariff policies for the auto and other industries threaten to upset foreign relations with Mexico and Canada (even though current trade provisions with our North American neighbors were negotiated under the first Trump term).

In addition to severing incentives for manufacturers with foreign ties, the BBB repeals the ability to transfer clean energy tax credits under IRA Section 6418 — a key tool for helping smaller developers and manufacturers monetize credits and attract financing.

The BBB has sparked pushback from industry stakeholders, including Elon Musk, who argue that the IRA’s tax credits have spurred historic levels of clean energy investment and domestic manufacturing. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, over $120 billion in new manufacturing investments have been announced since the IRA’s passage. The proposed repeals and restrictions could significantly undercut that momentum.

Although the BBB is unlikely to become law in its current form, its provisions could resurface in future negotiations or budget bills. Industry participants should monitor legislative developments closely and consider how foreign ownership structures, supply chain dependencies, and tax credit planning may need to adapt to an evolving policy landscape.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/cap02-scaled-e1748988944221.jpg,N,,2025-06-07 06:03:15.833352

The unusual criticism of their own bill indicates a modicum of regret by the GOP lawmakers, whose votes were critical to the bill passing the House by a narrow margin last month.

“While we were proud to have worked to ensure that the bill did not include a full repeal of the clean energy tax credits, we remain deeply concerned by several provisions,” said the Republicans in the letter, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va.

They cited provisions that “abruptly terminate several credits just 60 days after enactment for projects that have not yet begun construction,” and “restrictions to transferability.”

“This approach jeopardizes ongoing development, discourages long-term investment, and could significantly delay or cancel energy infrastructure projects across the country,” the group of House Republicans said in criticizing the legislation they voted for, while suggesting some changes to “mitigate” the harm it could cause.

Kiggans, like most of the signatories, represents a competitive district that Democrats are targeting in the 2026 election. Other politically vulnerable members include: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.; Juan Ciscomani, R-Ariz.; Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.; Don Bacon, R-Neb.; Gabe Evans, R-Colo.; Young Kim, R-Calif.; David Valadao, R-Calif.; Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa.; and Tom Kean, R-N.J.

The remaining three, who sit comparably safer seats, are Reps. Mark Amodei, R-Nev.; Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y.; and Nick LaLota, R-N.Y.

The 13 Republicans warned that “the House-passed bill includes a phase out schedule for credits that would cause significant disruption to projects under development and stop investments needed to win the global energy race.”

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee mocked the letter and said the lawmakers will own their votes for the bill.

“These 13 Republicans promised not to support cuts to clean energy tax credits, then cast the deciding votes to raise energy costs on American families, kill tens of thousands of jobs, and undermine our nation’s energy security. They are responsible for this Big, Ugly Bill and all the harm it will cause,” DCCC spokesperson Viet Shelton said. “This toothless letter is the worst kind of political hypocrisy and voters will see it for what it is, a lie perpetrated by endangered House Republicans who caved to their D.C. party bosses at the expense of the American people.”

Kiggans' office did not immediately return a request for comment on whether she was aware of the provisions when supporting the bill, or if she'd vote for one that falls short of her new demands.

Senate Republicans are eying changes to the House bill to ease some of the negative impacts of the funding cuts.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, told NBC News her version of the bill will probably relax some of the deadlines to cut off funding.

But she said Thursday that there probably won’t be massive changes to the House-passed bill.

“I imagine it’s going to track fairly similarly, but I think some of the deadlines are pretty tight in terms of when you have to have construction and those things,” Capito said. “We’ve been approached by several employers who need some of those tax.”

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he’s willing to undo some of the clean energy funding, but he wants to make sure that existing business investments aren’t harmed by the bill.

“What we’re trying to focus on is to make sure that if businesses have invested and have projects in progress, that we do everything we can to hold them harmless,” he said. “Whether or not we continue some of these programs out into the future — that’s a separate question that I’m willing to entertain.”

Meanwhile, the conservative group Club For Growth is running ads targeting Sens. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., John Curtis, R-Utah, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for backing more modest rollbacks of the clean energy funding, which carries benefits for their states.

There's another reason changing the bill is easier said than done: The speedy cuts to clean energy funding under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act were part of an House agreement to win the votes of conservative hardliners who want to reduce the bill’s red ink.

House Republicans have a majority of 220 to 212, meaning they can only spare three “no” votes in their ranks to pass the bill when the Senate sends back their revised version.

“You backslide one inch on those IRA subsidies and I’m voting against this bill,” Rep.

Wind, solar and battery storage plants were expected to provide 93% of the new power coming online this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But the bill could shorten the window that consumers and manufacturers have to use federal tax credits. The potential added expense sent many clean energy stocks plummeting.

Paul Dickson, president of San Francisco-based Sunrun -- the largest domestic solar panel installer in the country -- pointed to booming job growth in the solar industry and recent efforts to onshore manufacturing back to the U.S.

""A quick and swift and abrupt change doesn't give you the runway to be able to accomplish that. And so, you know, overnight you'd probably see a quarter million jobs in the in the solar industry go away,"" Dickson said.

Many observers are hoping for changes in the Senate version of the plan. But in its current form, Nuclear Energy is the only sector to have its tax credits fully preserved.

The public feud between Trump and his once-allied Elon Musk fueled a litany of reactions on social media. The split has also raised other questions: Where does Tesla and the electric vehicle market stand?

What happened between Elon Musk and Donald Trump?

Despite Trump's constant praise of Musk as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or Doge, Musk announced in early May that he would be stepping back from the job.

In late May, the Tesla CEO criticized the president's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" showing hints that the breakup might not have been so amicable.

The two have now engaged in a public back-and-forth, with Musk saying that President Trump did not release the Epstein files because he was mentioned in them.

While the real reason the two no longer get along has not been revealed, and may never be, there has been speculation that the president's cutting of the EV Mandate is one reason.

What is the 'EV Mandate'?

The electric vehicle ""mandate"" isn't so much of a mandate as it is a goal set by the Biden administration to ramp up the development and purchases of electric cars to phase out vehicles that use fossil fuels eventually.

One of President Trump's first moves in office was to reverse the Biden administration's decision.

Between the reversal and other incentives like up to $7,500 worth of tax credits for electric vehicle purchases being at risk, Tesla and Musk could stand to lose from further anti-EV moves.

Associated Press

DETROIT (AP) — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a rule Friday that Biden-era fuel economy standards for gas-powered cars and trucks are illegal and moved to reverse them, paving the way for a likely reset of rules.

Combined with Senate language in the pending budget bill to eliminate penalties for exceeding standards regulating how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel, automakers moving forward could come under less pressure from regulators to reduce their pollution. Ultimately, the nation’s use of electric vehicles could be slowed.

The moves align with the Trump administration's ongoing efforts to slash federal support for EVs. President Donald Trump has pledged to end what he has called an EV “mandate,” referring incorrectly to former President Joe Biden's target for half of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. EVs do not use gasoline or emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.

No federal policy has required auto companies to sell — or car buyers to purchase — EVs, although California and other states have imposed rules requiring that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state to be zero-emission by 2035.

When he was in office, Biden imposed increasingly stringent emissions standards for cars and trucks. He included use of EVs in calculating the rules — an inclusion the Trump administration and the auto industry have argued was illegal and raised the bar too high for automakers to meet.

The Transportation Department's memorandum Friday said the previous administration “ignored statutory requirements” that barred consideration of EVs when setting standards.

“We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States,"" Duffy said.

The revised rule does not itself change existing standards, but it empowers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to make adjustments in coming months. Duffy put pressure on the federal agency earlier this year to reverse the fuel economy rules as soon as possible.

Under the Biden administration, automakers were required to average about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon of gas by 2031 — up from about 39 miles (63 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles today — in an effort to save almost 70 billion gallons (265 billion liters) of gasoline through 2050.

The rules, finalized in 2024, increased fuel economy 2% per year for passenger cars in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% each year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031.

Mileage rules — in place since the 1970s energy crisis — work alongside the EPA limits on vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the largest source of the nation’s planet-warming emissions, and cars and trucks make up more than half of those.

In recent years, automakers have been manufacturing gasoline-fueled cars that are more efficient and get higher mileage.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents automakers, called Duffy's announcement “a positive development"" that adds “important clarity” to federal mileage rules.

The Biden-era standards “were ‘improperly predicated’ on alternative fuel vehicles,” said John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO.

But Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All program, said the Transportation Department's action will increase costs for Americans and increase pollution.

“Making our vehicles less fuel-efficient hurts families by forcing them to pay more at the pump,” she said. “It will lead to fewer clean-vehicle options for consumers, squeeze our wallets, endanger our health and increase climate pollution.”

Meanwhile, Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee added proposed language to the pending budget bill Thursday that would remove fines penalizing automakers that don’t meet fuel economy standards with their gas-powered vehicles.

Automakers can buy regulatory credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don't rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

The memo and bill text landed this week as Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump engage in a public spat online, with Trump suggesting that Musk “only developed a problem” with his budget bill because it rolls back tax credits for EVs. Musk disputes that.

,American Energy,2025-06-06 21:36:56+00:00,Planet Detroit,Can Trump's order to keep a Michigan coal plant open be stopped? - Planet Detroit,Brian Allnutt,,,,,https://planetdetroit.org/2025/06/trump-administration-michigan-coal-plant/,"A Department of Energy memorandum from May 23, the same day the Campbell order was issued, highlights the challenges of keeping the plant open.
This represents roughly 16% of the Michigan energy sector’s total emissions.
Trump’s order to keep the plant open is “unprecedented” and based on a “fabricated emergency,” Nessel said at the Mackinac Policy Conference last month, The Detroit News reported.
Keeping the 63-year-old Campbell power plant open could prove expensive, with the cost potentially falling on Consumers ratepayers.
It’s unclear whether the cost of keeping the West Michigan coal plant alive will ultimately be spread across the region.","The Trump administration’s order on May 23 to keep Consumers Energy’s Campbell coal-fired power plant online coincides with similar calls to prolong the lifespan of DTE Energy’s Monroe plant southwest of Detroit.

“Monroe is twice the size of Campbell,” State Rep. Dave Prestin (R-Cedar River) told Politico’s E&E News, saying he would be “very, very upset” if the facility, slated to fully close in 2032, were torn down.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright cited an energy “emergency” in his order to keep the Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan which was set to retire May 31, open for 90 days.

Michigan regulators and environmental advocates say the move is unnecessary and that keeping an old plant operating will mean steep costs for ratepayers while generating harmful air pollution and planet-warming emissions.

A Department of Energy memorandum from May 23, the same day the Campbell order was issued, highlights the challenges of keeping the plant open.

“Past the planned retirement date of May 31, Consumers has ended its contracts for coal procurement, coal delivery, and power plant staffing and may face challenges with addressing these issues on short notice,” the memo says.

“The order provides reasonable last-minute contract extensions for fuel and operations, if feasible.”

The memo, which is labeled as privileged and controlled unclassified information, was briefly posted publicly on the DOE website and then taken down, according to the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group that advocates for clean energy and that posted the memo on its site.

Trump’s coal order creates precedent: Sierra Club organizer

Pollution from the Campbell plant causes an estimated 44 deaths per year and the facility produces over 9 million tons of carbon emissions annually, according to the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force. This represents roughly 16% of the Michigan energy sector’s total emissions.

The group found that DTE’s Monroe plant is responsible for an estimated 38 deaths annually as well as more than 16 million tons of carbon emissions, or 29% of Michigan’s energy sector emissions.

The group uses the EPA’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment screening model to calculate its mortality estimates.

Although the final units at DTE’s Monroe plant aren’t due to suspend operations until 2028 and 2032, Byran Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer for the Sierra Club, said the Campbell plant order creates a precedent for similar actions with other facilities. He noted President Donald Trump has expressed a general desire to keep coal plants online.

For example, the Trump administration issued executive orders in April to stop the enforcement of state climate laws, repeal regulations that “discriminate” against coal production, waive pollution restrictions for coal plants, and develop a process for using emergency powers to prevent coal plant retirements.

DTE spokesperson Cynthia Hecht said the company still plans to retire Monroe’s remaining coal units in 2028 and 2032.

Michigan regulators are looking to reduce costs for Consumers ratepayers by having the Campbell plant’s operating expenses spread across the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s territory. MISO is the regional grid operator covering most of Michigan, 14 other states, and part of Canada.

Environmental groups, regulators, and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel could also intervene to reverse the Campbell decision.

Trump’s order to keep the plant open is “unprecedented” and based on a “fabricated emergency,” Nessel said at the Mackinac Policy Conference last month, The Detroit News reported.

Department of Energy spokesperson Ben Dietderich said the administration is committed to “ensuring Americans have access to reliable, affordable, and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows.”

The planned retirements of both the Campbell and Monroe facilities were the result of negotiated settlements among the utilities, environmental groups, ratepayer advocates and other organizations, overseen by the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Shannon Fisk, director of state electric sector advocacy for the environmental legal group Earthjustice, said the Trump administration is trying to override this decision-making process and turn itself into a local energy planner.

“A lot of this is just an ideological agenda to prop up coal and is disconnected from any actual reliability and resource adequacy issues.”

How Nessel, others could challenge Trump’s emergency order

The attorney general could fight the order to keep the Campbell plant open either in her role as a consumer advocate or as a representative of the state, Fisk said.

If Nessel were to petition the Department of Energy for a rehearing of the Campbell decision, Fisk said the attorney general could do so on the grounds that no energy emergency exists, or that the federal agency interfered beyond its authority. He added that Nessel could make the case that, even if there is an energy emergency, it’s “clearly arbitrary” to use an old coal plant to address it.

The attorney general’s office did not respond to Planet Detroit’s request for comment.

In contrast to the administration’s stance around an energy shortfall, MISO indicated in an April press release that “adequate resources are available to maintain reliability” for the period from June 2025-May 2026.

Dietderich, with DOE, cited the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability’s 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment as proof that more baseload power is needed. The assessment finds MISO is at “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand.”

Fisk said other parties to the Campbell settlement could also petition the Department of Energy, including environmental organizations and the MPSC.

When asked whether the MPSC would petition the DOE, commission spokesperson Matt Helms said: “we are still reviewing options.”

MPSC Chair Dan Scripps previously told Politico’s E&E News he would work with MISO and Consumers to comply with the DOE order. He criticized the order as unnecessary and expensive.

“I think it’s a difficult case to make that there is, in fact, this local energy need that can only be met through the extension of that plant,” he told the publication.

Who will pay to keep Campbell online?

Keeping the 63-year-old Campbell power plant open could prove expensive, with the cost potentially falling on Consumers ratepayers.

Closing the plant was projected to save these customers $600 million by 2040, according to the company. Its rushed reopening means the company will now pay market prices for coal rather than securing lower prices through contracts, according to Sierra Club’s Smigielski.

Nationally, coal has declined steeply as a power generation source over the last several decades as aging coal plants have struggled to compete with cheaper natural gas and renewable energy generation.

It’s unclear whether the cost of keeping the West Michigan coal plant alive will ultimately be spread across the region.

Helms, with the MPSC, said the commission would “pursue having costs spread across MISO.”

Consumers spokesperson Brian Wheeler told Planet Detroit: “The company is actively working to determine appropriate cost recovery consistent with applicable law and the federal order.”

To capture the expense of operating the Campbell plant this summer as well as health and environmental costs, the Sierra Club’s Smigielski said the MPSC should order a cost assessment for the facility.

“What that’s going to do is show … people spent a lot of money, a lot of extra pollution was poured into the air in the water, and there was no material gain from this,” he said, arguing this information could be used to make the case against coal.

Efforts to keep coal plants open could become even more harmful if the Environmental Protection Agency is able to successfully roll back standards for power plant emissions, which EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin pitched in March, Smigielski said.

This would mean subjecting people to “the kind of horrifically bad coal from 10 (or) 15 years ago that puts us all in even worse danger.”

The order keeping the Campbell plant open is limited to 90 days. But Fisk, with Earthjustice, said the administration could renew the order when it ends or issue a different order.

“It’s a real concern that this would become a perpetual thing.”

Alef prepares first “true” electric flying car for launch

San Mateo-based Alef Aeronautics has been developing flying cars for about a decade, but now it’s ready to bring them to life.

The company unveiled its first prototype, the “Model A,” in October 2022, claiming that the electric flying car can travel up to 220 miles with a 110-mile flight range.

After kicking off pre-orders the same month, the Model A secured 440 reservations by the end of the year. According to the company’s latest update, the flying car has now secured over 3,400 pre-orders, valued at around $1 billion in total.

The orders include businesses and individuals, including a car dealership in California. Alef became the first company to sell a modern aircraft through a car dealership with pre-orders.

You can reserve a spot in the “regular” queue for $150, or $1,500 for the “priority” waiting list. Alef has begun pre-production at its facility in Silicon Valley and expects to start producing customer models soon.

“If everything goes according to plan, and no major external changes, Alef plans to start production of the first vehicle by the end of 2025 or Q1 of 2026,” the company said (via KTVU), with deliveries set to follow.

Alef says the Model A is the first road-legal passenger car that can also take off and land. The company even claims that “On average, the Alef flying car uses less energy per trip than a Tesla or any other EV.”

Since the Model A is classified as “ultralight,” it doesn’t require a certification to fly on roads legally, Alef told KTVU. It does have other restrictions, however, including the ability to fly only during the day and limited flying zones. Ultralight vehicles can not fly over densely populated areas.

We got a sneak peek of the electric flying car in action for the first time earlier this year. Alef released a video of the flying car hopping over another vehicle on a public street in California.

It looked fake, but Alef promises it was the “first-ever video in history of a car driving and vertically taking off.” Other flying cars have appeared in videos with tethered flights and other gimmicks to make it seem like they’re actually in flight.

The Model A starts at $300,000, but Alef says costs “should drop down drastically,” adding “eventually below levels of Toyota Corolla or Ford Focus.”

Production and manufacturing costs are initially high due to the “hand-made in-house level,” the company explained.

The startup secured a mass manufacturing agreement with PUCARA Aero and MYC for aviation-grade parts last year, which supplies industry leaders such as Boeing and Airbus.

Alef’s flying cars underwent a “major technical update” this week, with more details to follow soon. Following the Model A, Alef is already working on its second flying car, the Model Z, which is expected to be priced closer to $35,000. However, it could be a while before we see it with an expected 2035 launch.

Under the so-called Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program (CAFE), the Biden Administration included electric vehicles (EVs) in calculating fuel economy regulations.

Now the Trump Administration published a ‘Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program’ rule, in which it declared that the Biden-era rule and rule-making exceeded legal authority.

Last month, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had submitted the interpretive rule for review.

“This is a key step towards reversing the prior administration’s illegal interpretation of CAFE standards that made cars more expensive for working class families,” DOT said in May.

“The Biden-Buttigieg administration illegally used CAFE standards as a backdoor electric vehicle mandate – driving the price of cars up,” Secretary Duffy said in a statement.

In an executive order on Day One, President Trump said that the Administration’s policy will be aimed at eliminating the “electric vehicle (EV) mandate” and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access.”

The Trump Administration is also considering “the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable.”

Republican lawmakers have been calling for more than a year for the withdrawal of the so-called EV mandate.

“NHTSA’s proposed standards, when coupled with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) distinct, extreme tailpipe emissions proposal, amount to a de facto mandate for electric vehicles (EVs) that threatens to raise costs and restrict consumer choice, harm U.S. businesses, degrade our energy and national security and hand the keys of our automotive industry over to our adversaries, especially China,” more than 120 lawmakers wrote in January last year.

Zeldin appeared before Congress four times in two weeks recently to field questions from both sides of the aisle about the agency’s proposed FY 2026 budget, which would cut the EPA’s funding by 55%. The proposal radically dismantles the State Revolving Fund, grants programs, Superfund cleanups and environmental justice programs, among other initiatives, all critical programs that safeguard human health and the environment.

While Zeldin touted a “Great American Comeback” in his testimonies before Congress, in reality he is driving our decline by proposing to defund the agency with no plan to maintain the essential services that it provides. The EPA impacts every American’s daily life by safeguarding air and water, responding to environmental emergencies, cleaning up contaminated sites, protecting the public from toxic chemicals and more. Cutting our agency’s funding by 55% isn’t just about cutting costs to reduce taxes, as Zeldin has touted; it puts American lives at risk.

It is notably perplexing how Zeldin can both promote cooperative federalism in his “Great American Comeback” initiative and, at the same time, propose an 89% cut for the State Revolving Fund program, which provides low-interest loans to states and local governments for critical water infrastructure projects. Cuts to the State Revolving Fund program threaten access to safe, clean water by stripping communities of funding to repair aging water infrastructure. Even during his testimony in the Senate, Zeldin’s claim that taxpayers voted for these cuts was expressly contradicted by expressions of concern from both sides of the aisle. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) rightly called the cuts “problematic” as states do not have any alternative funding source to address costly water infrastructure needs.

Zeldin also testified that he personally reviewed each of the 781 active, obligated EPA grant agreements that have now been canceled or are slated for termination as part of his effort to cut agency funding. These are grants, both big and small, that support counties, cities, states and local community groups.

Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) asked Zeldin about one particular grant for Georgia constituents that is part of the EPA’s Environment and Climate Justice block grant program. This grant would have provided a health clinic alongside upgrades to Thomasville, Georgia’s wastewater infrastructure. In response, Zeldin only suggested that when a new administration comes in, “it is going to apply its policy priorities to how that money is going to get spent.” Given that Zeldin personally reviewed all of the cancelled grants for supposedly problematic content, Sen. Ossoff, along with all Americans, deserves adequate explanations for why programs reviewed and approved by the agency suddenly require termination.

Eliminating grants in wholesale fashion is a danger to public health; it cuts support for local programs that monitor air and water quality, clean up pollution, and protect vulnerable communities. While it seems more likely that an AI-powered purity test searching for words such as “diversity,” “women” and “climate” flagged the agreements for termination, Americans must demand that Zeldin follow through on his promise to Congress to re-review the cancelled grants.

In his testimonies, Zeldin also championed expediting the chemical approval process at the EPA to allow private companies to profit from novel chemicals, undermining the agency’s duty to protect public health and directly contradicting the Trump administration’s own commission to “Make America Healthy Again.” This deregulatory push, paired with a 55% cut to the EPA’s budget, would severely limit the agency’s ability to research, monitor and regulate harmful substances like PFAS: “forever chemicals” now found worldwide and in 98% of human blood. Linked to cancer, cardiovascular disease and reproductive issues, PFAS represent a chemical crisis demanding more scientific scrutiny and enforcement, not less. As Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) warned, Zeldin’s legacy could well be one of increased cancer rates across America if this agenda continues unchecked.

Zeldin’s proposed budget would weaken the EPA and drastically reduce support for state and community programs. Taxpayers will ultimately foot the bill for such radical departures from scientifically backed environmental policies. Americans won’t only pay higher taxes and insurance premiums, but also live with elevated rates of disease and mortality.

Zeldin’s Great American Comeback will feature a return to rivers on fire, air thick with smog, and an America where many more of our citizens died from environmental harm. The reality is we cannot do more with less. Zeldin must back down from this drastic proposed cut to our agency’s budget and live up to his oath to protect human health and the environment.

South Carolina is investing heavily in electric vehicles.","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A Japanese company has halted construction on a $1.6 billion factory in South Carolina to help make batteries for electric BMWs, citing “policy and market uncertainty.”

While AESC didn’t specify what those problems are, South Carolina’s Republican governor said the company is dealing with the potential loss of federal tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and incentives for EV businesses as well as tariff uncertainties from President Donald Trump’s administration.

“What we’re doing is urging caution — let things play out because all of the these changes are taking place,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.

AESC announced the suspension in construction of its plant in Florence on Thursday,

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” the company’s statement said.

AESC promised to restart construction, although it didn’t say when, and vowed to meet its commitment to hire 1,600 workers and invest $1.6 billion. The company said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence plant.

The battery maker based in Japan also has facilities in China, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. In the U.S., AESC has a plant in Tennessee and is building one in Kentucky. The statement didn’t mention any changes with other plants.

The South Carolina plant is supposed to sell battery cells to BMW, which is building its own battery assembly site near its giant auto plant in Greer. BMW said the construction pause by AESC doesn’t change its plans to open its plant in 2026.

AESC has already rolled back its South Carolina plans. They announced a second factory on the Florence site, but then said earlier this year that their first plant should be able to handle BMW’s demand. That prompted South Carolina officials to withdraw $111 million in help they planned to provide.

The company is still getting $135 million in grants from the South Carolina Department of Commerce and $121 million in bonds and the agency said a construction pause won’t prompt them to claw back that offer.

South Carolina is investing heavily in electric vehicles. Volkswagen-owned Scout Motors plans to invest more than $4 billion and hire 10,000 people for a plant to build its new electric SUVs scheduled to open in 2027.

The state has for decades made big bets on foreign manufacturers like BMW, Michelin and Samsung that have paid off with an economic boom this century, but there is uneasiness that Trump’s flirtation with high tariffs might stagger or even ruin those important partnerships.

McMaster told people to relax as state and business leaders are talking to Trump’s administration and things will work out.

For years, Michigan Democrats have introduced “polluter pay” legislation seeking to alter the current regulations on polluter responsibilities, which lawmakers and environmentalists argue have left taxpayers holding the bag.

Michigan is home to tens of thousands of contaminated sites, many of which are “orphan sites” where the responsible party is either no longer in business, or cannot be identified.

Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), a longtime advocate for polluter pay policies, said in a statement that the bills would put liability where it belongs: with the polluters.

“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Irwin said, noting the reintroduced package of bills aims to ensure more thorough cleanups and comprehensive spill reporting.

During the previous legislative session, Irwin, alongside Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), led the introduction of renewed polluter pay bills intended to give state regulators more tools to enforce environmental cleanups.

After the introduction of the renewed package in October 2023, the bills were subject to workgrouping with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and various industry stakeholders.

Although several of the bills in the previous package passed through the Democratic-led Michigan Senate, the efforts never came to a vote in the House, as partisan bickering and party infighting left the House’s previous Democratic leadership unable to hold session at the end of their term.

With Republicans now in control of the chamber, the reintroduced polluter pay policies will likely face an uphill battle in the House, though Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) told the Michigan Advance that it would be great to see the policies move forward in some form.

According to a statement from Irwin’s office, several of the renewed polluter pay bills have already been introduced in the Michigan House, with the rest set to be introduced next week. Additionally, Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who chairs the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, said he intends to hold a hearing on the bills next week.

Proposals in the 2025 polluter pay bills include:

Stricter pollution reporting and cleanups requirements;

Creating an avenue for EGLE to update cleanup criteria as researchers learn more about contaminants while prioritizing the removal of contamination over implementing use restrictions;

Allowing individuals exposed to hazardous substances to sue polluters for the cost of medical monitoring;

Allowing the state to hold polluters accountable for cleanup costs and damages to the environment from contaminants not regulated before 1994, such as PFAS;

And extending the statute of limitations for individuals harmed by pollution by beginning the timeline when the pollution is discovered, in line with the federal “discovery rule.”

Democrats were unable to advance the policies while they held control of both Legislative chambers, but Nick Occhipinti, state government affairs director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said the policies are still viable, even in a split-power Legislature.

“You do any polling on asking Michiganders if polluters should pay to have both legacy and existing sites cleaned up to protect public health, to redevelop those sites and return them to the community, return them to prosperity, they are overwhelmingly in support,” Occhipinti said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1514-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:11:57.104290

The innovation is a lithium manganese-rich, or LMR, pack. Collaboration with LG Energy Solution has brought the promising technology over significant hurdles, including short lifespans and voltage decay. Now the team plans to unlock benefits headlined by low cost and “impressive range,” per Narayanaswamy.

The success is thanks to a mix of dopants, coatings, and particle engineering, according to the expert.

The LMR combo will form the cathode, one of two electrodes in a battery cell. Ions move between them through an electrolyte. Experts for most automakers and in other labs are experimenting with a variety of materials, including odd ones such as cow hair and potassium, to find a cheaper, better-performing component list.

Current GM truck and SUV packs use nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum oxide chemistry. Others in the sector are moving forward with lithium-iron phosphate, or LFP, packs. That’s in addition to common lithium-ion ones. But GM thinks LMRs can outperform the other types in development.

“With LMR we can make EVs more affordable,” Narayanaswamy wrote. Silverado EVs cost between $55,000 and just over $91,000, for reference, according to Kelley Blue Book. The Chevy Equinox EV starts at $33,600.

Part of the breakthrough is using a rectangular “prismatic” cell design instead of a common pouch configuration.

“Prismatic cells reduce both the number of required parts and the percentage of non-active materials. More specifically, prismatic cells reduce battery module components by 75% and total pack components by 50%,” Narayanaswamy wrote.

EVs prevent thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution compared to gas-burning cars, even in regions where fossil fuels provide most of the electricity to charge them, according to Department of Energy data. Tailpipe exhaust is linked by government experts to a variety of health risks, including cancer, making the pollution reduction vital. Switching can also save you $1,500 a year in gas and maintenance costs.

When combined with a rooftop solar system, you can even provide the juice to charge the ride free from the sun, helping your bankroll and preventing even more pollution. EnergySage is a vetted resource that can help you find the right incentives and installers, and both EVs and solar panels are still eligible for robust tax breaks.

GM is also part of an alliance of eight well-known brands that plan to add 30,000 fast-charging stations around the country during the next half decade. The infrastructure will be needed to meet a growing market. Nearly 300,000 EVs were sold in the United States during the first quarter, an 11.4% jump from the same time last year, according to Cox Automotive.

Narayanaswamy said that GM already offers the longest-range truck with the Chevrolet Silverado EV Work Truck with max range. It has a government-rated 492-mile ability on a full charge.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-GM-logo-2021-300x300-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:12:20.651912

The House version of the “big, beautiful bill” would make drastic changes to tax cuts for low-carbon energy sources passed in the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Climate-friendly energy projects, including wind and solar, would only be able to qualify for the credits under the House bill if they begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.

This brief window would likely make many projects ineligible for the credits, and it is expected to significantly hamstring the development of new renewable power.

In a post Friday on social media, the Freedom Caucus warned the Senate against loosening that restriction or others included in the bill.

“We want to be crystal clear: if the Senate attempts to water down, strip out, or walk back the hard-fought spending reductions and IRA Green New Scam rollbacks achieved in this legislation, we will not accept it,” said the post, which was attributed to the Freedom Caucus’s board.

“The House Freedom Caucus Board will stand united holding the line. The American people didn’t send us here to cave to the swamp — they sent us here to change it,” it added.

The Senate has been widely expected to consider changes that could slow the rapid elimination of the tax credit passed under the House version of President Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”

Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Jerry Moran (Kan.) and John Curtis (Utah) released a letter warning against a “full scale” repeal of the tax credits. Senate Republicans can only afford three defections and pass their bill.

On Friday, a group of 13 House GOP moderates released a letter calling on Senate leadership “to substantively and strategically improve clean energy tax credit provisions” in the legislation.

“We believe the Senate now has a critical opportunity to restore common sense and deliver a truly pro-energy growth final bill that protects taxpayers while also unleashing the potential of U.S. energy producers, manufacturers, and workers,” the group said in the letter, which was led by Reps. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.).

Altogether, the letters illustrate what could be a tough task ahead for Republican leaders as they look to find a measure that will keep at least 50 senators on board and appease the House.

Car buyers took the bait when Colorado dangled tax credits of $5,000 on top of federal tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. Sales took off. EVs alone constituted 24.7% .of all new car sales in the final months of 2025. T

Even in early 2025, when Colorado’s tax incentives ramped down to $3,500, EVs were still responsible for about 21.1% of all sales.

What if federal tax credits go away as proposed in the budget reconciliation bill now before the U.S. Senate?

Repeat, (Rapid Energy Policy Evaluation and Analysis Toolkit), a project housed within the University of Princeton, predicts 40% fewer sales nationally by 2024. Sales will still increase, just not as fast.

Travis Madsen, who oversees the transportation program for the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, an advocacy group, said EV sales will continue to grow in Colorado. EVs save people money in lesser fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a car.

Research by the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project found that drivers in Colorado and other Southwestern states can save on the order of $10,000 over 200,000 miles by choosing an electric sedan. For battery-electric pickups, the savings can exceed $30,000.

The front-end costs can be discouraging, though.

“We will have to develop new tools to help people understand that they can save money,” said Madsen. “We will still be making progress. It just won’t be as fast.”

Will Toor, who directs the Colorado Energy Office, described the bill’s effects more broadly if the Senate were to go along with what the House passed.

“They would be, I think, ceding the future of auto manufacturing to China and essentially knee-capping American auto manufacturers from their ability to compete into the future,” he said.

“We’d started to see a bit of manufacturing renaissance in this county for clean energy supported by the Inflation Reduction Act. If this moves forward, I think it will be really negative for that clean energy manufacturing across the nation.”

The net effect of the sweeping 1,000-page bill would be to “drive up the cost of electricity, drive up the cost of vehicles and essentially drive up the costs of all the things that Coloradans depend on in their daily lives,” he added.

New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, a frequent visitor to Colorado over the years, made the same point several days later. In a column, “Trump’s Gilded Gut Instinct,” he wrote this:

“As I have been arguing since Trump came to office, his ridiculous right-wing woke obsession with destroying the U.S. electric vehicle industry that President Joe Biden was trying to build up undermines U.S. efforts to compete with China in electric batteries. Batteries are the new oil; they will power the new industrial ecosystem of A.I.-infused self-driving cars, robots, drones and clean tech.”

Friedman then introduced the thoughts of an economist, Noah Smith, who observed the consequences of the new budget bill in light of last weekend’s attack of Russian’s airplanes by Ukrainian drones. The essay is extended but entirely germane to U.S. defense but also EV adoption in Colorado.

Smith’s posting on Tuesday included this:

“Electric vehicles are crucial for battery manufacturing capacity, because in peacetime, they’re the main source of demand for batteries. Pump up the EV industry, and you pump up the battery industry too — just as the chart above shows Biden doing. Kill the EV industry and you kill the battery industry too, just as Republicans now want to do. Harming the solar industry will also harm the battery industry, because some types of batteries are used to store solar energy for when the sun isn’t shining.”

As for Colorado’s goal of having 940,000 EVs on its roads by 2030, it remains on track to get there. The incentives have jump-started sales. Another component was to ensure sufficient charging infrastructure exists.

This has several components.

To assuage worries about running out of fuel without a way to quickly charge when traveling, Colorado set out to get high-speed charging stations around the state. Some of this has been done with federal aid.

Gaps remain in Colorado, though. Most every wide spot in the road has a gas station. Fast charging EV stations are not so omnipresent. Colorado has worked to provide that reliability.

Colorado has been helped by but has not been solely dependent upon federal aid to seed the charging stations needed to make drivers comfortable when considering purchase of an EV. The state has investment programs, and utilities have invested, too.

“Unlike many other states, we haven’t been dependent just on federal investment,” said Toor.

The federal government has cut off funds for continued fast-charging through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Fund. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined with California and other states in a lawsuit that seeks to force the Trump administration to thaw those funds.

“They are important, and we’ve been relying on them and we need to get access to them,” said Toor. “But there’s a lot of EV charging that’s been deployed and will continue to be deployed in the state.”

EV adoption in Colorado also depends upon having ample fast-charging stations in other states, too, said Toor. Coloradans don’t always stay in Colorado, so they want assurances of being able to charge when driving across the vast expanses of Wyoming and Montana, too.

Another difference is that you can fill up a car with gas before you finish washing your windows. With an EV it can take 10 or 20 minutes. Best to find a charger coupled with a coffee shop and plan your trips accordingly. You can get charged up with caffeine while your car gets charged with electricity.

In May, after the Legislature convened, Toor, who directs the Colorado Energy Office, set out from the Front Range in his Chevy Blazer EV for a backpacking trip in Canyonlands National Park. It worked well, he reported. The car has a listed range of 285 miles. He reports that in temperate weather, he can get 330 miles. “And I’m sort of the opposite of a lead-footed driver,” he explained.

The first stop was a fast-charging station coupled with a coffee shop in Fruita. In Utah, at Monticello, they had a similar pre-scheduled stop.

“We stopped a few times in nice places,” said Toor. “The only problem was I drank too much coffee. Couldn’t sleep that night.”",https://coyotegulch.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-06-at-6.26.38 AM.png,N,,2025-06-06 19:07:52.679321

Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.

Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production.

Kristina Costa, who formerly worked at the White House implementing the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and climate policies, said the IRA established at least 10 years of tax credits to support clean energy industries, which launched new projects and expanded the industry.

“The House bill that the Republicans passed explodes that entire paradigm,” Costa said. “It functions as a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Costa, during a Thursday press conference with Climate Power, said the bill “really radically” changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to “lock in” a tax treatment at the start of construction.

“This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,” Costa said. “It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.”

How the bill impacts clean energy projects

Clean energy tax credits impact transportation, power generation, industry and construction and create incentives for projects like renewable vehicle fuels, solar, wind, nuclear power generation and more.

Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors.

Some of the restrictions include strict construction timeline requirements, like beginning construction within 60 days of enactment, and bringing the projects online by 2028.

Costa said these timelines create an “incredibly sharp cliff” for developers to work within for projects that often take years and can face lengthy setbacks from supply chain disruptions.

The budget bill also has extensive language pertaining to and restricting projects that have any ties to foreign entities.

Costa said these restrictions are “very complicated, unworkable, Byzantine requirements” that impose “a lot of red tape” for developers and would have the “immediate effect of freezing the market.”

She said it would require companies to understand where “literally every nut, bolt, screw and wire in a project they are building comes from” and certify that it does not have any ties to China or to Russia.

Costa said gutting these policies will lead to increased energy costs for American customers. A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.

Part of the problem is an anticipated 2% energy demand increase nationwide, in 2025 and again in 2026, according to the EIA. Much of that energy demand is a result of battery manufacturing and data centers.

Iowa alone has roughly 100 data centers, which is one of the largest concentrations in the midwest.

“The near term additions to the grid are going to come from renewables, or they’re supposed to come from renewables under the current tax regime,” Costa said. “That is why you would see these consumer electricity price increases.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s utility companies with significant investments in solar and wind energy, said the company is monitoring the bill.

A spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy declined to comment on the pending legislation.

Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A representative from the company did not answer questions about the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project.

A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032.

Repeal of the credits would also affect associated manufacturing companies, like those that make solar panel parts, or wind turbine blades.

Analysis from Climate Power found 400,000 jobs nationwide would be in jeopardy without the tax credits supporting the expanding industry.

Joe Zimsen, an Iowa resident with 10 years of construction experience in the wind industry, said the IRA created a “tremendous amount of hope” among his colleagues in the industry that has now “disintegrated” because of budget bill.

Zimsen formerly worked on wind projects near Grinnell, but now works for Renew Energy as a construction manager for off-shore wind projects. He and his family still live in Iowa, and he urged Iowa senators to oppose the bill as it is currently written.

“This policy of killing offshore and onshore wind and solar energy is going to have tremendous detrimental effects and set us back another 10 to 15 years behind our competitors, like China and Europe,” Zimsen said. “We can’t afford to do that.”

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday that wind energy incentives have been at risk since 2015 when he worked to extend them, and he said he senators would try to find a “compromise” on them again, Radio Iowa reported.

But, the so-called, “big beautiful bill” comprises much more than just clean energy concerns, which Grassley said means one issue can’t “stand in the way” of the rest of the bill.

While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.","WASHINGTON — Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they’re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.

While some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a “green new scam,” statistics reviewed by State Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump’s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.

Trump vowed in early April to “supercharge our domestic industrial base.”

“Jobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,” he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.

But as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.

Critics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.

They have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states — top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.

U.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.

Kevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.

“We're just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we'll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,” Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.

Doffling’s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.

Moving away from fossil fuels

The suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.

For example, the IRA’s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output.

Battery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.

Most credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.

A group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam” — echoing Trump’s rhetoric — pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.

The House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled “foreign entities of concern,” making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.

The legislation also repeals “transferability,” which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.

For example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.

Schneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals “reflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.”

Silfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.

Investment soared

Spurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.

Of the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.

The credit spurred a “sea change” in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.

Despite solar technology’s roots in the U.S., the nation “didn’t even have a toe” in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.

“But after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,” Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.

Active manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association’s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.

The renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.

Active solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.

Advanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.

But various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country — for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.

Lithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.

China largely dominates the world’s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.

When accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 — including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits — just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power’s 2024 report on clean energy employment.

Troy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.

“​​We're getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,” said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.

“What troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can't get anything done, and that's been very difficult to deal with,” he said.

Industry slowdown

The industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.

Six announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor’s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.

Van Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.

“We had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,” Van Beek said. “And when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.”

Van Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.

Several companies declined States Newsroom’s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.

Spencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.

“Whether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you're doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,” said Pederson, the association’s senior vice president of public affairs.

Too expensive, Republicans say

Some House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits — for example by removing the “overly prescriptive” restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.

Kiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that “the last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.”

Her co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.

Far-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company’s ability to transfer credits.

The right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the “commonsense changes” championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.

The organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.

“The longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it’s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,” Thomas Aiello, NTU’s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.

Hope in the Senate?

But representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.

Jeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that “The Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.”

Pederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are “particularly restrictive coming out of the House.”

“So we're hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,” Pederson said.

Doffling believes senators have a “longer term vision” of the nation’s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.

“They see what's happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,” Doffling said.

The House bill just sets the U.S. “further behind,” he added. “This bill is all about going backwards in time and hoping for the best.”

“I wish they could look at the numbers and understand the economic impacts it's gonna have. … But somehow we're talking about the fact of hamstringing a whole entire industry itself over verbiage of the word ‘clean.’”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-06/solarpanelworker2025.jpg?h=8c1344d8&itok=N7WYdfUN,N,,2025-06-06 17:13:43.474150

Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.
A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.

Many of these credits were extended via the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which put them under attack from Republican lawmakers opposed to the green policies. Renewable energy advocates say continued investment into wind, solar and other clean energy sources, regardless of environmental impact, is vital to meeting growing energy demands.

Nearly three-fifths of Iowa’s total electricity generation comes from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which also reports Iowa is one of the top states for solar and wind energy generation. Since 2019, Iowa has generated more electricity via wind than from coal and continues to grow its solar production.

Kristina Costa, who formerly worked at the White House implementing the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and climate policies, said the IRA established at least 10 years of tax credits to support clean energy industries, which launched new projects and expanded the industry.

“The House bill that the Republicans passed explodes that entire paradigm,” Costa said. “It functions as a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Costa, during a Thursday press conference with Climate Power, said the bill “really radically” changes how clean electricity developers can plan and develop their projects, by eliminating the ability to “lock in” a tax treatment at the start of construction.

“This is going to create a lot of uncertainty for project developers,” Costa said. “It’s going to raise financing costs for project developers pretty considerably … but it also just means that fewer projects will end up qualifying for the credits.”

How the bill impacts clean energy projects

Clean energy tax credits impact transportation, power generation, industry and construction and create incentives for projects like renewable vehicle fuels, solar, wind, nuclear power generation and more.

Per the reconciliation bill text as it passed the House May 22, the bill would terminate clean vehicle credits, residential energy efficiency credits, hydrogen fuel credits and place restrictions on credits for clean electricity production, zero-emission nuclear energy production and other sectors.

Some of the restrictions include strict construction timeline requirements, like beginning construction within 60 days of enactment, and bringing the projects online by 2028.

Costa said these timelines create an “incredibly sharp cliff” for developers to work within for projects that often take years and can face lengthy setbacks from supply chain disruptions.

The budget bill also has extensive language pertaining to and restricting projects that have any ties to foreign entities.

Costa said these restrictions are “very complicated, unworkable, Byzantine requirements” that impose “a lot of red tape” for developers and would have the “immediate effect of freezing the market.”

She said it would require companies to understand where “literally every nut, bolt, screw and wire in a project they are building comes from” and certify that it does not have any ties to China or to Russia.

Costa said gutting these policies will lead to increased energy costs for American customers. A study from Clean Energy Buyers Association analyzed the impact of removing just two clean energy tax credit programs, and found it would cause an average increase of 7% for residential electricity costs.

Part of the problem is an anticipated 2% energy demand increase nationwide, in 2025 and again in 2026, according to the EIA. Much of that energy demand is a result of battery manufacturing and data centers.

Iowa alone has roughly 100 data centers, which is one of the largest concentrations in the midwest.

“The near term additions to the grid are going to come from renewables, or they’re supposed to come from renewables under the current tax regime,” Costa said. “That is why you would see these consumer electricity price increases.”

A spokesperson for Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s utility companies with significant investments in solar and wind energy, said the company is monitoring the bill.

A spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy declined to comment on the pending legislation.

Earlier this year, NextEra Energy proposed restarting its Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant near Palo. A representative from the company did not answer questions about the impact the Republican-sponsored bill would have on the Iowa project.

A study from The Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits in Iowa alone would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa, if left intact through 2032.

Repeal of the credits would also affect associated manufacturing companies, like those that make solar panel parts, or wind turbine blades.

Analysis from Climate Power found 400,000 jobs nationwide would be in jeopardy without the tax credits supporting the expanding industry.

Joe Zimsen, an Iowa resident with 10 years of construction experience in the wind industry, said the IRA created a “tremendous amount of hope” among his colleagues in the industry that has now “disintegrated” because of budget bill.

Zimsen formerly worked on wind projects near Grinnell, but now works for Renew Energy as a construction manager for off-shore wind projects. He and his family still live in Iowa, and he urged Iowa senators to oppose the bill as it is currently written.

“This policy of killing offshore and onshore wind and solar energy is going to have tremendous detrimental effects and set us back another 10 to 15 years behind our competitors, like China and Europe,” Zimsen said. “We can’t afford to do that.”

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Tuesday that wind energy incentives have been at risk since 2015 when he worked to extend them, and he said he senators would try to find a “compromise” on them again, Radio Iowa reported.

But, the so-called, “big beautiful bill” comprises much more than just clean energy concerns, which Grassley said means one issue can’t “stand in the way” of the rest of the bill.

But now, Congress is threatening to roll back the very policies that have made that progress possible.

The Trump Administration has a stated goal of American Energy Dominance, but the House Reconciliation Bill’s severe cuts to the energy tax credits threatens to bring energy chaos instead.

The bill passed by the House will decimate the energy manufacturing boom, increase electricity costs for families and businesses and put the nation at risk of energy shortages as we try to keep up with rapidly growing energy demand. Senator Capito and Senator Justice should not let that happen and instead support common-sense approaches to the commercial and residential energy tax credits that are benefitting West Virginians.

In West Virginia, lower-income household energy burdens are among the highest in the country and many are struggling to afford increasing utility bills. According to the Clean Energy Buyers Association, the House Reconciliation Bill will increase electricity prices over the next decade. The electric utilities trade association, the Edison Electric Institute, has also stated that maintaining the energy tax credits will help lower utility bills by $45 billion through 2032.

As scary as those cost increases are, it may be far worse for West Virginia because those don’t account for the “dramatic increases in future energy demand” forecast by PJM, the region’s wholesale electricity market, due to data center development, new manufacturing and increasing use of electricity in transportation. That rising demand coupled with slower deployment of cost-effective new energy resources, which includes solar and energy storage, will increase utility rates across the region. It is simple supply and demand — if we don’t bring on enough energy resources then costs will go up and that will be a drag on West Virginia’s economy.

Solar Holler and PosiGen are utilizing the 48E and 25D energy credits to reduce energy costs for families across West Virginia. For example, Mary West, who lives just outside of Charleston, was able to install solar on her home through a lease structure that required no credit check, income requirement and will provide immediate savings on her bills. Removing the option for families to lease, which the House bill does, will simply put energy savings out of reach for those who need it the most. Mary’s story is powerful, but not unique. It represents thousands of households across West Virginia looking for stability in an unpredictable energy market.

We are also proud of the growth in American energy manufacturing across the country, including West Virginia, due to the energy tax credits. We use domestically-manufactured equipment in every installation and we continue to see more and more of the solar supply chain come to the US because of the policies that are in place to support onshoring. This is critical not just for the economic benefits, but also for our national security.

Our residential solar projects create demand for domestically-produced solar panels, inverters and racking, including from Georgia, Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Washington, New Mexico, Ohio and Arizona, which has led to the several hundred solar manufacturing facilities that are under development or are operating today. A sudden reversal of long-term energy policies will create a policy whiplash that puts those manufacturing facilities and jobs at risk.

Businesses are investing in projects and factories across the country, many of which would be negatively impacted by the near immediate elimination of the energy tax credits. Congress should not punish businesses by pulling the rug on those investments. The economic impact is real and being felt in West Virginia with each family that we serve.

At a time when we need all energy sources to meet rising energy demand and to keep energy affordable, our Senators should take a holistic approach to Energy Dominance that includes a reasonable approach to the 25D and 48E credits that directly benefit West Virginians.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/solar-holler.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 17:13:53.528138

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Transportation Department paved the way for looser U.S fuel economy standards on Friday by declaring that former President Joe Biden's administration exceeded its authority by assuming high uptake of electric vehicles in calculating rules.

The department made the declaration as it published a final ""Resetting the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Program"" (CAFE) rule. A future separate rule from the administration of President Donald Trump will revise the fuel economy requirements.

""We are making vehicles more affordable and easier to manufacture in the United States. The previous administration illegally used CAFE standards as an electric vehicle mandate,"" said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a statement.

The department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in writing its rule last year under Biden, had ""assumed significant numbers of EVs would continue to be produced regardless of the standards set by the agency, in turn increasing the level of standards that could be considered maximum feasible,"" it said Friday.

Duffy in January signed an order directing NHTSA to rescind fuel economy standards issued under Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Late Thursday, Senate Republicans led by Commerce Committee chair Ted Cruz proposed eliminating fines for failures to meet CAFE rules as part of a wide-ranging tax bill - the latest move aimed at making it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

Last year, Chrysler-parent Stellantis paid $190.7 million in civil penalties for failing to meet U.S. fuel economy requirements for 2019 and 2020 after paying nearly $400 million for penalties from 2016 through 2019. GM previously paid $128.2 million in penalties for 2016 and 2017.

Stellantis said it supported the Senate Republican proposal ""to provide relief while DOT develops its proposal to reset the CAFE standards... The standards are out of sync with the current market reality and immediate relief is necessary to preserve affordability and freedom of choice.""

GM referred questions to a trade group representing the Detroit Three automakers, which said ""the current CAFE rules are challenging to achieve for automakers and real regulatory relief is needed,"" and praised the Senate Republican proposal.

NHTSA in June 2024 under Biden said it would hike CAFE requirements to about 50.4 miles per gallon (4.67 liters per 100 km) by 2031, from 39.1 mpg currently, for light-duty vehicles.

The agency last year said the rule for passenger cars and trucks would reduce gasoline consumption by 64 billion gallons and cut emissions by 659 million metric tons, cutting fuel costs with net benefits it estimated at $35.2 billion.

The U.S. Senate is expected to vote on President Donald Trump’s massive tax policy, known as the “big beautiful bill,” within a month. It affects a broad range of domestic policy, ranging from increased military spending to reduced Medicaid, food stamps and taxes.

A key target in the bill is repealing most tax credits for clean energy.

Analysts say this will raise energy costs in Tennessee, threaten manufacturing jobs and increase planet-warming pollution.

Trump’s tax bill could slow clean energy growth

In the bill’s current form, consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, heat pumps, solar panels and energy efficient windows will be phased out within a year. These tax credits were introduced under former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

The bill also decimates tax credits for renewable energy, which has been the most common and often cheapest form of new electricity. Last year, 94% of new electricity capacity in the U.S. came from solar, wind or batteries.

At the same time, electricity demand is starting to increase after remaining flat for decades. National electricity demand surged 3% last year, largely due to a hotter summer and partially because of new data centers used for artificial intelligence. U.S. exports of fracked gas are also expected to increase, which could raise domestic prices for heating and electricity.

American households could consequently pay as much as $400 more each year on energy bills within a decade, according to analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group.

Tennessee is forecasted to have one of the highest electricity increases in the nation. One analysis found that annual electricity bills could increase by more than 10%, or roughly $200 for the average home, by next year.

The state has already faced higher monthly bills as the Tennessee Valley Authority, the utility that provides nearly all electricity to Tennessee and parts of six other states, has been rapidly expanding its fossil fuel footprint with new gas plants and pipelines. TVA raised electricity rates by 9.75% between 2023 and 2024.

Trump’s bill could impact another part of the local energy economy: Tennessee’s manufacturing boom. In the past three years, the state has seen billions of dollars in investments for factories creating clean tech like EV batteries. Some analysts say these factories and their estimated 5,000 jobs in the state could soon be at risk.

“Jobs have been created and electric bills have been lowered. We urge members of Congress to maintain these tax incentives so that the people of Appalachia can continue to reap their benefits,” Chelsea Barnes, a director with the environmental group Appalachian Voices, said in a statement. The group cited specific examples of tax credits helping communities in the state, like a money-saving rooftop solar installation at the First Presbyterian Church of Oak Ridge, in a new report.

Ultimately, as climate change accelerates, the bill could delay the transition to cleaner energy, which has been ramping up in recent years. The bill also contains goodies for the fossil fuel industry, including an end to taxing excess methane emissions and expedited approval for new oil and gas projects.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cb9136f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+109/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd9%2F27%2F279b946f4586bf73cf37a51a18ec%2Fmatthew-henry-yetqklnhsui-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 19:07:58.291732

Millions of newly uninsured, low-income Americans would be at risk of financial catastrophe from a health emergency, while many of these same individuals could also see their food assistance cut or eliminated in full. And the bill would put 680,000 jobs at risk—largely in states President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election—while raising energy costs for families. Senators must reject this deeply unpopular legislation to avoid damaging the economy, hurting the most vulnerable, and increasing costs on families already suffering from high prices caused by the president’s tariffs.

Methodology

To estimate health insurance coverage losses by congressional district, the authors created proportional weights for each congressional district’s share of the state’s Medicaid and ACA population using KFF 2024 enrollment data. To account for states without Medicaid expansion, the authors used a weight equal to each congressional district’s proportion of the state’s total population from the Missouri Census Data Center, consistent with prior KFF analysis. Then the authors applied that weight to KFF state coverage loss estimates of the House-passed One Big, Beautiful Bill Act and changes based on the loss of enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits to estimate coverage losses by congressional district. Total estimated coverage losses were then calculated by combining estimated losses from cuts to Medicaid and from expiring ACA tax credits.

The estimate for the impact of expanded paperwork requirements on SNAP benefits come from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ analysis, which can be accessed here and here, of fiscal year 2022 SNAP quality control data and American Community Survey data for 2019-2023.

The number of jobs at risk if IRA clean energy tax credits are eliminated was calculated using the spreadsheets “Clean Investment Monitor 2025 Q1 Outstanding Spending by State with Jobs” and “Clean Investment Monitor 2025 Q1 Outstanding Spending by CD with Jobs” downloaded from page 10 of the Clean Investment Monitor: Q1 Update from Rhodium Group and MIT CEEPR. The total of “Outstanding Operational Jobs” and “Outstanding Construction Jobs” was 686,003.

Single-cycle gas turbines work by burning gas and using the heat to generate power.
For starters, gas plants with this type of turbine can ramp up more quickly than combined-cycle ones.
Meta just inked a 20-year power supply deal with Constellation Energy, which operates a nuclear power plant in Illinois.
But this appetite is suffering certain constraints: new nuclear power plants take a whole lot of time to get built.","Artificial intelligence is all over the media—and so is its energy consumption, which is spurring something of a new tech race. That race, however, besides innovation, includes some simpler moves, such as a return to a kind of power generator that had been consigned to history.

Single-cycle gas turbines used to be popular before combined-cycle technology emerged. It was much more efficient and a lot cleaner, Bloomberg reported this week in a story looking into the latest developments in AI and securing the energy for its continued growth. Single-cycle gas turbines work by burning gas and using the heat to generate power. Combined cycle turbines work pretty much the same way, but they also utilize the excess heat to turn it into steam, which also generates power (or is used for district heating).

Yet, while Bloomberg focuses on the fact that single-cycle turbines are less efficient and emit more carbon dioxide, they have certain advantages that may well explain why AI developers have become fans. For starters, gas plants with this type of turbine can ramp up more quickly than combined-cycle ones. Fast response times for power generators are bound to be important for tech majors. But single-cycle gas turbine facilities are also cheaper and faster to build than combined-cycle power plants. And this is even more important for AI developers.

Meta just inked a 20-year power supply deal with Constellation Energy, which operates a nuclear power plant in Illinois. Interestingly, the plant was supposed to be shut down back in 2017. It wasn’t, because Illinois legislators decided to prioritize both reliability and emission reduction and extended the life of the facility. This is the latest in a string of such deals in which Big Tech demonstrates a newfound appetite for nuclear power because of its AI ambitions. But this appetite is suffering certain constraints: new nuclear power plants take a whole lot of time to get built.

“There is a high level of urgency in the industry to get power fast,” the chief operating officer of Crusoe, a data center-building company, told Bloomberg. “We have tried to be creative about the energy component of data centers,” Cully Cavness also said. Crusoe is building the data centers for the Stargate project, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX that is eyeing an international network of such centers. It is by far not the only one.

“To have the energy we need for the grid, it’s going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time,” Kevin Miller, Amazon vice president of global data centers, said earlier this year. “We’re not surprised by the fact that we’re going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term.”

Indeed, no one should be surprised that the tech industry would need to add a lot of thermal generation in short order to satisfy its energy demand. And if anyone thinks that it will be for the short term only, then they are deeply mistaken. Whether it’s a single-cycle gas power plant that could be built in a few months or a nuclear facility that will take years, AI needs reliable electricity—lots of it. Ensuring the supply of such electricity is a long-term investment, not something you pay for, and then shut down five years later because of emission regulations.

It is rather ironic that none other than Big Tech, a most vocal industry backer of the energy transition, is bringing the issue of supply reliability—and the importance of hydrocarbons—back into the spotlight of the energy stage. Perhaps even more ironically, there is a shortage of gas turbines already, so those single-cycle turbine power plants may take a bit longer than a few months to build.

Held at the Heinz 57 Center, the event brought together educators, workforce practitioners, community leaders, and employers for a morning of rich conversation, strategic updates, and collaborative breakout sessions.

Panel: Career Maps and Tech in Workforce Development

The morning kicked off with a panel discussion moderated by Sustainable Pittsburgh Executive Director Bhavini Patel, featuring:

Justin Aglio, Executive Director, Readiness Institute at Penn State and Associate Vice President, Penn State Outreach

Pam Dincher, Executive Director of Strategic Initiatives, Clean Energy Center at Penn College

Valerie Karplus, Associate Director, Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation and Professor of Engineering and Public Policy, Carnegie Mellon University

The panel explored how career maps and digital tools can improve awareness of clean energy job opportunities for students, job seekers, and communities that have often been left out of emerging workforce conversations. The speakers emphasized that these tools must be built on accurate, responsive data in order to help individuals understand what jobs are available, what they may already be qualified for, and what steps are needed to move forward.

The panel highlighted how personal experience and community context play a critical role in shaping workforce decisions. Justin Aglio spoke about how limited exposure to career options, especially in communities historically tied to industries like coal, can shape generational expectations. He and Pam Dincher emphasized the potential of career maps to introduce new opportunities for individuals with educators and counselors helping to guide them along the way. Valerie Karplus added a systems-level view, noting that high-quality data can help identify pathways for transitioning from legacy industries into emerging clean energy roles.

At the same time, the panel cautioned that if career maps are not designed thoughtfully, they risk reinforcing the very inequities they aim to address. Ensuring their value requires intentional development and strong community partnerships.

Audience members raised important questions about how apprenticeships are integrated, how employers can be more engaged, and how to ensure career maps capture the full spectrum of job opportunities. Panelists emphasized that while career maps are a valuable resource, their impact depends on strong relationships, active mentorship, and meaningful exposure to real-world work experiences.

Regional Updates from Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh

Brittany Prischak, Director of the Allegheny County Department of Sustainability, introduced the county’s upcoming Climate Action Plan and invited roundtable participants to get involved in shaping it. She noted that the plan will be developed over the next 12–18 months and emphasized opportunities to coordinate with existing community events and networks. Initial surveys and a new public engagement website are expected to launch in mid-June, with larger public events scheduled for September.

Matt Mahoney, Climate and Energy Planning Manager at the City of Pittsburgh, shared updates on the city’s PGH2050 Comprehensive Plan. With research synthesis underway and a summer of engagement planned, Mahoney invited participants to explore the city’s digital engagement hub and share feedback on how the plan can better reflect workforce and sustainability priorities. He also spotlighted the city’s PGH Lab initiative and encouraged organizations to apply for the 2026 cohort, with applications opening Fall 2025.

TrailBlaze Presentation: Defining and Promoting Clean Energy Careers

Tim Hindes, Chief Trail Officer with TrailBlaze Creative, introduced draft concepts for a marketing campaign to support the launch and adoption of the Clean Energy Career Maps, under development by Sustainable Pittsburgh with support from Julius Education. Designed to raise visibility of clean energy jobs, the campaign aims to increase public understanding of what clean energy jobs are, where they exist, and how they connect to long-term, reliable careers.

A key focus of the effort is reaching audiences that may not currently see themselves reflected in the industry, and emphasizing that these roles may require the same skills used in other industries.

During the session, participants were invited to engage with a live polling exercise that prompted responses to draft messaging and visuals around clean energy careers in southwestern Pennsylvania. Attendees shared reactions, identified missing language or ideas, and suggested refinements for tone, clarity, and resonance.

Breakout Sessions

After the presentation, attendees divided into two breakout sessions, each focused on a key initiative within the roundtable: career maps and workforce vitality.

Career Map Committee

Facilitated by Tim Hindes, this session explored how to communicate the full scope of careers reflected in the maps and how to ensure the career maps are relevant across geographic and demographic lines. Participants discussed the challenge of expanding public understanding beyond the most visible clean energy jobs, such as solar installation, to include related fields like transportation, sales, and equipment maintenance. They emphasized that language matters and that small shifts can make a big difference. For example, “skilled trades” was viewed as more approachable than “building trades,” and “reliable work” resonated more clearly with some audiences than technical industry terms like “resiliency.”

The group also emphasized the importance of regional access. Many workforce programs primarily serve Allegheny County, so the maps could be positioned to help job seekers from surrounding counties connect to training and employment opportunities. The conversation also touched on the need to showcase non-traditional pathways, such as veterans transitioning into new industries, or unskilled workers entering pre-apprenticeship tracks. Participants agreed that the success of the maps will depend not only on good design and information, but also on trusted messengers, localized outreach, and exposure to real-world experience.

Workforce Vitality Committee

Led by Coleman Rogers, a Fellow with the U.S. Department of Energy, this session focused on a draft Workforce Vitality Index. The index is being developed to help the region track where job opportunities are growing, where barriers exist, and how to align investments and policies to improve access. Participants reviewed a framework that considers factors like job growth and barriers such as transportation, childcare, and financial insecurity.

The group offered detailed feedback on how to improve the tool. Several attendees suggested clarifying the definitions used in the index and identifying data sources that reflect both industry demand and community needs. Others emphasized the need to break down barriers like transportation into more specific categories to better reflect lived experiences, such as long commute times or lack of flexible transit options.

The conversation also turned to employer practices and job quality. Participants discussed the importance of mentorship, co-op models, and engaging employers early to ensure job seekers are prepared for the realities of the workplace. The index was seen as a useful tool not only for analyzing workforce trends but also for advocating more effectively for funding and policy support.

Both sessions underscored a common goal: improving access to clean energy careers by increasing visibility, strengthening partnerships, and centering the voices of communities most affected by economic transition.

What’s Next

The Clean Energy Workforce Roundtable will reconvene on August 28, 2025, with continued focus on advancing career visibility, addressing workforce barriers, and strengthening collaboration across sectors.

Manufacturers are under increasing pressure to reduce their environmental impact, optimize resources, and improve energy efficiency. As sustainability becomes more of a strategic priority for manufacturers, leveraging cutting-edge technology to meet sustainability goals has become essential. One such technology that is making a significant impact on manufacturing operations is the Automated Building Management System (BMS). These intelligent systems offer a range of benefits for manufacturers looking to reduce their environmental footprint, enhance energy efficiency, and achieve sustainability objectives.

What is an Automated Building Management System (BMS)?

An Automated Building Management System (BMS) is a centralized system that manages and controls various building systems and operations in a manufacturing facility. These systems typically manage areas like heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, energy consumption, security, water management, and access control. BMS integrates these functions into a cohesive platform, allowing real-time monitoring, control, and optimization.

By using sensors, automation, and data analytics, BMS helps facilities make informed decisions, improve efficiency, and monitor the overall health of building systems. In terms of sustainability, BMS acts as a vital tool for reducing resource consumption and minimizing a facility’s environmental footprint.

The backbone of sustainability

Energy usage is one of the most significant costs in manufacturing, and managing it effectively is crucial for achieving sustainability. A BMS enhances energy efficiency by automating the control of heating, cooling, and lighting systems to ensure that energy is used only when necessary.

Real-time energy monitoring and control

Through continuous monitoring of energy use, BMS systems can detect energy inefficiencies and automatically adjust operations to minimize waste. For example, lighting systems can be automatically dimmed or turned off in unoccupied areas, and HVAC systems can adjust their operations based on the real-time temperature and humidity levels within the facility. These energy-saving measures help ensure that energy consumption is minimized, especially during non-peak hours when the facility may not be fully operational.

Demand-response and peak load management

One of the key features of an advanced BMS is demand-response capabilities, which enable the system to respond dynamically to fluctuations in energy demand. By adjusting the use of HVAC, lighting, and other systems, the BMS can reduce energy consumption during peak hours when the grid is under strain. Manufacturers can use this feature to avoid high energy costs and reduce their environmental impact by using energy more efficiently during critical times.

Load shedding and optimization

BMS also helps to manage peak demand through load shedding—reducing non-essential energy consumption during periods of peak demand. This can significantly reduce the overall energy consumption of the facility while maintaining operational efficiency.

Manufacturing facilities, particularly those that rely heavily on energy-intensive processes, contribute significantly to carbon emissions. In addition to improving energy efficiency, BMS plays an integral role in helping manufacturers reduce their carbon footprint.

Renewable energy integration

Many manufacturing facilities are now incorporating renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind energy, into their operations to further reduce their carbon impact. A BMS can play a crucial role in managing the integration of these renewable energy sources. By prioritizing renewable energy usage when available and balancing it with grid electricity, the system ensures that the facility uses as much clean energy as possible, reducing reliance on non-renewable resources.

Water conservation and waste management

Water is another crucial resource that many manufacturing facilities rely on for processes such as cooling, cleaning, and production. As water conservation becomes increasingly important, a BMS helps manage water usage effectively. BMS systems track and monitor water usage in real-time, alerting facility managers to wasteful practices or water leaks. By identifying areas where water is used inefficiently, such as excess cooling or leaky connections, manufacturers can take steps to reduce consumption. Additionally, BMS can provide automated control over water-based systems, ensuring that they are used optimally throughout the day.

For facilities with on-site wastewater treatment systems, a BMS can assist in monitoring and controlling wastewater processes, ensuring they run efficiently. By optimizing water treatment, BMS systems can help ensure that water reuse is maximized, contributing to sustainability efforts and lowering operational costs.

Predictive maintenance and preventing waste and downtime

Manufacturing facilities rely heavily on machinery and equipment to keep operations running smoothly. However, poorly maintained equipment can lead to inefficiencies, increased energy consumption, and even premature failure. BMS plays a critical role in predictive maintenance, which helps avoid these issues and contributes to long-term sustainability.

Using real-time data analysis, BMS systems can identify potential issues with equipment before they become critical, enabling proactive maintenance. This minimizes unplanned downtime, reduces the need for emergency repairs, and extends the lifespan of equipment, reducing the need for replacement and cutting down on waste.

Predictive maintenance also ensures that equipment runs at peak efficiency, avoiding overuse of energy due to malfunctions or inefficiencies. This can significantly reduce energy waste and lower overall energy consumption, directly supporting sustainability efforts.

Compliance with green building standards

As sustainability regulations become more stringent, manufacturers are often required to meet specific green building certifications, such as LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method). A BMS helps facilities stay compliant with these standards by providing valuable data on energy consumption, water usage, and overall environmental impact.

Pathway to a sustainable future

In the quest for sustainability, manufacturers must leverage technology to optimize resource usage and minimize waste. Automated BMS are an essential tool in achieving these goals, offering real-time monitoring and control of energy, water, and equipment. By automating critical systems, BMS help manufacturers reduce their carbon footprint, lower energy costs, and improve operational efficiency.

Monitoring and managing resources efficiently through BMS gives manufacturers a competitive edge, not only by helping them meet regulatory standards but also by reducing operational costs and contributing to a more sustainable future. As we move toward a greener industrial landscape, BMS will play a pivotal role in driving sustainability efforts and ensuring that manufacturing operations are as efficient and environmentally responsible as possible.",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/warehouse-lighting-bms.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:38.608532

U.S. energy demands are rising by 2% to 3% annually, driven by data center growth, expanding manufacturing, and electrification. Data centers alone are projected to consume up to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028, versus 4.4% in 2023. Such trends drive a supply and demand gap as generating capacity margins in the SPP footprint could decline from 24% in 2020 to just 5% in 2029 unless intervention occurs.

That intervention starts with end-to-end technical innovation, first at the point of generator interconnection. Currently, the U.S. generates 1.28 terawatts of power. The partnership draws on multiple Hitachi competencies: Method’s design services; GlobalLogic’s software engineering services; Hitachi Energy’s energy portfolio management asset modeling solutions; Hitachi R&D’s AI-based energy grid algorithm; and Hitachi Vantara’s integrated storage and compute platform Hitachi iQ, built on NVIDIA accelerated computing, networking, and AI software.

As the regional transmission organization (RTO) framing the project, SPP will guide the integration of these technical solutions and services. As a coordinator prioritizing operational and customer experience improvements, SPP’s input will also ensure the project outcomes align with requirements and regulations.

“Our nation’s demand for electricity has risen sharply in recent years following a long period of slow growth. Our industry has struggled to keep up with this sudden and significant shift,” says SPP President and CEO Lanny Nickell. “There are a lot of would-be power producers out there waiting to connect to the grid, but yesterday’s systems and technology haven’t been sufficient to enable us to bring incremental capacity online fast enough. It’s time to fix that, and SPP is proud to work with Hitachi and NVIDIA, two AI industry leaders who have the means to help realize a vision of a better energy future for our nation.”

The integrated solution is an industrial AI system differentiated by its advanced proprietary AI algorithms and high performance enabled by Hitachi iQ’s enterprise AI solution stack which sit at its core. Dynamic AI-driven technologies will be applied to various study areas, such as:

Process automation

Predictive analysis

Communication systems integration

The partnership with Hitachi and NVIDIA runs parallel to other improvements underway at SPP, including a reimagining of its transmission planning processes to align with current and future industry needs. Together, these technological and process innovations are expected to set high-water marks in the electricity industry for generator interconnection, mid- and long-term planning, long-term forecast accuracy, analysis and deployment of additional grid-enhancing technologies.

“This initiative is about reimagining the electricity production and distribution process through the lens of modern AI technology,” says Frank Antonysamy, chief growth officer, Hitachi Digital. “Real-time data access is needed to create truly realistic scenarios caused by new generator introductions. The AI solution we’re all developing will provide that data, among other advantages. SPP can then make significantly quicker, better-informed decisions that will increase overall ROI while better serving the nation’s population with accessible power.”

“Interconnection process acceleration is critical to meet the unprecedented demand on our grid,” says Marc Spieler, senior managing director of the Global Energy Industry at NVIDIA. “Using advanced NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI, Hitachi and SPP are helping speed interconnection studies to bring essential infrastructure online faster.”

The project’s phase one milestones are expected to be completed by winter 2025/26. They include initial systems acceleration, data management processes optimization, and the introduction of AI-augmented simulation modeling among other goals.

The bills—all of which were approved by the Texas state Senate, but then stalled in the House of Representatives—were backed by interests opposed to continued renewable energy development in the state, even at a time when electricity demand is soaring. One measure would have imposed specific permitting and setback requirements for new wind and solar projects, while another would have limited the state’s growth of new renewable energy capacity to that of natural gas power, which itself is currently curtailed by a global shortage of turbine components.

The bill that attracted the most criticism would have mandated expensive battery or natural gas backup power systems for all existing and future state wind and solar plants when not in operation—a requirement that business and trade groups found too costly for comfort, especially as Texas competes for energy-hungry industries such as artificial intelligence and semiconductor production.

These concerns were amplified by a study commissioned by the Texas Association of Business and released during the legislative session that forecast a 14% increase in power prices in the state, if renewable energy expansion was curtailed. In addition, the report found that the loss of new capacity from renewables would further burden the state’s largely standalone power grid that has proven vulnerable to failure during extreme weather events.

Judd Messer, Texas vice president of the Advanced Power Alliance, a renewable industry trade association, credits the bills’ eventual failure to recognition by House members that sustaining the state’s current economic boom requires every affordable megawatt available, regardless of how it’s generated.

“These legislators recognized renewable power for what it is: a vital part of the Texas economy, particularly in rural communities,” he adds.

New Projects Power Up

The past two decades have seen Texas evolve into a powerhouse of renewable energy development. Last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, wind and solar farms in Texas combined to generate more than 169,000 gigawatt hours, more than any other state.

The pace of growth continues to accelerate. Renewable market monitor Cleanview reports that in 2025, energy developers in Texas expect to add 11.5 and 2.6 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity, respectively. Texas is also a top market for battery projects, with 2.8 megawatts already on line and another 7 gigawatts to be added this year.

Among projects recently completed or underway are the 600-MW Hornet Solar in Swisher County, and the 284-MW Stillhouse Solar, being developed by Matrix Renewables and SOLVEnergy in Bell County. Later this year, developer RWE plans to begin construction on a 200-MW solar project in Bastrop County.

Hybrid projects combining renewable generation with battery storage in Texas include Clearway Energy Group’s 300-MW Pine Forest solar farm and 200-MW standalone storage facility in Hopkins County, and Enel Green Power’s Azure Sky in Throckmorton County, which will combine a 350-MW wind farm with 180 megawatt-hours of battery storage.

Despite the anticipated capacity provided by these and other projects currently in the renewables pipeline, Messer worries that political efforts to undermine the competitiveness of these resources are likely to resurface when the Texas legislature convenes again in 2027, if not sooner.

“Clean energy has become such a political flashpoint that a small band of lawmakers are willing to abandon the very principles they typically champion—protection of private property rights and free enterprise—not out of conviction, but out of political antagonism,” he says.

Unable to challenge renewables’ increasing reliability and affordability, Messer adds, “opponents have shifted the debate to peripheral concerns such as aesthetics or unfounded claims about impacts to wildlife and habitat—a trend that, unfortunately for all Texans, is likely to persist.”

That threat, combined with the prospect of an end to federal clean energy tax incentives, could cloud the state’s long-term renewable energy prospects.

“It’s not just developers paying attention to legislative activity,” Messer says. “So are financiers, offtakers and other project partners. The recent regulatory uncertainty has rattled many of them, and understandably so—we came dangerously close to seeing damaging bills become law. That uncertainty alone can chill investment and delay or derail projects, affecting not just development but also engineering and construction activity across the sector.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/06/06/credit_infrastructure_and_energy_alternatives.jpg?height=635&t=1749229957&width=1200,N,,2025-06-06 16:11:32.228685

Federal clean energy tax credits are at risk of being removed in the new budget reconciliation bill. Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senators are being urged to protect these credits, which help the state’s economy, environment, and energy future.

According to Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, removing these credits could lead to the loss of 26,000 jobs in Pennsylvania by 2030. That number may rise by 2035 if the tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act are repealed. These incentives help clean energy projects like solar, wind, and battery storage grow.

""In Pennsylvania in particular, we found that the loss of the clean energy tax credits would lead to $60 per year in higher household energy bills by 2030 growing to $80 per year by 2035,"" said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling at Energy Innovation. ""That amounts to more than $2 billion more in spending on energy for Pennsylvanians between 2025 and 2035.""

Between 2025 and 2035, this would cost Pennsylvanians over $2 billion in energy expenses. The state could also lose $5 billion in GDP by 2030 and $6 billion by 2035.

""Solar energy made up 66% of the new electricity-generating capacity added to the grid last year,"" said Aaron Nichols, a solar expert at Exact Solar. ""As people have taken advantage of these incentives, the solar industry has grown, creating thousands of good-paying jobs.""

Mike Zimmerman from EDF Action shared that over $1 billion has already been invested in Pennsylvania’s clean energy projects. These include battery and solar manufacturing and grid technology. He added that 27 gigawatts of clean energy projects are waiting to connect to the grid.

Policy Uncertainty Impacts EV Battery Production

AESC cited “policy and market uncertainty” as the primary reason for halting the project, according to the company’s official statement. The Florence facility was set to produce battery cells for BMW, which is constructing its own battery assembly site near its auto plant in Greer, South Carolina.

The pause reflects broader concerns about the future of federal tax incentives for EV buyers and businesses, which could be scaled back under Trump’s administration.

South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster acknowledged the shifting landscape, urging caution: “What we’re doing is urging caution — let things play out because all of the changes are taking place,” he told reporters on Thursday.

The potential loss of EV tax breaks and new tariffs could increase costs for manufacturers like AESC, which operates facilities globally, including in China, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, and the U.S. (with a plant in Tennessee and another under construction in Kentucky). AESC has not indicated changes to its other U.S. operations, but the South Carolina pause signals a cautious approach to expansion amid regulatory uncertainty.

The Florence plant was a significant investment for South Carolina, promising 1,600 jobs and a $1.6 billion economic boost. The state had committed $135 million in grants through the South Carolina Department of Commerce and $121 million in bonds to support the project.

Despite the pause, state officials remain optimistic. The Department of Commerce stated that the construction halt would not prompt them to retract the financial incentives, signaling confidence in the project’s eventual resumption.

BMW, the primary customer for the Florence plant’s output, stated that AESC’s decision does not affect its plans to open its Greer battery assembly site in 2026. However, the pause could delay the supply chain for BMW’s EV production, potentially impacting timelines for new electric models. South Carolina has been a hub for EV manufacturing, with companies like Volkswagen-owned Scout Motors planning a $4 billion plant to build electric SUVs, set to open in 2027 and employ 10,000 workers. The state’s economic strategy relies heavily on such investments, but policy shifts could challenge this momentum.

Industry Trends and the Road Ahead

The EV sector in the U.S. is at a crossroads. Federal support, including tax credits for EV buyers, has driven growth in domestic battery production, but potential policy rollbacks could shift the landscape.

AESC’s decision highlights how sensitive the industry is to regulatory stability. Battery plants require significant upfront investment—$1.6 billion in this case—and long-term certainty to justify such expenditures. If tariffs on imported EV components rise, manufacturers may face higher costs, which could be passed on to consumers, slowing EV adoption.

Governor McMaster remains optimistic, emphasizing dialogue with the administration: “I think the goal of the president and the administration is to have robust economic growth and prosperity and there is no doubt there has to be changes made in our international trade posture and President Trump is addressing that,” he told reporters.

For now, AESC has not specified a timeline for resuming construction, leaving the future of the Florence plant—and its role in South Carolina’s EV ecosystem—uncertain. As the industry watches for policy clarity, stakeholders hope for a resolution that supports continued growth in EV manufacturing.

The assessments, published 4 June 2025, are now open for public comment and peer review—setting the stage for sweeping regulatory consequences across supply chains.

Unreasonable risks identified for workers and ecosystems

EPA's preliminary evaluation concluded that DBP poses risks in 25 of 40 analysed conditions of use (COUs), including exposures to workers and consumers, and one to the environment. Meanwhile, DEHP was found to present unreasonable risks in 33 COUs, particularly concerning occupational exposure and multiple environmental release scenarios.

Importantly, the evaluations do not account for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), though EPA notes PPE may help mitigate some risks. No general population risks were identified under current assumptions, nor were cumulative exposure thresholds exceeded for either substance.

Phthalates under the regulatory spotlight

DBP and DEHP are part of a five-chemical phthalate group under TSCA scrutiny. Alongside these, evaluations are progressing for butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), and dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP). These substances are commonly used as plasticisers across automotive, medical, consumer, and electronics sectors.

In addition to the two draft evaluations, EPA released several cross-cutting technical support documents (TSDs), including a revised cumulative risk analysis and draft carcinogenicity assessment. These documents are intended to harmonise regulatory decision-making across the group.

Key deadlines and next steps

Public comments are due by 4 August 2025, while comments intended for consideration by the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC) must be submitted by 21 July 2025 to the peer review docket (EPA-HQ-OPPT-2024-0551). A virtual peer review meeting will take place from 4–8 August 2025, where evaluations for DBP, DEHP, and DCHP, as well as cross-cutting documents, will be scrutinised.

EPA emphasised that no further peer review will be conducted for BBP and DIBP, as upcoming evaluations will incorporate SACC recommendations from the August session.

Implications across the manufacturing value chain

The findings may have significant regulatory and commercial consequences for sectors reliant on phthalate-based materials. Companies may need to revise their exposure assessments, product formulations, or supply chain transparency measures ahead of final determinations.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64412e3f91a2beff0381430e/6843126559642a7f50e94297_manufacturing-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 18:11:12.425067

The Louisiana lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars for alleged environmental harm from federally directed wartime activities, are precisely the kind of state overreach Trump’s order targets.
By threatening massive liabilities, these cases deter investment in Louisiana’s energy sector, particularly in LNG infrastructure critical to expanding export capacity.
The Louisiana lawsuits create uncertainty that could stall projects like terminal expansions and new production in the Gulf of Mexico.","The recent $745 million verdict against Chevron in Plaquemines Parish, in a case involving claims against the energy company for environmental damages, demonstrates how Louisiana’s coastal erosion lawsuits are a dangerous blend of legal overreach, political manipulation, and economic risk. Driven by trial attorneys exploiting a home court advantage, the cases jeopardize energy development and the broader economic health of Louisiana and the United States.

The Supreme Court should grant certiorari in Chevron v. Plaquemines Parish to correct the lower courts’ misapplication of the federal officer removal statute, curb the excesses of these lawsuits, and safeguard America’s energy future—especially under President Trump’s energy dominance agenda.

The pending certiorari petition asks the Supreme Court to resolve a growing split among circuit courts over the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. §1442(a)(1), and to overturn the Fifth Circuit’s flawed decision to remand these cases to state court. Expanded by a 2011 amendment, the statute allows civil actions “for or relating to any act under color of [federal] office”—that is, actions carried out under federal direction—to be removed from state to federal court.

In this case, Chevron and other petitioners—who want to keep the case in federal court—argue that their World War II-era crude oil production was conducted under federal contracts aimed at producing high-octane aviation gasoline (avgas), a resource critical to the Allied war effort. But a divided Fifth Circuit panel ruled that Chevron’s oil production was “unrelated” to those contracts because the federal government had not explicitly directed the company’s upstream crude extraction, which caused the environmental damage at issue. That decision was upheld in a narrow 7–6 vote denying en banc review.

This ruling revives a “causal-nexus” or “contractual-direction” test that Congress eliminated in 2011 when it modified the statue by adding “relating to” to the statute’s language. Under this narrower approach, removal to federal courts was allowed only if the defendant could show a direct cause-and-effect relationship (causal nexus) by proving that it acted under explicit government instructions (contractual direction). As Judge Andrew Oldham’s dissent highlighted, crude oil is the indispensable raw material for avgas, and Chevron’s production activities were closely tied to its federal obligations.

Most appellate courts have recognized that the 2011 amendment eliminated the causal-nexus requirement, permitting removal for actions “connected or associated” with federal directives. In contrast, the Second and Eleventh Circuits still apply the outdated test, and the Fifth Circuit’s decision adds further confusion by introducing a new “contractual-direction” standard.

The Supreme Court’s intervention is essential to clarify the statute’s scope and to ensure that federal contractors, especially those acting under wartime directives, are shielded from state court bias. The phenomenon of state courts acting unfairly against out-of-state actors to the detriment of interstate commerce as a whole has been recognized as far back as Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist Papers. The Fifth Circuit’s approach undermines Congress’s intent to provide a federal forum for such disputes, potentially discouraging private-sector cooperation with federal priorities. As amici General (Ret.) Richard Myers and Admiral (Ret.) Michael Mullen argued, denying a federal forum could deter firms from responding to the government’s call in times of national need, weakening national defense and energy security.

The Louisiana coastal lawsuits are orchestrated by trial attorneys, led by John Carmouche, who have tilted the playing field through political connections and gamesmanship. Carmouche has capitalized on ties with Louisiana’s Governor Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, both Republicans, to advance these cases. In 2016, then-Attorney General Landry signed a joint prosecution agreement with Carmouche, ceding significant control to private plaintiffs’ lawyers. This agreement, binding the state to reject any defenses raised by defendants, undermines the attorney general’s duty to impartially assess these cases.

Carmouche and his firm have also contributed at least $10,500 to Judge Michael Clement, who presided over the Plaquemines trial. Such contributions raise concerns about impartiality in a state court system already inclined to favor local interests. The plaintiffs’ strategy of filing in rural parishes like Plaquemines exploits this “home court advantage,” where juries may prioritize local concerns over national interests. As former attorney general William Barr’s recent letter to Murrill emphasized, these suits are more about enriching trial lawyers, who stand to gain massive fees from multibillion-dollar settlements, than about genuine environmental restoration.

The $745 million Plaquemines verdict is only the beginning. With interest, costs could exceed $1.1 billion. Plaquemines Parish has 20 other lawsuits pending, and 43 similar cases target oil and gas companies across Louisiana. If the Plaquemines verdict sets a precedent, settlements could reach tens of billions of dollars.

These lawsuits allege violations of Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA), claiming that oil production since the 1940s caused coastal erosion, despite SLCRMA’s grandfather clause exempting pre-1980 activities. Undermining the legal foundation for these claims, the Fifth Circuit ruled in New Orleans City v. Aspect Energy that SLCRMA does not apply retroactively to pre-1980 activities. Attorneys argue that pre-1980 operations were not “lawfully commenced” and that post-1980 unpermitted uses trigger liability for decades-old harms—a theory that contradicts the statute’s text and raises constitutional concerns about retroactivity and due process.

These lawsuits also directly undermine President Trump’s energy policy, which prioritizes American energy dominance through expanded domestic production and liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. On April 9, 2025, Trump issued an executive order, “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” which condemns states for imposing “arbitrary or excessive fines through retroactive penalties” on energy producers. The Louisiana lawsuits, seeking billions of dollars for alleged environmental harm from federally directed wartime activities, are precisely the kind of state overreach Trump’s order targets. By threatening massive liabilities, these cases deter investment in Louisiana’s energy sector, particularly in LNG infrastructure critical to expanding export capacity.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has underscored LNG’s role in national security and meeting the electricity demands of artificial intelligence infrastructure. The Louisiana lawsuits create uncertainty that could stall projects like terminal expansions and new production in the Gulf of Mexico. The Barr letter warns that these suits could constrain funding for Gulf production, hampering Trump’s goal of positioning the U.S. as a global energy leader. Moreover, the retroactive nature of these claims risks punishing companies for lawful actions taken decades ago, contradicting Trump’s push for a stable, business-friendly regulatory environment.

The suits will drive up energy costs for consumers. Companies facing massive liabilities will pass costs onto consumers through higher fuel prices. The threat of retroactive penalties also discourages new investment, further tightening supply and inflating prices. The Pelican Institute estimated in 2019 that Louisiana’s litigation risk has reduced oil well development by between 53 and 74 wells annually, costing the state $44 million to $113 million in economic activity. Consumers will bear the burden as companies divert resources to legal defense and settlements.

Louisiana’s support for these lawsuits signals a hostile business climate that threatens its economic future. The state’s economy has long depended on oil and gas activity, which provides jobs, revenue, and energy security. But the alliance between trial lawyers and political leaders prioritizes short-term expropriation over long-term economic stability.

The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association warned that the Plaquemines verdict “undermines Louisiana’s position as an energy leader.” Companies may relocate to states with more predictable regulatory frameworks, as Chevron did when it left California’s restrictive environment—only to face similar challenges in Louisiana. Litigation-driven instability could transform Louisiana from an energy hub into a cautionary tale for businesses.

The Supreme Court should grant certiorari to clarify the scope of the federal officer removal statute and shield federal contractors from state court bias. By allowing these cases to proceed in state courts, the Fifth Circuit has set a troubling precedent—one that threatens national energy policy and economic stability. The Court’s intervention is essential to ensure that justice, not local prejudice, prevails.",https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/chevron-v-plaquemines-parish-louisiana-coastal-erosion-lawsuits-trump-energy.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 19:09:08.033415

Meta has already stated that the PPA is not going to directly support a specific data center.

Moving Nuclear Power Forward

The Clinton Clean Energy Center, which began operations in 1987, had been facing financial challenges and had been slated for closure in 2017.

A temporary reprieve in the form of a state-funded zero-emission credit program provided temporary relief, but this support program is set to expire in 2027.

Meta's long-term commitment, with its 2027 start date for the PPA, effectively replaces the expiring state subsidies, ensuring the plant's continued operation.

The plant currently generates 1,121 MW of energy and the PPA includes plans to increase output by 30 MW, as part of the upgrade, maintenance, and development cycle for the facility.

Constellation made the news last September with the announcement that they would be working with Microsoft to restart the shut down Unit 1 at Three Mile Island, an 800 MW facility that was closed due to not being financially viable by 2019.

Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation, with the benefit of hindsight, pointed out the shortsightedness of that plant closure and the value of keeping the Clinton Clean Energy Center operational, saying:

SMR Potential at Clinton

The power from the Clinton plant will be added to the grid in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s (MISO) zone four territory, covering central and southern Illinois.

And perhaps more importantly, the long-term commitment to continued operation is encouraging Constellation to consider expanding operations on the site, with the company looking at strategies to expand the early site permit, or potentially join the next generation of power production by seeking a permit from the NRC to develop SMR [small modular reactor] or other Advanced Nuclear Reactor technologies on-site.

Clinton Mayor Helen Michelassi, who has seen the value of the plant and its jobs and tax revenue for her community, said:

Texas Legislature Moves Toward Encouraging Nuclear Power in the State

The Texas Legislature has recently approved House Bill 14, establishing a $350 million taxpayer-funded grant program to promote nuclear energy development in the state.

This initiative aims to position Texas as a leader in advanced nuclear technologies, particularly focusing on SMRs. This is, however, a very much “glass half full” result as the original pitch for the legislation suggested a $2 billion grant program.

The Governor's Office will oversee the nuclear energy fund and the grant program. This includes hiring a coordinator to assist qualifying programs in navigating federal regulations, aiming to expedite the permitting process.

SMR Nuclear a Moving Target

At this point in time, it does seem that the permitting process for next generation reactors is a bit of a moving target as there have been reports of pressure being put on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to both simplify and tighten up the permitting process.

Approximately 80% of the $350 million fund is designated to reimburse construction costs for operational nuclear reactors. The remaining funds are allocated for research and development initiatives.

The focus for all of the funding is supposed to be targeted at the development of SMR facilities within the state.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott believes that the funding would bolster Texas' nuclear manufacturing capacity, rebuild a domestic fuel cycle supply chain, and train the future nuclear workforce, going a long way to making Texas a leader in the nuclear power industry.

Several of the bills have already been introduced in the House as House Bills 4636-4640, and the remaining bills will be introduced next week.
“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Sen. Irwin said.
“Michigan enacted pollution cleanup laws because we had all too many examples of polluters who failed to do the right thing.
“Since my time on the Kent County Commission, I’ve worked to hold polluters accountable and prevent them from transferring that financial burden onto Michiganders.","LANSING, Mich (June 6, 2025) — Democratic legislators in both chambers of the Michigan Legislature are jointly introducing legislation to hold polluters accountable by requiring more thorough cleanups, making information about sites more available, and making it easier for those harmed by pollution to seek justice. The bills’ sponsors are Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) and Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), along with Sens. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield), Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Twp.), Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), and Reps. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit), Noah Arbit (D-West Bloomfield), Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth), Cynthia Neeley (D-Flint), and Phil Skaggs (D-East Grand Rapids). Several of the bills have already been introduced in the House as House Bills 4636-4640, and the remaining bills will be introduced next week.

“It’s shocking that Michigan law doesn’t require polluters to actually clean up their mess or even report all spills,” Sen. Irwin said. “This package will ensure more thorough cleanups and comprehensive spill reporting. I’m grateful to the many experts and stakeholders who helped us tailor these bills so that brownfield re-developers can continue to play their key role in cleaning up polluted sites. These bills put liability where it belongs: with the polluters, not the public.”

“For too long, corporations have dumped their messes on Michigan communities and left working people to pay the bill,” Rep. Morgan said. “If you pollute our water, poison our soil, or threaten public health — you pay to clean it up. It’s time we stand up for the people of Michigan and stop protecting billionaire corporations at public expense.”

Michigan’s Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act often enables polluters to restrict access to land or groundwater in lieu of cleaning up pollution. An ever-growing list of over 4,500 sites in Michigan features such land- or water-use restrictions. Environmental advocates and legislators have been working to strengthen Michigan’s pollution cleanup laws for decades.

The current Polluter Pay package was refined through an intensive stakeholder workgroup hosted by the Michigan Dept. of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) in the summer of 2024. Five of the six bills in the package passed the Senate last fall, but the House was not able to take them up before the end of the legislative session. The bills were re-introduced in the form they passed the Senate. Sen. McCann, one of the sponsors of the legislation and chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and the Environment, plans to hold a hearing on the bills next week.

“Michigan’s biggest polluters have been able to use bureaucratic barriers to essentially block updates to the cleanup criteria that say how much contamination is acceptable in our land and water,” Sen. Chang said. “We need this legislation so EGLE can update inputs to cleanup criteria as scientists learn more about the effects and exposure risks of different pollutants.”

“Michigan laws should protect residents, and the default response to a spill should be to clean it up, not fencing it off and letting it sit,” Sen. Moss said. “We know that contamination cleanup can be difficult, but the current law doesn’t even require polluters to try. The Polluter Pay legislation prioritizes removing contamination rather than simply issuing land and water use restrictions.”

“By the time we understood PFAS risks, the legal window to hold polluters accountable had already slammed shut,” Sen. McMorrow said. “For decades, manufacturers knew that even low levels of these ‘forever chemicals’ were dangerous and covered it up. We can’t let companies get away with poisoning Michigan just because they hid the evidence long enough.”

“When you’re notified a polluter has exposed you to a hazardous substance, of course, you want to find out if your health has been affected,” Sen. Shink said. “People already have the right to sue polluters who make them sick, but it often takes a while for the ill effects of a toxic exposure to manifest in a medical diagnosis. My bill would make polluters liable for the costs of medical monitoring to detect problems in the people they put at risk.”

“You don’t always know immediately that you have been harmed by pollution,” Sen. McCann said. “By starting the clock on polluters’ liability before the problem is detected, Michigan’s statute of limitations incentivizes coverups and penalizes people for not knowing they were being poisoned. My bill would, like federal law, start the clock on liability when a person finds out about the pollution so that they have a meaningful chance to seek justice.”

“We can’t continue to rely on the honor system when it comes to pollution,” Rep. Koleszar said. “Michigan enacted pollution cleanup laws because we had all too many examples of polluters who failed to do the right thing. Yet our current law still allows a polluter to release a hazardous substance, clean it up however they see fit, and never report it to anyone. House Bill 4640 would require reporting for all releases, because people have a right to know.”

“Polluters count on the fact that it’s hard for regular people to pay out of pocket for the kinds of testing and monitoring they need to prove that pollution has made them sick,” Rep. McKinney said. “You shouldn’t have to pay to find out how much a polluter has harmed you. House Bill 4637 would make polluters liable for medical monitoring so that people don’t have to shoulder these costs after being exposed to hazardous substances.”

“It is outrageous that many corporate polluters have successfully utilized government red tape to shirk their responsibilities to clean up harmful contamination — and leaving taxpayers to foot the bill,” Rep. Arbit said. “Michigan’s cleanup criteria for chemical substances are over 10 years out-of-date. House Bill 4638 will ensure Michigan no longer lags behind in protecting our residents from toxic substances.”

“People in my district know that you can’t always tell immediately when you’ve been exposed to dangerous levels of a chemical; some hazards, like lead, are not detectable by human senses alone,” Rep. Neeley said. “But in Michigan, the clock on your right to sue a polluter starts when they dump the chemicals. By the time you find out about it, you may have no way to hold that polluter accountable. My bill would set a common-sense standard that parallels the federal law: starting the clock when someone finds out about the pollution.”

“Unless we pass House Bill 4639, forever chemicals will mean forever costs for Michigan taxpayers,” Rep. Skaggs said. “Since my time on the Kent County Commission, I’ve worked to hold polluters accountable and prevent them from transferring that financial burden onto Michiganders. The pollution is still there in our water and land, but current law allows unethical businesses to avoid responsibility for cleaning it up because industrial polluters successfully concealed the dangers of PFAS for so long. The people of Michigan deserve to be able to sue for the damage emerging contaminants have done to our land and water. We all learned a basic rule in kindergarten: clean up your own mess. That simple truth should be the law of the land here in Michigan.”

On changes inside Ford workplaces House joined Ford about a year ago and became its CFO in recent months.
For example, when it named Liz Door as its chief supply chain officer in 2023.
House called her ""an amazing supply chain leader at the forefront of that thinking.""","Ford CFO Sherry House discussed the impacts of tariffs and supply chain disruptions on the company's production and costs.

House stated that Ford is working to mitigate potential production disruptions caused by export controls on rare earth minerals from China.

Ford is collaborating with suppliers to explore options for moving production to the U.S. to reduce tariff exposure.

Ford Motor Co.'s chief financial officer outlined how tariffs and supply chain disruptions are expected to impact Ford's vehicle production and its costs during a wide-reaching interview with a Wall Street analyst June 4.

Ford CFO Sherry House said the Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker will provide more details on the economic impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs and other policy changes in its second-quarter earnings next month. But she cautioned there are still many unknowns being sorted out, all of which could make Ford's upcoming financials ""a bit lumpy,"" she said.

""As we move into the next couple of weeks to prepare for the quarter, if we give guidance it will be in the caveats of what we can’t define,"" House said. ""If we don’t, we’re going to give you every piece of information that we feel we can to help you, other analysts and investors to understand the business as much as possible.”

Here are the top takeaways from House's fireside chat with analyst Joe Spak at the UBS Auto and Auto Tech Conference in New York on June 4:

On getting parts from out of the country

House said Ford has seen some backlogs to getting rare earth minerals into the supply chain, so Spak asked how that could impact vehicle production.

“There are many components that rare earth minerals are in and many of those that are coming from China require you to now go through export controls, so there’s an additional layer of administrative process that has to happen,"" House said.

She said sometimes the components pass through smoothly, other times there are holdups and that's when Ford has to take action to mitigate any disruptions.

""You have to look for alternative parts or alternative ways to get things,"" House said. ""Frequently, it goes through, it just may take more time. So then you might be facing expedited shipment costs that you weren’t anticipating and it just puts stress on a system that’s highly organized with parts being ordered many weeks in advance.""

She said Ford has been managing the issue so far, but warned, ""I don’t know if at some point this is going to be a larger issue for us?""

As for Trump's latest tariff: a boost in steel and aluminum to 50%, House said the impact on Ford should be minimal because Ford buys all its aluminum from domestic suppliers and it buys 80% of steel from U.S. sources. Ford will manage any price increases in steel through ""contract pricing,"" meaning prices have already been set.

""So when all of this hits, there is a delayed impact,"" she said.

On getting reimbursed for certain tariffs

On April 29, Trump signed an executive order that set up a complicated system of federal reimbursements on certain imports of auto parts and components for the next two years used in vehicles made in the United States. The order gives Detroit's automakers some relief from what Trump earlier had ordered — 25% tariffs on all imported autos which began in April and another 25% on all imported auto parts set to begin by May 3.

Spak asked House how Ford is getting the federal reimbursements for the parts that are compliant with the United States Mexico Canada Agreement as outlined in the order Trump signed at the end of April. She said a lot of that is still being defined.

""I don’t completely know,"" House said. ""So you’re paying the tariffs now. I think it’s very possible that there will be a delay in getting those offset. I’m talking about the parts offset. It could be by a quarter, it could be by a couple of quarters. But all of you who are looking at our financials in Q2, Q3 and Q4, are going to have to know that it’s going to be a bit lumpy. You might have more expense before you actually get the money reimbursed.”

On getting suppliers outside the U.S. to move here

The good news for Ford is 80% of the parts used on its vehicles are USMCA-compliant and 80% of the vehicles it sells in the United States are built here. Still, the automaker warned during its first-quarter earnings report that tariffs will add $1.5 billion in net costs this year.

For the 20% of suppliers who import parts, House said Ford is having conversations with them, seeking ways to help mitigate Ford's exposure to tariffs and lower those costs, while also meeting the business obligations of its suppliers.

“As we face the tariff situation, we face it together,"" House said of Ford's suppliers. ""The types of conversations we are having are around: Do you have additional capacity in the U.S.? Could you move to the U.S.? What types of investments might help you get there?”

But she explained that it is ""a very complex and nuanced situation"" with the supply base as to which suppliers to press for changes. Ford considers the kinds of quality, cost, technology and performance a supplier has provided in the past as to how it works with them around the tariffs, she said.

“But on an individual basis we’re decided whether or not it makes sense to make some of these changes,"" House said. ""I don’t have anything to announce with you right now, but, of course, you would look at some of your higher priced components first, items that affect more vehicles, that would be the order of operations.”

On finding partners for EV and battery production

House did not address a May 25 report in the Wall Street Journal that cited sources as saying Ford would share production space in its battery plant in Kentucky with rival Nissan. The move signals Ford's retrenchment from electric vehicle investments and it helps the Japanese automaker reduce its exposure to tariffs on imported vehicles and parts.

But House did say given the ""very competitive global landscape"" with companies having different needs and levels of technology, it makes sense to be thinking about partnerships so as to get more efficiency, especially if it is an area where Ford does not need to be No. 1. She said the automaker is ""absolutely open"" to doing more partnerships than the ones it currently has in place.

On changes inside Ford workplaces

House joined Ford about a year ago and became its CFO in recent months. When asked how she has seen the company change culturally, she listed a few ways:

First, Ford has started to put more specialists in roles as opposed to putting a really great generalist in roles. For example, when it named Liz Door as its chief supply chain officer in 2023. House called her ""an amazing supply chain leader at the forefront of that thinking.""

House said she has challenged Ford to think about ""not letting your governance define what the pace of the business is going to be.""

""What happens is big companies … you have weekly meetings on a topic, you have monthly meetings on topic, you have quarterly meetings on a topic. What happens when you set up your business that way is you are running to that governance structure and you’re only doing the work to get ready for that weekly meeting or monthly meeting,"" House said. ""But if you can step back and let the priorities define the pace versus the governance structure, the business define the pace, I think you can go a lot faster and you can make sure you’re focused on the right things.”

She said Ford also has looked to ""break boundary constraints"" in its strategy meetings.

""If you’re having meetings with just one function, a lot of times you can’t break the boundary constraints because you don’t have everybody in the room that can tell you can do something. So you feel like you can’t,"" House said. ""So having more cross functional meetings as well. These are all tactics that can make a difference.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/04/USNK/84037278007-20250416-t-211035-z-733222701-rc-24-zday-8-uh-8-rtrmadp-3-autoshownewyork.JPG?crop=4979,2801,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-06 18:12:42.159148

The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025 would make the world’s largest sources of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels financially responsible for the damage caused by wildfires, droughts and other events exacerbated by the warming climate.

The idea adopts the “Superfund” model — created by Congress in 1980 to clean up the nation’s worst toxic waste sites — and applies it to greenhouse gases, aiming to hold companies financially accountable for emissions that drive climate change.

New York and Vermont have already enacted similar measures despite massive opposition from the oil and gas industry.

But the proposed California legislation has stalled since April, even as environmental groups — galvanized by the death and destruction of the January Los Angeles wildfires — have made it a top priority.

Identical versions in both legislative houses have sat idle in Assembly and Senate committees despite a full-court press by supporters framing the superfund as a solution to California’s $12 billion budget deficit. The bills passed out of their first committees but have not advanced further.

“Nobody can afford the kind of financial crisis that the climate crisis has caused,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, one of the authors, told CalMatters. “Oil caused the climate crisis, in large part … they lied about it as they caused the damages, and it's time for them to come to the table and create more affordability for the very people that they've harmed.”

The funds would be earmarked for paying for community disaster preparedness, such as evacuation planning and emergency housing, as well as energy efficiency, zero-emission fleets and charging, and natural resource protection, among other projects, according to the bill.

Opposition includes oil companies and major business groups. In addition, despite worsening wildfires and floods, many Californians have been increasingly voicing concern that the state’s climate policies are driving up gas and electricity costs.

Oil and gas industry lobbying has been fierce. Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, the industry’s top lobbying group in the West, said in a statement that the measures were “misguided proposals to retroactively punish companies for providing a legal product that was, and remains, critical to our state's economy.""

He said that ""at a time when Californians are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, these bills will likely result in massive price increases for gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity and consumer goods.""

The climate superfund also faces resistance from a powerful ally of Big Oil: California’s State Building and Construction Trades Council, a key union that has repeatedly backed the industry’s positions, as CalMatters has previously reported.

Earlier this year, the council also opposed legislation by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, that would have allowed residents to sue oil companies for climate damages.

In April, Keith Dunn, a lobbyist for the trades union, told an Assembly committee that the climate superfund would drive up energy prices, kill middle-class jobs and act as a stealth tax on working families. “The affordability gap is widening,” Dunn told lawmakers. “It's not by chance, it's by choice.”

Both measures include “urgency” provisions, which allow them to take effect immediately if passed by a two-thirds vote and signed by the governor. That higher threshold makes them less vulnerable to certain legal challenges and exempts them from the usual legislative deadlines. (Most bills must clear their house of origin by today.)

“There was quite a bit of opposition earlier in the year so we're continuing those conversations,” Addis said. “We have time to have those conversations.”

The bill would make companies pay for emissions from “the extraction, production, refining, sale, or combustion, including by third parties, of fossil fuels or petroleum products,” which includes oil, gas and coal.

Bill targets multinational corporations

The bill applies to companies that emit more than a billion metric tons of global emissions from 1990 through 2024 — that means multinational oil and gas corporations. Within three months of the law taking effect, the agency would publish a list of companies that would pay into the fund.

There are no official estimates as to how much companies would pay. The legislation would require the California Environmental Protection Agency to estimate costs from past and projected climate damages to people, governments, ecosystems and infrastructure every five years through 2045, using peer-reviewed science.

“It is imperative that we make polluters that caused a large percentage of the climate crisis pay for the thing that they knowingly caused,” said Maya Golden-Krasner, an attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, which has sponsored the California bills. “They've known that this would cause damage since at least the 1950s, they knew that these greenhouse gases would be regulated since the 1990s and they've been gaslighting us all the way and blocking climate regulation.”

The climate superfund fight is part of a broader national movement against major oil companies that is playing out in legislatures and courtrooms across America.

California is leading efforts to hold oil companies accountable in court for climate change, recycling a legal strategy deployed during the 1990s, when states alleged that tobacco companies knew cigarettes cause cancer.

Trump-era politics have also been at issue. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting state climate programs, specifically calling out Vermont's and New York’s polluter-pays laws and threatening legal action against California’s landmark cap-and-trade program.

Backers say the climate superfund is a fair solution to California’s budget crunch as well as a long-overdue reckoning for an industry that knowingly caused the climate crisis.

But the plan — which could cause oil and gas companies to pay billions for emissions over the last three decades — faces an uphill battle in Sacramento.

Last year, Californians voiced strong opposition to plans to overhaul one of its cornerstone climate programs, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which could push gasoline prices higher. Last week, Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Democrat from Bakersfield, called for California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, who led the board in its passage of that measure, to resign over cost concerns.

Likely to trigger a legal onslaught

If enacted, the climate superfund would almost certainly trigger a wave of legal challenges. Donald Sobelman, a San Francisco environmental attorney, told CalMatters that the bill is legally ambitious — and is almost certainly headed for a courtroom challenge if it passes.

The Trump administration, for instance, sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund measures, arguing they are unconstitutional.

Another potential legal argument, Sobelman said, is that the measure could charge companies now for pollution emitted years or even decades ago. Another is that the measure could act like a tax, which could make it easier to challenge in California court without two-thirds approval by the Legislature.

And some judges may question whether the science linking the emissions to worsening fires and other climate events is strong enough to single out specific companies for climate damage, leading to the “classic battle of the experts,” Sobelman said.

In addition, courts could determine that consumers hold some responsibility for their actions, such as driving cars and trucks powered by fossil fuels, and that other industries around the world, such as power plants and farms, also emit a lot of greenhouse gases.

A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to tell CalMatters whether he supports the measure.

In his May budget proposal, the governor adopted “polluters pay” language to rally support for an existing California climate program, cap-and-trade, which raises money by selling pollution credits to companies.

The debate is unfolding amid a worsening budget crisis in which lawmakers are under pressure to find new revenue sources — especially ones that don’t involve tax hikes on Californians. Supporters of the Superfund Act argue that the bill offers a “polluter-pays” principle rather than new taxes.

Newsom’s budget proposal said extending cap and trade “aligns with the polluter-pays principle in which carbon emitters will fund the state’s world-class forestry and fire protection programs in the face of wildfires that have become increasingly destructive because of climate change.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/97fb8d5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1412x741+0+98/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F95%2F3b%2F4c4d12b547f0b8def957b40743dc%2Fscreenshot-2025-06-06-092513.png,N,,2025-06-06 19:09:12.269457

LEOPOLD, Ind. (AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state, including members of Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life, aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

The version of the One Big Beautiful Bill that passed the House would eliminate them.
The One Big Beautiful Bill takes aim at EVs in other ways.
WGLT asked Kontou what inside the One Big Beautiful Bill would impact Rivian most.
Whether those secondary impacts actually happen depends on if the One Big Beautiful Bill actually passes.","On the surface, legislation that kills the $7,500 tax credit for new electric-vehicle purchases doesn’t look like a big deal for Rivian.

As of this year, consumers who buy a new Rivian R1T pickup or R1S SUV made in Normal aren’t getting the tax credit anyway. That’s because the price tag for a new Rivian is above the $80,000 cap to get the credit. (Business buyers could still get it.)

But the fate of the EV industry – and, indirectly, the Bloomington-Normal economy – is a lot more interconnected than that one thing. That means there’s a lot at stake for the Twin Cities in the House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill, which would cut incentives for EVs.

“Any impact on consumer demand, or the supply of vehicles, or the supply of infrastructure can have great ramifications on how fast we can transition to electric vehicles,” said Eleftheria Kontou, an assistant professor in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has studied EV demand.

Currently, buyers can get up to $7,500 in tax credits for certain new EV purchases, and $4,000 for a used EV.

The version of the One Big Beautiful Bill that passed the House would eliminate them. They've long been a target of President Trump and other Republicans who consider them wasteful spending. They argue the market, not the government, should determine what people drive.

A Princeton study estimated that if the tax credits are repealed and federal emissions regulations are cut, as the White House has signaled it also plans to do, sales of EVs in 2030 could be 40% lower than they would have been. Kontou tends to agree.

“There’s of course still market momentum, because consumers understand the electric vehicles are cheaper to operate. They’re much more energy efficient. And there are other performance benefits. If you drive an EV, you know how easy they accelerate. It’s a different experience,” Kontou said.

One criticism of EV tax credits is that they primarily help wealthier car buyers, because new EVs are expensive. Kontou says even that can have positive trickle-down effects.

“They can bring down the prices of batteries, because demand increases. [They] help solidify the market so that you can justify investments in building electric vehicles. And, of course, as more and more people become familiar with electric vehicles, prices drop, then a greater set of consumer segments can access these vehicles. We can see that this happened very fast in the past 10 years,” Kontou said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill takes aim at EVs in other ways. It would also add a new $250 annual fee for EV drivers, hypothetically meant to correct for the fact that EV drivers don't pay gas taxes.

However, Consumer Reports has calculated that the proposed fee is more than three times what a typical driver of a new gas-powered car pays in gas tax. Kontou is also skeptical of the $250 math.

“I’m not convinced the comparison is fair. We’d need to see that that is the case,” she said.

WGLT asked Kontou what inside the One Big Beautiful Bill would impact Rivian most. She theorized it might be disinvestment in charging infrastructure.

Indeed, Illinois’ chief EV officer Megha Lakhchaura says the legislation would eliminate a 30% tax credit for charging stations in specific areas. She says the areas most affected will be primarily rural communities and underserved regions that currently lack adequate EV infrastructure. She's urging developers and utilities to move quickly and get charging stations installed by Dec. 31 so they don't lose that tax credit.

“Consumer could be left perplexed with charging decisions. And this could impact accessibility for them, and I’d foresee that Rivian and other auto manufacturers will be affected by these secondary impacts,” Kontou said.

Whether those secondary impacts actually happen depends on if the One Big Beautiful Bill actually passes.

As the saying goes, “the Stone Age didn’t end because we ran out of stones,” and neither are we moving away from coal because we’ve run out of coal. And yet, Pres. Donald Trump is trying to revive the dying industry with Executive Orders (EOs) and presidential pardons for toxic polluters, including coal mining corporations and NorthWestern Energy.

On his first day in office, Pres. Trump signed an EO declaring an energy emergency and directed federal agencies to do everything possible to expedite the “leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources,” particularly on federal lands. Of course, his definition of energy resources excluded the most affordable, clean, and abundant energy resources on earth today – wind and solar.

While Pres. Trump was elevating fossil fuels, he was also signing EOs targeting wind energy. One EO stopped off-shore wind projects and put the brakes on wind development across the country. His actions threatened the vibrant wind energy industry and the enormous opportunity we have for further clean energy development in Montana.

In late March, polluters were told they could email the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requesting exemptions from toxic air pollution standards. On April 8, Pres. Trump issued another series of EOs and proclamations aimed at coal. He granted scores of industrial polluters a two-year waiver from toxic air pollution standards, including the Colstrip power plant, which has the highest rate of toxic emissions of any coal plant in the country. The waiver was issued with complete disregard for technology, public health, aquatic resources or wildlife. As a result, people near and downwind from the Colstrip plant will continue to experience higher levels of lead and arsenic than other coal communities in the nation. While every similar power plant in the country has already installed pollution controls limiting toxic air pollution, Montanans will pay the price of this delay with their health, water resources, aquatic life, and wildlife.

The EO didn’t just grant a two-year waiver from toxic air pollution requirements; It also directed EPA to revise the rule and eliminate the requirement that these plants reduce toxic pollution – even if they have the ability to do so. This puts Montanans’ health in the crosshairs despite technology being readily available to protect people from air toxins.

Other EOs claimed that “[c]oal is abundant and cost-effective, and can be used in any weather condition.” First, the plant is only cost-effective compared to nuclear and NorthWestern’s new gold-plated methane gas plant near Laurel. The Colstrip plant is anything but cost-effective, especially when you consider the annual cost of fuel, maintenance, and operations, and eventual cost of cleanup. The EO also ignores the Colstrip plant’s abysmal record of operations during times of extreme weather. In recent years, the plant has been partially or entirely offline during extreme weather events, costing customers a fortune because NorthWestern had to buy power from the market when it was the most expensive.

Some of the EOs try to claim that reopening closed coal plants or extending the life of uneconomic plants is a matter of “energy security.” But these EOs encourage the overseas sale of coal and do nothing to stop the flow of oil and gas resources to overseas markets. If energy security were the concern, the orders would have mandated increased production of renewable energy resources and prohibited the export of coal, oil, and gas. But instead, the orders did the opposite.

One of the EOs directed the Department of Interior (DOI) to prioritize and expedite coal leasing on public lands despite the dramatic decline in coal production over the last 20 years due to competition with cleaner resources. In response, the Interior Secretary issued orders to the agency to approve the environmental impact statement for new coal mine expansions within 28 days, ignoring the time it takes to determine baseline conditions, analyze water resources, consider community impacts and concerns, or protect public health and water resources.

There have even been rumors of EOs that would target nonprofits that work on environmental issues, promote climate action, or oppose the bolstering of the coal industry. Rest assured that, in the case of such an EO, MEIC will continue to advocate for clean air, clean water, sustainable communities, justice, and a livable climate. We will speak out against those who weaponize authority, and we stand firmly united with our fellow environmentalists and nonprofit advocates who work to provide vital services across this country.

Ultimately, these energy EOs are just a wishlist for an uncompetitive industry and a power-hungry administration. Most of the published orders will be implemented through rules adopted by the EPA and DOI. These and future rules will be subject to judicial challenge where courts will hopefully hold the administration in check and require it to comply with the laws adopted by Congress and signed by previous Presidents.

I wanted to share a brief update on the current status at the Capitol. As I mentioned in my last update, just before the midnight deadline on May 19, the Minnesota House officially adjourned the 2025 regular legislative session. We successfully passed many of our key budget bills in time, sending them to the Governor’s desk for his signature. However, about ten remaining components of the budget were still tied up in negotiations. As a result, we’ll need to return for a brief special session to complete our work.

Special sessions aren’t unusual in budget years, especially when government control is divided. In fact, the only recent budget year we avoided one was in 2023, when DFL leadership in the House, Senate, and Governor’s office collaborated to pass one of the most impactful budgets in state history.

Just before I sent this out today, an agreement was reached between House & Senate leadership and the Governor that a special session will start next Monday, June 9th, at 10:00 am.

So the next time I send out an update, it will be about how the special session was completed!

Wildfires and our Air Quality

The recent poor air quality across our community is yet another stark reminder of the growing impacts of climate change. The thick haze from wildfire smoke is becoming an all-too-familiar sight.

Climate change fuels hotter, drier conditions, which drive more frequent and intense wildfires. According to the World Resources Institute, forest fires are now destroying more than twice as much tree cover as they did just 20 years ago. The trend is only worsening as global temperatures continue to rise.

Minnesota is on the frontlines. The northern part of our state is part of the northern boreal forest, one of the regions warming faster than the global average. Alarmingly, 70% of all wildfire-related tree loss worldwide is happening in boreal regions like northern Minnesota.

We can’t afford to ignore this. Bold climate action is no longer optional. It’s urgent. Much of what we did this year in the Energy and Transportation Committees is fight against rollbacks of key climate policies passed in prior years. While we were largely successful, it also is a lost opportunity to keep making progress on climate action.

Clean Energy = Jobs

While wildfire smoke reminds us of the urgent need to tackle climate change, we’re also seeing positive action right here in Minnesota. Just a few days ago, I joined the House DFL Energy team at the ribbon cutting for Heliene’s new solar module manufacturing line in Rogers, MN.

This expansion means 220 new clean energy jobs and over 500 megawatts of solar production capacity each year, which is enough to power thousands of homes. As our Senator Amy Klobuchar said at the event, she “loved the sound of Minnesota jobs.” So do I!

Clean energy isn't just about reducing emissions. It's about creating good-paying jobs, lowering electricity costs, improving air quality, and building a stronger, more resilient economy. Minnesota is proving that we don’t have to choose between economic growth and climate action. We can and must do both.

Happy Pride Month!

As we celebrate Pride, we reaffirm our commitment to making Minnesota a welcoming, inclusive, and affirming place for everyone, no matter who you are or who you love.

While some national figures and extremist movements work to roll back hard-won rights and target LGBTQ+ youth and communities, here in Minnesota we’re standing firm.

HARRISBURG, Pa. – With Congress rolling back numerous federal clean energy programs, hundreds of Pennsylvanians joined PennEnvironment’s annual virtual “citizen lobby day.” New data shows the Keystone State ranking a lowly 49th in the nation for growth in renewable energy over the past decade, making it even more important for constituents to lobby their state senators and representatives to fill the potential federal funding gap.

“Red, blue and purple states are all diving in and taking advantage of the clean energy opportunities readily available in their states. But Pennsylvania is falling far behind in the renewable energy race,” noted PennEnvironment Deputy Director Flora Cardoni. “It’s time for the Keystone State to stop being a clean energy laggard, and implement the policies needed to make it a clean energy leader.”

Over the course of the day, nearly 400 constituents from Erie to Philadelphia and everywhere in between met with their respective state legislators from 65 different (more than one quarter of the) state House and Senate districts. This cross-section of Pennsylvanians called on their state legislators to pass the package of energy conservation and clean energy policies put forth in Gov. Josh Shapiro’s energy plan — often referred to as the Lightning Plan.

The plan includes proposals to increase the amount of clean, renewable energy that utility companies must supply in Pennsylvania; expand the state’s cornerstone energy conservation program to reduce energy consumption and save Pennsylvanians money on their utility bills; reduce climate pollution from the state’s largest global warming polluters; authorize community energy, which will allow residents to access and jointly share solar energy resources; and streamline the process for wind and solar projects to come online faster, to help deliver more clean energy.

“PennEnvironment’s annual virtual citizen lobby day is a simple and effective way for concerned Pennsylvanians to have their voices heard about the environmental and energy issues that affect their lives and they care so deeply about,” said Cardoni. “That’s why so many residents take time out of their busy schedules to call on their elected officials to implement policies to expand clean energy, improve energy efficiency, reduce climate and air pollution, and protect our children and future generations.”

The day also included a virtual rally featuring cosponsors of Lighting Plan legislation, including state Sen. Judy Schwank, as well as Jessica Shirley, the acting secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection

“Climate change is causing more frequent and severe extreme weather events, putting Pennsylvania communities in harm’s way,” said Senator Judy Schwank. Substantive action to address our over-reliance on fossil fuels and meet our need for clean, renewable energy is long overdue. Community Energy is just one of many policies we can enact at the state level to modernize Pennsylvania’s energy agenda and ensure we protect our environment for future generations.”

This year’s citizen climate action lobby day is co-sponsored by PennPIRG, Solar United Neighbors, Vote Solar Action Fund, POWER Interfaith, Sierra Club PA, Clean Air Action Fund, KEEA, Lutheran Advocacy Ministry in PA, Audubon Mid-Atlantic, PA-IPL, Evergreen Action, Third Act PA and more.

A report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) said that the industry currently contributes $18 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product and supports over 122,000 manufacturing jobs.

The industry is primed to grow to 579,000 jobs and an $86 billion increase to GDP by 2030. It would provide $42 billion in earnings to American workers, said the report.

ACP said clean energy manufacturing jobs pay an average of $42,000 more than the typical American worker’s salary. This is especially true in solar, where direct manufacturing job salaries averaged $134,000 in 2024, said the report.

Solar manufacturing

Solar manufacturing alone supports 75,400 jobs across 90 facilities, $5.9 billion in earnings and $11.5 billion in GDP, according to the report.

For active facilities, the United States currently has 35 module manufacturing sites, 25 tracker manufacturing facilities, seven for racking, 13 for inverters, three solar cell facilities, one ingot and wafer fabrication and four sites producing solar-grade polysilicon.

Today, the United States has over 20 GW of active module manufacturing capacity and 3 GW of cell capacity directly supporting the utility-scale sector. This leaves a 25% gap for module demand and 75% gap for cell demand for manufacturers to fill. However, if all announced projects come online as planned, total utility-scale module capacity could exceed 75 GW and cell manufacturing could reach 40 GW, enough to meet projected demand, said ACP.

Further upstream, the United States currently has no commercial-scale solar ingot and wafer manufacturing capacity. However, Qcells and Corning are building facilities that together would add 6 GW to the domestic supply chain of ingots and wafers. If all announced projects move forward, the United States could reach 15 GW of ingot and wafer capacity for utility-scale solar by 2030, said ACP.

As for solar-grade polysilicon, the producers in the United States supplied 4.5 GW – equivalent of material in 2024, with expectations to reach 10 GW by 2030, said ACP.

The full report tracks manufacturing output, jobs and economic impact for solar, wind and energy storage manufacturing.

Policy

The trade association made several policy recommendations to maintain manufacturing momentum:

Preserving energy tax credits (45X, 45Y, 48C, 48E)

Ensuring executive orders on energy and critical minerals security appropriately leverage demand from downstream manufacturers

Create a stable and strategic trade environment

“When tariffs are used to counter unfair trade practices, they must be phased in over time and be sector-specific to avoid inadvertently raising costs and suppressing demand for American businesses, including domestic manufacturers,” said the report.

Facilitating a true all-of-the above energy strategy

“ACP estimates that the U.S. will require up to 50% more power on the grid in the next 15 years. Traditional energy sources, while necessary, are not enough to meet near-term needs. Solar, wind and energy storage are immediately available and will ensure that the cost of U.S. energy—including costs for energy-intensive domestic manufacturing processes—remains low.”

Streamlining permitting

“The Administration and Congress should establish clear, predictable, standardized permitting timelines across agencies and technologies, streamline permitting processes, align judicial review requirements (e.g., FAST-41) for manufacturing and energy projects with other sectors, and expedite high-impact transmission projects.”

Bottom line

Over 73% of the 800-plus active manufacturing facilities in the United States are located in Republican districts. Despite this, the budget resolution bill moving through Congress makes drastic cuts to tax credit support for the industry, threatening 94,000 manufacturing jobs across the nation, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The One Big, Beautiful Bill will next head to the Senate for negotiations, marking the last opportunity for legislators to avoid causing massive job losses and an estimated $286 billion in lost investment.

But not all SAFs are created equal. With a potential to slash aviation’s CO₂ emissions by more than 90%, e-kerosene (also known as e-SAF) is the only scalable and sustainable option in the long term.

Despite a strong regulatory framework under the Fit for 55 package and ReFuelEU Aviation, e-SAF projects in the EU have yet to reach Final Investment Decision (FID). This is due to high capital and operational costs, a lack of long-term offtake agreements, and insufficient revenue certainty — a market failure that existing EU mechanisms have not been able to resolve.

The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) presents a unique and timely opportunity to correct this imbalance. By focusing its support on the most strategic SAF pathway – e-SAF – the STIP can catalyse the deployment of clean aviation fuels while boosting the EU’s industrial competitiveness, energy independence, and jobs.

To do so, the STIP should embed a comprehensive mechanism, such as a European Hydrogen Clearing House (EHCH). The EHCH would operate through double-sided auctions, matching fuel producers and buyers (e.g. airlines), while ensuring price stability and demand aggregation. This would de-risk production through long-term contracts and contract for differences for e-SAF, enabling scale-up while ensuring alignment with the EU’s competitiveness goals.

CEO Alex Urist of XCharge, which makes battery-integrated chargers, raised the issue in an interview with Charged (see our Oct-Dec 2023 issue).
The company recently introduced a line of EV chargers that can handle a variety of input voltages, including 240 V single-phase and 208 V/240 V three-phase—all in the same box, without derating the charger.
At that time there were a lot of customer comments from some of the incumbents in the DC fast charger space.
Inside of the charger there’s this big open space for ease of installation, and in this area are what we call configurable busbars.","Power Innovations International’s new line of DC fast chargers can accept a wide range of input voltages.

The utility connection bottleneck has become the bête noire of the EVSE world. But sometimes the problem isn’t getting enough power, but rather getting the right kind of power—and sometimes the real bottleneck is getting the transformers and switchgear needed to work around these issues.

Power Innovations International has a solution—its new line of EV chargers can handle a wide range of input voltages, eliminating the need for step-up transformers and 480 V switchgear, which can translate to big savings of time and money.

Pii’s new chargers have several other features that customers have been asking for, including a modular architecture that’s designed to simplify installation and improve reliability.

There are three things everyone in the EV industry seems to agree on: (1) we need more charging infrastructure; (2) it needs to be more reliable; and (3) installation often takes much too long. Project delays very often have to do with getting a site connected to the grid, but it isn’t (always) the fault of local utilities—high demand for essential power equipment such as transformers and switchgear has created a shortage, and wait times can stretch into months or even years.

In addition to equipment shortages, many sites have problems obtaining the right kind of power. The majority of DC fast chargers on the market today require 480-volt, 3-phase power, instead of the 208 V and 240 V supplies found at many commercial and residential properties. And there are some areas in the US where 480 V is simply not available.

Several EVSE industry pros have told us that this is a major bottleneck. CEO Alex Urist of XCharge, which makes battery-integrated chargers, raised the issue in an interview with Charged (see our Oct-Dec 2023 issue). If 480 V isn’t available at your site, you’ll need an extra piece of equipment called a buck-boost transformer to step the voltage up to what you need. Charging industry consultant Forest Williams told us that this item can cost thousands of dollars, and the lead time for obtaining the necessary switchgear can stretch to months.

EVSE manufacturer Power Innovations International (Pii) has a solution. The company recently introduced a line of EV chargers that can handle a variety of input voltages, including 240 V single-phase and 208 V/240 V three-phase—all in the same box, without derating the charger. This eliminates the need for step-up transformers and 480 V switchgear, which can translate to big savings of time and money.

Charged spoke with Nick Stone, Pii’s Product and Market Manager.

Charged: What’s the origin story behind your new EVFC line of chargers?

Nick Stone: Pii was started in 1997 as a small business in Utah, and developed a rugged, reliable type of UPS product, focusing on industrial applications. [Taiwanese electronics company] Lite-On acquired Pii in 2013. In the 2020-2021 timeframe, there was an opportunity to complement that business with what Pii can do. Lite-On has a number of Level 2 chargers, but Lite-On didn’t have a Level 3 charger. With DC fast charging, of course, we’re integrating power conversion to convert AC to DC, and that’s one of the core competencies that Pii offers.

At that time there were a lot of customer comments from some of the incumbents in the DC fast charger space. We listened to some of that feedback and tried to understand what customers were saying about their chargers. Of course, uptime is certainly imperative, but we wanted to add some other features.

We spent some time around 2022 developing some rectifiers that we use across our product lines, and leveraging the same power supply topology that Lite-On uses in the data center space. This gives us one million hours demonstrated MTBF [Mean Time Between Failures, a measure of reliability] within the data center. We wanted to take that same type of power supply topology that’s been demonstrated in mission-critical applications and integrate that into a DC fast charger.

One of the things that our firmware team does is a lot of embedded control. One of the competitors in this space builds a UL 508 A panel where your power supply and power meter are DIN rail-mounted, and you open it up and it’s a maze of wires. We wanted to take all the control and the power conversion that’s doing the auxiliary power and integrate that into one solution that sits on top of our power conversion. We spent some time developing that to where you take AC power coming into our power conversion block, measure the AC power, do all your low-voltage conversion—12, 24 and 48 volts for all the internal power needs and the auxiliary loads—bring that down to our power supplies, bring it back up through the high-voltage line, back through that same controller, and to the CCS1 output.

Charged: The low-voltage auxiliary loads are things like the video screen and the user interface?

Nick Stone: Yes. Our modem, the display, the buttons, the e-stop, the heat exchangers—all of those are coming from a central power supply that’s built in. There’s no need for a separate DIN rail power supply or a whole bunch of other wiring. Conversion of any type of AC voltage is a core competency that Lite-On has, and we integrated that into our overall design. We don’t have external wires come and go to the power supply, then come out and feed all these loads—we’re doing it all in an integrated, clean solution.

Now, of course, we need an enclosure, we need thermal management, environmental protection, a display, some type of user interface. That’s where we spent some time listening to customers and installer partners. They were saying, “I don’t like to do filter replacements.” Okay, we will integrate that into our design. We will have a way to do thermal management that requires no maintenance.

They were saying, “I need this thing to be easy to install.” How do we do that? One key is having a very wide space to land your cables, so you can do any type of configuration when you’re doing the installation. With a lot of space, you don’t need tweezers. Even if you’re doing 60 kilowatts, 240 single-phase, for instance, your cable bending space, you could struggle with that during the installation.

That was one of the key messages that we heard. Another was, when we’re in existing infrastructure, they don’t always have 480-volt power available. They may only have 208, 240 single-phase or delta, so they have to buy a step-up transformer. That’s another pain point that we heard: “I can buy a charger with maybe six months of lead time, but I have to wait two years to get my transformer.” We came up with a way, which we have a patent pending on, to accommodate any standard US installation voltage out there. We can do 208, 240 delta, 240 single-phase, 480 delta [a form of three-phase that doesn’t have a neutral], 480 wye, all in the same charger.

Accommodating the available power can help speed up getting the chargers into the ground. If you’re looking at a hotel or a car dealership or a gas station, they’re probably not going to be installing ten DC fast chargers, so they don’t want to get that additional transformer. In some cases, you would have to pour a pad, get a primary and secondary disconnect, and depending on who owns that station, you might have to get a meter socket to branch off power. There’s a lot of different variables, and we have seen instances where doing that can double your project cost.

Charged: Our Chloe Theobald spoke to your Global Sales Manager Tim Rees at the 2024 ACT Expo, and he explained that Pii’s chargers are based on a modular power architecture that can keep them delivering electrons even if individual modules fail.

Nick Stone: It’s similar to a data center type of architecture. If a power supply goes down, it doesn’t take the rest of the system down. For example, we have nine modules in our 30 kW charger. If one does go down, the other eight are still operational. You’re running at 26.7 kilowatts instead of 30, but your whole station doesn’t go down. And to replace a power supply, the module slides right in and out in a matter of seconds. Any other type of charger, you have to take that whole 30 or 40 or 50 kW block out, and it’s a pretty serious level of effort. For us, we ship out another module, you take the top off, there’s a little tab that you pull out, slide another one in, and you’re back up and running at full capacity.

Charged: Your chargers can accept not only a wide range of voltages on the input side, but on the output side too, so they can already accommodate the new EVs that are moving to 800-volt systems.

Nick Stone: Correct. We have the dual drivetrain in our rectifier that can do that. Some of the first Hyundai/Kia 800-volt vehicles out there, we’ve already been charging those for a couple years now. We know that’s where the industry’s heading, because you can lower your current and increase your overall power.

Charged: It all seems like a no-brainer. You’ve got a charger that can eliminate the need for a transformer. Why isn’t every EVSE manufacturer offering that?

Nick Stone: I’ll say a couple things. One, we’re one of the only ones that are vertically integrated in this space, so we are able to configure our power supplies to the application that we have. And looking at the power supply topologies that are used in the data center space, we have to have a wide input range to accommodate that market segment. Also, the way we’ve arranged our rectifiers within what we call our power shelf is a proprietary arrangement, and that’s something we do have a pending patent on.

Now, there are a few manufacturers that can take a 240 delta input, but you’re derating the amount of power. For instance, if you go to that 30-kilowatt charger, it’s 30 kilowatts if you feed it 480 three-phase. You can apply 240 to it, but you may derate to maybe 22 or 24 kilowatts of power. We’re the only ones that we’ve seen that can take any of those different input voltages without derating the amount of power. So, if you buy 30 kilowatts or 60 kilowatts or 120 kilowatts, you get what you bought.

Charged: And whoever’s installing the chargers can easily choose the input voltage that they need.

Nick Stone: Yes. It’s not something you have to do with firmware or anything like that, it’s actually a mechanical way that we do that. Inside of the charger there’s this big open space for ease of installation, and in this area are what we call configurable busbars. This is something that is smaller than the palm of your hand. It’s a very easy process. All three of these are available in every charger that we sell, so when the electrician or the installer sees what input voltage they have available, they simply pick the appropriate voltage. It’s printed right on the front of the busbar.

Charged: Considering that this can save money and time, and increase reliability, do you foresee that your competitors are going to start doing this too?

Nick Stone: I think they’ll certainly take notice. When we were at ACT doing our initial market launch of the product, there were a number of competitors that came by to learn about what we’re doing. The way we’ve done it though, I think we have enough protection there for our IP for them not to do it the same way, and it will then take another couple years for them to do it a little bit differently.

Charged: So you’ve got a first-mover advantage that’s going to last you for a couple years, hopefully.

Nick Stone: We believe so, yes. There’s one additional featurethat I haven’t mentioned yet. Our standard rectifier today uses AC input voltages, but it is capable of taking a DC input voltage as well, so we can now take inputs from a battery source or a hydrogen fuel cell input. So, we’re looking at these other applications—if you’re in the portable power space serving applications such as events or movie studios, those are some of the additional applications that we are working with partners to expand the application set, because we can do DC input.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Power-innovations-copy.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 14:18:21.445897

LEOPOLD, Ind. (AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state, including members of Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life, aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

Environmental inspection legislation in China At the central legislative level, the Central Environmental Inspection (CEI) mechanism remains underdeveloped in formal legal frameworks.
The hybrid model establishes environmental inspection systems in both comprehensive environmental legislation and specific environmental legislation.
The analysis reveals eight possible scenarios for provincial-level environmental inspection legislation: “no legislation”, “Party regulations only”, “comprehensive environmental legislation only”, “specific environmental legislation only”, “Party regulations + comprehensive legislation”, “Party regulations + specific legislation”, “comprehensive legislation + specific legislation”, and “Party regulations + comprehensive legislation + specific legislation”.","Scholars have a long-standing tradition of conducting political-economic analyses of environmental legislation, which has yielded a wealth of research findings (Oates and Portney 2003). However, existing literature on environmental legislation tends to focus predominantly on laws that are implicitly regarded as “regulations of the market”. For instance, traditional theories view environmental regulation as a tool for internalizing negative environmental externalities (Oates and Portney 2003), while median-voter models often conceptualize industries as the primary targets of environmental legislation (Peltzman 1976; Stigler 1971). What if the target of environmental legislation is the government and its officials, rather than corporations or individual citizens? Unlike “laws regulating the market”, laws designed to “oversee the regulators” primarily impose legal obligations on environmental regulators (such as local environmental protection agencies and their officials) to diligently investigate environmental violations and ensure local environmental quality, accompanied by corresponding liability for non-compliance. Under such circumstances, what factors might influence the development of environmental legislation?

Although existing studies on the factors influencing environmental legislation are extensive, they remain insufficient to address the questions raised above. This limitation is evident in two main aspects: First, as noted earlier, most research—whether in the environmental field or other domains—focuses primarily on legislation regulating the market, with relatively little attention given to laws that oversee environmental regulators (Boyer and Laffont 1999; Dougherty and Heckelman 2008; Ekelund et al. 2010; Jenkins and Weidenmier 1999). The distinction between legislation regulating the market and laws overseeing environmental regulators lies in their respective governance targets and institutional functions. While the former primarily constrains market actors’ environmental behaviors through compliance mandates, the latter establishes accountability mechanisms for regulatory agencies themselves, addressing principal-agent dilemmas that could otherwise lead to lax enforcement, regulatory capture, or bureaucratic inertia. This institutional oversight dimension proves critical because even the most sophisticated market-oriented environmental laws risk becoming symbolic gestures if the regulators entrusted with their implementation lack effective supervision and performance evaluation frameworks (Gunningham et al. 1998; McAllister 2010).

Second, existing scholarship on environmental legislation has predominantly focused on analyzing the influence of individual determinants, such as conflicts between local economic interests and environmental objectives (Adetutu 2024), shifts in policymaker risk perceptions triggered by environmental disasters (Emam et al. 2020), disparities in subnational governance capacities (Provins 2024), and public opinion pressures amplified by climate extremes (Herrnstadt and Muehlegger 2014). These studies collectively emphasize how singular factors—whether institutional, perceptual, or socio-political—shape legislative outcomes. While emerging research has begun examining contextual drivers in non-Western settings, including China’s centralized environmental governance mechanisms like central inspection systems (Ding et al. 2022) and localized legislative responses to environmental accidents (Zang 2022), the field remains dominated by analyses of isolated variables rather than their systemic interactions. Such an approach, however, risks oversimplifying the complexity of environmental lawmaking, which is shaped by the interplay of political, economic, and institutional dynamics rather than any single determinant (Harrison and Sundstrom 2010; Vogel 2003). A fragmented analytical lens may obscure the cumulative and interactive effects of these factors, leading to partial or even misleading conclusions about the drivers of legislative change.

To bridge these research gaps, this study employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine the complex configurations of factors shaping environmental inspection legislation in China. The establishment of the Central Environmental Inspection System is widely regarded as a landmark event marking China’s shift in environmental governance from “regulating enterprises” to “regulating governments” (Feng et al. 2022). Since 2016, China has conducted three rounds of Central Environmental Inspections. However, this system is currently stipulated only in the internal Party regulation, Regulations on Central Environmental Protection Inspections, and has yet to be codified into national law. Consequently, the system has been criticized by scholars for its “lack of legitimacy” (Zhang 2017), its limited long-term effectiveness as a campaign-style governance tool (Tan and Mao 2021; Xiang and van Gevelt 2020), and its tendency to result in overly rigid enforcement practices at the local level (Kou et al. 2024). Against this backdrop, some regions have proactively incorporated the environmental inspection system into local legislation ahead of national codification. Regional approaches vary significantly in terms of whether and how environmental inspections are included in local laws. This variation provides valuable material for studying the factors influencing environmental inspection legislation. Adopting a configurational perspective and employing fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study examines the local environmental inspection legislation of 31 provincial-level administrative regions in mainland China to identify and analyze the factors shaping such legislation.

This study offers potential contributions in three main areas: First, it fills a void in the study of the factors affecting “oversight of regulators” within environmental legislation. Second, it employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to rigorously explore the complex interactions among the various determinants shaping environmental lawmaking. Third, it broadens the research perspective on environmental inspections. While scholars have conducted extensive research on environmental inspections, the majority of studies have focused on the environmental governance performance resulting from central environmental inspections (Jia and Chen 2019; Li et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2021; Lu 2022; Pan and Hong 2022; Tan and Mao 2021; Wang et al. 2021; Wei and Kang 2023; Wu and Hu 2019; Yuan et al. 2022), their impacts on corporate investment, environmental information disclosure, and green technological innovation (Cheng and Yu 2023; Pan and Yao 2021; H. Wang et al. 2021; J. Wang et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023), as well as their influence on regional industrial structure upgrading (Chen and Shen 2022; B. Wang et al. 2022; Zeng et al. 2023). However, there has been a lack of research specifically focused on environmental inspection legislation, particularly concerning provincial-level environmental inspection systems.

This study is structured into five sections. Apart from the Introduction, the second section provides an overview of China’s environmental inspection system, followed by an analysis of the factors influencing environmental inspection legislation from a political-economy perspective. The third section employs a configurational analysis approach, utilizing fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to conduct an empirical analysis of the factors affecting environmental inspection legislation. The fourth section focuses on the analysis and discussion of the empirical results. Finally, the fifth section presents the conclusions.

Environmental inspection system in China

Central environmental inspection practices in China

Since the beginning of the 21st century, China has increasingly emphasized strengthening environmental regulation in response to mounting environmental challenges. A milestone in this effort was the enactment of the revised Environmental Protection Law in 2014, widely regarded as “the strictest environmental protection law in history”. However, despite the introduction of a progressively comprehensive environmental regulatory framework, China’s environmental issues remain unresolved, leading to growing public dissatisfaction (Xiang and van Gevelt 2020). The central government attributes these persistent issues to a critical factor: the failure of local governments to fulfill their environmental protection responsibilities in accordance with the law. To ensure the effective implementation of local governments’ environmental obligations, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Environmental Inspection Plan (Trial) in 2015, formally establishing the Central Environmental Inspection (CEI) systemFootnote 1.

The Central Environmental Inspection (CEI) refers to a mechanism through which the central government establishes dedicated inspection bodies to oversee the environmental performance of provincial-level Party committees, governments, and other relevant organizations. The CEI teams serve as the primary implementation entities, typically led by provincial-level or ministerial-level leaders from the central government, with the vice minister of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment acting as the deputy leader. Other team members include experts in environmental protection and officials from central government departments.

The scope of the inspections includes assessing regional compliance with national environmental laws, regulations, policies, standards, and plans; identifying and addressing prominent environmental problems; and examining how complaints from the public regarding environmental issues are handled. Sources of inspection leads include both information collected independently by CEI teams and environmental complaints lodged by the public. For cases of environmental damage resulting from failure or improper fulfillment of duties by local Party and government leaders uncovered during inspections, CEI teams are authorized to refer case leads to relevant authorities for investigation and accountabilityFootnote 2.

As of December 19, 2024, China has conducted three rounds of Central Environmental Inspections. The first round began in 2015 and was completed in 2018, covering all 31 provincial-level administrative regions. The second round, conducted from 2019 to 2022, also achieved full coverage of the 31 provincial-level regions across six batches. The third round commenced in November 2023 and, as of now, has completed three batches of inspections, covering 20 provincial-level regionsFootnote 3. Statistics from the first round of CEI reveal that over 135,000 public complaints were processed, resulting in penalties for approximately 29,000 enterprises, with total fines amounting to about 1.43 billion yuan. Additionally, 1518 enterprises faced criminal investigations, and 1527 individuals were detained. The inspections also led to the questioning of 18,448 Party and government officials and the accountability of 18,199 individualsFootnote 4.

Environmental inspection legislation in China

At the central legislative level, the Central Environmental Inspection (CEI) mechanism remains underdeveloped in formal legal frameworks. While Chinese central legislation typically operates through a three-tier hierarchy—comprising laws (法律), administrative regulations (行政法规), and departmental rules (部门规章)—CEI currently lacks anchoring in national laws or State Council-issued administrative regulations. Its sole statutory basis resides in a single departmental regulation: Article 3(6), 20, and 31(4) of the Measures for Supervision and Administration of Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection by Central Enterprises (2022) outline the obligations for the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) and central enterprises to cooperate with CEI activities.

Beyond this limited regulatory footing, CEI primarily derives authority from administrative normative documents (行政规范性文件). For example, the Implementation Opinions on Strengthening the Supervision and Management of Sewage Outlets into Rivers and Seas, issued by the General Office of the State Council in 2022, states that “the rectification and supervision of sewage outlets should be included as a key element in central and provincial-level environmental inspections”. Nonetheless, administrative normative documents (行政规范性文件) are not recognized as formal sources of law under the Legislation Law. The absence of formal legislation is the primary factor underpinning scholarly critiques regarding the CEI’s lack of legitimacy (Zhang 2017).

This contrasts markedly with provincial-level environmental inspection regimes, which exhibit greater legislative maturity. Twenty-four provincial-level jurisdictions have formally institutionalized environmental inspection systems through local legislations (地方性法规)—legislative instruments enacted by provincial People’s Congresses or their Standing Committees. These binding legal frameworks establish comprehensive procedures for inspection implementation, rectification mandates, and accountability mechanismsFootnote 5.

The term “local legislation” herein specifically refers to these province-level statutory instruments, distinct from both central-level departmental rules and non-binding administrative directives. This subnational legislative development addresses the regulatory gap observed at the national level, providing formalized legal bases for environmental governance that align with regional enforcement realities.

In terms of local legislative models for environmental inspections, three primary approaches can be identified: the comprehensive environmental legislation model (hereinafter referred to as the “comprehensive model”), the specific environmental legislation model (hereinafter referred to as the “specific model”), and the hybrid model combining comprehensive and specific legislation (hereinafter referred to as the “hybrid model”). Details of local environmental inspection legislation for each provincial-level region are provided in Table 1.

Specifically, the comprehensive model incorporates the establishment of environmental inspection systems into general environmental protection legislation. For instance, Article 28(1) of the revised Hunan Province Environmental Protection Regulations (2019) states: “The provincial people’s government shall inspect the performance of environmental protection responsibilities by lower-level governments, their achievement of environmental protection targets, improvements in environmental quality, and their resolution of prominent environmental issues. For violations identified during inspections, the relevant people’s government shall be urged to address them promptly in accordance with the law, and the results shall serve as a basis for assessment and evaluation. Inspection results shall be disclosed to the public”. A total of 10 provincial-level administrative regions have adopted the comprehensive model for legislating environmental inspections, including Shanghai, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang.

The specific model refers to the establishment of environmental inspection systems within specialized environmental legislation. For example, Article 7 of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Water Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (2019) stipulates: “The people’s government of the autonomous region shall establish systems related to water pollution prevention and control, including ecological protection compensation for water environments, monitoring and early warning of water environment carrying capacity, and environmental inspections”. A total of 3 provincial-level administrative regions have adopted the specific model for legislating environmental inspections: Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, and Henan.

The hybrid model establishes environmental inspection systems in both comprehensive environmental legislation and specific environmental legislation. For instance, Article 23 of the Tianjin Municipal Environmental Protection Regulations (2019) establishes a specialized inspection system for environmental protection: “The municipal people’s government shall establish an environmental supervision system to conduct routine supervision and specialized inspections of the implementation of environmental protection laws and regulations and the fulfillment of environmental quality responsibilities by municipal departments and district governments”. Meanwhile, Article 20 of the Tianjin Municipal Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality Promotion Regulations (2021) explicitly applies environmental inspection to the “dual carbon” field: “The implementation of laws, regulations, and responsibilities related to carbon peaking and carbon neutrality by municipal departments and district governments shall be included in environmental inspections”. A total of 11 provincial-level administrative regions have adopted the hybrid model for legislating environmental inspections: Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Chongqing.

Factors driving environmental inspection legislation: a theoretical framework

The heterogeneity of provincial-level environmental inspection legislation in China’s political-legal landscape calls for a theoretical framework that captures the multi-actor dynamics inherent in legislative processes. Stakeholder theory—originally formulated by Freeman (2010) for corporate governance—posits that organizational decisions emerge from interactions among diverse actors who hold varying interests, wield different degrees of power, and offer distinct value propositions. This perspective has been effectively extended to environmental governance research, illuminating how government agencies, industries, civil society groups, and citizens negotiate competing priorities in regulatory policymaking (Driscoll and Starik 2004; Zhang and Cao 2015). Recent studies further demonstrate its utility in explaining environmental legislation variations through the lens of power-resource configurations among legislators, bureaucrats, and advocacy coalitions (Berrone et al. 2013; Delmas and Toffel 2008).

Drawing on existing research based on stakeholder theory, this study develops a tailored theoretical framework for analyzing local environmental inspection legislation in China. The framework identifies four primary stakeholder groups in the legislative process: legislators, enforcement authorities, market entities, and the general public. Legislators—embodied by local People’s Congresses and their Standing Committees—are responsible for drafting, reviewing, enacting, and amending laws (Bektas 2023; Trajkovska-Hristovska 2022). Although enforcement authorities typically have limited direct involvement in the legislative process, their role is pivotal in implementing laws and ensuring compliance, thereby translating legislative intent into practice (Van Kreij 2022). Market entities, such as industrial enterprises, actively shape legislative processes by providing information and lobbying for favorable policies, which can influence legislators’ perceptions of public opinion and the broader representation of societal interests (Hertel-Fernandez et al. 2019; Judge and Thomson 2019). Meanwhile, the public and civil society organizations participate through consultations and public hearings, contributing diverse perspectives and expertise essential for democratic representation and shaping legislative outcomes (Rasmussen and Toshkov 2013; Tao and Jasper 2022).

Building on “Power-Legitimacy-Urgency” framework by Mitchell et al. (1997), this study identifies the key stakeholders in local environmental inspection legislation and elucidates their interactional dynamics (see Fig. 1). The definition of significant stakeholders requires meeting at least two of the three dimensions outlined in the framework. In the context of China’s environmental inspection legislation, four categories of significant stakeholders are identified: legislators (local People’s Congress and its Standing Committee), enforcers (local governments and environmental protection departments), market entities (industrial enterprises), and the general public. The following sections will examine the three-dimensional attributes and roles of each stakeholder.

Legislators: local people’s congresses and their standing committees

Local legislative bodies possess high levels of power and legitimacy in the process of local environmental inspection legislation. This is primarily due to the exclusive powers granted to them by the ConstitutionFootnote 6 and the Legislation LawFootnote 7, which enable them to formulate, amend, and repeal local regulations. As the statutory authorities, they are the final decision-makers on whether local environmental inspection legislation will be enacted. However, because legislators must balance multiple interests during the drafting, revision, and deliberation phases of the legislation, their sense of urgency is relatively low. For instance, local People’s Congresses must weigh the accountability pressure from central environmental inspections, the capacity of local enforcement agencies, and the practical needs of local economic development. This process is often accompanied by complex negotiations and coordination of interests.

For legislators, an assessment of the existing legislative stock in a related field is typically conducted before initiating new legislation. Generally, if there is already a significant body of existing legislation, the likelihood of enacting new laws decreases (Fankhauser et al. 2015). Environmental inspections fall under the category of administrative enforcement supervision within the specialized domain of environmental protection. Prior to the enactment of local legislation on environmental inspections, there may already have been laws addressing administrative enforcement supervision in a general context. For legislators, if existing administrative enforcement supervision legislation sufficiently supports local environmental administrative enforcement efforts, there is little necessity to incorporate environmental inspections into local legislation. This is because enacting new laws imposes additional responsibilities on local legislators, such as conducting subsequent enforcement reviews and post-legislation evaluations, which significantly increase their workloadFootnote 8.

However, on the other hand, diverging from the conventional theories discussed above, this study contends that within the Chinese context, a larger legislative stock may actually promote a higher degree of local environmental inspection legislation. Specifically, local legislators do not necessarily approach environmental inspection legislation purely from a functional standpoint; they may also be driven by a desire to “keep pace with national policy trends” or to “outperform other regions”, resulting in these laws being difficult to enforce in practice and ultimately becoming “zombie provisions”Footnote 9. The research by Qin et al. (2023) has also noted that Chinese local legislative practice is characterized by an overemphasis on quantity at the expense of quality, as well as a tendency toward blind competitive behavior. In regions with a higher stock of enforcement supervision legislation, local legislators generally exhibit greater initiative and efficiency in the legislative process, which can help them distinguish their environmental inspection legislation efforts on a national scale.

Enforcers: local governments and environmental protection departments

In the context of local environmental inspection legislation, enforcers exhibit both high power and high urgency. The power of enforcers is reflected in their substantial capacity to influence the legislative process. According to Article 73 of the Legislation Law, although local governments do not hold direct legislative power, they can indirectly shape the content of legislation through activities such as drafting regulatory proposals, making legislative suggestions, and coordinating stakeholder interests. From a legitimacy standpoint, local governments’ participation in the legislative process must be bounded by their statutory functions. Article 59 of the Organic Law of Local People’s Congresses and Local Governments clearly assigns local governments the responsibility to “implement the resolutions of the local People’s Congresses”. However, proactive involvement in legislation can provoke controversy over “executive overreach” into the legislative domain, particularly within the framework of “campaign-style governance”, where policy-driven acceleration of legislation may undermine procedural legitimacy. The high urgency of enforcers stems from the rigid constraints imposed by central environmental inspections—such as deadlines for corrective actions and the public disclosure of accountability lists—which compel local governments to view legislation as a tool for risk mitigation.

For enforcers, their attitudes toward environmental inspection legislation are primarily influenced by two factors: motivation and capacity. First, central environmental inspections provide a strong impetus for local governments to improve environmental legislation (Ding et al. 2022). According to the Regulations on Central Environmental Inspections, inspection results serve as a critical basis for assessing the leadership teams and officials of inspected entities. These results are submitted to the relevant organizational (personnel) departments according to the cadre management authority for decision-making regarding rewards, punishments, appointments, and removals. Additionally, inspection teams must compile accountability issue lists and case files on significant environmental problems, along with any associated negligence or misconduct. These are transferred to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the National Supervisory Commission, the Central Organization Department, or other relevant authorities based on jurisdiction, procedures, and requirements.

Under the pressure exerted by central environmental inspections, provincial-level administrative regions may standardize procedures, methods, and criteria for provincial environmental inspections through local legislation. This allows for the establishment of routine inspection mechanisms that enable more comprehensive and in-depth monitoring of local environmental issues. These mechanisms can identify and address problems that central inspections might overlook or deprioritize, aiming to minimize exposed issues in subsequent rounds of central inspections. This paper argues that the greater the pressure from central environmental inspections, the stronger the motivation of local enforcers to support and promote local legislation on environmental inspections.

It should be explicitly stated that within the framework of this study, the central government is treated not as an independent legislative stakeholder but as an external source of pressure on local enforcers. This classification is based on the following considerations: the legislative authority for environmental inspections rests with the provincial People’s CongressFootnote 10, and the central government indirectly drives local legislation through the environmental inspection system (e.g., accountability case counts serving as pressure indicators), rather than by directly participating in the legislative process. In other words, the role of the central government is primarily manifested in its supervision and accountability mechanisms over local enforcers, rather than through the direct allocation of legislative resources (Du et al. 2023; Kou and Han 2021). Consequently, the political pressure exerted by the central government is internalized as a behavioral constraint on local enforcers rather than representing an independent stakeholder.

Additionally, enforcers’ attitudes toward environmental inspection legislation are constrained by their enforcement capacity. The formulation of laws often takes enforcement costs into account (Ehrlich and Posner 1974). If a region lacks sufficient enforcement resources to support the actual implementation of provincial environmental inspections, the corresponding local legislation would ultimately become an unenforceable “paper tiger”. Therefore, this paper contends that the more resources local governments allocate to environmental enforcement, the stronger the support of enforcers for local legislation on environmental inspections.

Market entities: industrial enterprises

In the process of local environmental inspection legislation, market entities hold both high power and high urgency. Market entities, particularly industrial enterprises, primarily participate in the legislative process through their economic influence (Liu and Ren 2023). When industrial enterprises anticipate that forthcoming environmental legislation may impact their operations, they often promptly exert pressure on local legislators through mechanisms such as emphasizing their tax contributions and job creation roles. This strategic lobbying aims to influence the legislative process in their favor (Hobbs 2020). However, the legitimacy of the demands from market entities, especially industrial enterprises, is relatively low, as their profit-maximizing goals often conflict with environmental protection obligations.

In general, for market entities, environmental legislation signals a tightening of regulatory oversight and the imposition of greater environmental obligations on industrial enterprises, potentially disrupting their routine production and business operations (Cai and Ye 2020). Consequently, industrial enterprises are inclined to oppose such measures. However, within the context of local environmental inspection legislation, these enterprises may exhibit two distinct responses.

On one hand, if the legislation primarily enhances the supervision of local environmental enforcement inaction, it indirectly increases regulatory pressure on industrial enterprises—thereby reinforcing their opposition. On the other hand, if the legislation functions to standardize local environmental inspection practices, it can protect the legitimate rights and interests of industrial enterprises by preventing local governments from overreaching in their enforcement effortsFootnote 11 to meet environmental performance targets (Slivka and Lesko 2021), which in turn may garner support from these enterprises.

Importantly, the eventual impact of environmental inspection legislation is not determined solely by its textual provisions—typically a blend of measures to address both enforcement inaction and overaction—but rather by the level of political pressure exerted by the central government (He et al. 2022). Specifically, under high central political pressure, local governments are more likely to emphasize measures curbing enforcement inaction, leading industrial enterprises to oppose the legislation. Conversely, under lower central political pressure, local governments tend to focus on mitigating excessive enforcement, thereby protecting industrial interests and securing their support.

The general public

In the process of environmental inspection legislation, the key characteristics of the general public are high legitimacy and high urgency. As an essential human right, the public’s demand for clean air and water carries both moral and legal legitimacy. The direct threat of environmental pollution to public health and quality of life further intensifies the immediacy of these demands. However, the public’s power to participate directly in the legislative process is limited, primarily relying on indirect channels such as petitioning and public opinion supervision to exert pressure. For example, environmental mass incidents may compel local governments to accelerate legislation, but the public faces challenges in directly intervening in legislative decision-making.

Local environmental inspection legislation is influenced by the public’s demand for environmental quality. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory, when people have low incomes, their primary focus is on meeting basic survival needs, such as food and housing, with less attention given to environmental quality. However, as income levels rise and basic needs are met, people begin to focus on quality of life and higher-level spiritual needs, with a good environment becoming a key factor in fulfilling these higher-level needs (Maslow 1943).

Based on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory, environmental quality may deteriorate during the initial stages of economic growth but improves as income levels reach a certain threshold. This improvement partly reflects increased demand for and provision of environmental protection in higher-income societies (Grossman and Krueger 1995).

In the legislative process, public demand for environmental quality can translate into environmental legislation. For instance, during the 2014 revision of the Environmental Protection Law, public feedback prompted lawmakers to add 14 provisions to the second draft and an additional 7 provisions to the third draft (Zhu and Wu 2017).

In this study, I have chosen to apply fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to investigate the factors influencing local environmental inspection legislation. fsQCA is particularly well-suited for examining complex causal relationships and identifying patterns across multiple cases, making it an ideal method for this research. Unlike traditional statistical techniques, fsQCA allows for the exploration of how different combinations of conditions lead to a particular outcome, providing a nuanced understanding of the factors that contribute to the development of local environmental legislation.

The legitimacy of fsQCA is anchored in its foundations in set theory and Boolean algebra, with a focus on analyzing necessary and sufficient conditions for outcomes (Ragin 2000). This method operates under the principle of “causal complexity”, acknowledging that outcomes often result from combinations of conditions rather than isolated factors. Unlike regression-based methods that emphasize net effects, fsQCA examines how conditions interact conjunctively (through logical AND) and substitutively (through logical OR) to produce outcomes (Schneider and Wagemann 2012). This approach aligns with the study’s configurational perspective, which posits that local environmental legislation emerges from the interplay of political, economic, and social factors.

The fsQCA process comprises three key steps: calibration, truth table construction, and solution evaluation. First, variables are calibrated into fuzzy-set membership scores ranging from 0 (full non-membership) to 1 (full membership), reflecting the degree to which cases belong to a given set. A critical assumption underlying fsQCA is that set membership must be well-defined, which necessitates careful determination of appropriate cut-off points for fuzzy sets (Olsen and Nomura 2009; Tóth et al. 2017). Second, a truth table is constructed to systematically compare case configurations. This study analyzed 31 provincial-level cases, generating a truth table with 25 = 32 possible configurations. Third, logical minimization algorithms simplify complex configurations into parsimonious solutions, distinguishing between core and peripheral conditions (Rihoux and Lobe 2009).

The choice of fsQCA is justified by three methodological considerations. First, the study addresses the issue of “multiple conjunctural causation”, recognizing that different combinations of conditions may lead to the same outcome (Fiss 2011). For example, both public demand and political pressure might independently drive legislation under specific contexts. Second, the sample size (N = 31) is moderate, making fsQCA preferable to large-N regression methods that require stricter assumptions about linearity and independence. Third, fsQCA accommodates asymmetric causality, recognizing that the presence and absence of a condition (e.g., high vs. low political pressure) may have distinct effects on the outcome (Misangyi et al. 2017).

Despite its advantages, fsQCA is not without limitations. In addition to the challenges of establishing a well-defined set membership and determining appropriate fuzzy-set thresholds, there is an inherent risk of oversimplification. The subjectivity involved in setting these thresholds may also influence the configuration results, potentially affecting the robustness and generalizability of the findings. Acknowledging these limitations, this study has taken care to define and operationalize each condition in a manner that is both theoretically informed and empirically grounded, while remaining mindful of the methodological challenges posed by fsQCA.

Methods

This study primarily employs the fsQCA method to investigate the driving factors behind local legislation on environmental inspection. fsQCA is a case-oriented method that analyzes causal complexity from a configurational perspective, exploring combinations of multiple condition variables that lead to an outcome variable (Ragin et al. 2005). The fsQCA method posits that multiple combinations of conditions can lead to the same outcome (e.g., A × B + C × D = Y, where both A × B and C × D are sufficient combinations for the outcome Y). It also emphasizes that the effect of a single condition on the outcome is substitutable and asymmetric (e.g., if the combination of A and B leads to Y, it is possible for ~A, in combination with other conditions, to also produce Y).

To operationalize fsQCA, this study followed standardized procedures (Rihoux and Ragin 2009): First, continuous variables (e.g., per capita GDP) were transformed into fuzzy-set scores using direct calibration in fsQCA 3.0, with thresholds for full membership (0.95), the crossover point (0.50), and full non‐membership (0.05) determined through theoretical reasoning and case knowledge. We then conducted a necessity analysis to evaluate whether any single condition was necessary for the outcome (consistency > 0.90). Next, a truth table was constructed to define configurations and assess each configuration’s consistency (threshold = 0.80) and coverage. Boolean algebra was then applied to simplify the solution by eliminating redundant conditions, yielding the most streamlined configuration. Finally, the resulting solution was elucidated and interpreted in light of the study’s theoretical framework.

Data

Dependent variable: local environmental inspection legislation

Local legislation is a variable that is challenging to quantify. To ensure objectivity in this study, we adopt a binary approach by measuring whether a provincial-level administrative region has enacted relevant local legislation on environmental inspection, while avoiding subjective evaluations of legislative content.

Based on this standard, three questions are posed to assign values to local environmental inspection legislation across provincial-level regions: First, has the provincial-level region enacted internal Party regulations on environmental inspection? (If yes, the value is 0.5; if no, the value is 0.) Second, has the region incorporated environmental inspection into comprehensive environmental legislation? (If yes, the value is 1; if no, the value is 0.) Third, has the region incorporated environmental inspection into specific environmental legislation? (If yes, the value is 1; if no, the value is 0.)

It should be noted that provincial-level Party regulations do not strictly qualify as local legislation enacted by provincial legislative bodies, such as the provincial people’s congress or its standing committee. However, given that Party regulations constitute an important institutional source for environmental inspection, excluding them would omit critical information. Therefore, this study extends the scope of local environmental inspection legislation to include Party regulations. To distinguish between Party regulations and formal local legislation, the former is assigned a value of 0.5, while the latter is assigned a value of 1.

The analysis reveals eight possible scenarios for provincial-level environmental inspection legislation: “no legislation”, “Party regulations only”, “comprehensive environmental legislation only”, “specific environmental legislation only”, “Party regulations + comprehensive legislation”, “Party regulations + specific legislation”, “comprehensive legislation + specific legislation”, and “Party regulations + comprehensive legislation + specific legislation”. Following the coding rules, these eight scenarios are assigned six distinct values ranging from low to high (see Table 2 for details).

Independent variables

Political pressure from the central government

This study measures the political pressure exerted by the central government on provincial-level administrative regions through the number of environmental damage accountability cases transferred by the Central Environmental Inspection Teams. Environmental damage accountability cases refer to investigations and determinations of behaviors that violate environmental protection laws, regulations, or policies, or failures to fulfill environmental protection duties, resulting in environmental damage. These cases primarily hold government departments and their officials accountable.

As a result, environmental damage accountability cases heighten local governments’ attention to environmental inspection efforts, thereby accelerating the process of local environmental inspection legislation. Accordingly, this study collects data on the number of environmental damage accountability cases transferred to each provincial-level administrative region during the first round of Central Environmental Inspections and uses it as a conditional variable representing pressure from higher authorities.

Notably, this study exclusively utilizes data from the first round of Central Environmental Inspections due to the following two reasons: First, compared to other indicators, the environmental damage accountability cases transferred by the central government to local authorities during inspections offer a more direct measure of the political pressure exerted on local governments. For instance, while other environmental inspection-related metrics—such as the post-inspection accountability of local cadres—are available, the number of officials held accountable is determined by local authorities based on their independent investigations of potential legal violations. As a result, these figures do not directly capture the extent of political pressure imposed by the central government. Second, official disclosures on the website of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment indicate that only the first round provides complete and publicly accessible records of transferred accountability cases across all 31 provincial-level regions. In contrast, for the second round, accountability case statistics for 12 provinces remain undisclosedFootnote 12, and for the ongoing third round (since 2023), no provincial-level data have yet been released. This limitation necessitates reliance on first-round data to ensure methodological consistency and comparability.

The legislative stock for supervising administrative enforcement

As analyzed in Section “Legislators: local people’s congresses and their standing committees”, drawing on the approach of Fankhauser et al. (2015), this study uses the stock of administrative law enforcement supervision legislation in each region to represent the stance of local legislators on environmental inspection legislation. To achieve this, I collected all provincial-level legislations for administrative enforcement supervision enacted by the people’s congresses or their standing committees across China’s 31 provincial-level administrative regions.

Based on this dataset, I categorized and synthesized the legislative landscape of each region, and six distinct models of administrative enforcement supervision legislation were identified across provincial-level administrative regions. The various legislative models and their assigned values in this study are as follows: no local legislation or government regulations (0); only non-specialized local legislation (0.2)Footnote 13; only specialized local government regulations (0.4)Footnote 14; both non-specialized local legislation and specialized local government regulations (0.6)Footnote 15; only specialized local legislation (0.8)Footnote 16; and both specialized local legislation and specialized local government regulations (1)Footnote 17.

The share of the secondary sector

This study employs the share of the secondary industry as an indicator to represent industrial enterprises—key stakeholders in local environmental inspection legislation. This choice is based on three main considerations.

First, industrial pollution remains the primary source of environmental degradation in China (Shi et al. 2017), and empirical studies have shown that, controlling for other factors, regions with a higher secondary industry share tend to experience more severe pollution (Luo et al. 2018). Given this, industrial enterprises are among the market actors most directly affected by environmental legislation (Peng et al. 2018), which suggests they have a strong incentive to actively engage in and influence the legislative process.

Second, in this study, the secondary industry share is not used as a measure of regional environmental pollution but rather as an indicator of the bargaining power of industrial enterprises in environmental legislation. Generally, larger enterprises have stronger bargaining power in negotiations with the government (Egger et al. 2020). In the context of environmental regulation, industries that constitute a larger portion of a region’s economy, especially those in the secondary sector, typically exert greater influence over local environmental policies. This influence stems from their critical role in sustaining local economic stability and employment (Decker 2006).

Third, in existing literature, the share of the secondary industry is explicitly used as a key variable in both the theoretical framework and empirical analysis to examine its role in shaping the relationship between environmental tax legislation and air pollution reduction (Tang and Yang 2023).

Considering industrial enterprises’ motivation to engage in local environmental inspection legislation, the effectiveness of the secondary industry share in capturing their bargaining power, and its established use in existing environmental legislative research, this study argues that employing the secondary industry share as an indicator to analyze the role of industrial enterprises in local environmental inspection legislation is an appropriate approach.

Notably, as analyzed in the “Market entities: industrial enterprises” section, industrial enterprises may exhibit divergent attitudes toward environmental inspection legislation depending on the specific regulatory context—they may either oppose or support such legislation. The proportion of the secondary industry reflects the intensity of either support or opposition rather than a unidirectional stance. To capture this dimension, I compiled data on the proportion of the secondary industry from the China Statistical Yearbook (2018–2023) for China’s 31 provincial-level administrative divisions. The six-year average for each region was calculated as an indicator of its industrial structure.

Resource allocation for environmental enforcement

Drawing on the approach of Blundell et al. (2021), this study uses public fiscal expenditures on energy conservation and environmental protection to represent enforcement resources across provincial-level regions. Such expenditures provide financial support for environmental enforcement personnel, including equipment, salaries, and training, as well as funding for routine and specialized enforcement actions (Ercolano and Romano 2018). Similarly, the implementation of provincial-level environmental inspection systems also relies on these financial resources. Compared to general public fiscal expenditures, expenditures specifically allocated to energy conservation and environmental protection more directly reflect a region’s investment in enforcement resources.

I compiled data on public fiscal expenditures on energy conservation and environmental protection for China’s 31 provincial-level administrative regions from the China Statistical Yearbook (2018–2023). The six-year average for each region was calculated as an indicator of its enforcement resources.

Public demand for environmental quality

Following extant literature, this study employs per capita GDP at the provincial level as a proxy for public environmental demand (Ahmad et al. 2021; Pata 2018). The underlying rationale is that as per capita GDP increases, individuals’ basic material needs are increasingly satisfied. Drawing on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (Maslow 1943), once these lower-level physiological and safety needs are met, attention tends to shift toward higher-level aspirations, including the desire for improved environmental quality (Ahmad et al. 2021; Verbič et al. 2021). Consequently, higher per capita GDP is generally associated with a stronger public demand for environmental sustainability.

I acknowledge, however, that per capita GDP alone may not fully capture the complexities of public environmental demand, particularly in regions with varying levels of environmental awareness, divergent policy frameworks, and distinct socio-political contexts. While measures such as the frequency of public environmental complaints might offer a more direct reflection of public environmental concerns, my ability to utilize such indicators was limited. Specifically, according to the China Environment Yearbook (2018–2023), comprehensive data on public environmental complaints for the years 2017 and 2019 across provincial-level regions are unavailable.

Despite these limitations, per capita GDP remains a practical and consistent proxy within the scope of our analysis, providing a valuable comparative metric across China’s provinces.

Drawing on data from the China Statistical Yearbook (2018–2023), this study extracted per capita GDP figures for China’s 31 provincial-level administrative regions spanning 2017 to 2022. The six-year average per capita GDP for each region was then computed and employed as a proxy indicator for public environmental demand.

Table 3 summarizes the operational definitions, data sources, and calibration methods for each condition variable. Except for X2 (The Legislative Stock for Supervising Administrative Enforcement), which is directly assigned based on legislative model classification, all other variables are calibrated using the direct calibration method based on theoretical thresholds or percentile ranks (Ragin 2000). The specific calibration logic is detailed in the table.

Based on the established criteria for assigning and calibrating values for the outcome and condition variables, the 31 selected cases in this study were evaluated, yielding the results presented in Table 4.

Necessity analysis of condition variables

The necessity analysis of condition variables aims to determine whether these variables are essential factors influencing the outcome. The preliminary criterion for identifying a necessary condition is that the necessary consistency score should exceed 0.9. After running calculations with the fsQCA 3.0 software, the output results for the consistency and coverage of the condition variables related to local environmental inspection legislation are presented in Table 4.

From the consistency results shown in Table 5, it is evident that the consistency scores for each individual variable fall below 0.9. This indicates that none of the condition variables are necessary conditions for the outcome variable; in other words, each individual condition variable can be substituted for others in the context of producing the outcome. Given this situation, it is essential to employ configurational analysis to explore which combinations of factors provide a sufficient explanation for local environmental inspection legislation.

Configurational analysis of conditions

Configurational analysis of high-level local environmental inspection legislation

After conducting the consistency test, it is necessary to perform a configurational analysis of the constructed truth table. First, the case frequency for the configurations should be set according to the sample size. Generally, the selected case frequency should retain at least 75% of the observed cases. Based on this criterion, this study sets the case frequency to 1. Next, the consistency threshold is established. Following research conventions, the threshold is set at the default value of 0.8 in fsQCA 3.0 (Ragin et al. 2005). Condition configurations with consistency below 0.8 are recorded as 0, while those above 0.8 are recorded as 1. Through configurational analysis, three types of solutions can be obtained: parsimonious solutions, complex solutions, and intermediate solutions. This study follows Ragin’s (2014) recommendation and adopts an intermediate solution for explanation. The results of the model analysis are presented in Table 6.

Analyzing Table 6 reveals that five distinct conditional configurations can lead to the achievement of high-level local legislation on environmental inspection. The model’s intermediate solution demonstrates robust explanatory power. On one hand, its consistency value of 0.877 indicates that 87.7% of the cases conforming to these configurations have successfully enacted high-level legislation; on the other hand, a coverage value of 0.624 shows that these five configurations account for 62.4% of the high-level legislative cases. Based on these configurations, we can further identify the corresponding roles of The Legislative Stock for Supervising Administrative Enforcement, Political Pressure from the Central Government, The Share of the Secondary Sector, Public Demand for Environmental Quality, and Resource Allocation for Environmental Enforcement in advancing local environmental inspection legislation. The following discussion elaborates on these relationships:

Pathway 1—3: Industry-Driven Legislation under Low Central Pressure

Pathway 1 indicates that when a region possesses a high legislative stock and strong public demand for environmental quality, it can still achieve a high level of local environmental inspection legislation even in the context of a high share of the secondary sector and low political pressure from the central government. This pathway has an initial coverage of 0.352, meaning that it accounts for 35.2% of cases exhibiting high-level environmental inspection legislation, with 2.2% of cases being exclusively explained by this pathway.

Pathway 2 shows that when a region has a high legislative stock coupled with abundant enforcement resources, it can also realize high-level local environmental inspection legislation despite a high secondary sector share and low central political pressure. This pathway explains 38.2% of cases, of which 2.4% are solely attributable to it.

Pathway 3 demonstrates that when a region features high public environmental demand together with substantial enforcement resources, it can achieve high-level local environmental inspection legislation even with a high share of the secondary sector and low central political pressure. This pathway explains 29.4% of cases, with 2.7% exclusively explained by this configuration.

At the level of provincial administrative divisions, these three pathways show some overlap, as all include Zhejiang ProvinceFootnote 18. The three pathways share a common feature: low central political pressure combined with a high proportion of secondary industry. This observation is consistent with the study’s theoretical assumptions. In contexts where local governments face minimal central oversight, industrial enterprises are less likely to view environmental inspection legislation as a threat; rather, such legislation operates as a regulatory framework that standardizes supervision and safeguards their legitimate rights. Across all pathways, low central political pressure and a dominant secondary industry emerge as pivotal factors—a combination we term the “Industry-Driven Model under Low Central Pressure”. Nonetheless, distinctions remain among the pathways. Path 1 is marked by a high legislative stock alongside strong public demand for environmental quality; Path 2 features a high legislative stock paired with abundant enforcement resources; and Path 3 exhibits strong public environmental demand and substantial enforcement resources. These findings suggest that in provincial administrative divisions characterized by low central political pressure and a dominant secondary sector, these conditions are functionally equivalent in fostering robust local environmental inspection legislation.

To provide a more concrete and intuitive illustration of Industry-Driven Legislation under Low Central Pressure, the following content will take Jiangsu Province as an example:

First, political pressure in the region has remained relatively low. During the second round of central environmental inspection conducted by the Second Central Environmental Protection Inspection Team from March 25 to April 25, 2022, only three environmental damage accountability issues were transferred to Jiangsu Province for investigationFootnote 19. This figure is notably lower compared to economically developed regions such as Guangdong Province and Shandong Province, which received five accountability cases each. Besides, according to statistics compiled by the author, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has publicly reported 227 cases of insufficient local rectification following environmental inspections. Among these, Jiangsu Province accounted for only 5 cases, representing a mere 2.2% of the total. This indicates that Jiangsu has faced relatively limited political pressure during the implementation of central environmental inspection.

Second, in terms of economic structure, from 2017 to 2023, the secondary industry’s share of GDP in Jiangsu Province remained stable between 43% and 46%, significantly higher than the national average of approximately 39%. This reflects a strong industrial base and high reliance on secondary industry.

Third, regarding public demand, according to the 2019 China Environmental Yearbook, Jiangsu Province handled 88,775 environmental complaints in 2018, far exceeding the national average of 22,907 cases. This figure ranked first nationwide, accounting for 12.5% of the total complaints across all provinces, highlighting strong public demand for improved environmental quality.

Fourth, in terms of enforcement resources, from 2017 to 2022, Jiangsu Province’s average public fiscal expenditure on environmental protection and energy conservation reached 3.226 million RMB, ranking third nationwide. This substantial investment demonstrates robust environmental enforcement capacity.

Under the aforementioned conditions, Jiangsu Province promulgated the Jiangsu Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Regulation in 2022, which explicitly grants the provincial government the authority to supervise and inspect the soil pollution prevention performance of municipal governmentsFootnote 20. In 2024, Jiangsu Province promulgated the Jiangsu Environmental Protection Regulation, which provides a more comprehensive framework for provincial-level environmental inspection, including inspection formats, utilization of results, and rectification processesFootnote 21.

It is particularly noteworthy that the Jiangsu Environmental Protection Regulation explicitly stipulates that inspection authorities must publicly disclose inspection results and that inspected entities must disclose their rectification progress to the public. This legislative provision directly addresses public environmental demands and ensures citizens’ right to know. For a long time, the public’s right to information regarding local governments’ environmental inspection rectification efforts has lacked legal guarantees. The primary reason lies in the nature of the documents produced during inspections, which are often joint party-government documents. Such documents do not fall under the purview of the Regulations on Open Government Information, making it difficult for the public to access them through formal information disclosure requests.

For example, in the case of Yingkou Haigong Fuel Petrochemical Co., Ltd. v. Dashiqiao City People’s Government on Information Disclosure, the Dashiqiao City government conducted a “Special Rectification of Oil Storage and Transport Enterprises” as part of an inspection rectification initiative. The plaintiff, Yingkou Haigong Fuel Petrochemical Co., Ltd., was ordered to suspend operations due to insufficient regulatory compliance. Consequently, the plaintiff requested the disclosure of the “Detailed Measures and Responsibility List for the Special Rectification of Oil Storage and Transport Enterprises” from the Dashiqiao City government. Upon review, the court held that the document in question was jointly issued by the Dashiqiao Municipal Party Committee and the Dashiqiao Municipal Government, thereby classifying it as a party-government joint document. According to the Regulations on the Disclosure of Party Affairs, such documents do not fall within the scope of the Regulations on Open Government Information. As a result, the court rejected the plaintiff’s claimFootnote 22. This indicates that in the absence of explicit provisions in laws or administrative regulations, the specification of information disclosure obligations for relevant parties regarding the implementation of environmental inspection and subsequent rectification in local regulations can provide tangible legal guarantees for the public’s right to be informed about these inspections.

Pathway 4: Institutional Inertia-Driven Legislation

Path 4 demonstrates that when a region exhibits a high legislative stock alongside a low share of the secondary sector, it can still achieve high-level local environmental inspection legislation even under conditions of low central political pressure, limited public environmental demand, and scarce enforcement resources. This pathway explains 36.2% of the cases, with 11.4% of the cases being exclusively attributable to it. Unlike Paths 1, 2, and 3—which feature a high share of the secondary sector and other high-intensity factors—Path 4 is primarily driven by the existing legislative stock for enforcement supervision, rather than by high central political pressure, strong public demand, or abundant enforcement resources. Regions that conform to Path 4 include Gansu, Yunnan, and Tibet.

In these regions, environmental protection is a central pillar of governmental priorities. For example, environmental initiatives in Gansu are regarded as a key component in “strengthening the ecological security barrier in western China” as emphasized by President Xi Jinping during his visit to Gansu in September 2024Footnote 23. Yunnan is charged with the important mission of “strengthening the ecological security barrier in southwest China”Footnote 24. Tibet, meanwhile, is considered “an important national ecological security barrier occupying a key position in China’s ecological security framework”, with environmental supervision recognized as a critical means to bolster this barrierFootnote 25. Thus, given the paramount importance of environmental protection in these three western regions, coupled with institutional inertia, Gansu, Yunnan, and Tibet have been notably proactive in formulating local environmental supervision legislation. Consequently, this study categorizes Path 4 as an “institutional inertia-driven” model.

Taking Yunnan Province as an example, the political pressure it faces is relatively low, similar to Jiangsu Province, under the framework of central environmental inspection. During the central government’s “review” of previous inspections, Yunnan Province accounted for only two typical cases, below the national average of 2.76 cases per provincial-level region.

However, unlike Jiangsu Province, Yunnan’s economic development is less dependent on industrial activities, with the secondary industry accounting for only about 35% of its GDP. Regarding public demand, Yunnan handled 6,578 environmental complaints in 2018, significantly lower than the national average of 22,907 cases and accounting for only 0.93% of the total complaints nationwide. In terms of enforcement resources, Yunnan’s average public expenditure on environmental protection from 2017 to 2022 was 16.69 million yuan, below the national average of 18.59 million yuan.

Nevertheless, Yunnan Province has undertaken “high-level” local legislation on environmental inspection. Not only has Yunnan issued dedicated provincial-level Party regulations on inspections—such as the Measures for the Implementation of Environmental Inspection in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2020)—but it has also integrated inspection mechanisms into comprehensive environmental protection legislation. For instance, Article 24 of the Regulations on Environmental Protection in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2024) states: “A sound environmental inspection system shall be established and improved to supervise and inspect the implementation of environmental protection in accordance with relevant national and provincial regulations”.

Moreover, Yunnan has incorporated environmental inspection mechanisms into sector-specific environmental laws. Article 9 of the Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution by Solid Waste in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2022) stipulates: “The provincial government shall include the prevention and control of environmental pollution by solid waste in the provincial environmental inspection framework, inspecting the fulfillment of related responsibilities by relevant departments and subordinate governments”.

In terms of the function of local legislation on environmental inspection, rather than alleviating industrial structural pressures or improving environmental quality, institutional inertia-driven legislation primarily serves to establish the environmental inspection system. Consequently, the content of such legislation is largely declaratory, focusing on the formalization of the inspection framework while lacking detailed procedural provisions. Scholars often refer to this approach as “institutional empowerment” (McElwee 2010). For example, Yunnan Province has incorporated environmental inspection systems into nine pieces of local legislation—the highest number among all provincial-level regions in China. These laws uniformly proclaim the establishment of a provincial-level inspection system without offering detailed provisions for its operation. For instance, Article 24 of the Regulations on Environmental Protection in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2024) states: “A sound environmental inspection system shall be established and improved to supervise and inspect the implementation of environmental protection in accordance with relevant national and provincial regulations”. Similarly, Article 9 of the Regulations on the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution by Solid Waste in Yunnan Province (promulgated in 2022) stipulates: “The provincial government shall include the prevention and control of environmental pollution by solid waste in the provincial environmental inspection framework, inspecting the fulfillment of related responsibilities by relevant departments and subordinate governments”.

Pathway 4 represents a model of local legislation on environmental inspection driven by the core impetus of a high legislative stock for supervising administrative enforcement. This pathway demonstrates that even in the absence of significant political pressure, strong public demand, or ample enforcement resources, regions with relatively low dependence on secondary industries and a strong emphasis on legislative oversight and environmental protection can actively advance local legislation on environmental inspections.

Pathway 5: Political Pressure-Driven Legislation

Path 5 demonstrates that when a region is characterized by a high legislative stock, high central political pressure, a low share of the secondary industry, and high public demand for environmental quality, even limited enforcement resources do not preclude the achievement of high-level local environmental inspection legislation. This pathway accounts for 25.6% of the cases, with 6.3% being exclusively attributable to this configuration. Liaoning Province is a prototypical example of Pathway 5:

First, in terms of political pressure, the Central Third Environmental Inspection Team conducted an inspection in Liaoning Province from April 25 to May 25, 2017, identifying 14 cases of accountability for ecological and environmental damage, a notably high number.

Second, regarding economic structure, the secondary industry in Liaoning accounted for approximately 38% of GDP from 2017 to 2022, lower than Jiangsu Province but slightly higher than Yunnan Province.

Third, in terms of public demand, Liaoning received 45,297 environmental complaints in 2018, significantly higher than the national average of 22,907 cases, accounting for 6.4% of the total—among the highest nationwide.

Fourth, as for enforcement resources, Liaoning’s average public expenditure on environmental protection from 2017 to 2022 was only 9.73 million yuan, far below the national average of 18.59 million yuan.

Following the first round of central environmental inspection, Liaoning introduced the Provisional Guidelines for Handling Matters Assigned by Environmental Inspection in Liaoning Province in 2019. In 2022, during the amendment of the Regulations on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Liaoning Province, the environmental inspection system was formally incorporated. Article 25 of the amended regulations states:

“The provincial government shall establish and improve an air environment protection inspection system, ensure regular inspections, strengthen accountability, and promptly disclose inspection results.

For major air environment violations or significant air pollution issues that are inadequately addressed or provoke strong public concerns, the provincial environmental department shall prioritize supervision in accordance with relevant regulations and publicly disclose the supervision results.”

In terms of legislative content, under the dual influence of political pressure and strong public demand, the Regulations on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Liaoning Province emphasize both the effectiveness of inspection and rectification and the transparency of inspection processes. Specifically, Clause 2 of Article 25 underscores the importance of disclosing key supervision results to the public, aiming to enhance accountability and social oversight.

Pathway 5 represents a model of local legislation on environmental inspection driven primarily by political pressure. This pathway illustrates that under conditions of significant political pressure and strong public demand, regions may actively promote such legislation despite limited enforcement resources.

Regions following this model typically exhibit levels of economic development and dependence on secondary industries that fall between those observed in Pathways 3 and 4. Without political pressure from the central government, even strong public demand alone would not suffice to motivate these regions to enact local inspection legislation, as their lack of sufficient enforcement resources would undermine their ability to do so effectively.

Configurational analysis of low-level local environmental inspection legislation

Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) emphasizes the asymmetry of causal relationships. Therefore, this study further examines the specific configurational conditions that lead to low-level environmental inspection legislation. The intermediate solution is presented in Table 7. The results indicate that a provincial administrative region tends to exhibit low-level environmental inspection legislation under two distinct conditions. The overall consistency of these two pathways is 0.866, meaning that 86.6% of the cases conforming to these configurations exhibit low-level environmental inspection legislation. The overall coverage is 0.512, suggesting that these two configurations collectively explain 51.2% of the cases characterized by low-level environmental inspection legislation. The detailed interpretations are as follows:

Pathway 1 indicates that when a region has a low legislative stock for enforcement supervision, low central political pressure, low public demand for environmental quality, and limited enforcement resources, it is likely to exhibit low-level environmental inspection legislation. This pathway has a raw coverage of 34.1%, meaning it accounts for 34.1% of the cases with low-level legislation. Representative regions following this pattern include Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Guizhou Province, and Hainan Province. These results corroborate the high-level environmental inspection legislation model—termed “Industry-Driven Legislation under Low Central Pressure”—by showing that even in areas with a high share of secondary industry and low central political pressure, robust legislation emerges only when at least two of the following conditions are met: high legislative stock, strong public demand for environmental quality, and abundant enforcement resources. Failure to satisfy these conditions invariably results in low-level legislation, underscoring that an industry-driven approach requires supportive external factors.

Pathway 2 reveals that even if a region has a low share of the secondary sector, high public demand for environmental quality, and abundant enforcement resources, its environmental inspection legislation remains weak if the legislative stock for enforcement supervision is low. This pathway explains 28.8% of the cases characterized by low-level legislation, with representative regions including Beijing, Shanghai, and Hunan Province. The analysis further suggests that in regions with both low legislative stock and low secondary sector share, central political pressure exerts minimal influence on legislative outcomes. In conjunction with the Political Pressure-Driven Legislation model for high-level legislation, these findings indicate that high central political pressure can effectively promote robust legislation only when accompanied by a high legislative stock.

Notably, both pathways highlight a common constraint—low legislative stock for enforcement supervision—which appears to be a critical bottleneck in advancing environmental inspection legislation in these regions. This empirical finding diverges from some existing research. Generally, when a significant body of legislation already exists, the likelihood of enacting new laws tends to decrease (Fankhauser et al. 2015). However, this study demonstrates that a high legislative stock facilitates a higher degree of local environmental inspection legislation, while a low legislative stock tends to result in less comprehensive local legislation in this area. This finding partially validates the theoretical hypothesis proposed in Section “Legislators: local people’s congresses and their standing committees”, suggesting that local legislators do not approach environmental inspection legislation purely from a functional perspective; they may also be motivated by a desire to “keep pace with national policy trends” or to “outperform other regions”.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-025-05127-w/MediaObjects/41599_2025_5127_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-06-06 17:14:17.528588

Now there may be some pushback from Washington on what is being discussed and debated in Albany.

Republican U.S. Rep. Nick Langworthy, who represents portions of Western New York in the 23rd District, announced Thursday the bipartisan Energy Choice Act in the U.S. House and Senate to stop state and local governments from trying to ban utility service hookups with any connection, reconnection, modification or expansion.

Langworthy was unavailable for an interview but in a press release stated in part, ""I’ve introduced the Energy Choice Act — to slam the brakes on these reckless, ideological mandates and restore sanity to America’s energy policy. People deserve the freedom to choose energy that is affordable, reliable, and proven — not be forced into rolling blackouts to please eco-activists who don’t live in the real world.""

It is an obvious shot across the bow at the New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act passed in 2019 which calls for the eventual elimination of fossil fuels as an energy and heating source in favor of total electrification. That would involve the use of electric heat pumps and other such appliances for homes with specific future dates required as goals for such a transition.

A 2024 New York State Comptroller's Office Audit did raise some serious questions about costs and implementation of CLCPA

Also now there is state legislature discussion of the related New York HEAT or Home Energy Affordable Transition Act reintroduced by Democratic State Senator Liz Krueger of Manhattan.

Here are portions of the measure:

Minimize the need for new gas infrastructure investments by redirecting ratepayer funds to alternatives including electrification, thermal energy networks, targeted energy efficiency, demand response, and market

transformation measures.

Facilitate a planned, neighborhood-scale transition away from fossil fuels, avoiding stranded gas infrastructure costs and supporting coordinated investments that reduce emissions, increase affordability, and create good-paying jobs, while covering transition costs of customers moving to non-gas alternatives.

Ensure equitable access to affordable, clean energy for heating, cooling, and other building needs, protecting customers from undue burdens during the transition.

The NY HEAT Act does not impose a ban on the use of gas. Rather, it supports a gradual, long-term, and carefully planned transition for existing gas customers to cleaner alternatives, ensuring affordability, reliability, and equity throughout the process.""

While not specifically stating it would ban natural gas some are concerned it could have the affect of eventually putting natural gas utilities out of business by encouraging reduced customer base and revenue.

Concerns have been raised about the Christmas Weekend Blizzard of December 2022 in which power was lost and there were 47 deaths. Most of the victims were determined to be elderly residents including many on Buffalo's East Side who did not have heat in their homes. Other residents say they depended on heat from still functioning gas stoves to provide some warmth even though that practice can also be dangerous.

Also, natural gas is used to power standby generators for homes.

The HEAT Act has been passed by the Democratic controlled State Senate.

And now HEAT Act supporters like a group of leaders from Buffalo's East Side hope to see it passed by the State Assembly with other provisions.

PUSH Buffalo Executive Director Dawn Wells-Clyburn told reporters: ""The New York Heat Act would provide the state the tools to guarantee affordable energy bills for low and moderate income households by capping energy costs at 6 percent.""

But that same HEAT Act has builders of new homes very concerned.

Essex Homes President & CEO Phil Nanula who also leads the Buffalo Niagara Homebuilders Association says: ""It's been difficult to get anyone to really listen to any logic on the problems that this poses to us as builders. It was gonna create about a $20,000 dollar increase in the cost to build a home. And we just don't understand how that could be absorbed by the home buyer when interest rates are up.""

State Senator Krueger's office later released this statement regarding the proposed Energy Choice Act for Congress: ""Talk about a poorly thought-out bill with unlimited unintended consequences. This would essentially upend all energy regulations, building codes, zoning, fire codes, health and safety rules, you name it. It would create absolute chaos — which seems to be the point of Donald Trump's presidency — and do nothing for people struggling to pay their bills. Let's call this what it is: a BAN on state sovereignty, that takes away our right to self-govern and makes us wards of the federal government.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A Japanese company has halted construction on a $1.6 billion factory in South Carolina to help make batteries for electric BMWs, citing “policy and market uncertainty.”

While Automotive Energy Supply Corp. didn’t specify what those problems are, South Carolina’s Republican governor said the company is dealing with the potential loss of federal tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and incentives for EV businesses as well as tariff uncertainties from President Donald Trump’s administration.

“What we’re doing is urging caution — let things play out because all of the these changes are taking place,” Gov. Henry McMaster said.

AESC announced the suspension in construction of its plant in Florence on Thursday.

“Due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” the company’s statement said.

AESC promised to restart construction, although it didn’t say when, and vowed to meet its commitment to hire 1,600 workers and invest $1.6 billion. The company said it has already invested $1 billion in the Florence plant.

The battery maker based in Japan also has facilities in China, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. In the U.S., AESC has a plant in Tennessee and is building one in Kentucky. The statement didn’t mention any changes with other plants.

The South Carolina plant is supposed to sell battery cells to BMW, which is building its own battery assembly site near its giant auto plant in Greer. BMW said the construction pause by AESC doesn’t change its plans to open its plant in 2026.

AESC has already rolled back its South Carolina plans. They announced a second factory on the Florence site, but then said earlier this year that their first plant should be able to handle BMW’s demand. That prompted South Carolina officials to withdraw $111 million in help they planned to provide.

The company is still getting $135 million in grants from the South Carolina Department of Commerce and $121 million in bonds and the agency said a construction pause won’t prompt them to claw back that offer.

But clean energy investment follows a different path, a far more aggressively positive trend: The curve is up and to the right.
But the same type of equation applied to clean energy figures fits the data far better (R2 = 0.94).
But analysts have previously issued overly cautious clean energy investment forecasts.
Clean energy technologies are cheaper by the year, which makes them more accessible.","The world is set to invest nearly twice as much in clean energy as fossil fuels this year, according to a new International Energy Agency report.

While fossil fuel outlays are still significant — about $1.15 trillion this year — they’ll be dwarfed by clean energy, which is expected to receive $2.15 trillion in 2025.

But the real takeaway is that the energy transition doesn’t show signs of slowing.

Plotting the two investment trends is revealing. Over the last decade, fossil fuel investment has been relatively steady, if declining slightly. There has been an uptick since a drop that coincided with the pandemic, but even that shows signs of softening this year.

But clean energy investment follows a different path, a far more aggressively positive trend: The curve is up and to the right.

For data nerds: A second-order polynomial fit to the fossil fuel investment does a reasonable job of explaining the variance (R2 = 0.74), suggesting the world might be extracting a bit more oil, coal, and gas in the near future. But the same type of equation applied to clean energy figures fits the data far better (R2 = 0.94). Unless the world takes a U-turn — something that hasn’t happened in the 10 years the IEA has collected this data, pandemic included — expect bigger clean energy numbers next year.

The big question is whether it’ll be too little, too late.

To hit net zero by 2050, the world has to invest an average of $4.5 trillion annually, according to a report from the World Economic Foundation. That’s double this year’s investment, which sounds like a lot. But analysts have previously issued overly cautious clean energy investment forecasts. The trend in the new IEA data suggests that the goal is within reach.

Clean energy’s exponential growth won’t last forever; the trend is likely to taper off in the coming years, just like it did in the mid-2010s. But as I’ve written before, these sorts of fits and starts are not unusual, and adoption of new technologies is never continuous. Instead, it’s influenced by global economic trends and the learning curve that companies face when incorporating them into their businesses.

Ultimately, by 2050, I suspect average annual investment will probably meet or exceed the $4.5 trillion annual rate that the World Economic Forum calls for. Clean energy technologies are cheaper by the year, which makes them more accessible. Indeed, 85% of electricity demand growth in the next two years is going to come from developing and emerging economies, and while cheap coal has driven the narrative in many of those, solar and wind shouldn’t be counted out.

The wildcard, of course, is data centers. In the U.S., at least, utilities are confronting demand forecasts with enormous error bars. Those forecasts may fall short, but utilities tend to err on the side of caution, which means finding more power.

Some will turn to gas turbines, others will bet on nuclear. But in the next few years — and likely over the long term — renewables paired with energy storage will have the upper hand. They’re probable winners not just because they’re getting cheaper, but because they’re modular. They can be deployed at a range of scales and prices. It’s easy for them to be everywhere, and that’s something investors love to see.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1475927398.jpeg?resize=1200,674",N,,2025-06-06 14:16:51.884196

Evan Halper and Jake Spring report for The Washington Post.

In short:

The Trump administration used emergency authority to stop the closure of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan, despite opposition from the plant’s utility, state regulators, and grid operators.

The decision aligns with a broader federal strategy to prioritize fossil fuel energy over renewables, justified by claims that wind and solar can't reliably meet future electricity demands, particularly with rising artificial intelligence-related energy use.

Critics say the policy will raise electricity costs and undermine local clean energy goals, while pushing outdated, polluting infrastructure into extended use without sufficient justification.

Key quote:

“It came as a surprise to everybody, and it was baffling why they chose this plant. Nobody asked for this order. The power grid operator did not. The utility that owns the plant did not. The state regulator did not.”

— Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission

Why this matters:

Coal plants are among the dirtiest sources of electricity, emitting high levels of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter. These pollutants contribute to climate change and directly harm human health, increasing the risk of respiratory diseases, heart attacks, and premature death. The J.H. Campbell plant, specifically cited as the largest local source of greenhouse gases in western Michigan, was slated for retirement based on both environmental and economic grounds. Reversing its closure not only delays air quality improvements but signals a federal move to override state efforts to decarbonize. By targeting renewables with new hurdles and re-prioritizing fossil fuels, the administration is shifting national energy policy in ways that could stall climate progress and saddle communities with dirtier air and higher costs. This rollback also limits the authority of state and local agencies that have worked to craft cleaner, more affordable energy plans.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60498208/origin.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 14:17:26.539376

With a whopping $1.85 billion investment backing it, the company’s ambitious Lancaster Clean Energy Center is set to become the largest green hydrogen production facility in North America. By combining massive solar arrays, long-duration battery storage, and fully independent off-grid capabilities, this project is all about cutting emissions in the transportation and industrial sectors that are usually tough to electrify.

Project Snapshot: North America’s Future Hydrogen Hub

Sitting on as much as 2,100 acres of rural land in California’s Antelope Valley, this site will pump out around 22,000 tons of renewable hydrogen every year. The secret sauce? Clean solar energy driving electrolysis, all supported by industrial-scale batteries to keep everything running 24/7—no grid needed. The hydrogen is stored on-site in liquid form and will mostly be used for heavy-duty transport, public transit, and key industrial uses.

Why It’s a Big Deal: Climate Goals Meet Energy Independence

This isn’t just about checking boxes for California’s climate goals, which aim to slash emissions 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. It’s also about building an energy system that can stand on its own. By staying off-grid, the facility adds a layer of energy resilience—a big plus in a state wrestling with grid overloads, wildfire threats, and power reliability issues.

A City Transforms: From Farming to Future Fuels

With a population of about 173,000, Lancaster already has a solid track record in renewables, attracting solar companies for more than ten years. This time around, the shift is even more dramatic—swapping out water-hungry farming for a low-impact, water-efficient hydrogen project. In fact, the new plant will use just 15–20% of the water that agriculture once did, easing the load on local water supplies and aquifers.

The Tech Behind the Transformation

Solar PV: Harvests solar energy to power the entire system.

Battery Storage: Keeps the juice flowing even when the sun isn’t.

Electrolyzers: Break down water into hydrogen and oxygen using solar electricity.

Liquid Hydrogen Storage: Keeps the hydrogen safely stored and ready for shipping.

Why It Matters Nationally: Jobs, Investment & Clean Energy

This isn’t just good news for Lancaster—it’s a potential blueprint for clean energy projects across the country. The site is expected to create plenty of construction and operational jobs, boost local suppliers, and act as a magnet for future investments in the broader hydrogen infrastructure. The push also aligns with national incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act, which supports projects that boost domestic clean energy production.

At first, most of the hydrogen produced at the facility will be used locally and across the region—think trucking fleets, transit buses, and port equipment. But with built-in scalability, the site has the potential to serve industrial decarbonization efforts far beyond California’s borders.

Real-World Impact: More Than Just Lower Emissions

Here’s what the project expects to deliver, according to the company estimates:

Over 200,000 tons of CO2 emissions avoided every year.

Cleaner air in a region that’s battled ozone pollution for years.

Less groundwater usage compared to traditional farming on the same land.

Of course, no transformation is without its challenges. As the area shifts from agriculture to clean energy, care will be needed to make sure former landowners and residents are part of the process and local zoning stays community-friendly.

The City of Lancaster is leading the charge on permits and environmental reviews, making sure everything aligns with both city requirements and California’s CEQA standards.

What’s Next?

Construction is expected to kick off in mid-2025, with full operations targeted for 2027. As the cost of electrolyzers and green hydrogen production continues to drop, this isn’t just a one-off—it could be the first of many large-scale projects that reshape the industrial energy landscape.

Led by seasoned clean energy pros, Element Resources is staking its claim at the intersection of technology, policy, and scale. If all goes as planned, Lancaster won’t just be part of the zero-emission technology movement—it’ll help lead it.

This was evident at CERAWeek 2025, held in Houston, Texas, against a backdrop of surging energy demand in the host country(link is external), in large part due to the rapid expansion of data centers as AI use grows.

The question now on the industry’s lips, according to attendee Bill Newsom, President and CEO of Mitsubishi Power Americas, is: “How do we meet the challenges of electricity demand growth and still chart an economically viable path to decarbonization?”

AI’s energy needs

Globally, over the next three years, electricity consumption will rise by an unprecedented 3,500 terawatt hours(link is external) (TWh), according to International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts. Alongside data centers, this growth is fueled by industrial production, the rising use of air conditioning and accelerating electrification.

In the US, which according to the World Resources Institute (WRI) “needs more electricity than ever(link is external)”, the demand spike could increase emissions, cost consumers more and make the grid less reliable if left unaddressed.

The challenge is compounded by policy shifts causing uncertainty around the energy transition and geopolitical tensions putting energy security firmly back on national agendas(link is external).

Utilities and energy providers are having to rethink how they deliver reliable power quickly and sustainably, Newsom says.

Nuclear energy to power AI

The industry is increasingly recognizing that meeting demand is a delicate balancing act between ensuring clean, secure and affordable energy. And there is no single solution, the WRI notes, but a “menu of options to choose from”.

At CERAWeek, two such options — nuclear and geothermal power — were the topic of multiple discussions(link is external), observed Takajiro Ishikawa, President & CEO at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America. “These are two areas we’ll see a lot of movement in 2025 and beyond as we look to meet the increasing energy demand from various sources,” he said in a blog post after the event.

On the conference sidelines, big tech firms Amazon, Google, Meta and others recognized the role of nuclear(link is external) for reliable power and energy security by signing a pledge to support the goal of at least tripling the world’s nuclear capacity by 2050.

But with data center demand projected to triple in the US(link is external) within the next three years, consuming 12% of the nation’s entire power supply, what happens in the short term?

Meeting global energy demand today

At a panel called ‘System Reliability: The Challenges of Risk and Demand’, delegates discussed gas-fired power generation as a near-term solution to meet demand. This would be through a mix of gas turbine combined cycle power plants (GTCC), which offer high generation efficiency while reducing CO2 emission by about 65% compared to traditional coal plants, and peaker plants to ensure grid reliability during peak periods.

Hydrogen blending and CO2 capture, utilization and storage, which can capture more than 90% of the CO2(link is external) from GTCC plants, were seen as promising routes to further decarbonization.

The future of the energy transition

While the conversation around the green transition may be evolving, MHI delegates came away from CERAWeek optimistic about the path ahead.

“Despite the current uncertainty, deep emission reduction as a long-term trend will continue,” says Mike Fowler, Vice President, Engineered Systems Division, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America, reflecting on his discussions at the event. “We’re still seeing high demand for clean energy, with several projects set to cross the finish line in the next few years and market dynamics creating new opportunities.”

For Newsom, creating more of these opportunities will require a careful combination of technology, economics and regulation working together. Cross-industry partnerships are already helping to achieve this, accelerating innovation and managing rising demand. And he suggests that reframing the issue could drive further advances.

“One term that I keep hearing is the ‘energy trilemma’ but I see it as an ‘energy trifecta’,” he says. “Every challenge is an opportunity, and we as an industry are inherently optimistic, always striving to advance in the best ways possible. Our goal is to lead the energy transition with innovative and reliable solutions.”",https://spectra.mhi.com/sites/g/files/jwhtju2216/files/styles/crop_freeform/public/Meeting-AI%E2%80%99s-energy-demand-with-clean%2C-secure-and-affordable-power.jpeg?itok=NoEgpRy2,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:56.409644

In short:

The House bill sets narrow windows for clean energy projects to start and finish in order to qualify for tax credits, with added restrictions on sourcing components from countries like China, Russia, and North Korea, raising major compliance challenges.

Analysts warn the rollback could drastically reduce renewable energy deployment, with a Princeton University analysis projecting a one billion metric ton rise in annual emissions and job losses potentially reaching 300,000 nationwide, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Battery storage may be the hardest hit sector due to its dependence on foreign supply chains, with modeling by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions showing up to an 89% drop in deployment by 2035.

Key quote:

“Lost jobs in every single state are a recipe for disaster for American families, businesses, and the U.S. economy.”

— Abby Ross Hopper, Solar Energy Industries Association president and CEO

Why this matters:

Slashing tax credits for wind, solar, and battery projects could undermine years of growth in America’s clean energy sector. These incentives, expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act, have driven the rapid deployment of low-carbon technologies, supported hundreds of thousands of jobs, and made solar and wind competitive with fossil fuels. By tightening construction deadlines and introducing vague, geopolitically charged sourcing rules, the proposed legislation risks freezing many new projects in place. This is especially disruptive at a time when the U.S. grid faces rising demand and aging infrastructure. Penalizing projects for foreign components without clear alternatives in place could delay or derail vital capacity expansions. Meanwhile, electricity users could see rising costs, especially in states already strained by heat, wildfires, or power outages.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60501497/origin.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 13:09:59.185404

This bill is part of Gov. Josh Shapiro's ""Lightning Plan"" and aims to create jobs, reduce costs, and boost long-term energy stability by focusing on clean energy and sustainability, per Central Penn Business Journal.

As the world moves toward a cleaner economy, there are growing opportunities for investors to back companies that focus on renewable energy, clean tech, and sustainable practices. These industries are proving to be financially smart investments, often outperforming traditional fossil fuel stocks in long-term growth.

Pennsylvania is positioning itself to capitalize on this global shift, supporting sectors like semiconductor manufacturing, hydrogen hubs, and sustainable aviation fuel. The bill now heads to the state Senate for further approval.

State Rep. John Inglis, a key sponsor of the bill, highlighted the importance of acting now.

""With costs rising due to inflation, tariffs and a confluence of other factors, we're seeing companies across the country shy away from making long-term investments,"" he said, per CPBJ. ""This is a critical moment for us to assure businesses and energy producers that, despite looming economic uncertainty, Pennsylvania is leading the nation toward a cleaner and stronger energy future.""

Beyond the environmental benefits, the bill's people-first approach promises substantial economic rewards. By expanding tax credits and attracting investment in clean energy, the legislation could create thousands of new jobs and lower energy costs for consumers. This approach not only strengthens Pennsylvania's economy but also provides resilience in an unpredictable global market.

In fact, the EPA helped the health department’s air pollution control program with “devising ways to reduce the formation of ozone,” SCHD said.
Methane is a “key ingredient in ground-level ozone pollution,” according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.
The petition cites five air monitors in the Memphis Metropolitan area “showing clear violations of the 2015 Ozone” standard.
The petition asks the health department to revise the plan to include measures to bring the Memphis Metropolitan area in compliance with national standards.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been asked to find that the Memphis Metropolitan area has failed to meet national air quality standards for ozone, in a petition filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center on Thursday.

A ruling of “non attainment” would “force the Shelby County Health Department and other health officials to finally take meaningful action to address smog problems in the area,” the SELC said in an email.

Local health officials would have to impose stricter standards on future air permits and require “polluters to invest in better emissions controls that can limit the amount of smog-forming pollution they could pump into the air,” SELC senior attorney Caroline Cress told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism in an email.

Ozone exposure can cause health effects that include coughing, difficulty breathing, increased susceptibility to lung infection, increased frequency of asthma attacks and can aggravate lung diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, according to the EPA.

“Some of these effects have been found even in healthy people, but effects can be more serious in people with lung diseases such as asthma,” the EPA states. “They may lead to increased school absences, medication use, visits to doctors and emergency rooms, and hospital admissions. Some studies in locations with elevated concentrations also report associations of ozone with deaths from respiratory causes.”

Memphis has been named an “Asthma Capital” by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and Shelby County has received an “F” grade from the American Lung Association due to its ozone pollution for the past two years. The county leads Tennessee in emergency room visits for asthma.

LaTricea Adams, founder of Young, Gifted and Green, told MLK50 that these designations show “a long history of legacy air pollution, such as smog, that simply has not improved.”

“We are calling on EPA to protect our air and lungs, and the health department needs to do their job and enact permitting policies that better protect children and families from smog and other air pollution,” she said. “It’s a matter of life and death.”

The SCHD told MLK50 in a written statement that there are numerous ongoing ozone reduction projects in Shelby County, including replacing some of the county’s gas vehicles with electric vehicles and promoting bicycle commuting. In fact, the EPA helped the health department’s air pollution control program with “devising ways to reduce the formation of ozone,” SCHD said.

“SCHD has had meetings with various industries in Shelby County and has engaged air program managers from Mississippi and Arkansas in ongoing discussions to address regional ozone pollution,” the department said. “The entire Mid-South region would be impacted by non-attainment status.”

The petition was filed on behalf of Memphis Community Against Pollution, the Sierra Club and Young, Gifted and Green, three organizations that have been at the forefront of fights against industrial pollutants in Memphis, including most recently Elon Musk’s xAI.

xAI has been running unpermitted methane gas turbines and is currently in the process of seeking air permits for the permanent installation of 15 of the 35 turbines reported on site. The Tennessee Valley Authority is also planning to install six new methane gas-fired turbines at the Allen Plant in South Memphis. Methane is a “key ingredient in ground-level ozone pollution,” according to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.

According to the SELC’s calculations, the xAI facility in South Memphis is “likely the largest industrial emitter of (nitrogen oxides) in Memphis.” Nitrogen oxides are a main component in the formation of ozone.

The Memphis Metropolitan area includes nine counties in Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas, comprising about one million people, with the majority living in Shelby County.

The petition cites five air monitors in the Memphis Metropolitan area “showing clear violations of the 2015 Ozone” standard.

“And the problem is only getting worse with each passing year,” the petition states.

None of the monitors is located in South Memphis, the area that houses the first xAI facility and is known for having high industrial pollutants. The Shelby County Commission recently allocated $411,000 to the SCHD to establish an air monitoring station in South Memphis, but that remains a work in progress.

“The petition to the Environmental Protection Agency by the Southern Environmental Law Center is a flare into a dark abyss of corporate overreach that has sacrificed our health for far too long,” said KeShaun Pearson, head of MCAP. “Smog is known to complicate and contribute to respiratory illnesses and emergencies. The petition is an alarm-sounding because we are slowly being suffocated with poison by air pollution.”

The health department agreed to participate in a plan to address local ozone pollution alongside the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment in August 2023. However, a draft of the plan obtained by the SELC “​​contains no new control measures that will be effective in reducing ozone concentrations in the area,” the petition says.

The petition asks the health department to revise the plan to include measures to bring the Memphis Metropolitan area in compliance with national standards. In a written statement, the SCHD told MLK50 that it is working to update the Path Forward plan, which predates xAI’s arrival in Memphis.

“This petition is a last resort,” Cress said. “We’ve attempted to work with local health leaders, including SCHD, to get them to address local smog problems in the Memphis area, but they haven’t taken the necessary steps to fight smog pollution. …. Concerningly, local health officials recently missed an important deadline to submit a plan to reduce smog in the area. That’s why we’re asking federal officials to act.”

The Inflation Reduction Act has jump-started hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy and manufacturing development — and most of its benefits have gone to regions represented in Congress by Republicans.

But House Republicans still chose to pass a budget bill two weeks ago that would crush the bustling clean energy sector by rapidly phasing out incentives for making energy-efficient home improvements, buying EVs, and building solar, wind, and battery projects.

Now, it’s the Republican-controlled Senate’s turn to consider the bill. Early signs suggest that at least two GOP senators — John Curtis of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are not on board with the aggressive cuts in the current version of the bill.

Tillis represents a purple state where clean manufacturing and solar project development has boomed in recent years, Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts reported this week. He’s since said that he wants to revise the House’s cut to IRA production and investment tax credits, as well as a provision that bars companies with ties to China from accessing incentives. Tillis and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) also said that the Senate is unlikely to stand by the House’s provision that would require clean energy projects to start construction within 60 days of bill enactment or miss out on tax credits.

Curtis meanwhile authored a Deseret News op-ed on Wednesday diving into the consequences of a total IRA repeal. While he agrees that some IRA provisions included ​“frivolous spending,” he warned against treating ​“good policy ideas as guilty by political association.”

“The simple truth is this: many of these credits are Republican policies that we fought to protect,” Curtis wrote. ​“We must build a thoughtful, principled bill that doesn’t pull the rug out from under American innovators.”

Other Republican senators have expressed reservations too. Chuck Grassley, who represents wind turbine-dotted Iowa, suggested he’ll try to find compromise on extending support for wind power. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said he may look to change the House’s proposed 60-day deadline for accessing tax credits. North Dakota’s John Hoeven wants to preserve some incentives for geothermal; Shelley Moore Capito, from West Virginia, would like to keep hydrogen incentives alive.

We still have yet to hear from Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, who in April penned a letter alongside Sens. Curtis, Murkowski, and Tillis defending IRA tax credits.

These public statements in support of some aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act could be read as a signal that the House’s ​“backdoor repeal” of the landmark climate law will fail at the hands of the Senate. On the other hand, plenty of House Republicans spoke out before the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” passed, too. In fact, nearly two dozen signed a letter opposing IRA cuts in late March.

But come time to vote in May, not a single one of those signatories voted against the bill. It passed the House 215-214.

Trump’s coal-boosting efforts don’t make sense

The Trump administration keeps trying to prop up fossil-fuel power plants. Experts and regulators say it’s an uneconomical and unwise mission.

President Donald Trump’s coal-boosting endeavors kicked off last month with a slate of executive orders that would let the U.S. Energy Department order power plants to stay open and would exempt some coal plants from air-pollution regulations. Among those facilities targeted for reinstatement is the Cholla coal plant in Arizona, which shut down in March, and which a state energy regulator warned would cost utility customers nearly $2 billion to reopen.

In recent weeks, the DOE has ordered a Michigan coal power plant and a Pennsylvania oil and gas facility to stay open just days before their planned retirements. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis examined the challenges of keeping the Michigan plant open, noting that its power prices were becoming increasingly uncompetitive and that its owner has already been working for years to replace its generation capacity with renewables and gas. And with coal companies laying off miners across Appalachia, keeping coal alive is only going to become more impractical.

Bad news/​good news for greener steel

A potential deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, backed by President Trump, would likely be bad news for efforts to clean up steelmaking. A week ago, Trump announced that Japan’s Nippon Steel was set to acquire U.S. Steel in a deal whose details are yet to be disclosed. Nippon has previously pledged to extend the life of U.S. Steel’s coal-burning furnaces, Alexander C. Kaufman reported for Canary Media this week, and to build a new electric arc furnace in the U.S. should the deal go through.

Meanwhile, Massachusetts-based Boston Metal is honing a greener steelmaking process of its own. The start-up is developing a technique that uses electricity to remove contaminants from iron ore, the company told Canary Media’s Sarah Shemkus. Refining iron ore is responsible for most of steelmaking’s emissions, but in Boston Metal’s process, the only greenhouse gas emissions created come from the electricity used to power it.

LEOPOLD, Ind. (AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Rule required big polluters to say how much they are emitting

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts see a role for registry in cutting emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA seeks to cancel money to fund some air monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state, including members of Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life, aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

A little-known provision of Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” would open thousands of acres of public lands at the edge of Minnesota’s Boundary Waters wilderness to a foreign-owned mining company.

The move amounts to a giveaway “in perpetuity” to a company that has lobbied in Washington for years, environmental campaigners say, potentially opening up one of the US’s most famous wilderness areas to water-pollution risks.

Earlier this month, conservationists cheered when Congress withdrew from the reconciliation bill several provisions that would have sold off hundreds of thousands of acres of federal land in Nevada and Utah. Those provisions had sparked fury among public land advocates and staunch opposition even from some Republicans, including the representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, who vowed to oppose the bill if the land sell-off provisions were retained.

Despite that fury, a lesser-known public lands giveaway remained in the reconciliation bill. If approved as currently written, the provision could lease in perpetuity land near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters wilderness, an enormous complex of pristine lakes and untrammeled forests, to Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of the Chilean mining giant Antofagasta PLC.

Becky Rom, the national chair of Save the Boundary Waters, a campaign to protect the wilderness area from mining, described the provision as “a giveaway of critical and sensitive federal public land forever to a single mining company”.

“It is a giveaway,” Rom added. “This is forever.”

An ‘irreplaceable’ wilderness area

First set aside by Congress in 1964, the 1.1m-acre Boundary Waters canoe area wilderness, as it is officially known, is the only large-scale protected sub-boreal forest in the lower 48 states. Each year, about 150,000 visitors come to partake in the all-American tradition of canoe travel and enjoy a pristine landscape where wolves, moose, loons, bears and bald eagles thrive. Those who come to explore it help contribute to Minnesota’s $13.5bn outdoor recreation economy. According to the US Forest Service, the landscape contains “healthy forests with extremely high water quality”. It is “irreplaceable”.

But the Boundary Waters also sit atop mineral-rich lands. Antofagasta has for years sought to develop a copper and nickel mine on public land near the wilderness, amid the headwaters that feed its famous lakes. The company and its American subsidiary, Twin Metals Minnesota, came close to success during the first Trump administration, which overturned an Obama-era denial and renewed mining leases for the project.

The Biden administration, recognizing the threat the proposed mine posed to the environment, subsequently rescinded those discretionary leases, arguing that they were legally deficient. The Biden administration also issued an order that prohibited mining for 20 years in the portion of the Superior national forest where Antofagasta wants to extract copper and nickel. Twin Metals Minnesota, which declined to comment for this story, filed litigation to fight the Biden policies in court. That lawsuit is ongoing.

Meanwhile, the companies went to Capitol Hill in their quest to build their mine, which they say will directly employ more than 750 people and could revitalize “the entire region”. In the last three years alone, Antofagasta and Twin Metals have poured more than $1.6m into lobbying efforts in Washington DC, according to OpenSecrets.

Among the lobbying shops they retained is Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, the powerful firm that was the longtime home of David Bernhardt, interior secretary during Trump’s first term. Brownstein’s employees and its political action committee, in turn, were together among the top 10 donors last election cycle to the campaign committee of representative Bruce Westerman of Arkansas, the powerful chair of the House natural resources committee.

Last month, that lobbying apparently bore fruit. Westerman’s committee unveiled its portion of the president’s reconciliation bill and it contained a major win for Antofagasta and Twin Metals.

The bill, which passed the House and is now being considered by the Senate, includes provisions that rescind the Biden administration’s 20-year mining prohibition in the Superior national forest and grants Twin Metals 20-year mining leases to pursue its copper-nickel project on nearly 6,000 acres (2,500 hectares) of public land near the Boundary Waters. It also grants Twin Metals rights in perpetuity to lease renewals and it prohibits judicial review of the leases, meaning that citizens cannot sue to challenge them. Only one party retains rights to judicial review per the legislation: Twin Metals. If the federal government fails to comply with the reconciliation bill, Twin Metals can sue to enforce it.

“The reconciliation bill compels the issuance of four leases forever,” said Rom. “To get there it expressly overrides four federal laws, it expressly overrides BLM regulations, so all of those rules that apply to everybody else in the world, the laws, the regulations, for Antofagasta they don’t apply.”

“There is a heavy hand in here,” she added. “The heavy hand of Antofagasta.”

Pollution fears and pushback

Neither Antofagasta nor Westerman’s office responded to requests for comment. Twin Metals has said its mine will provide a supply of strategic minerals that are important to national security and the emerging green energy economy.

For conservationists like Rom – who grew up helping her father run an outfitting business in the Boundary Waters wilderness and has since spent decades working to protect the wilderness area – the major threat from Twin Metals’ proposed mine is water pollution. That threat was described in a 2016 letter by the US Forest Service, when it initially denied its consent to the Twin Metals mine leases during the waning days of the Obama administration. There is “inherent potential risk that development of a regionally-untested copper-nickel sulfide ore mine within the same watershed as the BWCAW might cause serious and irreplaceable harm to this unique, iconic, and irreplaceable wilderness area”.

The agency’s letter particularly drew attention to the risk of acid mine drainage, a potent form of water pollution that is a well-known risk of the sort of sulfide-ore mining that Twin Metals and Antofagasta wish to undertake. Any drainage from the “mine workings and mining wastes are likely to be highly acidic”, the agency said of the Twin Metals mine. Any failure to contain such waste could have “potentially severe consequences for the BWCAW” and could “cover a very broad region”.

Twin Metals Minnesota has denied that acid mine drainage will be a potential threat, calling it a “nonissue”.

As the reconciliation bill moves through the Senate, conservationists as well as their allies in Congress are hoping it will be stripped out of the bill before it lands on Trump’s desk. They argue, among other things, that the bill’s Twin Metals provision may run afoul of Senate rules governing the reconciliation process, which disallows the body from including “extraneous provisions” in budget bills.

Among the opponents of the Twin Metals provision is Minnesota’s junior senator, Tina Smith, though the state’s congressional delegation is split on the issue.

“Senator Smith strongly opposes the reckless Republican provision in the US House-passed Big Beautiful Bill that would give a foreign conglomerate full permission to build a copper-nickel sulfide mine right on the doorstep of the Boundary Waters watershed,” wrote a spokesperson for Smith in a statement to Public Domain. “By including this language in their massive budget bill, Republicans in Congress have made it clear they don’t care about the science or the data, which shows unequivocally that this type of mining poses an unacceptable risk and stands to irreversibly pollute this pristine wilderness.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be3ce87aa173df50e48098a2ce1e3ef99681b3f/480_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b51d4d8b114d1a2b40c7a26e9f78445,N,,2025-06-06 13:10:22.660519

The Inflation Reduction Act has jump-started hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy and manufacturing development — and most of its benefits have gone to regions represented in Congress by Republicans.

But House Republicans still chose to pass a budget bill two weeks ago that would crush the bustling clean energy sector by rapidly phasing out incentives for making energy-efficient home improvements, buying EVs, and building solar, wind, and battery projects.

Now, it’s the Republican-controlled Senate’s turn to consider the bill. Early signs suggest that at least two GOP senators — John Curtis of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are not on board with the aggressive cuts in the current version of the bill.

Tillis represents a purple state where clean manufacturing and solar project development has boomed in recent years, Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts reported this week. He’s since said that he wants to revise the House’s cut to IRA production and investment tax credits, as well as a provision that bars companies with ties to China from accessing incentives. Tillis and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) also said that the Senate is unlikely to stand by the House’s provision that would require clean energy projects to start construction within 60 days of bill enactment or miss out on tax credits.

Curtis meanwhile authored a Deseret News op-ed on Wednesday diving into the consequences of a total IRA repeal. While he agrees that some IRA provisions included ​“frivolous spending,” he warned against treating ​“good policy ideas as guilty by political association.”

“The simple truth is this: many of these credits are Republican policies that we fought to protect,” Curtis wrote. ​“We must build a thoughtful, principled bill that doesn’t pull the rug out from under American innovators.”

Other Republican senators have expressed reservations too. Chuck Grassley, who represents wind turbine-dotted Iowa, suggested he’ll try to find compromise on extending support for wind power. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said he may look to change the House’s proposed 60-day deadline for accessing tax credits. North Dakota’s John Hoeven wants to preserve some incentives for geothermal; Shelley Moore Capito, from West Virginia, would like to keep hydrogen incentives alive.

We still have yet to hear from Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, who in April penned a letter alongside Sens. Curtis, Murkowski, and Tillis defending IRA tax credits.

These public statements in support of some aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act could be read as a signal that the House’s ​“backdoor repeal” of the landmark climate law will fail at the hands of the Senate. On the other hand, plenty of House Republicans spoke out before the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” passed, too. In fact, nearly two dozen signed a letter opposing IRA cuts in late March.

But come time to vote in May, not a single one of those signatories voted against the bill. It passed the House 215-214.

More big energy stories

Trump’s coal-boosting efforts don’t make sense

The Trump administration keeps trying to prop up fossil-fuel power plants. Experts and regulators say it’s an uneconomical and unwise mission.

President Donald Trump’s coal-boosting endeavors kicked off last month with a slate of executive orders that would let the U.S. Energy Department order power plants to stay open and would exempt some coal plants from air-pollution regulations. Among those facilities targeted for reinstatement is the Cholla coal plant in Arizona, which shut down in March, and which a state energy regulator warned would cost utility customers nearly $2 billion to reopen.

In recent weeks, the DOE has ordered a Michigan coal power plant and a Pennsylvania oil and gas facility to stay open just days before their planned retirements. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis examined the challenges of keeping the Michigan plant open, noting that its power prices were becoming increasingly uncompetitive and that its owner has already been working for years to replace its generation capacity with renewables and gas. And with coal companies laying off miners across Appalachia, keeping coal alive is only going to become more impractical.

Bad news/​good news for greener steel

A potential deal between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, backed by President Trump, would likely be bad news for efforts to clean up steelmaking. A week ago, Trump announced that Japan’s Nippon Steel was set to acquire U.S. Steel in a deal whose details are yet to be disclosed. Nippon has previously pledged to extend the life of U.S. Steel’s coal-burning furnaces, Alexander C. Kaufman reported for Canary Media this week, and to build a new electric arc furnace in the U.S. should the deal go through.

Meanwhile, Massachusetts-based Boston Metal is honing a greener steelmaking process of its own. The start-up is developing a technique that uses electricity to remove contaminants from iron ore, the company told Canary Media’s Sarah Shemkus. Refining iron ore is responsible for most of steelmaking’s emissions, but in Boston Metal’s process, the only greenhouse gas emissions created come from the electricity used to power it.

1. The Supreme Court Just Started a Permitting Revolution — Heatmap

The Supreme Court just narrowed NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act. Federal agencies now don’t have to analyze downstream impacts of projects, only the direct environmental impact of the project itself. The ruling also significantly limits judicial oversight of agency NEPA reviews, directing courts to broadly defer to agency decisions.

This ruling is a major win for project developers – it’s easier and faster to approve projects, including clean energy. Most oil and gas drilling is already exempt from NEPA thanks to a 2005 law, but pipelines are still subject to NEPA and environmental groups say NEPA is useful in slowing them down.

2. U.S. Oil Companies Are ‘Battening Down the Hatches’ — The New York Times

US oil companies are shutting down rigs and laying off workers because oil prices have stayed low, around $60 a barrel. Global demand for oil is weakening due to an expected slowdown in global growth from Trump’s trade war, and at the same time OPEC Plus increasing production.

Smaller US oil producers have been hit the hardest. Those that still want to drill for oil are planning to cut capital spending by about 3.5%, while majors like Exxon and Chevron hold steady. Some companies are drilling less in Texas and New Mexico, and more in areas with natural gas, which is holding its value better.

BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (June 6, 2025) – The Illinois Soybean Association (ISA) commends members of the Illinois congressional delegation for their steadfast bipartisan support of the 40A Blenders Credit, a critical measure that strengthens America’s biofuels fuel industry while supporting Illinois soybean farmers.

Reps. Mike Bost (R-IL-12), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL-13), Darin LaHood (R-IL-16), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL-17) have all signed onto H.R. 3137, which was introduced by Reps. Mike Carey (R-OH-15) and Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA-1) on May 1.

The bipartisan legislation, which extends the biodiesel and renewable diesel blenders tax credit, represents a crucial investment in America’s energy independence and commitment to soybean farmers and rural communities across the Midwest. As the nation’s top soybean-producing state, Illinois stands to benefit significantly from this extension, which ensures the state’s biofuel refiners stay open, retain good paying jobs and continue to contribute to local and state economies.

“Southern Illinois farmers play a vital role in powering our nation forward – not just with food, but with fuel,” said Rep. Bost. “I’m proud to help lead the effort to extend the biodiesel and diesel blender tax credits, which supports good-paying jobs, strengthens energy independence, and protects the market for Illinois-grown soybeans. This bipartisan bill gives our biofuels producers the certainty they need to keep investing in rural communities and delivering American-made energy.”

“Soybeans are a cornerstone of Illinois’ economy, and few issues are more critical to our state than strengthening the biofuels industry and expanding market opportunities,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I am proud to support this legislation, which extends the federal tax credit for biodiesel producers and encourages continued investment in renewable fuels. We owe it to our farmers to help them stay competitive and provide certainty in these uncertain economic times.”

“Representing one of the largest corn and soybean producing districts in the nation, I know how critical biofuels are to the agriculture industry,” said Rep. LaHood. “The Biodiesel Tax Credit Extension Act will provide more certainty and opportunities for farmers, producers, and rural communities throughout the state. I am proud to join my colleagues in supporting this legislation to invest in the future of Illinois agriculture and American energy independence.”

“Illinois farmers work hard to feed and fuel our country, and they deserve a fair shot in the marketplace. This bill helps keep demand strong for biodiesel made from soybeans grown right here in Illinois and provides stable markets for farmers,” said Congressman Sorensen. “It’s a smart, bipartisan fix that supports good-paying jobs, strengthens our rural economy, and helps us keep moving toward cleaner energy.”

“We’re grateful to our representatives in Congress for recognizing the importance of this measure,” said ISA Chairman Ron Kindred. “Their strong bipartisan support demonstrates their commitment to Illinois farmers and economic stability for our rural communities.”

The 40A Blenders Credit supports biodiesel and renewable diesel production, which creates significant demand for soybean oil and provides stable markets for Illinois soybean farmers. This tax incentive helps level the playing field with petroleum-based fuels, making clean, renewable biodiesel more competitive in the marketplace.

Illinois produces more than 600 million bushels of soybeans annually, and Illinois’ biodiesel industry, which is the 4th largest in the nation with an annual production of approx. 192 million gallons a year, supports nearly 2,000 jobs in all sectors of the state’s economy. The extension of this tax credit will help provide certainty for both farmers and biodiesel producers, allowing for continued growth and investment in the sector.

The bill has earned support from the American Trucking Associations (ATA), Clean Freight Coalition, Energy Marketers of America (EMA), Illinois Soybean Association (ISA), National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS), National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI), NATSO, Representing America’s Travel Centers and Truck Stops, Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), Sustainable Advanced Biofuels Refiners (SABR), SIGMA: America’s Leading Fuel Marketers, National Tank Truck Carriers, and Truckload Carriers Association (TCA).

BACKGROUND ON 40A:

Biodiesel and renewable diesel are advanced biofuels that are generally produced from feedstocks such as soybean oil, recycled cooking oil, or other animal fats. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines the two fuels as renewable fuels that emit at least 50 percent less lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel alternatives. In many cases, biodiesel and renewable diesel reduce emissions by more than 70 percent.

The biodiesel tax credit refers to a group of incentives included in Section 40A(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

The Second-Generation Biofuel Producer Tax Credit provides a tax credit of up to $1.01 per gallon of qualifying advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol made from corn kernel fiber. This tax credit incentivizes investment in innovative fuel production technologies and has resulted in critical advancements in the production of domestically produced second generation biofuels.

The fee adds to the expenses incurred by EV owners, as the bill also includes a provision to phase out consumer tax credits for EVs. As lawmakers debate these policies, Resources for the Future (RFF) researchers consider another key component of the cost of owning an EV—how the costs of public and private EV charging vary, and how charging costs compare to the costs of refueling gasoline-powered vehicles. In an article from the latest issue of Resources magazine, RFF Fellow Beia Spiller and coauthors Trenton Marable and Benjamin Leard collected and analyzed data on these pricing differences. “Home charging is the most financially viable option in terms of reducing the costs associated with EV operation,” the researchers conclude. “With public EV charging … the cost is much higher and can exceed the costs associated with operating and refueling gasoline vehicles.”

Senators are debating the future of clean energy tax credits as they deliberate on the budget reconciliation bill. The bill proposes a phaseout or wholesale repeal of these tax credits, which were designed to incentivize investment in and development of clean energy projects, by the end of 2025. Critics of these broad repeals cite concerns that the loss of these incentives would increase emissions, constrain efforts to meet rising energy demand, and undermine economic gains in US states that already have increased their investment in clean energy projects. In a new In Focus video, RFF Senior Research Associate McKenna Peplinski explains what the repeal of two clean electricity tax credits in question could mean for the energy sector and consumers. “If these two tax credits are repealed, it’s likely that we will see higher emissions for the power sector … and negative consequences for the clean energy sector, as well as for consumers,” says Peplinski.

Wildfires have been burning in Canada since last week, sending smoke southeast into the United States and worsening air quality from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast. This prevalence of wildfire smoke significantly increases people’s exposure to fine particulate matter—known as PM2.5—which poses health risks. But exposure to PM2.5 is not limited to outdoor air pollution. Common household activities, such as cooking, release PM2.5 into the home. Robert D. Metcalfe, a professor at Columbia University, investigated the levels of indoor air pollution in homes and the behavioral changes people make when they are made aware of fluctuating levels. He joined Resources Radio last week to share his findings, along with insights about how this type of research can inform effective public health policy responses. “When we reveal that information to the households … we find that the indoor PM2.5 levels fell by just under two micrograms per cubic meter … a big change,” says Metcalfe.

A new report from the World Meteorological Organization projects that between 2025 and 2029, global temperatures will increase by 1.2°C–1.9°C above pre-industrial levels. The report also forecasts an 80 percent chance that one of those years will be the hottest on record. These projections bring the world close to surpassing limits set by the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperature rise below 2°C—and, more recently, below 1.5°C—to avoid severe impacts of climate change.

In a 2023 issue brief, RFF researchers Jordan Wingenroth, Brian C. Prest, and Kevin Rennert assessed the global economic benefits of limiting temperature increases to the Paris Agreement targets. “We find that mitigation efforts that reduce expected warming to well below 2°C would generate cumulative economic benefits of $467 trillion through 2300,” Wingenroth says. “Relative to the path the world is currently expected to take, that dollar figure amounts to about half of the climate damages from the sectors covered in our model, which demonstrates the substantial value of cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the near term.”

Upcoming Event: Analyzing Policy Action in 2025

This spring, RFF launched its If/Then series, an initiative that shares timely insights from researchers on developments in energy and environmental policy in a rapidly changing legislative landscape. In an upcoming webinar on June 24, RFF scholars Alan Krupnick, Kevin Rennert, and Carlos Martín will be joined by NOTUS reporter Anna Kramer to discuss notable policy actions so far in 2025 and some key issues to watch. Register for the webinar.

Recent Event: Conversations on Electricity Affordability

Electricity affordability is a problem in the United States, as growing electricity demand puts pressure on aging infrastructure. Earlier this week, RFF and Canary Media hosted a panel of journalists, industry experts, and researchers who discussed possible solutions to this problem. “These are the types of conversations we are compelled to have in our current context—conversations about how the energy transition affects all of us in our day-to-day lives,” said Carlos Martín at the event. “Like our colleagues at Canary Media, we work to advance the clean energy transition and find solutions to the climate crisis. And, like Canary Media, we do our best to share information in accessible ways.”

Trade Policies Targeting Foreign Pollution Highlight Shared but Unequal Climate Responsibilities

Countries vary in how they regulate carbon emissions—some require that companies pay domestic fees for generating emissions, while imports from countries with weaker emissions standards often go untaxed. Some countries address this regulatory imbalance by placing fees on imports through policies known as carbon border adjustment mechanisms. But these fees tend to be borne disproportionately by developing countries that historically have contributed little to global emissions. In a new issue brief, RFF researchers Milan Elkerbout and Katarina Nehrkorn, with David Kleimann of ODI Global, examine these international climate-and-trade policies, considering how such policies can meet climate objectives while fairly distributing the responsibility of reducing global emissions.

India’s Urbanization Ambitions Are Shaping Its Plans for Decarbonization

India’s power sector has expanded rapidly over the past 25 years, fueled largely by coal. The timing of this development puts India on a unique path to meeting global emissions-reduction targets. Sandeep Pai, who researches and advises on energy transitions at nonprofit Swaniti Global, joined Resources Radio this week to discuss India’s efforts to expand energy access while moving toward a lower-carbon future. “India has a lot of aspirations to urbanize, grow, and industrialize … to at least reach the world average of per capita electricity consumption,” says Pai. “That means India’s electricity system has to triple as India tries to decarbonize.”",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2185514865.width-600.png,N,,2025-06-06 14:16:31.304542

Dive Brief:

The tax credit transferability provision included in the Inflation Reduction Act has introduced new deal structures and is allowing clean energy developers to secure project financing faster, said speakers at a Thursday panel at the American Council on Renewable Energy’s Finance Forum.

“The closing of transactions has become so much easier,” said Gaurav Raniwala, global renewable energy leader at GE Vernova. “You don't have to line up two different structures simultaneously and then close everything when there's already enough mess going on. And the type of players that are now able to enter the market has broadened significantly.”

A Wednesday report from Crux, a finance technology company that connects tax credit buyers and sellers, said lenders are “increasingly” looking to finance less established technologies like carbon capture, and that “this openness is supported by the robust and progressively more liquid market for transferable tax credits.”

Dive Insight:

Raniwala said that financing had previously relied on the tax equity market, which “was limited in capacity. The industry wanted to be bigger.”

“If you really want to have a dominant energy industry which has abundance of supply to help with electrification, to help with all the AI stuff, we need all sources of energy out there,” he said. “And I think what transferability did was it broadened the market from just traditional tax equity to a whole host of players.”

Crux’s analysis said that “tax equity structures have evolved to hybrid structures, or t-flips, which explicitly contemplate the sale of a portion of tax credits in the transfer market” and found that t-flips “made up about 60% of the tax equity committed in 2024, and that share is expected to rise.”

“Historically, the tax equity market was about a $20 billion a year market dominated for many years by a handful of institutions,” said panelist Meghan Schultz, executive vice president and CFO at Invenergy. “And with the transferability market, the size more than doubled … it allows the tax investor, the tax credit buyer, to be able to monetize those tax benefits without actually needing to be an owner in the project.”

Raniwala noted that transactions can also now be customized based on credit profile. “As an example, you could do the traditional tax equity, but now you know you can transfer the credits, so you could also borrow against those credits from banks.”

Despite this sea change for project financing, transferability itself is endangered, as the budget bill that passed the House last month would eliminate or severely restrict transferability for the credits included in the IRA — and eliminate or shave down the credits themselves.

“The medium-term policy environment contains significant uncertainty, which investors in clean energy and manufacturing projects must navigate,” Crux said.

Crux’s report noted that the Senate will have to pass its own version of the budget, and “senators have telegraphed their desire to make substantive changes to the House’s version. That said, the near-term uncertainty may lead some developers to face higher costs of capital, more limited capital availability, or higher equity requirements as they seek to finance their projects.”

Despite looming threats to the IRA, Crux’s report took a bullish stance overall on the U.S. clean energy economy, noting that it “directed nearly $340 billion in new investment in the United States last year.”

One factor driving new projects is the added transaction speed offered by transferability.

The tax credit trade has “allowed people to close financing much more quickly, to not need to have that tax equity or tax credit buyer lined up at close, knowing that there is this liquid market for the tax credits,” Schultz said. “It’s facilitated speed to market for projects, because you can be efficient in your financing.” The lowered cost of debt and added flexibility of being able to lend against the expected transfer of your credits has also streamlined the process, she said.

David Haug, CEO of Bildmore Clean Energy, said the option to transfer the credits allows developers to choose “whether you want to have a long term offtake contract, or a long term revenue contract or a hedge to lock in your revenues or not.”

“Most of the projects that we're providing [preferred] equity for have a significant component of merchant risk,” he said. “So we do not require them to have long term offtake contracts. We also don't require them to have pre-sold the tax credit. If they want to go all the way to commercial operation with no tax credit sale agreement in place, we will do that because we're betting that the tax credit market is strong, and we're also betting that the merchant power market is strong.”

But accommodating those drivers while preparing for growth within the EV industry remains a work in progress.

The City of Missoula this week unveiled a draft of its new Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan. Two years in the making, the product covers a range of strategies focused on both infrastructure and education.

The plan is set for adoption later this summer, according to Devin Filicicchia, the city's electrification specialist.

“We want EV supply equipment be easy to implement,” he said. “We're looking at land-use regulations, permitting and ordinances to ensure they're not a cumbersome hurdle when someone's thinking about purchase an EV or instilling a charger.”

Montana has one of the lowest EV adoption rates in the country, though the number of electric vehicles on the road is slowly increasing. Statewide, EV registrations nearly doubled in 2023, though pickup trucks still represent around 35% of all registered vehicles.

But that hasn't deterred those looking to move away from combustible engines and go electric. Participants in a recent open house held around the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan mapped their preferred locations for EV charging stations.

Filicicchia said the results weren't a big surprise.

“Many of the locations that people plotted as high-priority areas are areas with high dwell times – or places where people spend a lot of time – and close to businesses or other community centers,” he said. “We're not using it as the end-all-be-all where charging should be located, but it's a helpful start.”

According to the plan, roughly 17 fast DC charging ports were mapped within the Metropolitan Planning Area. Combining that with other data will help inform future action, including the placement of charging stations.

As it stands, Filicicchia said the city can work to simplify the adoption of EV infrastructure and outline goals around public-private partnerships. Future land-use regulations will recognize EV infrastructure needs. Other regulations, such as “across sidewalk” charging and any role local government can play in enhancing EV use, will also be explored, he said.

“We're hoping to layer more data and what the public thinks is important, and create a priority map,” said Filicicchia. “Because we want to see more charging on private land, one of the key strategies will be reaching out to entitles where people want to see charging.”

The state in 2023 adopted its own Montana Alternative Fuel Corridors, identifying Interstates 90 and 15 as corridors, along with Highway 93 and Highway 2. Given that 40% of Missoula's greenhouse gas emissions stem of tailpipes, the city sees growth in the EV market as powerful tool in addressing climate change at the local level.

The plan also calls on the city “to lead by example,” which includes increasing the city's own EV fleet. Filicicchia said the city has roughly 463 vehicles in its fleet, including 11 fully electric, five plug-in hybrid and 42 conventional hybrid vehicles.

Growing those numbers remains challenging, he said.

“I think the development for charging infrastructure for fleet vehicles is the biggest challenges,” he said. “Fleet vehicles are parked at a variety of locations, and many of these facilities are facing changes or a move in the coming years. A comprehensive fleet charging plan is necessary to support future electrification.”

While the future of EV tax credits and other incentives remains uncertain under the Trump administration, industry growth is expected to continue. According to the International Energy Agency, the number of EVs in the U.S. is estimated to reach 27 million by 2030 and 92 million by 2040.

Filicicchia said the city is looking at the University of Montana as a model to enhance its own EV infrastructure plan.

“The university has been a close partner, because they're a great example of providing a lot of workplace charging,” he said. “They have multiple charging locations across campus, and we can receive that data to see what that charging usage looks like.”

Areas identified as Phase 1 of the city's Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan are slated for achievement by 2027. Phase 2 categories lie further down the road.

“This is a plan we're excited to see carried out” said Filicicchia.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e4245ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/980x515+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7a%2F6d%2Fe0b50422416e9defabb50654ca83%2Fattachment-electric.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:27.323341

The U.S. faces a looming nuclear fuel supply gap due to the loss of Russian uranium.
Western enrichment capacity, meanwhile, is dominated by two players that are not American owned.
The European enrichers are reliable partners and have done a good job supporting the market, Vexler told CNBC.
Centrus wants to break the stranglehold that state-owned corporations have over the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain.","President Donald Trump's push to dramatically increase nuclear power in the U.S. will require a tremendous amount of fuel, but the country remains heavily dependent on foreign state-owned companies for its supplies, the CEO of the only publicly traded uranium enricher in the world told CNBC.

""There's barely enough Western enrichment, if at all, to satisfy existing operating plants,"" Centrus Energy CEO Amir Vexler said in an interview. ""If the nuclear industry is to add all this generation capacity, there will have to be a tremendous amount of enrichment capacity that's added.""

Trump issued a series of executive orders on nuclear power last month that set a target for the U.S. to quadruple the sector's capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050. Nuclear energy is one of the few issues in deeply polarized Washington these days that enjoys some level of bipartisan support. Trump's push expands on former President Joe Biden's goal to triple nuclear power by midcentury.

Most nuclear plants worldwide use low-enriched uranium, or LEU. The U.S. relied on foreign countries for around 70% of the fuel for its reactors in 2023, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.

About 27% of U.S. fuel purchases came from Russia that year, one of the principle geopolitical foes of the U.S. But Russian uranium will be forced out of the U.S. supply chain by 2028 at the latest, after Biden signed legislation in 2024 to ban imports over Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. faces a looming nuclear fuel supply gap due to the loss of Russian uranium.

Western enrichment capacity, meanwhile, is dominated by two players that are not American owned. They are France's Orano and a British-Dutch-German consortium called Urenco, according to the World Nuclear Association.

The European enrichers are reliable partners and have done a good job supporting the market, Vexler told CNBC. But trade tensions threaten to disrupt global supply chains, he said on the Centrus first-quarter earnings call.

""We don't have any domestic fuel cycle capacity, almost at all,"" Vexler told CNBC, referring to American-owned companies. ""We don't mine anything, we don't convert anything. We don't enrich anything. We rely on others. And others are all state-owned enterprises, maybe with a few minor exceptions.""

The only commercial enrichment facility operating in the U.S. is owned by Urenco, the European consortium. It is located in Eunice, New Mexico. Centrus wants to break the stranglehold that state-owned corporations have over the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain.

""The circumstances in the market are such that we believe and we're staking everything we have on the fact that the market needs another enricher,"" Vexler said. ""It needs competition.""

Bethesda, Maryland-based Centrus is also the only company in the U.S. that has a license to produce a type of fuel that some next-generation nuclear plant designs, such as small modular reactors, are planning to use.

The U.S. wasn't always dependent on foreign countries. It was the first country to enrich uranium for the commercial market and was a dominant player in the market through the 1980s. The federal government owned and operated the nation's enrichment facilities during that period.

The U.S. sold its enrichment business through a company called the United States Enrichment Corp. in a public offering in 1998. USEC went bankrupt in 2014 as nuclear plants struggled to compete against cheap natural gas and support for the industry declined in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. Centrus emerged from the reorganization of USEC later that year and is now profitable.

""We were just not able to compete with other government, state-owned competitors,"" said Vexler, who took over the helm at Centrus in 2024. When times got tough for the industry, national governments in Europe and Russia would not allow their state-owned enrichers to fail, he said.

Centrus plans to transition away from its trading business as it stands up its domestic enrichment capacity. The vast majority of the enriched uranium produced in Ohio will be sold on the commercial market and potentially for export, Vexler said.

""I would certainly aim for us to not only backfill sort of the vacancy that the Russians are creating, but I also hope that we're going to gain market share, both in the LEU and in the HALEU market,"" Vexler said.

But this will require some level of government support given the state-owned competition, he said. Congress has passed $3.4 billion to support domestic enrichment and reduce U.S. dependence particularly on Russia. Centrus is one of several companies competing for the funding.

""We've always said that it has to be a public-private partnership,"" Vexler said. ""We've been raising our own funds. We've been raising our own financing. We will contribute significantly to this, but we have to have government support.""

""There is a path here where we could have a prosperous, commercially competitive American industry,"" he said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108155194-1749130755984-gettyimages-1733949510-URENCO_URANIUM.jpeg?v=1749130897&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:24.740085

Antipathy toward environmental protections was a hallmark of the first Trump administration, but in his second term, the president and his congressional allies are redoubling their efforts to allow cars to pollute more and limit the adoption of electric vehicles.

Congressional republicans have been working on a budget bill that would radically transform many aspects of American life. Among the environmental protections being stripped away in the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (yes, that's what it's called) is a repeal of the US Environmental Protection Agency's rules on ""greenhouse gas and multi-pollutant emissions standards.""

These regulations are meant to limit the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the US vehicle fleet, a major driver of climate change, as well as the noxious pollutants containing sulfur and nitrogen compounds that have more immediate and deleterious effects on human health. And if the budget bill is sent to Trump to sign, the existing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, implemented in 2022, and the future rules meant to take effect next year will be no more.

The House bill also eliminates the IRS clean vehicle tax credit, which provides up to $7,500 for buyers of some new EVs, plug-in hybrids, and fuel cell EVs; $4,000 for buyers of some used EVs; and the commercial vehicle tax credit of $7,500 that applied to any leased EV.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is on record as supporting the repeal of the EV tax credit, as it would hurt his rivals more than Tesla. But yesterday, Musk decried the fact that the spending bill does not cut subsidies for oil and gas, just EVs and solar.

No fines for you

Yesterday in the Senate, Republicans proposed another new measure that can only be seen as pro-pollution. Should it pass, the EPA would no longer be able to levy fines against carmakers that exceed fleet averages set out in the CAFE regulations. OEMs have paid the government hundreds of millions of dollars in these fines over the past decade. (Note that these fines are different from those imposed on Volkswagen and other automakers for circumventing efficiency standards.)

This would allow OEMs to save money by removing emissions equipment from their products, and it could potentially bring back older powertrains that would otherwise be prohibited on the roads. Tesla may well be the biggest loser here, as the bill removes incentives for other automakers to purchase carbon credits. The GOP is also attacking California's ability to set its own emissions standards. That would remove another major source of emissions credits for Tesla, which are, again, increasingly important in keeping the company's books out of the red.

Over at the Department of Transportation, similar efforts are underway. Secretary Sean Duffy's first action as the head of DOT was to begin reviewing Biden-era fuel efficiency regulations, and today, the department decided that it makes no sense to include EVs as part of its CAFE rules.

At this rate, it's a wonder they're not trying to mandate coal-fired steam engines as an alternative.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2165387463-2560x1440.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:32.041808

ROCKFORD — A Rockford company is preparing to test a prototype that will harness the power of the Rock River to generate electricity for local homes.

Latitude Power of Rockford is working with Studio GWA on a demonstration product that would generate enough electricity to power five homes. If its test is successful, it could pave the way for Rockford to become a hub for micro-hydro cycling systems, state Sen. Steve Stadelman said.

The local companies were awarded a $914,330 grant through the Illinois Equitable Energy Future program to help develop the project at the Fordam Dam in downtown. Stadelman confirmed the award of the grant on Thursday.

“The test program being proposed for the Fordam Dam is just the type of clean energy development we had in mind when we approved the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act,” Stadelman said in a news release. “Rockford has a proud manufacturing tradition, and being the base for production and sales of this technology will bring jobs and could lead to wider economic growth.”

Once proven, the technology would be expanded to generate enough electricity to power at least 50 homes. Latitude Power would also need to reach an agreement with ComEd to direct energy into its grid and offer residential users a credit on their bills.

The demonstration product is expected to take about 18 months to manufacture and install, including the time it takes to obtain approvals required by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, according to Latitude Principal Carl Cacciatore.

“There are all sorts of applications for this that will then spread out across the country,” said Cacciatore, a retired program manager for what is now Collins Aerospace. “Rockford will be at the center of it all.”

Fordam Dam was built in the 1840s as part of the Rockford Water Power Co., and it was first used for hydroelectric power in 1896 by Rockford Electric Co., according to ComEd.

Latitude Power’s grant is among 27 awarded statewide by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. The agency is preparing a third round of applications for $25.5 million in grants.

The federal clean energy incentives have given our state a major boost and Arizona is seizing the opportunity.
It’s about families and communities: better paying jobs, lower energy bills, economic opportunity, stronger schools, and thriving communities.”","“Arizona is on its way to clean energy dominance, with 24 major new projects and more than $11.8 billion in private investments, thanks, in part, to federal clean energy tax incentives that are now under threat,” Steven G. Zylstra, president and CEO of the Arizona Technology Council, wrote in a guest commentary piece published in the Arizona Capitol Times. The state’s ongoing energy transition “means good paying jobs, cleaner air, and thriving communities, especially in rural parts of Arizona that are often overlooked. And it means that Arizona is leading the way as the U.S. seeks to hold its position as a global energy leader,” Zylstra elaborated.

Zylstra pointed to many factories and operations “building a prosperous and vibrant future for our state.” In 2022, American Battery Factory announced the first domestic network of Lithium-Iron Phosphate battery cell giga-factories, which will contribute to chipping away at China’s dominance in manufacturing these batteries that are vital for energy storage systems and electric vehicles. Zhenfang Ge, Chairman of the Board, discussed the impact of these upcoming facilities: “Each factory we build will create an estimated 300 to 1,000 quality jobs. As our network grows, we will help mitigate decades of U.S. manufacturing job losses resulting from the closure of nearly 66,000 U.S. manufacturing sites while eventually making it possible to move the country and the entire world to 100% renewable power.”

In 2023, the company broke ground on a $1.2 billion gigafactory in Tucson that it estimated would create 1,000 jobs and have a $3.1 billion economic impact on Arizona. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero reflected, “Many years from now, when we look back at the global race to develop the clean technologies of the future, people will look to the Sonoran Desert.”

Lucid Motors’ 3 million-square-foot expansion of its U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, which it announced last year in advance of the production launch of the electric Lucid Gravity, also stands out. “The expansion of our manufacturing footprint in Arizona is a significant milestone for the company, as we prepare for the next phase of Lucid’s growth… We are proud to call Casa Grande home, to continue in our role pioneering advanced technology in Arizona, and to be an American electric vehicle company,” said CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson. The company has partnered with the Arizona Commerce Authority, the City of Casa Grande, and Central Arizona College to source, develop, and train local employees.

Meanwhile, in March, Sion Power installed a new large-format battery cell production line at its facility in Tucson. Using lithium metal, these batteries have double the energy density of comparable graphite or silicone anode versions, reducing cell material costs by 15% and cell count by 20%. President Tracy Kelly explained the importance of the technology: “The ability to scale performance from small prototype cells to large-format cells is often where battery technologies face the greatest challenge. Our new manufacturing line bridges that gap, demonstrating the capability of our lithium-metal battery technology in formats applicable to real-world applications.”

Finally, Zylstra highlighted EVelution Energy, which announced in April it would begin building the first solar-powered cobalt processing plant in the U.S. this year. When it is up and running in 2027, the facility near Wellton will be able to meet up to 40% of domestic cobalt demand, benefiting the aerospace, defense, and electric vehicle sectors. The company expects the site to create 3,300 direct, indirect, and induced jobs during its lifetime, many sourced through training programs at the Wellton Campus of the Arizona Western College, and contribute $750 million to the state’s economy. The company expected to benefit from $42.5 million in energy subsidies, however, that is now at risk as Congress considers legislation that could strip such incentives away.

Zylstra explained what is at stake: “Higher-paying jobs will empower more people to buy homes, start small businesses, and make EVs more accessible to everyday consumers. This in turn will help create a higher tax base, which translates into better schools, better roads, and stronger communities.” The U.S. Department of Energy counted more than 65,000 clean energy jobs in the state, accounting for approximately half of all jobs in the energy sector.

Zylstra’s organization promotes the state’s technology ecosystem by organizing events, offering resources, and pushing for policies to connect and empower Arizonian tech companies. He noted, “As president and CEO of the Arizona Technology Council, our mission is to position our state as a clean energy and technology hub and a national center of innovation. The federal clean energy incentives have given our state a major boost and Arizona is seizing the opportunity. Southern Arizona, in particular, with its ideal climate and skilled workforce, is positioned to become a flourishing clean energy hub for the nation.”

Moreover, Zylstra highlighted the importance of the projects in the district of Rep. Juan Ciscomani, where, according to Climate Power, new projects representing “at least half a billion dollars” will contribute to making the region “the capital of electric batteries while the state becomes a solar powerhouse and electric-vehicle manufacturing hub.”

Although the U.S. House’s version of the reconciliation bill essentially takes a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits, there is still hope to preserve them as the Senate considers the legislation. Zylstra expanded that the significance is more than these industries: “This isn’t just about businesses and factories and leading the way. It’s about families and communities: better paying jobs, lower energy bills, economic opportunity, stronger schools, and thriving communities.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/481180429_1088233103339216_3734100789110007386_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 15:11:42.237782

Research has shown that it costs more to operate most coal plants than it would to build wind and solar power replacements.
Thirty power plants with a combined capacity of 12.2 gigawatts are scheduled to retire just this year.
Of those facilities, 10 are coal plants with a combined capacity of 7.7 gigawatts.","A 63-year-old coal-fired power plant was scheduled to permanently close its doors in Michigan on June 1. So was an oil- and gas-powered plant that was built in the 1960s in Pennsylvania.

But at the last minute, the Trump administration ordered both to stay open. The orders came as it pursues a far-reaching plan to boost fossil fuels, including coal, by declaring a national “energy emergency.”

The grid operators in Michigan and Pennsylvania said they hadn’t asked for the orders and hadn’t planned on using the plants this summer.

The costs to keep the plants open, which could total tens of millions of dollars, are expected to fall on consumers. Experts have said there’s little evidence of a national energy emergency, and 15 states have sued to challenge President Trump’s declaration, which was issued the day he took office.

The emergency orders, which came last month, surprised the companies that operate the plants, and they are now scrambling to delay some workers’ retirements and reverse nearly complete plans to shutter their facilities. In Michigan, the plant operator raced to buy enough coal to power operations.

The episode marks a highly unusual use of the Energy Department’s emergency powers under the Federal Power Act. In the past, the department has typically issued emergency orders at the request of regional grid operators to stabilize the power supply during extreme weather events and blackouts.

Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission, said he estimated that the 90-day order to keep the coal plant open would cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars.

“What was surprising about this order is that nobody was asking for it,” he said. “The grid operator wasn’t asking for this plant to be kept online. The utility that owns and operates the plant wasn’t asking for the plant to be kept online, the state wasn’t asking for the plant to be kept online.”

Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general, a Democrat, said she was “certainly considering” challenging the order affecting the coal plant in her state.

“We think this is par for the course with the Trump administration,” Ms. Nessel said. “They’re abusing emergency authorities and really manufacturing an emergency that doesn’t exist, in a way that’s really unprecedented.”

Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization, also plans to challenge the orders, according to Tyson Slocum, the group’s energy program director.

In a statement, Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said the department under Mr. Trump was “ensuring Americans have access to all forms of reliable energy, including coal” and that the administration was committed to ensuring access to “reliable, affordable, and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows.”

The Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The plant was just one week away from closing. The order prompted a rush to replenish the giant coal pile that feeds the plant, which had dwindled ahead of the planned closure. Coal is the dirtiest of the fossil fuels in terms of planet-warming pollution.

A week later, near Philadelphia, the oil- and gas-powered Eddystone plant was one day away from closing when it received similar news. In order to keep the affected units available, Constellation Energy, the facility’s parent company, is “currently focused on securing the staff and performing the maintenance necessary,” a spokesman said.

In its official order, the Energy Department cited projections showing potential summertime electricity generation shortfalls as the basis for the emergency action. Electricity demand is typically higher during the summer when temperatures rise and people use air-conditioning. Overall electricity demand is projected to increase because of data center construction and the adoption of electric vehicles.

All told, 108 plants with a combined capacity of 31.5 gigawatts are set to be retired by the end of Mr. Trump’s term. That list includes 25 coal plants with a combined capacity of 18.2 gigawatts. One gigawatt is roughly enough to power the city of San Francisco.

Mr. Trump attempted something similar during his first term, but the idea faced fierce opposition from grid operators, power companies and consumers, and the White House eventually backed down.

The April order was one in a wave of executive actions aimed at reviving the coal industry by slashing regulations and opening more land for mining, among other things. Coal use in the United States has been declining for more than a decade, and coal plants now produce less than a fifth of the nation’s power.

Despite Mr. Trump’s vocal support of coal during his first administration, the period saw more coal capacity retired than the Biden era did. Research has shown that it costs more to operate most coal plants than it would to build wind and solar power replacements.

Thirty power plants with a combined capacity of 12.2 gigawatts are scheduled to retire just this year. Of those facilities, 10 are coal plants with a combined capacity of 7.7 gigawatts. Another 12 plants set to retire this year are powered by natural gas or oil.

These facilities are generally being replaced with renewables, but grid operators have raised concerns that new sources of energy are not coming online fast enough to meet supply shortfalls left by retiring plants.

Companies that generate power typically work with grid operators, often years in advance, to ensure that a planned retirement will not increase the risk of blackouts or other power failures.

Grid operators have broad power to reverse or delay planned retirements if they forecast an electricity generation shortfall. Because of electricity reliability concerns, PJM Interconnection, a grid operator affected by the Energy Department’s emergency orders in May, separately called on two power plants that burn oil and coal to stay open four years past their retirement dates this year.

Because the Michigan and Pennsylvania plants were set to close at the end of May, keeping these plants open will involve spending money on maintenance, staff and supplies, and these additional costs are expected to be borne by consumers through higher bills.

In Michigan, Consumers Energy rushed to buy more coal. The plant which uses 15,000 tons of coal per day bought from Wyoming and Montana. And then there were other costs: Employees who had planned to retire or transfer were suddenly needed for at least another three months.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/06/multimedia/06cli-doe-emergency-01-fvlb/06cli-doe-emergency-01-fvlb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:28.030337

While demand for clean energy continues to grow, executive orders, regulatory changes, and evolving legislative priorities are reshaping the landscape for project development and investment.

In this Insight based on our Earth Day webinar series we outline some of the key federal developments affecting renewables in 2025, including changes to permitting and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementation, vehicle emissions standards, the future of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax incentives, and additional considerations for clean energy project developers, and highlight how legal and regulatory changes are being implemented and what to watch in the months ahead.

RENEWABLE INFRASTRUCTURE PERMITTING

The administration’s early executive orders have sent strong signals that it intends to prioritize domestic fossil fuel production over renewable energy development. The implications for project permitting are particularly acute.

Executive Orders

Three major executive actions will reshape the permitting landscape:

National Energy Emergency Declaration: Defines “energy” to include fossil fuels but excludes solar and wind, directs agencies to invoke emergency powers under the Defense Production Act to accelerate fossil fuel projects, and provides specific instructions for expediting Clean Water Act permitting and Endangered Species Act reviews for such projects.

Unleashing American Energy: Directs agencies to revise or repeal regulations that hinder fossil fuel development, rescinds multiple Biden-era environmental orders, and instructs the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to withdraw NEPA regulations and issue new permitting guidance.

Offshore Wind Leasing Halt: Suspends new offshore wind leases, raising concerns about the reliability of federal permitting for renewables.

Collectively, these measures have introduced uncertainty and additional risk for clean energy projects across the country.

NEPA Reform

The rescission of the CEQ’s NEPA regulations represents a particularly significant change in federal policy for the renewables sector. The interim final rule removes the governmentwide framework for environmental reviews, replacing it with a directive that agencies craft their own NEPA regulations.

This transition period raises key questions:

Will agencies voluntarily follow now-rescinded CEQ guidance?

How will courts treat NEPA documents prepared under the old framework?

Will ongoing or future litigation challenge agency processes be built on unstable legal footing?

The administration has stated that permitting should continue without delay, however, the absence of consistent guidance combined with pending litigation and shifting agency procedures has introduced notable uncertainty, making it more difficult for developers to predict permitting timelines or requirements.

As agencies work to update or replace their NEPA processes, developers must stay closely engaged with regulators, monitor evolving standards, and remain flexible in project planning to avoid delays or compliance setbacks.

VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS

The transportation sector, another key pillar of the energy transition, is undergoing a similar recalibration. The previous administration’s tailpipe rules and fuel economy standards aimed to accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption. The current administration is now working to unwind those efforts, and a budget reconciliation bill currently making its way through the US Congress includes provisions to revise or repeal the programs discussed below.

GHG Tailpipe Rules

The previous administration’s tailpipe rules for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles set aggressive greenhouse gas (GHG) emission limits, effectively pushing automakers toward electrification. It was projected that EVs would make up 60% of new car sales by 2030 and 67% by 2032. However, these rules are now in legal limbo.

Under the Unleashing American Energy executive order, agencies have been instructed to revise or suspend rules that limit consumer vehicle choice. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stated its intent to revise these tailpipe standards and the 2022 nitrogen oxide rules for trucks, which also incentivized manufacturers toward EVs.

The previous administration’s rules technically remain in effect and litigation over them is paused, but they are providing little to no incentive for EV adoptions as their compliance deadlines remain years away and the industry anticipates that they will soon be repealed and replaced.

CAFE Standards

Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, overseen by the US Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), have received less public attention but also face revision. These fuel economy benchmarks were aligned with EPA’s tailpipe rules and similarly incentivized EV production. NHTSA is now reconsidering these standards, with litigation held in abeyance pending agency action.

The California Waiver

In May 2025, Congress passed resolutions under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to nullify EPA waivers granted to California for its Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks programs along with related nitrogen oxide standards. These waivers issued under the Clean Air Act have long allowed California to set more stringent vehicle emissions rules. More than a dozen states follow these stricter standards, collectively representing roughly half of the US auto market.

This action by Congress followed earlier determinations by the Senate parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office that such waivers do not constitute “rules” under the CRA and are therefore not subject to its provisions. The resolutions now await the president’s signature.

California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, have announced intentions to challenge the revocation in court, arguing that it undermines the state’s longstanding authority under the Clean Air Act to protect public health and the environment. The outcome of this legal dispute could have significant implications for state-level environmental regulations and the broader framework of federalism in environmental policy.

The IRA fundamentally reshaped the US clean energy economy by introducing and expanding tax credits across the energy supply chain and for deployment and the way these credits could be monetized. While these benefits remain in place, they face political headwinds.

Background and Scope

The IRA enhanced or introduced federal income tax credits for renewable electricity, energy storage, clean hydrogen and other clean fuel, and carbon capture utilization and storage facilities, among other technologies.

It introduced credit-enhancing “adders” for meeting certain labor standards, using domestic content, “energy community” location, and investing in low-income communities. The IRA also introduced the advanced manufacturing credit for US production of clean tech equipment and critical minerals.

Critically, the IRA enacted two new ways to monetize these tax credits, transferability and direct payment. These provisions opened the market to new investors and financing structures, significantly expanding participation in the clean energy economy.

Current Status

With a Republican trifecta now in place for control of the US House of Representatives, Senate, and presidency, the future of these tax benefits is unclear. Guidance on IRA tax provisions has largely halted. A regulatory freeze was imposed shortly after the new administration took office.

Additionally, lawmakers are pursuing a budget reconciliation bill that seeks to extend the 2017 tax cuts and enact other tax cuts, and limitation and accelerated sunset of IRA tax benefits and transferability monetization are being proposed as offsetting revenue raisers.

While the tax credit transfer market has flourished since the IRA’s enactment, with a wide range of buyers and sellers now active, uncertainty is dampening enthusiasm. Developers and investors are increasingly focused on demonstrating that projects began construction early enough to hopefully “safe harbor” from any new legislative changes. Still, no strategy offers absolute protection in the current climate until legislation becomes certain.

CONSIDERATIONS FOR PROJECT DEVELOPERS

In addition to the above policy shifts, regulatory uncertainty, and market disruptions, renewable energy developers must contend with the following:

Permitting Risk and Offshore Wind: The abrupt halt of the Empire Wind project, despite extensive permitting and billions in secured financing, has raised concerns about the durability of federal approvals. While the stop work order was recently lifted, the lack of notice or process surrounding the pause has not only caused the developer significant financial losses but also created broader uncertainty across the project finance market, calling into question whether other federally permitted projects could face similar disruptions.

Impacts of Prolonged Fossil Fuel Operations: Executive orders aimed at keeping coal plants online will have an impact on electricity markets. These legacy facilities were previously scheduled for retirement and their extended operation could slow investment in renewable energy projects in the short term.

Tariff Uncertainty and Supply Chain Disruption: The imposition of reciprocal tariffs has complicated procurement for solar and storage projects, particularly those relying on manufacturers based in Asia. Projects already under construction are particularly exposed, as fluctuating costs and delivery schedules impact budgets and financing arrangements.

Tax Credit Market Caution: As noted above, the post-IRA boom spurred by the new and enhanced tax credits and monetization methods brought many new participants into the clean energy deployment, manufacturing, and financing spaces. But with policy changes under consideration, some parties are pulling back, and financings based on tax credit monetization (including credit transfers) now face increased uncertainty in light of this risk. The financing market for IRA tax credit benefitting in-development projects has generally proceeded in earnest, but pricing and terms continue to evolve on a real-time basis to react to this legislative uncertainty.

Defensive Strategies: Developers are responding by advancing construction timelines to qualify under current tax rules, revisiting offtake agreements to reflect cost volatility, and exploring alternative suppliers to hedge against tariff-related delays and price swings. These risk mitigation efforts are becoming essential in project planning and execution.

CONCLUSION

While renewable energy demand remains strong, the policy landscape in 2025 has so far been defined by legal uncertainty and administrative changes. Executive orders, rescinded regulations, stalled guidance, and legislative developments are forcing developers and investors to rethink strategies, assess new risks, and act decisively to protect the viability of current and future projects.

In this environment, close monitoring of agency and legislative actions and developments, proactive project planning, and agile legal guidance are more important than ever. The road ahead may be uncertain, but for those who adapt opportunity remains.",https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/tiles/energy-environmental/earth-day-webinar-series_478656454_240717_largetile.jpg?rev=ed5aa94be8174b3bb3a7c333c6bc6530&hash=691947489C864498F2DDA69BCCB3FE21,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:02.762298

(AP) — On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama’s administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they’ve collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

“We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,” said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press’ analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

Experts See a Role for Registry in Cutting Emissions

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to … document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that’s an inducement to lower emissions.

“It is money for those companies. It’s costs. It’s reputation. It’s been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country’s air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

“The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know” how bad the air is, Roque said.

EPA Seeks to Cancel Money to Fund Some Monitoring

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group’s community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

Big picture view:

The Rochester man who was president of a chemical company when it allegedly dumped thousands of gallons of environmental waste into the Flint River in 2022 will stand trial.

Rajinder Singh Minhas, 60,was bound over this week on four felony counts, including:

Falsely altering a public record - 14-year felony

Uttering and publishing a false or altered public record - 14-year felony

Substantial endangerment to the public - 5-year felony

In a new video conversation, environmental scientist Dana Nuccitelli, a research coordinator for the nonprofit Citizens’ Climate Lobby and Yale Climate Connections contributor, joins features editor Pearl Marvell of Yale Climate Connections to explain what’s at stake.

Passed by Democrats in 2022, the IRA invests hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years in clean energy, from electric vehicle tax credits to new solar panel factories. But now Republican Senators are considering a bill – already passed by the House – that would slash those investments to help fund their top priority: extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts.

Nuccitelli explains that repealing key parts of the IRA would eliminate hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy incentives. Ironically, the lion’s share of these benefits has gone to Republican-leaning districts, where land for clean energy development is most available.

Without the IRA’s support, communities that have seen new factories, battery storage sites, and solar farms could instead face layoffs, stalled projects, and rising power bills.

So why would lawmakers target a policy that’s creating jobs and boosting rural economies?

Nuccitelli says it’s less about favoring fossil fuel interests and more about a budget trade-off: Republican lawmakers are prioritizing extending the tax cuts and minimizing the federal deficit. Repealing the IRA’s tax credits – worth about $560 billion – is one way to help pay for that.

Despite growing calls from both parties for Congress and federal agencies to reform that process, there had been few significant revisions—until now.

In one fell swoop, the U.S. Supreme Court has changed a big part of the game.

Whether the effects are good or bad depends on the viewer’s perspective. Either way, there is a new interpretation in place for the law that is the centerpiece of the debate about permitting—the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, known as NEPA.

Taking a big-picture look

NEPA requires federal agencies to document and describe the environmental effects of any proposed action, including construction of oil pipelines, renewable energy, and other infrastructure projects.

Only after completing that work can the agency make a final decision to approve or deny the project. These reports must evaluate direct effects, such as the destruction of habitat to make way for a new highway, and indirect effects, such as the air pollution from cars using the highway after it is built.

Decades of litigation about the scope of indirect effects have widened the required evaluation. As I explain it to my students, that logical and legal progression is reminiscent of the popular children’s book If You Give a Mouse a Cookie, in which granting a request for a cookie triggers a seemingly endless series of further requests—for a glass of milk, a napkin, and so on. For the highway example, the arguments went, even if the agency properly assessed the pollution from the cars, it also had to consider the new subdivisions, malls, and jobs the new highway foreseeably could induce.

The challenge for federal agencies was knowing how much of that potentially limitless series of indirect effects courts would require them to evaluate. In recent litigation, the question in particular has been how broad a range of effects on and from climate change could be linked to any one specific project and therefore require evaluation.

With the court’s ruling, federal agencies’ days of uncertainty are over.

Biggest NEPA case in decades

On May 29, 2025, the Supreme Court (minus Justice Neil Gorsuch, who had recused himself) decided the case of Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, the first major NEPA dispute before the court in 20 years.

At issue was an 85-mile rail line a group of developers proposed to build in Utah to connect oil wells to the interstate rail network and from there transport waxy crude oil to refineries in Louisiana, Texas, and elsewhere. The federal Surface Transportation Board reviewed the environmental effects and approved the required license in 2021.

The report was 637 pages long, with more than 3,000 pages of appendices containing additional information. It acknowledged but did not give a detailed assessment of the indirect “upstream” effects of constructing the rail line—such as spurring new oil drilling—and the indirect “downstream” effects of the ultimate use of the waxy oil in places as far-flung as Louisiana.

In February 2022, Eagle County, Colorado, through which trains coming from the new railway would pass, along with the Center for Biological Diversity appealed that decision in federal court, arguing that the board had failed to properly explain why it did not assess those effects. Therefore, the county argued, the report was incomplete and the board license should be vacated.

In August 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed and held that the agency had failed to adequately explain why it could not employ “some degree of forecasting” to identify those impacts and that the board could prevent those effects by exercising its authority to deny the license.

The railway developers appealed to the Supreme Court, asking whether NEPA requires a federal agency to look beyond the action being proposed to evaluate indirect effects outside its own jurisdiction.

A resounding declaration

Writing for a five-justice majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered a ringing, table-pounding lecture about courts run amok.

Kavanaugh did not stop to provide specific support for each admonition, describing NEPA as a “legislative acorn” that has “grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development.” He bemoaned the “delay upon delay” NEPA imposes on projects as so complicated that it bordered “on the Kafkaesque.”

In his view, “NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents.” He called for “a course correction . . . to bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense.” His opinion reset the course in three ways.

First, despite the Supreme Court having recently reduced the deference courts must give to federal agency decisions in other contexts, Kavanaugh wrote that courts should give agencies strong deference when reviewing an agency’s NEPA effects analyses. Because these assessments are “fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of its inquiry . . . (c)ourts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.”

Second, Kavanaugh crafted a new rule saying that the review of one project did not need to consider the potential indirect effects of other related projects it could foreseeably induce, such as the rail line encouraging more drilling for oil. This limitation is especially relevant, Kavanaugh emphasized, when the effects are from projects over which the reviewing agency does not have jurisdiction. That applied in this case, because the board does not regulate oil wells or oil drilling.

And third, Kavanaugh created something like a “no harm, no foul” rule, under which “even if an [environmental impact statement] falls short in some respects, that deficiency may not necessarily require a court to vacate the agency’s ultimate approval of a project.” The strong implication is that courts should not overturn an agency decision unless its NEPA assessment has a serious flaw.

The upshot for the project at hand was that the Supreme Court deferred to the board’s decision that it could not reliably predict the rail line’s effects on oil drilling or use of the oil transported. And the fact that the agency had no regulatory power over those separate issues reinforced the idea that those concerns were outside the scope of the board’s required review.

A split court

Although Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote that she would have reached the same end result and upheld the agency permit, her proposed test is far narrower.

By her reading, the federal law creating the Surface Transportation Board restricted it from considering the broader indirect effects of the rail line. But her finding would be relevant only for any federal agencies whose governing statutes were similarly restrictive. By contrast, Kavanaugh’s “course correction” applies to judicial review of NEPA findings for all federal agencies.

Though the full effects remain to be seen, this decision significantly changes the legal landscape of environmental reviews of major projects. Agencies will have more latitude to shorten the causal chain of indirect effects they consider, and to exclude them entirely if they flow from separate projects beyond the agency’s regulatory control.

Now, for example, if a federal agency is considering an application to build a new natural gas power plant, the review must still include its direct greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on the climate. But emissions that could result from additional gas extraction and transportation projects to fuel the power plant, and any climate effects from whatever the produced electricity is used for, are now clearly outside the agency’s required review. And if the agency voluntarily decided to consider any of those effects, courts would have to defer to its analysis, and any minor deficiencies would be inconsequential.

That is a far cry from how the legal structure around the National Environmental Policy Act has worked for decades. For lawyers, industry, advocacy groups, and the courts, environmental review after the Eagle County decision is not just a new ball game—it’s a new sport.

In its latest Car Wars report, BofA analyst John Murphy warns that the next four or more years will bring “unprecedented” disruption for automakers, citing delayed EV adoption, regulatory uncertainty, and collapsing pricing in China. “The unprecedented EV head-fake has wreaked havoc on product plans,” Murphy said Wednesday during an Automotive Press Association event near Detroit.

The Car Wars report, an annual forecast of product strategies and model launches, predicts billions in upcoming EV-related write-downs as automakers unwind overly ambitious electric rollout plans. For instance, Ford’s $1.9 billion charge in 2023 for scrapping its planned all-electric three-row SUV is likely the first of many.

Amidst that financial strain, automakers are shifting their focus back to their most profitable core offerings, particularly internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and hybrids. Murphy emphasized that cash generation will be critical.

Moreover, automakers are expected to lead product replacement through 2029, with notable contributions from Tesla (22.4%), Honda (16.9%), Hyundai/Kia (16.5%), and Ford (16.1%). Those below the 16% industry average include Nissan (12.3%), Toyota (13.7%), and European legacy brands (15.2%). GM and Stellantis fall just below average at 15.7% and 15.4%, respectively.

Meanwhile, China is experiencing a market collapse due to extreme price wars and oversaturation. According to Nomura, average car prices have decreased by 19% over the past two years, with sharper declines for hybrids (–27%) and EVs (–21%). Murphy warned of looming consolidation among China’s hundreds of automakers and recommended shielding the U.S. market from an influx of cheap Chinese exports in the near term.

The report also notes a slowdown in the launch of new models. Automakers expect to release only 159 models over the next four years, down from more than 200 in previous cycles. Murphy noted that the “crossover surge is over,” as Detroit automakers focus on refreshing their full-size pickups, while Japanese manufacturers struggle with unpredictable production schedules.

Despite missed expectations in EVs and connectivity, Murphy still sees opportunities in automotive software and dealer services. He highlighted a $2.4 trillion aftermarket business, half of which is untapped by automakers. “It is vision critical that you get the dealers on board,” Murphy said, arguing that tech-driven service and sales strategies could unlock $133 billion in new profitability.

This year’s analysis is the 10th edition of the report and details energy investment trends through 2024 and the start of 2025. The investment surge reflects not only continued efforts to cut emissions, but also growing concerns over energy security and industrial competitiveness.

Investment in clean technologies is projected to draw $2.2 trillion and is double the investment expected in fossil fuels. This is driven by growth in renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, energy efficiency and electric transport. Solar PV alone is forecast to attract $450 billion, making it the single largest energy investment category worldwide. Nuclear power investment will exceed $70bn in 2025, representing a 50% increase over five years.

IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol noted that despite economic uncertainty and rising geopolitical tensions, energy security remains a powerful motivator for countries and companies alike. He clarified that, “The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”

One of the biggest barriers is the lack of modern grid infrastructure. Investment in electricity grids, currently at $400 billion annually, is falling short of what's needed to keep up with renewable energy deployment and growing electricity demand. Prolonged permitting processes, supply chain delays and underfunded utilities, particularly in developing economies, are stalling progress.

Meanwhile, fossil fuel investment is expected to decline, with upstream oil spending set to fall by 6% in 2025- the sharpest drop since 2016, outside the COVID-19 pandemic. However, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is on a growth path, with major new projects in the US, Qatar, and Canada expected to expand global capacity significantly between 2026 and 2028.

Investment in clean technologies is still heavily concentrated in advanced economies, with China now the world’s largest energy investor, spending nearly as much as the US and EU combined. In contrast, regions like Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America continue to lag behind, raising concerns about the equity of the global energy transition: “Despite being home to 20% of the world’s population and rapidly growing energy demand, total investment across the continent has fallen by a third over the past decade due to declining fossil fuel spending and insufficient growth in clean energy.”

The IEA warns that while overall investment levels are moving in the right direction, achieving net-zero goals by mid-century will require more money from international public finance organisations, as well as more strategic and inclusive deployment of capital, particularly to developing countries.

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 175 mayors, city council members and county commissioners from 45 states and the District of Columbia signeda letter asking members of the Senate Finance Committee to preserve clean energy tax credits that would be rescinded in theOne Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The bill, currently being debated in the Senate,calls for rapidly phasing down tax credits for clean energy sources, including wind, solar and geothermal, that were part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The May 29 letter states the local leaders “are concerned that repealing these clean energy tax credits could create economic uncertainty in our communities.”

Dive Insight:

The Inflation Reduction Act made 13 clean energy tax credits available to state and local governments and public power utilities throughelective pay, a platform that allows them to receive a payment equal to the full value of a tax credit when they build qualifying clean energy projects, even if they do not owe Federal income taxes.

“For the first time, state and local governments, as well as essential nonprofit community organizations – such as houses of worship, hospitals, and schools – can access the same clean energy tax credits as the private sector through elective pay,” the letter states. “This has led to major projects in our communities like solar installations for town halls, alternative fueling infrastructure and charging stations for local government fleets of electric and alternative fueled vehicles, electric school buses, and more.”

More than 500 state and local governments are accessing the incentives, according to the letter. Repealing them would “raise energy costs by $489 a year for families, result in up to 97,000 net fewer American jobs, hurt private sector investments, slow economic growth, and make the U.S. less globally competitive,” the letter states.

Laura Jay, deputy director of Climate Mayors, a bipartisan network of nearly 350 mayors, said in an email that clean energy tax credits “provide an undeniable economic boost to cities and towns nationwide.” Mayors are using them to update critical local infrastructure and invest in clean energy solutions, she said. “They are a win-win for improving affordability, growing jobs, and addressing climate change, which is why mayors and local leaders of all stripes are calling on Congress to preserve them.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/NED0f_NvwtFelrL8ul3DGY-nqP9c0cCak34RvuyCR6U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4NjgyNTI1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:17.709169

The only energy emergency in the U.S. is the failure to transition fast enough to clean energy.","In the Trump administration’s latest attempt to try to prop up costly, polluting fossil fuel-burning power plants, the Department of Energy (DOE) ordered two power plants to keep operating, overturning long-time plans to retire the aging, polluting power plants.

The orders, which came just days or hours before each power plant was scheduled to retire, are part of an unprecedented power grab to override the decisions made in the interest of customers by power companies, grid operators, state utility regulators, and state legislators.

The DOE ordered the J.H. Campbell coal plant in West Olive, MI and two units of the Eddystone oil and gas power plant in Eddystone, PA to remain open for the summer.

Under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, a statute originally passed in the 1930s, Congress gave the DOE a last-resort option to solve energy reliability issues during emergencies such as hurricanes, wildfires, and extreme winter storms. In these recent moves, however, the administration is falsely invoking emergency powers in order to evade the usual legal and regulatory decision-making process.

These unprecedented actions threaten to keep some of the nation’s oldest and dirtiest power plants operating unnecessarily and could end up costing utility customers millions, especially if the orders get extended or renewed. Earthjustice will continue to fight on behalf of consumers and communities to resist this abuse of power.

Sham ‘Emergency’ Order Will Cost Utility Customers

DOE ordered the Campbell plant to continue operation just eight days before the power plant was scheduled to retire, as long-agreed to and planned for in a 2022 settlement that let the aging power plant substantially reduce its spending on major maintenance and capital projects needed for long term operation. The Campbell plant remains the largest source of air pollution and climate-harming emissions in western Michigan.

As part of the 2022 settlement, Consumers Energy (the owner of the power plant) already purchased another power plant to make up for the generation previously provided by Campbell, extended the lives of two other generating units, and is in the process of building or acquiring significant amounts of wind, solar, and storage resources. Continuing to operate an unnecessary and expensive coal plant threatens to saddle Consumers Energy customers with increased utility bills and dirtier air and is counter to the state’s goal of 100% clean energy by 2040.

In addition to usurping the judgment of Michigan regulators, the utility, the state Attorney General, and numerous other parties who negotiated and approved the 2022 settlement, the Department of Energy order, if allowed to stand, will potentially cost Michiganders millions of dollars or more in order to further the Trump administration’s agenda to prop up expensive, dirty, and uncompetitive coal resources.

There is no evidence to support an emergency declaration. Consumers Energy, the Michigan Public Service Commission, and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) have all concluded that there is no reliability risk created by Campbell’s retirement. The DOE order cites the most recent NERC assessment, but takes its conclusions out of context. NERC found an elevated risk of needing to make operational changes only by making “extreme” assumptions, and even then, confirmed that the risk can be addressed with available tools such as demand response and transfers of power from neighboring areas. Similarly, the MISO auction results “demonstrated sufficient capacity” by the order’s own admission.

Instead of addressing a genuine need, the order is a pretext for the Trump administration to justify propping up expensive and polluting coal generation. As Consumers Energy and the Michigan Public Service Commission found in the 2022 settlement, however, the planned retirement of the Campbell plant would save ratepayers money and reduce the public health impacts caused by burning coal. The cost of operating coal power plants has only gone up since then — and is likely to be heightened at the Campbell plant, where preparations were already well underway for the plant’s planned retirement.

Forcing Campbell Coal Plant to Operate is a Costly, Illegal Abuse of DOE’s Authority

There is no legal basis or precedent for the administration to grant the Secretary of Energy sole authority to force a retiring power plant to remain open. DOE’s role, as designated under Federal Power Act Section 202(c), is limited:

Section 202(c) only applies to wartime situations or certain unexpected emergencies such as hurricanes or wildfires that pose an immediate threat.

The law limits the solutions that the Secretary can order to “temporary interconnections” and directives concerning the flow of electricity. Longer-term issues and planning decisions are made in processes before state commissions and other bodies.

If an order conflicts with environmental requirements, the law requires that such conflicts be minimized as much as possible and limits the order to only the hours necessary to meet the emergency and serve the public interest.

In overstepping these restrictions, DOE’s orders will not hold up in court. And DOE’s orders cannot substantiate an “emergency” that does not exist.

Myriad planning processes and operational protocols exist to ensure that the power stays on. States, for example, often require utilities to conduct Integrated Resource Plans that look years into the future in order to plan for resource mix and adequate total supply to meet demand under a range of scenarios. Depending on the region, states or regional grid operators ensure there is enough excess generation to meet “planning reserve margins.” Additionally, NERC works with stakeholders to develop reliability standards, which are binding and enforceable once approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

In addition to these proactive planning measures, grid operators conduct reliability studies whenever a generator announces it plans to shut down. If the study reveals that a grid reliability issue would be caused by the plant’s retirement, it explores solutions to the reliability issue, including temporarily allowing the plant to operate with a special agreement, filed at FERC, to recoup its costs.

In light of the robust, multi-layered system to ensure electric system reliability, especially in recent decades, DOE has generally used its 202(c) authority only in truly time-sensitive emergencies affecting the power system. As a result, previous orders have recognized that extra generation is likely only needed for limited hours, and usually include requests that consumers reduce their electricity usage. These orders insist that utilities use tools with less or no environmental harm before authorizing operation of generation under narrowly tailored emergency circumstances. In contrast, by directing the broader continued operation of dirty fossil fuel plants like Campbell without an actual emergency situation, the Trump DOE disregards state policy, energy affordability, and the limits imposed on its authority by Congress.

DOE’s order to force ongoing operation of the Eddystone plant makes the political agenda motivating these claims of “emergency” more explicit. The order states that DOE plans to evaluate Eddystone again in the future, under a yet-to-be-published methodology for evaluating power plants’ contributions to the grid required by executive order. But DOE cannot use a poorly substantiated Section 202(c) to halt a power plant’s retirement merely as a placeholder until DOE can contrive a new rationale. The only energy emergency in the U.S. is the failure to transition fast enough to clean energy. This administration has tried to throttle domestic energy production by pausing all wind energy projects, halting funding for hundreds of clean energy projects across the U.S., and proposing to gut DOE’s budget for offices that administer programs for solar and wind energy, energy efficiency, and the office that helps upgrade America’s electric infrastructure.

Coal use has been falling for decades. Forcing power companies to run polluting fossil fuel plants they do not need will not only harm our health, the climate, and communities, but also our wallets. Renewable sources of energy are now less expensive than coal for almost every coal plant in the country. These orders and the President’s executive order on grid reliability threaten a political takeover of the electricity grid, granting the Secretary of Energy the sole authority to override markets, states, FERC, and NERC to bolster uneconomic and polluting fossil fuels.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-06-06 12:24:35.262248

Xcel Energy’s nuclear power plants — Monticello and Prairie Island — supply nearly 25 percent of the electricity used across the company’s five-state Upper Midwest system.

The facilities are a cornerstone of Xcel’s carbon-free energy strategy and now, with federal tax credits in place, a source of direct financial benefit to customers.

“Nuclear energy is an important piece of American energy security,” Long added. “It helps us support economic growth in the Upper Midwest, deliver reliable and resilient electricity, and keep customers’ bills as low as possible.”

Customers in Minnesota, who account for the largest portion of the company’s regional base, are already receiving $176 million in similar nuclear tax credit savings, according to Xcel’s statement.

Xcel Energy also noted that under current federal law, customers are eligible to receive the nuclear production tax credits through 2032.

The company also recently secured federal approval to extend the operating life of its Monticello nuclear plant and plans to seek a similar extension for Prairie Island.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/shutterstock_1131155645.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 16:12:30.889425

Rare earths are a group of 17 elements used in many of the world's most advanced technologies, including semiconductors, electric cars and guided missiles used by the military.

Before they can be used, the minerals must be turned into magnets, and China produces as much as 95% of the world's rare earth magnets, according to energy research company Wood Mackenzie.

""I'd say we're a good 10, 15 years behind,"" USA Rare Earth CEO Joshua Ballard told CBS News of where he thinks U.S. production of rare earth magnets should be.

Inside its warehouse in Stillwater, USA Rare Earth is rushing to assemble massive machines that will eventually produce up to 5,000 tons of magnets per year. According to Ballard, that will equal about 10% of U.S. demand.

""Right now, we have to ask permission from China in order to get the magnets and minerals we need for our defense technologies,"" Ballard said. ""...This is an incredible choke point for this country.""

In April, the Trump administration announced an economic investment deal with Ukraine designed to give the U.S. access to Ukraine's rare earths, a move that comes amid the White House's trade disputes with China.

Ballard showed CBS News a small-scale laboratory that is showcasing what could be possible. Inside, engineers are refining the volatile rare earth metals, cooking and compressing them into tiny but powerful magnets.

""When you think about all these new technologies, whether it's in your phone, there's probably 12 magnets if you have an iPhone,"" Ballard said. ""A car, there's up to 40 magnets in a car. And the strength of them allows you to create smaller technologies with the power of the magnet.""

And while companies like USA Rare Earth will eventually help lessen U.S. dependence on China, Ballard said that's still a long way off.

Meta and energy producer Constellation Energy announced a 20-year nuclear power purchase agreement on Tuesday that will give the social media and tech conglomerate access to zero emissions power for its artificial intelligence goals and help keep an Illinois facility online.

The agreement will give Meta 1,121 MW of nuclear energy beginning in June 2027 from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. The PPA will also support the relicensing and continued operations of the Illinois power plant when a state zero emissions energy tax credit expires in 2027.

Meta is among a growing number of tech giants who have turned to nuclear to help offset growing data center energy needs driven by artificial intelligence. The company previously released requests for proposals seeking up to 4 GW of new nuclear energy generation capacity to support its “AI innovation and sustainability objectives.”

Dive Insight:

Meta’s deal will also allow Constellation to expand the facility to generate an additional 30 MW of power during the 20-year extension of operations, which will also preserve more than 1,000 jobs and deliver an estimated $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the June 3 release.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center had previously been saved by a state zero emissions tax credit program, after it was slated for closure in 2017. Meta’s power purchase agreement is designed to replace that credit and support the continued operations of the plant “without ratepayer support,” according to Constellation.

Meta Head of Global Energy Urvi Parekh said in the release that in addition to ensuring the long-term operation of the plant and preserving jobs, the deal demonstrates that “this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” The deal will also aid the global tech and social media conglomerate in its goal to reach zero emissions across its supply chain by 2030.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Parekh said.

Constellation said it is also exploring strategies that would extend an existing early site permit at the plant or approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop either an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor at the Illinois site.

This deal marks the second high-profile nuclear power purchase agreement Constellation has signed with a tech giant, following Microsoft’s 20-year agreement with the energy producer last fall. This deal will restart operations for a nuclear generator at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island facility in 2028.

Constellation CEO and President Joseph Dominguez said that after its plans to restart the Three Mile Island facility became national news, Meta questioned why “such a valuable plant” would be allowed to close in the first place, then “figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy.”

Meta — along with fellow tech giants Google and Amazon — was among a group of “large energy users” who signed a pledge to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 at S&P Global’s CERAWeek conference in March.

The tax credit transferability provision included in the Inflation Reduction Act has introduced new deal structures and is allowing clean energy developers to secure project financing faster, said speakers at a Thursday panel at the American Council on Renewable Energy’s Finance Forum.

“The closing of transactions has become so much easier,” said Gaurav Raniwala, global renewable energy leader at GE Vernova. “You don't have to line up two different structures simultaneously and then close everything when there's already enough mess going on. And the type of players that are now able to enter the market has broadened significantly.”

A Wednesday report from Crux, a finance technology company that connects tax credit buyers and sellers, said lenders are “increasingly” looking to finance less established technologies like carbon capture, and that “this openness is supported by the robust and progressively more liquid market for transferable tax credits.”

Dive Insight:

Raniwala said that financing had previously relied on the tax equity market, which “was limited in capacity. The industry wanted to be bigger.”

“If you really want to have a dominant energy industry which has abundance of supply to help with electrification, to help with all the AI stuff, we need all sources of energy out there,” he said. “And I think what transferability did was it broadened the market from just traditional tax equity to a whole host of players.”

Crux’s analysis said that “tax equity structures have evolved to hybrid structures, or t-flips, which explicitly contemplate the sale of a portion of tax credits in the transfer market” and found that t-flips “made up about 60% of the tax equity committed in 2024, and that share is expected to rise.”

“Historically, the tax equity market was about a $20 billion a year market dominated for many years by a handful of institutions,” said panelist Meghan Schultz, executive vice president and CFO at Invenergy. “And with the transferability market, the size more than doubled … it allows the tax investor, the tax credit buyer, to be able to monetize those tax benefits without actually needing to be an owner in the project.”

Raniwala noted that transactions can also now be customized based on credit profile. “As an example, you could do the traditional tax equity, but now you know you can transfer the credits, so you could also borrow against those credits from banks.”

Despite this sea change for project financing, transferability itself is endangered, as the budget bill that passed the House last month would eliminate or severely restrict transferability for the credits included in the IRA — and eliminate or shave down the credits themselves.

“The medium-term policy environment contains significant uncertainty, which investors in clean energy and manufacturing projects must navigate,” Crux said.

Crux’s report noted that the Senate will have to pass its own version of the budget, and “senators have telegraphed their desire to make substantive changes to the House’s version. That said, the near-term uncertainty may lead some developers to face higher costs of capital, more limited capital availability, or higher equity requirements as they seek to finance their projects.”

Despite looming threats to the IRA, Crux’s report took a bullish stance overall on the U.S. clean energy economy, noting that it “directed nearly $340 billion in new investment in the United States last year.”

One factor driving new projects is the added transaction speed offered by transferability.

The tax credit trade has “allowed people to close financing much more quickly, to not need to have that tax equity or tax credit buyer lined up at close, knowing that there is this liquid market for the tax credits,” Schultz said. “It’s facilitated speed to market for projects, because you can be efficient in your financing.” The lowered cost of debt and added flexibility of being able to lend against the expected transfer of your credits has also streamlined the process, she said.

David Haug, CEO of Bildmore Clean Energy, said the option to transfer the credits allows developers to choose “whether you want to have a long term offtake contract, or a long term revenue contract or a hedge to lock in your revenues or not.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/lEsJQUbBSWmsnW8h62oIQMypKsdQTCbq-HKsG6_tEh8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjAyMTEwODA4XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:06.751846

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that Peabody Energy provided 1.47 million tons of coal to the J.H.
Campbell plant.
Campbell order in a post on the website of its Count on Coal campaign and in a video.
In 2016, Peabody Energy had to disclose it paid $50,000 to IER over the previous two years.","A Department of Energy memorandum identified significant logistical challenges facing the Trump administration’s last-minute order to prevent the closure of the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in Michigan.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the order on May 23, just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down on May 31st. Wright’s order invokes wartime powers typically reserved for temporary electric grid emergencies related to extreme weather, but Michigan’s top state utility regulator says no energy emergency exists to warrant the order.

The DOE memo was also dated May 23 and marked as privileged and Controlled Unclassified Information, or CUI. The memo identifies “SENSITIVITIES” and makes clear the “challenges” the plant’s owner Consumers Energy may face if forced by Wright to reverse course on the closure after years of preparations and planning:

Past the planned retirement date of May 31, Consumers has ended its contracts for coal procurement, coal delivery, and power plant staffing and may face challenges with addressing these issues on short notice. The order provides reasonable last-minute contract extensions for fuel and operations, if feasible.

The memo was addressed to Wright and from Alex Fitzsimmons, a Trump DOE political appointee who previously held jobs at organizations funded by one of the power plant’s coal suppliers. Fitzsimmons recommended in the memo that Wright approve the order.

Fitzsimmons’ memo was initially posted publicly on DOE’s website, but the link where the memo was previously found now leads to a “Page not found” message. The existence of the memo was mentioned last week by the local news site Hollander.News.

Tyler Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, said Wright’s order “serves no purpose beyond attempting to prop up the dying coal industry.”

“We currently produce more energy in Michigan than needed,” Michigan Public Service Commission Chair Dan Scripps said. “The unnecessary recent order from the U.S. Department of Energy will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses across the Midwest.”

The cost of procuring additional coal and keeping the plant open will fall on customers of Consumers Energy and other utilities located within the 15-state Midwest Independent System Operator regional power grid, which the J.H. Campbell plant is connected to. Consumers Energy previously estimated the plant’s closure would save its customers in Michigan $600 million. Wright’s order expires on August 21, meaning the plant could still close soon unless the order is extended.

The latest fuel receipt data available from the Energy Information Administration identifies the North Antelope Rochelle and Black Thunder coal mines in Wyoming as suppliers of coal for the power plant. The Black Thunder Mine is owned by Core Natural Resources, the fossil fuel company formed by the merger of Arch Coal and CONSOL Energy.

The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis reports that Peabody Energy provided 1.47 million tons of coal to the J.H. Campbell plant last year. Peabody Energy told the Cowboy State News in Wyoming last week that it supplies coal to other plants in Michigan, but not to the J.H. Campbell plant.

After Wright signed the J.H. Campbell order last month, Peabody Energy called for further action to “halt coal plant retirements, use existing plants at higher utilization and restart shuttered coal plants.”

James Grech, the CEO of Peabody Energy, attended the White House ceremony in April where Trump signed an executive order commanding Wright to use DOE’s emergency powers under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to prevent the closure of coal plants. Peabody Energy and Core Natural Resources’ stock value jumped after Trump signed the executive order, along with several others benefiting the coal industry.

The National Mining Association (NMA) praised Wright’s J.H. Campbell order in a post on the website of its Count on Coal campaign and in a video. NMA reported lobbying the White House and DOE on the use of Federal Power Act authorities earlier this year. Paul Lang, the CEO of Core Natural Resources, is currently the chairman of NMA’s board of directors.

Wright signed another Section 202(c) order late last week to prevent the closure of the Eddystone gas plant in Pennsylvania, in another move opposed by environmental groups like the Sierra Club, which warned it would hurt everyday utility customers.

Trump political appointee Alex Fitzsimmons, who previously worked for organizations funded by Peabody Energy, recommended Chris Wright issue the order

Fitzsimmons was tapped last month to lead DOE’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) after serving as Wright’s chief of staff since January.

Fitzsimmons previously served as a political appointee in DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy during Trump’s first term as president. In between Trump’s terms in the White House, Fitzsimmons worked for an energy storage company and for ClearPath, a conservative group that’s supportive of clean energy but holds a favorable view of fossil fuels.

Fitzsimmons worked on energy policy for the Institute for Energy Research (IER) and its lobbying arm the American Energy Alliance (AEA) from January 2013 to April 2014 and again from November 2014 to January 2017.

At IER/AEA, Fitzsimmons was part of a long-running campaign by right-wing groups aligned with the fossil fuel industry to roll back state renewable energy standards that have helped power the growth of wind and solar power.

“Launched an in-house ghostwriting shop that crafts, pitches, and places op-eds on behalf of partner organizations,” Fitzsimmons said of his work for IER/AEA on a resume obtained from DOE by American Oversight.

In 2016, Peabody Energy had to disclose it paid $50,000 to IER over the previous two years. The disclosure came in Peabody Energy’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, where the coal producer also had to reveal its funding of multiple climate change denial and anti-clean energy groups.

Peabody Energy also listed AEA as a creditor in its bankruptcy case.

Fitzsimmons spent eight months in 2014 at the corporate public relations firm Berman & Company, where he worked with a front group called the Environmental Policy Alliance that attacked environmental conservation groups like Trout Unlimited. Peabody Energy later listed Berman & Company as a creditor in its bankruptcy.

Fitzsimmons also worked for a year and a half in 2016-2017 as the Director of Communications for the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce’s pro-fossil fuels Fueling U.S. Forward campaign. Fitzsimmons described the experience on his resume:

As the first hire for a multi-million dollar energy-advocacy campaign funded by Koch Industries and led by former AFPM President Charles Drevna, I managed the public launch of the organization in 2016 and am responsible for developing and executing the communications and digital-media strategy.

Koch Industries is the petrochemical company helmed by billionaire conservative megadonor Charles Koch. AFPM is the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers. Wright was an outspoken member of Koch’s network of political donors before he was tapped to become Trump’s Energy Secretary in November.

AEA endorsed Trump for president during the 2016 election. After Trump won, he also picked several of Fitzsimmons’ former IER colleagues to serve on his presidential transition team and as DOE political appointees during his first term. Among them was Travis Fisher, who co-authored a DOE grid study that Trump’s first Secretary of Energy Rick Perry used as a pretense for a failed 2017 proposal to bail out struggling coal and nuclear plants. Perry’s proposal would have cost consumers billions of dollars if it hadn’t been rejected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Perry spoke openly in 2017 about the administration’s “very classified” conversations about using national security as a pretext for preempting state climate change and clean energy policies. In January, Trump declared a national energy emergency and cited what he called “dangerous State and local policies [that] jeopardize our Nation’s core national defense and security needs” in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term.

In April, seven Republican state lawmakers from Michigan signed a letter to the Trump administration attributing the J.H. Campbell plant’s closure to the 100 percent clean electricity by 2040 law enacted by Michigan in 2023. Consumers Energy first announced plans to phase out its use of coal in 2018, and the Michigan Public Service Commission later approved a multi-party agreement to close the J.H. Campbell plant by 2025 and invest in cleaner sources of electricity like solar and energy storage.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” Wright said in a DOE press release last month announcing the order to keep the J.H. Campbell plant running until August.

IER published a post this week highlighting Wright’s order as “contrary” to Michigan’s clean electricity law and “Consumers Energy’s plans to remove coal entirely from its fleet by closing the Campbell plant.”

Trump’s executive order revamps a failed first-term attempt to use Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to bail out coal-fired power plants for the benefit of top donors

In 2018, a leaked memorandum revealed the Trump administration was considering using Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and the Defense Production Act to bail out coal plants struggling to compete with cheaper and cleaner forms of electricity. Trump abandoned that first-term effort amid concerns from advisors like Larry Kudlow that the public would view the move as a bailout.

The electric utility FirstEnergy later admitted to federal prosecutors that it secretly paid $5 million in 2017 to America First Policies, a group formed by Trump insiders to support Trump’s agenda, as it lobbied the Trump administration for a Section 202(c) bailout for its coal and nuclear power plants.

FirstEnergy was joined in the push by coal producers Murray Energy, which contributed $1 million to the pro-Trump Super PAC America First Action in 2017, and Alliance Resource Partners.

Joe Craft, the CEO of Alliance Alliance Resource Partners, attended Trump’s pro-coal executive order signing ceremony in April. Craft contributed $1 million to Elon Musk’s pro-Trump America PAC last year.

In a Thursday statement, AESC cited policy and market uncertainty for the pause. State and local leaders were informed of the decision Thursday.

The Japanese manufacturer's announcement comes as the Trump administration pushes and implements higher tariffs and the budget reconciliation bill in Congress — known as the Big Beautiful Bill — seeks to end electric vehicle tax credits.

“AESC has invested over $1 billion into the Florence facility, and we anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize,"" AESC spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement sent to media. ""AESC fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years.”

The battery cells made at the plant will be used for BMW's high-voltage battery plant in Woodruff. BMW Manufacturing said the company has already invested $700 million into the plant, which is expected to start assembling cars next year.

That money invested by AESC is in addition to the millions of dollars invested by the state and Florence County.

""This is a gut punch. Simple as I know to put it,"" state Rep. Roger Kirby, a Florence Democrat, told SC Public Radio by phone Thursday. ""It's just unimageable really.""

Despite the company's promises, Kirby said he's concerned the pause could last longer than a few months. That extension, he said, would likely have an impact on other EV-related companies in South Carolina.

Late last month, production at Volvo's Ridgeville plant temporarily paused. The company said it was due to a supply chain issue.

The impact of a longer delay would also affect the Pee Dee region, Kirby said.

""It's incredibly impactful,"" from jobs, housing, planned development and potential suppliers to AESC, Kirby said.

Gov. Henry McMaster told reporters Thursday that his office is in contact with the state’s federal delegation and White House.

SC Public Radio has reached out to the offices of U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott for comment.

The state Commerce Department said ""we are fully and unequivocally committed to supporting existing companies including AESC.""

For now, McMaster urged patience.

""There is a lot of uncertainty in the reconciliation bill, whether (those) tax credits will still be in there or incentives. Of course, with the tariffs, the tariffs are going up and down. Some of those are being paused,"" McMaster said.

To that end, it takes pains to make a key distinction between “carbon capture” — which includes technologies that filter CO2 from industrial sources — and “carbon removal” like Heirloom’s, which draws existing carbon out of the atmosphere.
“For those earlier-stage startups who are not backed by a large corporation or multinational, I think you could see this as absolutely devastating,” said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a trade group.
To that end, the company is trying to win over wary opponents who argue that any climate dollars should go toward nearer-term reductions.
California lawmakers this week advanced a bill to require the state to purchase $50 million in carbon removal credits between 2026 and 2035.","Another win in progress: While last week’s House-passed megabill would gut the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for renewables and nuclear power by tightening their construction deadlines to near-impossibilities, it leaves the IRA’s credits for carbon capture largely intact, other than cutting the credits’ transferability to third parties.

Carbon capture has plenty of enemies on the left, where it’s often viewed as a nascent, expensive distraction from reducing emissions in the near term. But it’s the right that wields influence over the huge pots of money that are the Biden administration’s biggest climate legacy — and as Republicans prepare to decimate incentives for renewable resources like solar, wind and geothermal energy, carbon capture has managed to weather the storm better than many other climate technologies.

Heirloom is as savvy an operator as any, having announced its Louisiana facility in 2023 in conjunction with Climeworks and Battelle on the back of an initial $50 million award from the bipartisan infrastructure law. The company is pursuing a two-pronged policy strategy: It’s trying to win over the right with the promise of jobs and heavy industry in their districts, and the left with the additional promise of a way to tackle climate change — with caveats about it not being a substitute for other emissions reductions. To that end, it takes pains to make a key distinction between “carbon capture” — which includes technologies that filter CO2 from industrial sources — and “carbon removal” like Heirloom’s, which draws existing carbon out of the atmosphere.

“By building in California, you get the door knocks from the Microsofts of the world,” Vikrum Aiyer, the company’s head of global public policy, told me on a tour last month of its first plant, on the agricultural eastern outskirts of the Bay Area, over the hum of a kiln that heats up the limestone to extract the captured CO2. “By building in Louisiana, we get more companies interested in ‘How do I use this CO2 for other things?’”

Choosing Louisiana was a prescient bet. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration pleaded the project’s case after it ended up on the Energy Department’s preliminary hit list.

“I urge you to contact DOE Secretary Chris Wright and ask him to take every necessary step to advance this critically needed federal grant,” Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bonnett Bourgeois wrote to the state’s congressional delegation.

Local port commissioners and business groups chimed in, too; an April letter touted the project’s ability to “generate demand for American-made steel, concrete, and advanced equipment, revitalizing our industrial heartland.”

It probably also helped that Heirloom was a relative old-timer, getting its funding award in August 2023; two-thirds of the projects on the kill list received final approval after the November election. But either way, avoiding being on the list was a significant victory, given how much work remains to get the technologies to economic viability.

“For those earlier-stage startups who are not backed by a large corporation or multinational, I think you could see this as absolutely devastating,” said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, a trade group.

The Senate is currently working through the megabill, but the House version’s 2033 deadline to start construction works for Heirloom, which is banking on the preservation of the existing $180-per-ton tax credit to remove CO2 as well as permanently store it (in concrete, at its plant in California, and in an underground well, in Louisiana). Another $130-per-ton credit, for using the carbon, would help it capitalize on its recently announced deal with United Airlines to incorporate it into jet fuel.

That would all go a decent way to helping the company get beyond the initial corporate buyers — Microsoft, Meta, McKinsey and JP Morgan among them — willing to shell out the roughly $600 per ton that direct-air capture currently costs. (It needs to get down to about $100 per ton to make it attractive to companies that have to reduce their emissions under government climate programs in California and the European Union, for example.)

Heirloom’s strategy on the left, meanwhile, involves trying to cobble together more funding for research and development to get the cost down further while allaying environmental groups’ concerns that the technology will enable industrial emitters to keep polluting.

Heirloom is hoping to leverage California’s carbon-trading program, which generates billions in proceeds from the sale of emissions permits to industry. It’s backing an “advanced climate technology” fund for industrial decarbonization technologies, pegged to the state’s 2022 climate roadmap that envisions carbon removal contributing to 15 percent of the state’s goal to get to net-zero emissions by 2045.

To that end, the company is trying to win over wary opponents who argue that any climate dollars should go toward nearer-term reductions. “Could that someday be a realistic part of the solution?” former Vice President Al Gore, one of the most powerful climate voices on the left, said of carbon capture in a speech in April in San Francisco. “Perhaps. But not now. Not even close.”

Carbon capture is “probably the most expensive and the least reliable thing that we could possibly be doing right now,” Katie Valenzuela, a consultant for environmental justice groups, said on a panel at a Sacramento climate conference in April.

“I recognize I’m not coming into this room as a very popular dude,” Aiyer responded. “We have to earn your trust. I get that.”

But they’re having some success there, too. California lawmakers this week advanced a bill to require the state to purchase $50 million in carbon removal credits between 2026 and 2035.

Another bill would lift California’s moratorium on carbon dioxide pipelines, which Heirloom would need if it scales up enough to move large volumes to storage wells or other sites. “There’s a huge opportunity here,” said Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, its author, who joined last month’s tour of the Tracy facility.

For now, much of Heirloom’s fate is in the hands of the Senate, where their industry-friendly pitch to the right might allow them to slip through the Trump administration’s net once again. And as other emissions-cutting efforts fall to Republicans’ machete, time is on their side.

“By 2050, we need to start taking down six to 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year for the rest of the century,” Aiyer said, “if we stand any chance of realizing either the temperature goals or the Paris Accords.”

Carbon capture might not be a favorite among progressives yet, but with the Trump administration’s gutting of other climate projects, companies like Heirloom may be some of the only ones left.",https://static.politico.com/31/a0/f4caa292449e8a3b390f66ccd839/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1753047155,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:38.179949

Ireland’s Emissions Targets

Ireland’s national target is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 51% by 2030. However, even with full implementation of current climate policies and measures, emissions are projected to fall by only up to 23%, a drop from last year’s projection of 29%. Almost all sectors are on a trajectory to miss their emissions targets.

Here’s a look at some sector-by-sector snapshots of projected emissions by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels):

🐄 Agriculture: Emissions projection - Range of 1% increase to 16% decrease by 2030. Measures to reduce emissions include limits on nitrogen fertiliser usage, switching to different fertilisers and bovine feed additives.

🚚 Transport: Emissions projection - Reduction of up to 21% by 2030. Measures to reduce emissions include 640k EVs on the road by 2030, increased biofuel blend rates and measures to support more sustainable transport.

🏠 Residential: Emissions projection - Reduction of up to 22% by 2030. Measures to reduce emissions include 571k domestic heat pumps projected to be installed by 2030.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working.
By contrast, if Congress protects clean energy tax credits, it would be a huge boost to Missouri’s economy over the next decade.
Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will boost $2.45 billion in additional income and support 31,500 full-time jobs for Missourians annually.
Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits.","On May 22, the U.S. House voted to pass a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits. I’m disappointed to see that the House advanced this legislation.

Make no mistake: These cuts will hurt Missouri if they go on to become law. Experts are already warning that these changes would raise energy costs for American households, increase pollution, and threaten growing economic investments we’ve seen in Missouri. The House passage of this bill just put these investments at risk.

Federal tax credits — designed to boost clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. — have been working. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, Missouri has benefited from $2.5 billion of investment from 10 projects, that have led to the creation of 2,400 jobs.

The tax credits were passed by Democrats, so they have been an easy target for Republican attacks. But the legislation has overwhelmingly benefited Republican-held districts — 78% of the funding has gone to rural and suburban areas held by the GOP. That includes Missouri, where companies like Ameren and ICL have announced major investments thanks to these tax credits.

But that success story could unravel quickly. The legislation is now in the Senate’s hands, and the House passage has set them on a path toward drastic cuts.

If the cuts become law, energy prices will rise. Rolling back these tax credits means Missouri ratepayers will face electricity prices that are 12% higher in the coming years, putting us (and many of our neighbors) in the top 15 states with highest price impacts from 2026 onwards.

Manufacturing will slow. Phasing out tax credits that support clean energy manufacturing could jeopardize long-term projects like US Strategic Metal’s battery recycling and manufacturing facilities in Fredericktown. Eliminating clean vehicle tax credits could put up to 100% of planned EV plant construction and a significant portion of existing capacity at risk, according to industry analysis.

Households and local businesses will take a huge hit. A rollback of tax credits for home energy upgrades like rooftop solar is a blow to Missourians who’ve been using these tools to cut energy bills. Incentives have made it easier for homeowners to install solar panels, save money, and even help stabilize America’s power grid.

But those benefits — and the local businesses that depend on them — are in jeopardy if Congress moves forward with these cuts.

By contrast, if Congress protects clean energy tax credits, it would be a huge boost to Missouri’s economy over the next decade. Analysis by American Clean Power and ICF estimates that continuing clean energy incentives will boost $2.45 billion in additional income and support 31,500 full-time jobs for Missourians annually. That’s not hypothetical — that’s real money and real livelihoods for Missourians.

Encouragingly, a growing number of Republican members of Congress are vocalizing their support for the clean energy tax credits. Four Republican senators recently sent a letter to leadership last month saying repeal would “lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits are working for Missouri. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful. I urge Missouri Sens. Hawley and Schmitt to work with their colleagues in the Senate to protect these tax credits.

Alongside Airex Energy and SUEZ, we are building a new economy—future-focused and environmentally committed.
“We are delighted to contribute to this pioneering biochar production project in Canada.
“I’m thrilled to see the Carbonity project come to life.","Airex Energy, an innovative leader in the development of world-class decarbonization solutions, Groupe Rémabec, a cornerstone of Quebec's forest industry committed to responsible transformation and decarbonization, and SUEZ, a global leader in circular solutions for water and waste, are inaugurating Carbonity on May 22—the first industrial-scale biochar plant in Canada, located in Port-Cartier.

Born from a partnership between the three companies, the plant begins with an annual production capacity of 10,000 metric tons of biochar, which is expected to triple by 2026, making it the largest facility of its kind in North America—and one of the most important globally. Biochar is recognized by the IPCC as one of the most effective technologies to combat climate change due to its long-term carbon sequestration capacity. In addition, its many benefits enhance agricultural resilience, drive sustainable innovation in construction and urban development, and support the decarbonization of heavy industries.

Biochar: A Decarbonization Tool for Multiple Industries

Biochar is produced through pyrolysis—a process of carbonizing residual biomass at high temperatures without oxygen.

When used as a soil amendment, biochar enhances nutrient and water retention, aeration, drainage, and microbial activity. It regenerates soil, increases fertilizer efficiency, improves crop yields, and aids water drainage—key advantages for the agriculture sector. It can also be added to livestock feed to promote animal health and reduce methane emissions.

When integrated into concrete, cement, or asphalt, biochar enhances material performance while significantly lowering their carbon footprint—addressing a major challenge in sustainable construction and urban development. Its production also yields surplus energy in the form of steam or pyrolytic oil, which can be used as fuel.

Cities are increasingly using biochar to process organic waste and combat flooding. Its absorbent qualities make it ideal for creating ""sponge parks."" It also supports the remediation of contaminated soils.

An Innovative Facility Driven by Three Pioneers of the Transition

Carbonity, located in Northern Québec, is an equally held joint venture between the three partner organizations. It will create 75 direct and indirect jobs in the region and produce carbon-rich biochar from approximately 58,000 tonnes of forestry residues annually, sourced from Groupe Rémabec’s operations. Carbonity is powered by Airex Energy’s proprietary technology. Its proprietary and patented DryFX™ and CarbonFX™ technologies are at the heart of the plant’s innovative process. SUEZ brings key expertise in organic waste recovery, the production of amendments and biofertilizers, and the development of circular solutions to help clients reduce their carbon footprint.

This project marks the first step in Airex Energy and SUEZ’s ambitious roadmap to build a global annual production capacity of 350,000 tonnes of biochar by 2035 to meet the decarbonization challenges of industrial operations.

“The inauguration of Carbonity is a true industrial milestone for Québec. Airex Energy’s technology, including our patented CarbonFX and DryFX solutions, is central to this success, and it makes us very proud. Our primary mission is to contribute to the decarbonization of our economy. This investment represents Airex Energy’s first step toward scaling global biochar production, a product that will help many businesses here and abroad achieve net zero.” — Michel Gagnon, CEO of Airex Energy and Chair of Carbonity's Board.

“Today, we continue an extraordinary journey that is shaping the future of forestry and asserting Quebec’s leadership in bioproduct development. Alongside Airex Energy and SUEZ, we are building a new economy—future-focused and environmentally committed. At Port-Cartier, we’re betting on innovation and boldness to convert our forest residues into sustainable economic value. This project breathes new life into a long-neglected industrial site, giving it a promising future. Thanks to strong partnerships, cutting-edge technology, and a clear vision, we are positioning ourselves as a global player while diversifying our products and markets for a better future.” — Réjean Paré, President and Chief Operating Officer, Groupe Rémabec.

“We are delighted to contribute to this pioneering biochar production project in Canada. Identified by the IPCC as a negative-emissions solution, biochar is effective in fighting climate change and aligns with SUEZ’s waste recovery activities. We believe biochar will play a key role in the ecological transition of industry. That’s why we aim, alongside Airex Energy, to produce 350,000 tonnes of biochar annually by 2035, providing our customers committed to carbon neutrality with innovative solutions to reduce their residual emissions.” — Yves Rannou, Interim Co-CEO, SUEZ, and Head of Recycling.

“The inauguration of Carbonity marks a pivotal step toward a new, more sustainable forestry model rooted in today’s economic and environmental realities, and serving the ecological and industrial transition of tomorrow. Taking part in this Canadian first is a tremendous source of pride.” — Patrick Girard, General Manager, Carbonity.

This project was made possible thanks to the vision and financial support of the governments of Quebec and Canada.

“The federal government is proud to have contributed to this flagship project supporting the establishment of a new subsidiary in Canada. Biochar is a key solution for carbon sequestration, with additional benefits for agriculture, the development of resilient cities, and the support of a diversified forestry industry.” — Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister of Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions.

“I’m thrilled to see the Carbonity project come to life. The new automated plant will generate significant economic and social benefits in Côte-Nord, including the creation of highly specialized jobs. It also strengthens the region’s forestry sector, which plays a key role in our economy.” — Kateri Champagne Jourdain, Minister of Employment, Minister Responsible for the Côte-Nord region, and Member for Duplessis.

“Carbonity is helping accelerate decarbonization in key sectors across Quebec. Our government is proud to have invested more than $16 million in this project, which leverages innovative technology and contributes to building a prosperous, sustainable economy.” — Christine Fréchette, Minister of Economy, Innovation and Energy, and Minister responsible for Regional Economic Development.

“With Carbonity, Port-Cartier becomes a leader in sustainable innovation. By transforming our forest residues into biochar, we are smartly harnessing local resources while creating lasting jobs. This is a flagship project that proves environmental protection and economic development can go hand in hand. It’s a great source of pride to see our community become a model of responsible development.” — Alain Thibault, Mayor of Port-Cartier.

At full capacity, the plant will sequester 75,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per year. This output will generate certified and guaranteed carbon credits, marketed on the voluntary market by First Climate. In 2024, Microsoft selected Carbonity to purchase 36,000 carbon credits over the first three years of operations.

“The official launch of Carbonity is an important step in international climate protection through technical carbon removal solutions, demonstrating that biochar technology can scale. We are thrilled by the strong interest our clients have shown in Carbonity, supporting the continued development of carbon removal technology.” — Olaf Bachert, CEO, First Climate.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Airex_Energy_June25_476c16f428.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 15:12:01.173164

Lucid Group has signed a second agreement with Graphite One for U.S.-sourced materials needed for lithium-ion batteries as the electric car maker seeks to strengthen its domestic supply chain, according to a June 4 press release.

The latest agreement will provide Lucid and its battery cell suppliers with natural graphite from the Graphite Creek deposit north of Nome, Alaska, where Graphite One expects to begin production in 2028, per the release.

The deal complements a 2024 pact in which Graphite One agreed to provide Lucid and its battery cell suppliers with graphite processed for use in battery anodes, starting in 2028, the release said. The active anode material (AAM) would come from Graphite One's planned plant in Warren, Ohio.

Dive Insight:

Lucid has increased U.S.-based battery-electric-vehicle production as part of its strategy for weathering tariff uncertainty. Executives have highlighted the company's efforts to localize critical supplies, including the transition to Panasonic's Kansas battery facility and the sourcing of domestic graphite through partnerships with Graphite One and Syrah Resources.

Beginning next year, Syrah will supply AAM from its production facility in Vidalia, Louisiana, under a three-year deal with Lucid, per the release.

""A supply chain of critical materials within the United States drives our nation's economy, increases our independence against outside factors or market dynamics, and supports our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our vehicles,"" Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said in the release.

Establishing supplier networks to build EV batteries has been a trend encompassing both traditional automakers and EV-only makers, such as Lucid. For example, Nissan Motor Corp. and SK On signed a battery deal in March.

The previous deal between Lucid and Graphite One is a non-binding supply agreement, pending Graphite One's commencement of AAM graphite production at the Ohio facility, according to the Canadian company's annual Management's Discussion and Analysis document, filed in April.

If successful, the Lucid and Graphite One partnership would establish a U.S. source of graphite materials for EV batteries for the carmaker. However, Hunan Chenyu Fuji New Energy Technology, an AAM manufacturer based in Changsha, China, would play a critical role in supporting the partnership.

Graphite One signed a technology licensing agreement and a consulting agreement with Chenyu last October, according to the MD&A document. Chenyu agreed to assist in the design, construction and operation of the Ohio facility.

But Consumers Energy, the utility that owns the coal plant, told CNN in an email it already purchased another natural gas-fired power plant to carry the load when the coal plant went offline.
Wright issued another emergency order last week to keep a Pennsylvania power plant that runs on natural gas and oil open past its May 31 retirement date.
In 2021, the average coal-fired power plant was 45 years old, according to a report from the Energy Information Administration.

Chris Wright, a decision that could cost Midwest energy customers tens of millions of dollars.

The last-minute federal order to keep the J.H. Campbell plant operating came as a surprise to Michigan officials, including the head of the state’s Public Service Commission, given it was at the tail end of a multi-year retirement process that was approved in 2022.

“The grid operator hadn’t asked for this, the utility hadn’t asked for this, we as the state hadn’t asked for this,” said Dan Scripps, chair of the Michigan Public Service Commission. “We certainly didn’t have any conversations with the (Energy Department) in advance of the order, or since.”

Wright’s May 23 emergency order cited concerns the Midwest could face a summer electricity shortage due to a lack of available coal, gas and nuclear plants that can provide stable baseload power. But Consumers Energy, the utility that owns the coal plant, told CNN in an email it already purchased another natural gas-fired power plant to carry the load when the coal plant went offline.

Scripps said the cost to keep the over-60-year-old plant operating, even for 90 days, will be high, and customers in 15 states will foot the bill.

“I can say with a pretty high degree of confidence that we’re looking at multiple tens of millions of dollars at the low end,” Scripps said. “I think there’s a range between there and the high end of getting close to $100 million.”

It’s unclear so far what that will mean for individual electricity bills, Scripps added, given the uncertainty about final cost.

“For years, American grid operators have warned decommissioning baseload power sources such as coal plants would jeopardize the reliability of our grid systems, which has raised alarm bells,” Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement.

Dietderich didn’t say whether the Energy Department had conducted a cost analysis before issuing the emergency order. It’s unclear whether the department realized the company already had a plan to maintain baseload power after its closure.

Wright issued another emergency order last week to keep a Pennsylvania power plant that runs on natural gas and oil open past its May 31 retirement date.

Coal is the dirtiest fuel large plants still burn for electricity, and it’s now the most expensive as renewable energy sources like solar have become increasingly cost-effective. Although natural gas is a fossil fuel and contributes significantly to warming the planet, it is still considered a cheaper and less-polluting option. Gas generates 43% of the country’s electricity.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said she is considering legal action against the federal government. Nessel and energy experts said such an emergency order from the federal government is extremely rare and usually reserved for the aftermath of severe storms or natural disasters.

“This is a novel case for us,” Nessel said. “We’ve not had to do this before.”

She reiterated keeping the plant open would “significantly” raise electricity rates, saying, “The whole point of closing this plant down was to save money.”

More electric utilities are retiring their coal plants because they are old and especially expensive to run. In 2021, the average coal-fired power plant was 45 years old, according to a report from the Energy Information Administration.

The Energy Department’s order didn’t specify exactly how much the Michigan coal plant should run, saying it was requiring the utility to “take all measures necessary to ensure that the Campbell Plant is available to operate.”

Scripps and energy experts said that means the coal plant would likely run continuously at a lower level throughout the summer, or until Wright’s order ends. Unlike gas plants, coal plants can’t be easily turned on and off with the flip of a switch and take time to ramp up and come online. The Campbell plant is so old — it has been operating since 1962 — that Michigan energy regulators feared it could not physically turn back on once it was powered off.

The utility will also have to buy more coal to keep it going. Consumers Energy said it has “arranged for new shipments of coal to keep the plant operating.”

A new report from think tank Energy Innovation found the cost of coal-fired power has grown faster than inflation in the last few years — collectively costing US consumers $6.2 billion more in 2024 than it would have cost in 2021.

“Even existing coal where it has fully depreciated and been paid off, the cost of coal is more than solar and storage at this point,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas based energy expert who authors the Texas Energy and Power Newsletter and host of the Energy Capital Podcast.

Lewin covers the energy transition in deep red Texas, where power companies are building wind, solar and battery storage at an incredible pace. Of the significant amount of new electricity added to the Texas grid in the last four years, 92% has been wind, solar and storage, Lewin said.

That has paid dividends, keeping energy prices relatively low and meeting the state’s exploding power demand from air conditioning, data centers and big industry.

“All throughout the summer months, you’re getting maximum solar output,” Lewin said. “It’s very well correlated to peak demand. For a place with massive AC load like Texas, it’s fantastic.”

Texas has also invested a lot in big batteries that can keep power flowing to the grid after the sun stops shining and the wind stops blowing.

Energy Sec. Wright, however, has panned renewables, saying they are not a reliable replacement for fossil fuels.

“There is simply no physical way that wind, solar and batteries could replace the myriad uses of natural gas,” he said at Houston energy conference CERAWeek in March. “I haven’t even mentioned oil or coal yet.”

The automotive component manufacturer has made notable gains in efficiency in several key systems, including weight and space savings, as automakers turn their attention to cutting EV curb weights.

ZF's optimization of battery temperature controls via the TherMaS system has demonstrated significant gains in range.

The pace of change in the EV world is often likened to that of computers in the 1990s, with vehicles that debuted around the turn of the decade already seeming dated if not outright stale. The same goes for the tech underneath, with the hardware produced today differing noticeably from what we saw a scant five years, and this goes well beyond battery tech.

ZF is best known as a developer and supplier for automakers, producing everything from transmissions to ADAS systems, letting automakers assemble cars with its components. And in the current EV landscape, it has been tasked with developing quite a bit of what goes into cars produced everywhere from Europe to China.

The company showcased its latest developments at eMobility Tech Day in Germany, bringing its modular electric powertrain hardware to the event. And the systems already show significant gains in power density, weight, and efficiency compared to just a few years ago.

And ZF's progress can be seen firsthand in the company's Select drivetrain for electric vehicles.

""The pace of innovation in many e-drive components is enormous. Our customers want to have the latest technology available quickly – and with limited integration effort,"" says Dr. Otmar Scharrer, Senior Vice President R&D, Electrified Powertrain Technology at ZF.

""This is exactly where we come in with our Select platform: the overall system and components are perfectly matched to each other – at the same time, the components are interchangeable depending on requirements.""

The platform was engineered to feature interchangeable components, depending on automakers' goals for a particular EV, and easy to offer in various states of tune depending on vehicle trim.

ZF's recently developed e-drive has efficiency in mind, using a coaxial primary drive coupled with a PSM (permanently excited synchronous machine) to produce just north of 400 hp and 4056 lb-ft of torque.

The company notes that the latest generation of the unit reduces losses by more than 25%, while also improving weight and efficiency parameters.

The em:Select is just one component that ZF has recently developed as part of the larger EV powertrain package. The company's components for this system also include an inverter, a reduction drive platform, and a converter. Gains in efficiency having been made in all four with this latest generation of an EV powertrain, with ZF finding new ways to save weight and space, while taking future uses into consideration.

""The co:SELECT modular system includes bidirectional charging as well as V2L and V2G functionality (vehicle-to-load, vehicle-to-grid). Both make the vehicle's battery energy available for the power grid as well as for external power consumers – even simultaneously,"" ZF notes.

ZF has made significant gains in optimizing EV drive systems, achieving weight and space savings, while allowing for interchangeable components based on automaker needs.

ZF is also mindful of recent trends in the auto industry, including a renewed focus on extended-range powertrains that now appear headed into large trucks and SUVs in the US, starting with the Ram 1500 REV and the new Scout model range revived by Volkswagen.

The company is currently developing a next-generation Range Extender (eRE) and the electric Range Extender plus (eRE+), the latter featuring an intelligent clutch and a differential. This will allows it to act not only as a generator, but as an additional drive unit.

Among other things, EREV powertrains promise smaller vehicle batteries, shorter development times, and lower overall platform costs.

But squeezing more range out of EVs also remains a priority. And gains can be made via a more advanced thermal management system for a battery pack.

""The battery of an electric car in particular is very sensitive when it comes to its ideal operating temperature. It feels most comfortable between 15 and 25°C (59 to 77°F),"" Scharrer notes.

Controlling the battery's temperature, therefore, has a big effect on range, and ZF's solution in this regard is called TherMaS, which is a system that uses propane as a refrigerant, thereby thermally keeping the battery in its optimal operating range.

At its core, TherMaS is propane-based heat pump refrigeration circuit, one that features a lighter and smaller housing compared to existing units.

The payoff in a demonstration vehicle tested by ZF ended up delivering 10% more electric range in the winter time, with the company seeing 30% in more extreme weather conditions.

Still, the next big breakthrough in EV drivetrains could still expected to materialize in the form of batteries with greater energy density, namely solid-state designs. A number of new compositions are inching their way through the pipelines of developers and automakers, including in-car road testing, though mass production remains a hurdle to be overcome in the future.

But EV motor evolution won't stand still in the meantime, before the solid-state era arrives, and more gains remain to be made in the drivetrain sphere.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/zf-crossovers-6841ab382a939.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0513xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-06-06 15:11:35.128321

Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real.","LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.

Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.

“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.

In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.

That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.

But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.

And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.

The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.

""We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,"" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.

Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.

It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.

But the registry “does put pressure on companies to ... document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.

""It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”

The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.

""The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.

The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.

CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.

“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”

Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.

Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.

Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.

“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

The goal is to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, increasing capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.
The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.
China has 55 nuclear reactors in operation, while France has 56 reactors at 18 different power plants.
Chinese officials have touted their strategy of standardized development of nuclear power plants, which enables the faster completion of projects.","On May 23, President Donald Trump signed four executive orders that directed the nation’s independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to reduce regulations and expedite the licensing process for new reactors and power plants, effectively overhauling the agency. The orders intend to fast-track new nuclear projects and technologies through federal permitting and deploy cost-cutting initiatives to scale back the NRC. The industry will be encouraged by federal subsidies as the draft budget legislation passed by the House of Representatives keeps tax credits for new and existing nuclear plants, but requires them to begin construction before January 1, 2029. The goal is to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, increasing capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

The orders provide an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications and create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026, in just 13 months. They also invoke the Defense Production Act to facilitate federal purchases of nuclear fuel to strengthen the domestic supply chain and weaken Russia’s substantial hold on it. Until 2023, the United States got much of its enriched uranium from Russia, which stopped after Russia invaded Ukraine, and a bipartisan law was passed. The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

According to the order reforming the NRC, “the current structure and staffing of the NRC are misaligned with the Congress’s directive that the NRC shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power.” It directs the NRC to consult with the Department of Government Efficiency to “reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.”

To speed up the development of nuclear power, the orders grant the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, rather than the NRC. Even so, Trump’s goal will be difficult to achieve with the current state of the U.S. nuclear industry. The U.S. nuclear renaissance was decades ago, and only two new large reactors, which are at a nuclear plant in Georgia, have been built in nearly 50 years. They were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget, but many attribute that to overregulation and red tape by the NRC. The United States currently operates 94 nuclear reactors, which generate approximately 19% of the nation’s electricity.

A number of countries are speeding up efforts to license and build a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors to meet a surging demand for electricity from artificial intelligence data centers and electrification, which the Biden administration pushed during his term in office. Recognizing the need for new baseload power, President Biden signed legislation to modernize the licensing of new reactor technologies so they can be built faster. The NRC is currently reviewing applications from companies and a utility that want to build small nuclear reactors to begin generating electricity in the early 2030s. It expects its review to take three years or less, but this is 18 months longer than Trump’s orders allow.

On May 20, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced that it had submitted a permit to install the nation’s first small modular nuclear reactor (SMR). In Ontario, Canada, the power company has begun building the first of four small nuclear reactors. Russia and China are also adding to their nuclear arsenal. China is building new nuclear plants at a stunning pace, with 10 reactors green-lighted in each of the last two years and 26 under construction. Its fleet may soon displace France as second in reactors behind the United States. China has 55 nuclear reactors in operation, while France has 56 reactors at 18 different power plants. Chinese officials have touted their strategy of standardized development of nuclear power plants, which enables the faster completion of projects.

China is also in the process of constructing a SMR , known as “Linglong One,” which is the first SMR globally to have passed the universal safety review by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its construction is expected to be finished by 2026 with a power generation capacity of 125 megawatts.

House Republicans’ decision to impose a new, permanent SALT cap upholds a double-tax on New York taxpayers and unfairly burdens households.
If New York Republicans in the House refuse to advocate for the best interests of their state, I will.","Governor Kathy Hochul today issued a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune outlining the potentially disastrous impact that the House’s proposed budget would have on New Yorkers. If enacted, the bill would gut New York’s healthcare system, strip families of crucial nutrition benefits, trigger billions in economic losses through the removal of clean energy tax credits and continue to unfairly tax hard-working New Yorkers by failing to fully repeal the SALT cap.

The House bill slashes $13.5 billion in funding for our healthcare economy through cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplace, putting nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers at risk of losing their health insurance. Safety net hospitals in rural and low-income areas could be forced to shutter their doors permanently and doctors and health care providers would face financial jeopardy. The bill also significantly shrinks federal support for SNAP nutrition and food benefits, making it more difficult for the nearly three million New Yorkers who rely on SNAP to put food on the table for their families.

In addition, the House bill would put the safety and reliability of our power grid at risk by repealing tax credits that support major renewable and energy storage projects with an estimated loss of $25 billion in clean energy investments. The bill would also curtail efforts to reduce housing energy costs and improve resilience by eliminating the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program, an important resource to retrofit affordable housing stock. Other proposed measures include gutting student loan programs, levying outrageous taxes on nonprofits and universities, eliminating the popular direct-file program to simplify the tax process, and prohibiting state AI regulation.

The proposed budget would inflict all of these harms while still failing to deliver on a key promise made by New York Republicans in Congress to their constituents: a full repeal of the SALT cap. Congressional Republicans’ decision to impose a new, permanent SALT cap upholds a double-tax on New York taxpayers and unfairly burdens middle-class households.

The full text of the letter is below:

Dear Majority Leader Thune and Minority Leader Schumer:

As Governor of New York, I am writing to you ahead of the Senate’s consideration of the House reconciliation legislative package to underscore the detrimental impact this bill would have on my state. If enacted, the proposed bill would gut New York’s healthcare system, strip families of crucial nutrition benefits, trigger billions in economic losses through the removal of clean energy tax credits, stagnate growth in education and critical technology sectors, and continue to unfairly tax hard-working New Yorkers by failing to fully repeal the SALT cap. Passage of this legislation would worsen the affordability crisis and inject further instability into an already fragile economy.

Restricting Access to Healthcare: The House bill slashes $13.5 billion in funding for our healthcare economy through cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. Make no mistake: if the Senate passes this legislation and it is signed into law, nearly 1.5 million people in New York will lose their health insurance. Over $3 billion will be lost to our hospitals, with safety net hospitals in rural and low-income areas at significant risk of shuttering their doors permanently. These closures will harm all New Yorkers, regardless of their insurance coverage.

Reducing Food Security: The bill also significantly shrinks federal support for SNAP nutrition and food benefits, making it more difficult for the nearly three million New Yorkers who rely on SNAP to put food on the table for their families. The bill places significant administrative burdens on our state and counties and will create headaches for eligible families in receiving their benefits. States have always played a key role in SNAP; this bill decimates the longstanding federal-state partnership by penalizing states with recurring annual costs. We expect the House-passed bill to cost New York State alone over $2.1 billion annually.

Undermining Energy Modernization and Resilience: The House reconciliation package would put the safety and reliability of our power grid at risk by repealing tax credits that support major renewable and energy storage projects. The financial impact to New York from the loss of the investment tax credit alone would be $25 billion to the state’s current portfolio of large-scale clean energy investments and would further make new projects more expensive for businesses and threaten good-paying union jobs. Added fees on electric vehicles, canceled IRA transportation funding, and the rollback of EV and home energy credits would also drive-up costs statewide. The bill would also curtail efforts to reduce housing energy costs and improve resilience by eliminating the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program (GRRP), an important resource to retrofit our nation’s affordable housing stock.

Education Undermined, Disparities Widened: The House bill threatens to dismantle essential supports for low-income and nontraditional students by imposing restrictive eligibility changes for working, part-time learners; establishing harsh institutional penalties; and eliminating key federal loan programs. In New York, where nearly half of community college students attend part-time and rely heavily on Pell Grants, these changes could force thousands to drop out or incur deeper debt. Additionally, the bill eliminates some subsidized student loans and forces loan risk onto education institutions. Taken together, these provisions represent a regressive shift that threatens to widen educational disparities, destabilize community colleges and minority-serving institutions and undermine national efforts to promote affordable higher education.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Moratorium: The House legislation also includes a highly-problematic and broad prohibition on state AI regulation for a decade. States like New York have passed laws to both invest in the incredible potential of AI and thoughtfully address potential AI harms in the face of federal inaction. Under my leadership, New York has enacted several first-in-the-nation AI safety measures, including the Safe for Kids Act to curb the addictive nature of social media for kids, and safeguards for AI Companion chatbots to reduce harmful interactions. If this federal prohibition remains in reconciliation, the impact is not merely a bureaucratic moratorium; it undermines the states’ fundamental right and responsibility to protect the safety, health, privacy, and economic vitality of its citizens.

Unfair Tax Burdens: Not only does this bill guarantee higher costs, it also fails to deliver on a key promise made by New Yorkers in your caucus to their constituents: a full repeal of the SALT cap. House Republicans’ decision to impose a new, permanent SALT cap upholds a double-tax on New York taxpayers and unfairly burdens households. The bill also levies outrageous taxes on nonprofits including universities, and eliminates the popular direct-file program that simplifies the tax filing process – all in an effort to cut taxes for the richest Americans.

These are just some of the more egregious harms this bill would inflict on my constituents. If New York Republicans in the House refuse to advocate for the best interests of their state, I will. As Governor, I must stand up for middle-class New Yorkers who cannot afford the consequences of this budget. I urge you to reject the House proposal and instead work with Leader Schumer on a bipartisan reconciliation package that delivers for working families, invests in the future, and reflects the real needs of the people we serve.

Sincerely,

California's climate superfund plan may have stalled - CalMatters,"Alejandro Lazo, Alejandro Lazo Climate",,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/climate-change/2025/06/climate-superfund-california-legislature-oil/,"In the battle over how to pay for damage wrought by climate change, California lawmakers had an idea: Create a “superfund” that makes big polluters pay.
The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025 would make the world’s largest sources of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels financially responsible for the damage caused by wildfires, droughts and other events exacerbated by the warming climate.

The Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act of 2025 would make the world’s largest sources of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels financially responsible for the damage caused by wildfires, droughts and other events exacerbated by the warming climate.

The idea adopts the “Superfund” model — created by Congress in 1980 to clean up the nation’s worst toxic waste sites — and applies it to greenhouse gases, aiming to hold companies financially accountable for emissions that drive climate change.

New York and Vermont have already enacted similar measures despite massive opposition from the oil and gas industry.

But the proposed California legislation has stalled since April, even as environmental groups — galvanized by the death and destruction of the January Los Angeles wildfires — have made it a top priority.

Identical versions in both legislative houses have sat idle in Assembly and Senate committees despite a full-court press by supporters framing the superfund as a solution to California’s $12 billion budget deficit. The bills passed out of their first committees but have not advanced further.

“Nobody can afford the kind of financial crisis that the climate crisis has caused,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, one of the authors, told CalMatters. “Oil caused the climate crisis, in large part … they lied about it as they caused the damages, and it’s time for them to come to the table and create more affordability for the very people that they’ve harmed.”

The funds would be earmarked for paying for community disaster preparedness, such as evacuation planning and emergency housing, as well as energy efficiency, zero-emission fleets and charging, and natural resource protection, among other projects, according to the bill.

Opposition includes oil companies and major business groups. In addition, despite worsening wildfires and floods, many Californians have been increasingly voicing concern that the state’s climate policies are driving up gas and electricity costs.

Oil and gas industry lobbying has been fierce. Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, the industry’s top lobbying group in the West, said in a statement that the measures were “misguided proposals to retroactively punish companies for providing a legal product that was, and remains, critical to our state’s economy.”

He said that “at a time when Californians are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, these bills will likely result in massive price increases for gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electricity and consumer goods.”

The climate superfund also faces resistance from a powerful ally of Big Oil: California’s State Building and Construction Trades Council, a key union that has repeatedly backed the industry’s positions, as CalMatters has previously reported.

Earlier this year, the council also opposed legislation by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, that would have allowed residents to sue oil companies for climate damages.

In April, Keith Dunn, a lobbyist for the trades union, told an Assembly committee that the climate superfund would drive up energy prices, kill middle-class jobs and act as a stealth tax on working families. “The affordability gap is widening,” Dunn told lawmakers. “It’s not by chance, it’s by choice.”

Both measures include “urgency” provisions, which allow them to take effect immediately if passed by a two-thirds vote and signed by the governor. That higher threshold makes them less vulnerable to certain legal challenges and exempts them from the usual legislative deadlines. (Most bills must clear their house of origin by today.)

“There was quite a bit of opposition earlier in the year so we’re continuing those conversations,” Addis said. “We have time to have those conversations.”

The bill would make companies pay for emissions from “the extraction, production, refining, sale, or combustion, including by third parties, of fossil fuels or petroleum products,” which includes oil, gas and coal.

Bill targets multinational corporations

The bill applies to companies that emit more than a billion metric tons of global emissions from 1990 through 2024 — that means multinational oil and gas corporations. Within three months of the law taking effect, the agency would publish a list of companies that would pay into the fund.

There are no official estimates as to how much companies would pay. The legislation would require the California Environmental Protection Agency to estimate costs from past and projected climate damages to people, governments, ecosystems and infrastructure every five years through 2045, using peer-reviewed science.

“It is imperative that we make polluters that caused a large percentage of the climate crisis pay for the thing that they knowingly caused,” said Maya Golden-Krasner, an attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, which has sponsored the California bills. “They’ve known that this would cause damage since at least the 1950s, they knew that these greenhouse gases would be regulated since the 1990s and they’ve been gaslighting us all the way and blocking climate regulation.”

The climate superfund fight is part of a broader national movement against major oil companies that is playing out in legislatures and courtrooms across America.

California is leading efforts to hold oil companies accountable in court for climate change, recycling a legal strategy deployed during the 1990s, when states alleged that tobacco companies knew cigarettes cause cancer.

Trump-era politics have also been at issue. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order targeting state climate programs, specifically calling out Vermont’s and New York’s polluter-pays laws and threatening legal action against California’s landmark cap-and-trade program.

Backers say the climate superfund is a fair solution to California’s budget crunch as well as a long-overdue reckoning for an industry that knowingly caused the climate crisis.

But the plan — which could cause oil and gas companies to pay billions for emissions over the last three decades — faces an uphill battle in Sacramento.

Last year, Californians voiced strong opposition to plans to overhaul one of its cornerstone climate programs, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which could push gasoline prices higher. Last week, Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Democrat from Bakersfield, called for California Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, who led the board in its passage of that measure, to resign over cost concerns.

Likely to trigger a legal onslaught

If enacted, the climate superfund would almost certainly trigger a wave of legal challenges. Donald Sobelman, a San Francisco environmental attorney, told CalMatters that the bill is legally ambitious — and is almost certainly headed for a courtroom challenge if it passes.

The Trump administration, for instance, sued New York and Vermont over their climate superfund measures, arguing they are unconstitutional.

Another potential legal argument, Sobelman said, is that the measure could charge companies now for pollution emitted years or even decades ago. Another is that the measure could act like a tax, which could make it easier to challenge in California court without two-thirds approval by the Legislature.

And some judges may question whether the science linking the emissions to worsening fires and other climate events is strong enough to single out specific companies for climate damage, leading to the “classic battle of the experts,” Sobelman said.

In addition, courts could determine that consumers hold some responsibility for their actions, such as driving cars and trucks powered by fossil fuels, and that other industries around the world, such as power plants and farms, also emit a lot of greenhouse gases.

A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom declined to tell CalMatters whether he supports the measure.

In his May budget proposal, the governor adopted “polluters pay” language to rally support for an existing California climate program, cap-and-trade, which raises money by selling pollution credits to companies.

The debate is unfolding amid a worsening budget crisis in which lawmakers are under pressure to find new revenue sources — especially ones that don’t involve tax hikes on Californians. Supporters of the Superfund Act argue that the bill offers a “polluter-pays” principle rather than new taxes.

Newsom’s budget proposal said extending cap and trade “aligns with the polluter-pays principle in which carbon emitters will fund the state’s world-class forestry and fire protection programs in the face of wildfires that have become increasingly destructive because of climate change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/070622_OilField_LV_CM_009.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:42.548705

Tariffs and potential repeals of federal funding are creating roadblocks to the further buildout of energy projects.

Wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects have helped revitalize rural communities by creating jobs, generating new tax revenues, and providing lease payments to landowners.

However, energy projects rely on globally-sourced components, due to the U.S. supply chain's inability to meet rising demand. To avoid tariffs, solar developers are stockpiling panels, but the impact is only delayed. Battery storage is critical for grid reliability and faces tariffs of up to 65%.

The rising costs are forcing companies to delay or cancel plans.

For example, the Plum Creek Wind Project in Minnesota was cleared for construction this fall, but the project developer, National Grid Renewables, has pressed pause due to escalating costs tied to tariffs.

The slowdown threatens rural economies by halting the local jobs and long-term positions in operations and maintenance that new construction brings. Tax revenues from energy projects fund vital infrastructure and critical public services like schools, emergency services, and roads. In Iowa’s Howard County, 147 wind turbines account for 14.5% of the county’s total annual tax revenue.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, about 85% of U.S. farm households earned the majority of their income from off-farm sources. Hosting wind turbines or solar panels offers a stable source of income through lease payments, but the additional income is at risk if renewable energy development declines.

Rural economies have grown, thanks to renewable energy development, but without continued investment, many communities will not be able to unlock those economic benefits.

Others in the left-of-center coalition say unfettered data center growth could jeopardize progress toward the state’s statutory target of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 while threatening grid reliability and raising costs for ordinary utility customers.
How much data center demand is actually coming?
Data centers alone account for about half of Xcel’s expected 5% annual sales growth through 2029.
“It’s shifted from us trying to attract (data center) companies to Minnesota to them knocking on our doors.” Smaller utilities like Dakota Electric Association are also gearing up for massive amounts of data center development, CEO Ryan Hentges said later on the webinar.","The intra-DFL rift between labor unions whose members build data centers and progressives skeptical of corporate giveaways was on full display at the Capitol last week as lawmakers considered extending generous tax breaks for data centers’ purchases of computers, software and energy equipment.

It was also evident in a May 28 energy webinar featuring top utility executives, state officials and representatives from regional labor, agriculture and environmental groups.

The conversation came as Minnesota utilities weigh proposals for thousands of megawatts of new data center capacity, representing new electric consumption equal to millions of homes. As other construction sectors falter amid high interest rates and sluggish demand, union laborers and tradespeople see an opportunity in building data centers and the power plants to run them.

“We need to be involved in the next iteration of energy development here in Minnesota,” said Joe Fowler, business manager for Laborers International Union of North America Local 563.

To labor, that means building not only the wind, solar and battery plants that will form the backbone of Minnesota’s future electric grid, but large industrial facilities to soak up the power they produce. Others in the left-of-center coalition say unfettered data center growth could jeopardize progress toward the state’s statutory target of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 while threatening grid reliability and raising costs for ordinary utility customers.

“We want to bring on large users like data centers, but not to the exclusion of others,” said Margaret Cherne-Hendrick, CEO of St. Paul-based Fresh Energy, a policy and communications shop focused on clean energy.

Though the data center boom was the elephant in the room, the conversation touched on some of the broader challenges issues facing Minnesota electric utilities, workers and customers as a dysfunctional state legislative session limps to a close and federal policymakers get closer to passing a budget bill that cuts taxes for the rich and Medicaid for the poor while, experts say, raising power prices for everyone.

How much data center demand is actually coming?

Developers have proposed nearly 9,000 megawatts of new data center capacity across Xcel Energy’s eight-state territory, CEO Bob Frenzel said in October, or almost 9 million homes’ worth of electricity consumption. Data centers alone account for about half of Xcel’s expected 5% annual sales growth through 2029.

Xcel expects Minnesota’s share of that growth to be about 1,300 megawatts over the next seven to eight years, said Ryan Long, Xcel’s president for Minnesota and the Dakotas. That’s up from 60 megawatts of total capacity as of early last year.

“The curve is up and to the right,” Long told Energy Futures Initiative Foundation CEO and former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz on the webinar. “It’s shifted from us trying to attract (data center) companies to Minnesota to them knocking on our doors.”

Smaller utilities like Dakota Electric Association are also gearing up for massive amounts of data center development, CEO Ryan Hentges said later on the webinar. Projects proposed for Dakota Electric territory include a 12-building, 340-acre Farmington campus that residents are suing to stop.

But the demand won’t hit all at once, Hentges said.

“One gigawatt is not all going to happen next year,” he said. “It’s going to happen over time, and that gives us more time to plan.”

Can utilities serve new data centers while meeting Minnesota’s carbon-free power mandate?

The short answer is yes, according to Long. Even with the influx predicted over the next five years, Xcel is on track to shut down its three remaining Minnesota coal units by 2030 and meet the interim state goal of 80% clean power by 2030, he said.

“These are aging, somewhat inefficient plants and we are blessed to live in a region that has excellent renewable resources,” he said.

Xcel could partner on future “clean firm” power projects with big tech companies, which have their own sustainability goals, Long added. Google, utility NV Energy and power developer Fervo Energy recently announced a geothermal power partnership in Nevada, while Meta, Amazon and Microsoft have all inked splashy nuclear deals. Nuclear and geothermal both produce carbon-free power without relying on variable weather conditions.

Those partnerships could eventually help wean Minnesota off natural gas power despite uncertainty around federal support for cleaner technologies, said Sydnie Lieb, assistant commissioner with the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

“In the absence of the federal government continuing to push development of clean firm resources, we are thinking about what the state can do,” she said.

Big data centers could also cover at least some of the cost of new transmission infrastructure needed to serve them, easing the burden on existing ratepayers, Hentges added.

But the state needs to ensure Minnesota data centers fully decarbonize their operations over time, including onsite backup generators that today generally run on natural gas or diesel, Cherne-Hendrick said. It also needs to push data centers to pay into state-administered equity programs facing sharp federal funding cuts, like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, she said.

Is Minnesota really facing a ‘power emergency’?

Also no, Long said, despite the Trump administration’s claims to the contrary.

Last month, Trump invoked an obscure law to order a Michigan coal plant to operate past its planned May 31 retirement date. Moniz, the former U.S. Energy Secretary, asked whether he could do the same in another Midwestern state committed to transitioning off coal.

Xcel is “obviously paying a lot of attention” to the issue but isn’t changing its coal retirement plans, which have been in the works for years and won’t affect system reliability, Long said.

He allowed that Minnesota will need gas power plants for many years, though they’ll increasingly serve as backup for renewables, nuclear and long-duration batteries. Xcel plans to build a new “hydrogen-capable” gas plant in southwestern Minnesota that will likely operate past 2040.

Will the transition to carbon-free power kill jobs?

Building new wind, solar and battery plants has been cheaper than running existing coal plants for years, in part because renewable power requires far less labor to operate and maintain.

Fowler said that’s a challenge for unions like LIUNA, whose work in the power sector increasingly focuses on facilities that more or less run themselves. And LIUNA members are uneasy about the future.

“Our job is to work ourselves out of a job — we build something and then move onto the next project,” he said.

A February settlement between Xcel and Minnesota’s utility regulator pushes the utility to expand training opportunities for underrepresented populations and work with labor on workforce transitions at retiring power plants. The training partnership has already produced around 100 graduates who can now work on new power plant or data center construction projects, Fowler said.

“There are real benefits the state will see from … having citizens who feel like their job is waiting out there,” he said.

Is rural Minnesota being asked to do too much to support the green transition?

Wind and solar development is a double-edged sword for rural communities, where income-earning opportunities for landowners clash with concerns about removing prime farmland from production, said Anne Schwagerl, vice president with Minnesota Farmers Union.

To demystify the issue and strengthen members’ negotiating position with power developers, Minnesota Farmers Union plans to update its five-year-old “farmers’ guide” to renewable energy. But the best way to ensure durable rural support for clean energy is to give farm communities more skin in the game, Schwagerl said.

Right now, for example, conglomerates barge most of the fertilizer used on Minnesota farms up the Mississippi River from massive factories on the Gulf Coast. Minnesota Farmers Union wants to see more local production, ideally led by rural cooperatives using excess wind power with support from federal and state green fertilizer grants, Schwagerl said.

“Our thinking is that the green transition is happening,” she said. “We’re seeing it in agriculture as in energy, and it would be a big bummer to us if it ended up being owned by the same multinational megacorporations.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nuclear-power-plant-2048x1365.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:03.630542

A recent survey found that Texas experienced 4.1% year-over-year job growth within the sector, ""demonstrating that traditional energy states can successfully transition toward cleaner alternatives.""

Generator and electrical services provider Oregon Generators gathered 2023 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Energy's 2024 report to compare states by clean energy job prevalence. The company, which specializes in power solutions including generator installation and electric vehicle (EV) charging setups, sought to find where the clean energy industry is booming in scale as well as relative job concentration.

""Understanding where clean energy jobs are concentrated should help both workers and businesses make more informed decisions about their future,"" Oregon Generators Owner Corey Gilgan said.

Here's how the Lone Star State's clean energy industry compares to those in other states.

Which states have the most clean energy jobs?

The six states with the most residents also lead the country in clean energy jobs. Data collected by Oregon Generators shows that each state approaches the sector in unique ways.

California's significant job market reflects the state's commitment to renewable energy and progressive climate policies. As it invests in solar and wind infrastructure, the largest tech sector in its clean energy economy is traditional HVAC.

While California's clean energy job growth has slowed in recent years, Texas boasts strong growth as it uses its energy expertise and infrastructure to expand into renewable energy. Energy Star & Efficient Lighting is the state's primary clean energy employment sector. The industry has become a significant employer, accounting for 3.02% of total employment in Texas.

North Carolina had by far the highest year-over-year growth, at 10.6%. Like Texas, its primary clean energy employer is Energy Star & Efficient Lighting.

Smaller states have highest rates of clean energy jobs

While the states with the most residents generally had the most clean energy jobs overall, it was actually the smaller states that tended to have the highest concentration of those jobs.

Vermont leads states in clean energy job rates. Its share of clean energy jobs within total employment (6.00%) was nearly double that of Texas (3.02%). The northeastern state's specialized focus was on high-efficiency and renewable heating and cooling technologies. Following Vermont, the highest rates were in Wyoming and West Virginia.

""In states like Vermont and Wyoming, clean energy is becoming fundamental to the local economy, rather than just being supplementary,"" Gilgan said.

Like Texas, Wyoming and West Virginia are former fossil fuel-dependent states that are successfully transitioning to focus on clean energy sources.

Utah and South Dakota also stand out for their impressive growth rates of 9.0% and 8.4%, respectively. Utah also has one of the largest employment bases in the country, with nearly 18 million total jobs.

Reviewing the study's results, Gilgan had this to say:

This sector creates quality, sustainable employment while addressing climate challenges. States investing in clean energy infrastructure and workforce development can drive significant job creation. Those establishing leadership now will maintain competitive advantages for decades to come.

For workers, these trends signal valuable opportunities in a growing field with long-term stability. The clean energy transition serves both environmental and economic imperatives, reshaping the American workforce in substantial ways.","https://www.statesman.com/gcdn/authoring/images/Hearst/2025/06/06/NAAS/84066191007-rawImage.png?crop=1124,632,x0,y2&width=1124&height=632&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-06-06 10:09:18.027374

The core of the argument between the two men — whether the Republican spending package is a “big, beautiful bill” or a “MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK” — is a side concern for people whose main priority is Tesla.

“The CEO of that company needs to spend his time focused on the company’s success,” said Nick Nigro, the head of Atlas Public Policy, which analyzes the electric vehicle market. “Whether his interest in federal policy comes from a good place, it’s a distraction from what Tesla shareholders and drivers need, which is his full attention.”

Seth Abramson, a vociferous Musk critic who is writing a book about the entrepreneur, wrote on X that “Musk will go the rest of his life without a political home or patron, shunned by politicians of both parties and therefore unable to effectively operate as a CEO of any company.”

The breakup between the world’s richest man and one of its most powerful could have far-reaching impacts for Musk’s companies.

Investor optimism about Tesla has been based on the assumption that Musk’s proximity to power would lead to a national policy on autonomous vehicles that would ease the arrival of Tesla’s robotaxi, which is supposed to hit the roads of Austin, Texas, this month. Musk could also lose leverage on other issues important to Tesla, such as Trump’s tariffs on China’s critical minerals. Meanwhile, his space company SpaceX has billions of dollars of federal defense and space contracts — now at risk — while its satellite subsidiary Starlink is angling for billions more in federal broadband subsidies.

‘Attack mode’

Tesla is still the country’s largest electric automaker. But the Trump-Musk split comes at a vulnerable moment for both Tesla and electric vehicles writ large.

The company is facing declining sales around the world, as its vehicle lineup has grown stale and Musk’s political activities have turned off many EV buyers in Europe and North America.

Meanwhile, federal support for EVs is hanging by a thread. The House’s version of the megabill would drastically scale back Biden-era tax incentives meant to stimulate EV manufacturing and sales.

The fight between Trump and Musk escalated on Thursday after Trump told reporters that Musk was “upset” about the House-passed bill’s proposal to remove EV tax credits and other incentives. Musk took to X to deny that narrative, writing: “Keep the EV/solar incentives cuts in the bill, also cut all the crazy spending increases in the Big Ugly Bill so that America doesn’t go bankrupt!”

The president’s repeated attacks on EVs and vows to repeal the Biden administration’s subsidies certainly didn’t seem to trouble Musk much during last year’s campaign, when the megabillionaire spent more than $270 million and countless hours to help put Trump back into the White House. (Trump did concede at the time that Tesla made a “great product.”)

Musk’s apparent willingness to sacrifice federal incentives was unwelcome news to clean energy and EV advocates who hope Republican senators will save some of the tax credits from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law. Republicans can afford to lose only three votes in the Senate, and some GOP senators have indicated they think the bill’s rollbacks go too far.

The war of words between Trump and Musk ended any hopes that the Tesla CEO would have the leverage with the White House to tip the scales.

“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social.

That statement was a far cry from three months ago, when Trump made a show of buying a Tesla in front of the White House. That gesture raised hopes among some Tesla shareholders that Republicans would embrace Tesla and compensate for its diminished popularity among Democrats, many of whom had taken to staging protests outside its showrooms.

“I’m going to buy because No. 1, it’s a great product, as good as it gets. And No. 2, because this man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this, I think he’s been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people,” Trump said at the time about Musk.

Now, that’s all changed.

“Trump no longer has to say nice things about Tesla and EVs,” said Loren McDonald, an analyst at the EV data shop Paren, in a message. “He and the admin can go back to ‘EVs are evil’ attack mode.”

Critical minerals and beyond

The fizzled bromance could also alter the myriad and complex relationships that Tesla has across the globe, as well as its business before the federal government.

Musk, for example, will presumably hold no sway over the administration’s intended move to impose steep tariffs on imports of Chinese graphite used to make EV batteries.

The Commerce Department concluded last month that imported Chinese graphite is receiving unfair subsidizes. The agency laid out a plan to impose tariffs of up to 721 percent on some natural and artificial graphite active anode material from China that’s used in batteries.

Tesla has fought against the tariffs, with one of the company’s attorneys pointing out that U.S. manufacturers don’t yet produce anode material that meets carmakers’ standards.

The fallout could also put a bulls-eye on Musk’s financial ties to Beijing, something Democrats have repeatedly railed against.

The Trump administration and lawmakers from both parties are pushing to ease China’s grip on supply chains, from the production of critical minerals to processing and manufacturing of EV batteries.

Yet Tesla has many ties to China, including reliance on graphite imports, a gigafactory located in Shanghai, and ongoing work with Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. CATL, the world’s largest battery-maker, is on a U.S. government list of companies that work with the Chinese military.

In short, nothing on Thursday boded well for America’s leading electric automaker.

“It’s another Twilight Zone moment in this Musk/Trump relationship which now is quickly moving downhill,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at investment shop Wedbush Securities who tracks Tesla.

But Ives nonetheless remained hopeful. The subject line of his email: “Friends Again Soon?”

The company outperforms the industry reliability standard, restoring 92% of affected customers’ power within 24 hours during active storm days, and has an overall electric service reliability of 99.98%. Its residential customers’ electric bills are 28% below the national average and are among the lowest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The company has also lowered customers’ bills through cost-effective wind and solar projects. Xcel Energy now has enough wind capacity on its system to cost-effectively power more than 2.5 million homes, quadruple the amount it had in 2005. And, from 2017 to 2024, wind projects saved customers approximately $5 billion through avoided fuel costs and earned tax credits.

“We have long been leaders in sustainability in this industry — without sacrificing affordability — and we’re not slowing down now,” said Jeff Lyng, vice president of external affairs and policy and chief sustainability officer. “Our customers and policymakers are asking more from us as our service plays an even larger role in their homes and businesses. We must continue to balance environmental responsibility with economic prosperity and community vitality.”

In 2024, Xcel Energy provided $187 million in customer rebates and incentives through programs that enable customers to embrace energy-efficient lighting, appliances and more. Customers installed more than 23,000 solar systems through the company’s Solar*Rewards program, and the company also connected more than 193,000 customers to more than $175 million in energy assistance programs offered by the company and by public sources.

Bringing jobs and investment to communities

Xcel Energy engages with community members, businesses, organizations and civic and political groups across the 1,600 cities and counties it serves to better meet residents’ energy needs, connect customers to programs that save money and energy, foster economic growth and build the future workforce.

Xcel Energy helps the communities it serves prosper, working with landowners, developers, municipalities and economic development organizations to ease the path to locating or expanding businesses. The company spent $5.2 billion with small or local businesses in 2024, helped create nearly 3,200 new jobs and spurred $5.1 billion in additional capital investment. The company’s economic development team initiated 24 projects across the eight states it serves, which will help grow industries such as data centers, food processing and manufacturing.

Together with the Xcel Energy Foundation, employees and retirees, the company gave back to its communities, donating $14.5 million across the eight states it serves and its employees contributed $3 million in economic impact through volunteering for nonprofit and community improvement projects.

A local environmental group is questioning how truly committed the City of Windsor is to its climate goals, despite recently earning a top green grade from a global non-profit.

The Citizens Environment Alliance said the ‘A’ grade — placing Windsor among roughly 100 cities recognized worldwide — does not reflect the city’s actual follow-through on its climate goals.

“From our perspective, and from our experience, it’s not an ‘A’ grade from us,” said Derek Coronado, president of the Citizens Environment Alliance.

“There’s a gap there between getting an ‘A’ grade from some nonprofit that’s not here on the ground, really paying attention, handing out questionnaires instead of actually seeing the city in action.

“The city is supposed to be a leader on environmental actions and policies, and more often than not, they’re followers.”

The organization CDP included Windsor on its ‘A’ list this year — one of just 112 cities worldwide so recognized, and only eight in Canada, to earn top marks. Other Canadian cities on the list included Calgary, Montreal, and Vancouver.

However, Coronado said the recognition may not tell the whole story. He said the methodology used to earn a top score is not an independent audit of the city’s actual performance, but a survey.

In an emailed statement to the Star, the city said it “recognizes the urgency of climate action and remains committed to sustainability.”

The city said its Environmental, Sustainability & Climate Change (ESCC) department is currently reviewing four master plans with more than 500 climate-related action items.

The statement added that since adopting the Community Energy Plan (CEP) in 2017, Windsor has made “significant progress.” It cited a decline in community-wide emissions since 2005, and said the city surpassed its emissions target for 2023.

Coronado’s local group, however, claims the city isn’t being fully transparent when it comes to keeping up with its climate promises.

Among the many oversights the CEA noted are delayed committee meetings, lackluster public communication, and missing public reports.

The group said the city has yet to publicly release its 2023 greenhouse gas emissions inventory, target updates, or its net-zero implementation plan.

“We are getting a bit more frustrated as time passes with the city’s lack of action on not only implementing climate action, but communicating and being accountable for that action,” said Coronado.

“It’s a two-fold problem, and it’s been going on for some time.”

Coronado said the city has yet to implement its Urban Forest Master Plan.

Asked by the Star to respond, the city stated that plan, which outlines Windsor’s long-term urban forestry goals, will be brought to council in the coming weeks for formal discussion and feedback.

The Environment and Climate Change Advisory Committee (ECCAC), which advises the city on environmental and climate change matters, is mandated to meet at least six times annually. The committee held only its second meeting of the year on May 22.

“While administration has made efforts to schedule meetings in recent months,” the city told the Star, “achieving quorum has been a challenge.”

Coronado said local environmentalists want to see the city “lay down cohesive principles for what the city stands for” when facing the unavoidable reality of climate change.

“We’re seeing it happen all over the place in Canada, from forest fires and flooding and heat waves, to all of those things that directly impact people’s health, but also people’s pocketbooks,” he said.

“The longer the city waits, the greater the risk and threat to the health and safety of members of the community.

Instead, we find that it is governed by complex interdependencies and feedback loops.","The global shift towards a clean-energy system is much more than just a technological switch – it is a profound transformation of markets, industries and societal behaviours.

This complex undertaking is often characterised by “non-linearity” and “feedback loops”, where small changes can go on to have disproportionately large impacts and where seemingly straightforward paths encounter unexpected roadblocks.

Interventions can be self-amplifying – leading to runaway change, or they can be self-defeating – when progress seems impossible to attain.

Our new policy brief sheds light on these intricate dynamics, which can be overlooked when governments use analytical frameworks based on standard economic thinking.

The brief sets out the most common archetypes of system change and behaviour, as well as the underlying feedback loops that drive them, with the aim of helping policymakers to understand the recurring patterns that can either accelerate or impede progress.

Governments that can recognise these patterns – as well as the ways they can be harnessed or sidestepped – are likely to be better equipped to manage structural change.

This article delves into three key examples from the policy brief, exploring how they are influencing the energy transition and what lessons can be drawn for effective policymaking.

Reinforcing feedback loops

At the heart of the energy transition lies a powerful engine: the reinforcing feedback loops inherent in the development and diffusion of many clean-energy technologies.

This virtuous cycle operates through several mechanisms.

First, “learning by doing”, which means that as more units of a technology, such as solar panels or wind turbines, are produced and deployed, manufacturers and developers become more efficient, processes are refined and costs fall.

Second, economies of scale kick in: as production volumes increase, unit costs decrease due to efficiencies in manufacturing and more developed supply chains.

Finally, wider deployment can trigger network effects and the emergence of complementary innovations. This means that as the adoption of a given technology grows, it can foster an ecosystem of supporting infrastructure, skilled labour and supporting technologies, which can further boost its attractiveness and viability.

Together, these three elements create a powerful reinforcing loop: initial investment drives innovation and cost reduction, which spurs increased demand, attracting further investment.

Solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines are prime examples of this dynamic.

The astonishing growth of solar offers a particularly vivid illustration of the way in which reinforcing feedback loops can blindside experts and policymakers alike.

Solar growth has far exceeded projections made in the early 2000s. Indeed, the world’s actual installed capacity in 2020 was over 700 gigawatts (GW), more than ten times the level expected in outlooks published in 2006, as shown in the figure below.

Global solar deployment has exceeded expectations due to disparate trends and drivers in individual markets that, together, all point in the same direction. China, for instance, met its 2030 target for wind and solar capacity six years ahead of schedule in 2024.

Batteries are also riding this wave, with costs plummeting by around 85% over the past decade as deployment, particularly in road transport, scales up.

However, not all clean-energy technologies benefit from this self-amplifying pattern.

Nuclear power and hydropower, for example, have historically not shown the same rapid cost declines, due to their large, complex and site-specific nature. This contrasts with the smaller, modular and replicable characteristics of technologies, such as solar PV.

This does not negate the potential role of such technologies, but it does mean that they are less likely to see disruptive, exponential and self-reinforcing growth.

There are a number of potential conclusions for policymakers.

Early in the transition, interventions such as feed-in tariffs and public procurement were crucial in kick-starting these reinforcing feedbacks for solar and wind.

As these technologies mature and become cost-competitive, the focus shifts to removing other barriers, such as streamlining permitting processes, investing in grid expansion and reforming markets so they are better able to integrate variable renewable output.

These same principles could now be applied to newly emergent clean-energy technologies. Policies that directly nurture these reinforcing loops, such as deployment subsidies and clean technology mandates, can be expected to be most effective in the initial stages.

Turning again to the example of solar energy, while such initial efforts appeared to be expensive, they paid off over time by unlocking future cost reductions and, thus, kick-starting the self-amplifying feedback loops that are now driving further progress.

This contrasts with the idea that carbon pricing is necessarily the most efficient policy for decarbonisation. It may well be helpful, but as it will not drive rapid early technology adoption, it is less likely to have a self-amplifying effect in the initial stages of the transition.

Renewable ‘cannibalisation’

While the growth of renewable energy is the driving force of the energy transition, another system dynamic, termed “renewable cannibalisation“, can act as a dampening feedback loop. This can potentially slow progress long before full decarbonisation is achieved

This cannibalisation process results in variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as solar and wind, receiving decreasing prices for the electricity they generate.

Essentially, the more solar and wind capacity that is connected to the grid, the more they undermine their own revenue. This happens through three main channels.

First, the merit order effect, whereby solar and wind, which have very low operating costs, push more expensive fossil-fuel generators out of the market when supply is abundant.

In markets with marginal pricing, this leads to lower wholesale electricity prices during periods of high renewable output. While this cuts prices for consumers – at least in the short term – these lower prices also reduce revenues for renewable generators, potentially undermining the economic case for further investment.

For example, in California, solar power unit revenues fell by $1.30 per megawatt hour (MWh) for each percentage point increase in solar penetration between 2013 and 2017.

Second, price volatility, where uncertainty over future trends in the generation mix and the balance between supply and demand can make long-term revenues difficult to predict.

This increased uncertainty can raise the cost of capital for new renewable projects, again acting as a brake on investment

The UK, for example, experienced this before the introduction of “contracts for difference” (CfDs), which helped stabilise revenue expectations for renewable developers.

Third, volume risk, where rising VRE capacity increases the likelihood of more frequent curtailment – periods when renewable generation exceeds demand or grid capacity, forcing generators to scale back output and lose potential revenue.

Curtailment in itself is nothing new, but the scale and frequency is changing. Recent analysis by University College London suggests that without significant flexibility or storage, UK renewable generation could exceed demand for more than 50% of the time by 2030.

The analysis found that installed wind and solar capacity is set to surge beyond current levels of electricity demand, as illustrated in the figure below, finding that this could “deter investment” in new projects if no action is taken to address the problem.

These dampening feedback loops illustrate a classic “limits to success” scenario. The very success of renewables, if unmanaged, can create conditions that hinder their continued expansion.

The policy implications here are nuanced. One solution is CfDs, which offer renewable generators a fixed price and have been effective in many countries at mitigating the merit order effect and price volatility, thus maintaining investment.

However, as VRE penetration becomes very high and surplus generation becomes a regular occurrence, other solutions are likely to be needed. This is because existing CfD designs often include clauses that stop payments when market prices drop below zero.

As a result, alternative CfD designs, guaranteeing revenues based on installed capacity or potential – rather than actual – electricity generation might be considered, for example, even though these have other drawbacks.

More fundamentally, our research suggests the solution to this challenge lies in fostering the co-evolution of renewables with technologies such as energy storage and green hydrogen production. These can absorb surplus generation and turn a problem into an opportunity.

Whereas, traditionally, it might be assumed that the market on its own can optimally allocate risk, research suggests that a redesign of market structures may be needed to enable investment and fully realise the cost-saving opportunities of the new technologies.

This is one of several sets of feedbacks discussed in a separate new report published today, looking at the power sector transition in China.

The power of connection

The energy transition is not a series of isolated changes in different sectors. Instead, it is an interconnected system, where progress in one area can catalyse shifts elsewhere. Shared technologies can create reinforcing feedbacks that accelerate decarbonisation across multiple fronts, generating cross-sector synergies.

The relationship between clean power and transport electrification is a powerful example of this. As batteries are deployed at scale in electric vehicles (EVs), their costs fall, enabling ever-wider deployment and further cost declines, as shown in the chart below.

This is due to the learning-by-doing and economies-of-scale feedbacks discussed above.

This cost reduction then makes batteries more viable for grid-scale energy storage, which, in tur, helps integrate more low-cost VRE into the power system.

Cheaper, cleaner electricity then further incentivises the electrification of transport, as well as heating and light industry. This increased electrification boosts demand for renewable power, driving further deployment and cost reductions in solar and wind. It also expands the potential for demand-side response, where consumers adjust their electricity use to help balance the grid.

A similar dynamic is anticipated for “green” hydrogen. As deployment in one anchor sector – perhaps fertilisers or refining – drives down the cost of electrolysers, it makes green hydrogen more competitive for other applications, such as shipping or even long-duration energy storage in the power sector.

Each sector’s adoption of green hydrogen contributes to the shared learning and cost reduction, benefiting all.

The policy implications of these cross-sector synergies could be significant. Their existence suggests, for example, that there is no need to wait for decarbonisation of the power sector to advance further, before beginning the electrification of transport, heating or industry.

This is in contrast to the argument that transport should only be electrified after cutting power sector emissions, since increased EV charging will drive up demand for gas- or coal-fired generation.

While there will be a marginal increase in emissions from plugging a new EV into the power grid, the insights described in our brief imply that it is still likely to be more effective to pursue the transition away from fossil fuels in multiple sectors in parallel, because it can activate beneficial cross-sector feedback loops that are greater than the sum of their parts.

As such, our research suggests that policymakers hoping to take advantage of cross-sector synergies could aim to deliberately strengthen technological linkages between different parts of the energy system. Examples include electricity tariffs and market structures that reward “smart” EV charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services, encouraging industrial participation in demand-side response and promoting integrated home energy systems. These interactions can amplify the benefits of early investment in the transition.

Policy insights from system dynamics

Archetypes such as the self-reinforcing growth of clean technologies, the potential for renewable cannibalisation, the accelerating power of cross-sector synergies and seven others described in our new report paint a picture of a transition that is far from linear. Instead, we find that it is governed by complex interdependencies and feedback loops.

Consequently, our research suggests that policymakers will be much better equipped to manage and steer the transition, if they adopt a systems thinking approach.

Recognising these recurring patterns allows for the design of more robust and effective policies that anticipate challenges and leverage opportunities.

For instance, understanding the power of reinforcing feedback loops in technology diffusion underscores the value of early-stage support for nascent clean-energy technologies.

Conversely, anticipating the dampening effects of renewable cannibalisation highlights the likely benefits of combining renewable buildout with evolving market designs and strategic investments in flexibility solutions, such as storage and demand-side response.

Policymakers that understand and work with these dynamics are likely to be in a better position to spark self-amplifying changes – achieving maximum value for minimum effort – and to avoid self-defeating interventions that go nowhere.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EANABH.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 10:09:21.522342

They're emitting more smoke,"" Fischer says.
""We are again having a remarkable start to fire season here in Canada,"" Daniels says.
He says most people think forest fires are sparked by carelessness, such as a discarded cigarette.
People in the U.S. shouldn't be too quick to criticize Canada when it comes to wildfires, Daniels says.","Paige Fischer was driving to the picturesque Traverse City region along Lake Michigan for a family vacation. But even as she was leaving her home in Ann Arbor this week, the smoke from massive wildfires in Canada's northern boreal forests was already evident.

Fischer, who as a professor of environmental sustainability at the University of Michigan, understands better than most what she and her family were getting themselves into.

""Even though I study this, I haven't completely caught up in terms of planning ahead to make sure there's good filtration systems where I'm staying,"" she acknowledged. ""But I definitely have masks with me.""

As of Thursday, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center said 201 fires are burning right now in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario, with fully half of them considered ""out of control."" While Canada is busy fighting fires, residents of the U.S. Midwest — especially in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan — are being forced to contend with the thick smoke.

While tens of thousands of Canadians have had to flee their homes in scenes reminiscent of what has occurred in recent years in California, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's AirNow page is showing air quality moderate to unhealthy throughout a large swath of the U.S., with the worst conditions in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana.

Fischer says we'd all better get used to it. The hotter, drying conditions that come with climate change are making these annual fires across North America, and in other parts of the world, the new norm.

""Wildfires are happening more frequently. They're getting bigger. They're emitting more smoke,"" Fischer says. ""The climate models are projecting that we're going to have more frequent, more severe wildfires.""

Lori Daniels, a forest ecologist and professor at the University of British Columbia (UBC) who specializes in wildfire science, agrees. ""Smoke knows no political boundaries — and neither does fire,"" she says. ""The wind patterns have taken that smoke kind of from the northwest across a big diagonal. And that's why you're getting so much smoke down in the United States.""

Canada and the U.S. are seeing a virtual repeat of 2023, when smoke from wildfires from some of the same regions lingered over the U.S. Midwest for days.

""We are again having a remarkable start to fire season here in Canada,"" Daniels says. ""Like the U.S., we've been struggling with these really mega fires that have huge consequences for our ecosystems and for our human communities ... we're all struggling with this, not just in Canada and the United States, but worldwide.""

John Smol is a biology professor at Queen's University in Ontario who studies long-term environmental change. He says most people think forest fires are sparked by carelessness, such as a discarded cigarette. Not true, he says. Most are sparked by lightning. ""To have a big forest fire … you need fuel, you need a spark, and you need fuel that'll burn. If it's hot, dry, and you didn't have summer rains — and you get a lightning strike — that's it,"" he says.

Even for the people not driven from their homes, the effects of these fires can be harmful. According to the EPA, exposure to high concentrations of wildfire smoke ""can cause persistent coughing, phlegm, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Even in healthy people, exposures to fine particles can potentially lead to transient reductions in lung function, and pulmonary inflammation.""

Fischer says unless people are paying close attention to the news, they might not know where the smoke is coming from. ""They have a hard time conceiving of wildfire smoke from Canada coming here. They might not take measures to protect their health,"" she said.

People in the U.S. shouldn't be too quick to criticize Canada when it comes to wildfires, Daniels says. She notes that the worst air quality conditions ever measured in Vancouver, where she lives and works, were in 2020 — and that was due to California wildfires that year.

Still, Daniels expresses sympathy to anyone in the U.S. who's being impacted. ""We're sorry about the smoke,"" she says.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1546x870+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F81%2F4d5a22d54444a0e8159a05783b33%2Fap25154587082900.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:56.484128

More than three-quarters of new gas pipeline capacity under development in the US would feed additional liquefied natural gas exports rather than supporting domestic energy needs, a new report concludes.

Greenhouse gas emissions tied to that new capacity would be far larger than the current climate pollution from all coal-fired power plants nationwide, according to the report, published Monday by the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis. CEEA is a recently formed think tank based in Arlington, Virginia, that focuses on energy and environmental policy.

“The money flowing to gas pipeline infrastructure is not slowing and is intended to push US gas production even higher from its current record levels,” Jeremy Symons, president of the CEEA and a former federal climate policy advisor, said in a written statement. “This buildout will extend our dependency on natural gas for decades to come, slowing the transition to cleaner, more affordable alternatives.”

Planned natural gas transmission pipelines would add 99 billion cubic feet per day of additional capacity, a figure just below the total volume of US natural gas production in 2024, according to the report. The 10 largest planned pipelines across the country—and 80 percent of total capacity of active pipeline projects—are intended to export gas overseas as LNG, based on the authors’ assessment of federal data and other public records.

The additional gas shipments would have significant implications for climate change. If all of the pipelines are built and run at full capacity, carbon dioxide emissions from burning this additional gas would be two and half times greater than the CO2 currently released from all US coal-fired power plants, the report found.

This doesn’t include emissions of methane, a climate super pollutant and the primary component of natural gas. Methane emissions occur at every step of the natural gas supply chain—from wellheads and pipelines to LNG vessels and end users—as the gas leaks or is intentionally vented.

Methane emissions from the additional pipelines would pack a climate punch nearly twice that of CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants over a 20-year period, according to the report.

The amount of gas leaks from the oil and gas sector will likely increase as the Trump administration rolls back the industry’s methane regulations, the report noted.

“We know from hundreds of thousands of aerial and satellite measurements that methane leaks from oil and gas production are far worse than we previously realized, which makes the climate footprint of natural gas as bad as coal in many regions of the country,” said Danny Richter, a senior fellow with CEEA and the report’s lead author. “We had a clear path to clean up the methane problem, including the methane emissions reduction program enacted by Congress in 2022 as well as EPA regulations for the oil and gas industry. But that pathway has been shut down by the current administration.”

A fee on excessive methane emissions from oil and gas producers implemented under the Biden administration was rescinded by the Trump administration on May 12.

“It is clear from the beginning of this ‘report’ that it was created with the outcome already determined and no desire to provide facts,” an EPA spokesperson told Inside Climate News. “US methane emissions have been falling for decades thanks to American innovation, not heavy-handed government regulations, while domestic production of oil and gas has exponentially increased. According to EPA, methane emissions in the United States decreased by 19% between 1990 and 2022.”

Measurements in the field have repeatedly shown that reported methane emissions far understate actual releases.

The American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, did not respond to a request for comment.

The report is based on US Department of Energy data on 104 pipeline projects currently under development. It is unclear whether all of the planned pipelines will be built. Fifty-four of the projects, slightly more than half of all pipelines under development, have either not yet been approved or are on hold.

This includes one of the largest proposed pipelines, the $45 billion Alaska Nikiski LNG project. The pipe, which proponents have sought for decades, would transport gas 805 miles from Alaska’s North Slope to an LNG export terminal in southern Alaska. Completing the proposed export terminal, a retrofit of an existing import terminal, is included in the project’s projected cost.

The developer, the Alaska Gasline Development Corp, has applied for permits for the pipeline, many of which were approved during the last Trump administration, but still requires more.

President Donald Trump has directed agencies to speed up permitting and roll back environmental protections. He touted the Alaska Nikiski LNG project in an address to Congress earlier this year as “truly spectacular” and said “the permitting is gotten.”

Arvind Ravikumar, co-director of the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, cautioned that the report included figures for carbon dioxide emissions of gas burned by end users in other countries that import the LNG. “The way international carbon accounting works in this space is that you count only those emissions that happen within your national border,” Ravikumar said.

However, David Lyon, a senior methane scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, said including emissions from burning the gas, wherever it occurs, made sense. “Climate change is global,” Lyon said. “If we are just exporting our emissions to other countries, that’s still going to cause climate change and have impact.”

However, Lyon noted that in some cases, building gas pipelines could actually help reduce emissions. For example, in the Permian basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico—the largest oil and gas producing region in the country—gas is often flared, or vented, due to a lack of sufficient pipeline capacity.

In such cases, additional pipelines could help reduce flaring and its associated emissions. But it would be better to avoid drilling new wells in areas that lack sufficient pipeline capacity in the first place, Lyon added.

In comparing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the planned pipelines to those of coal-power plants, the report only compares CO2 emissions between the two fuel sources. Elsewhere, the report discusses methane emissions from the gas supply chain, but does not consider methane emissions from coal mines that feed coal-fired power plants. A recent peer-reviewed study comparing the greenhouse gas emissions of LNG and coal found methane emissions from coal mines were relatively modest compared to coal’s CO2 emissions.

In addition to permitting issues, economic forces could also limit the number of pipeline projects that get built in the coming years, or the extent to which completed pipelines operate at full capacity. China, the world’s largest importer of LNG, stopped taking US gas entirely in March in response to US tariffs on Chinese goods.

Symons said the ongoing pipeline buildout could commit the US to significantly larger LNG exports for decades to come. “This locks in more fossil fuel dependency that future presidents won’t be able to make go away,” he said. “Policies like tax incentives come and go, but pipelines are forever.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250604-lng.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:16.034388

Drastically reducing EPA’s funding undermines not only the mandate to provide clean air and clean water but also the government’s ability to respond rapidly and effectively when disaster strikes.
The proposed budget would slash $2.46 billion from the clean water and drinking water state revolving funds, stalling long-overdue repairs of pipes in schools, homes, and hospitals.
Drastic cuts to the Office of Research and Development would undermine the science that guides environmental health policy.
We urge Congress to reject the proposed FY2026 budget cuts and restore full funding to EPA.","Congress created the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with a clear and unambiguous mandate: to protect public health and the environment. For over five decades, under both Republican and Democratic leadership, that mission has been reinforced through bipartisan legislation to clean up hazardous waste, improve air and water quality, and assist states, territories, and tribal nations in safeguarding their communities. Congress also provided the EPA with the funding, never excessive but historically sufficient, to fulfill those legal responsibilities.

Today, that funding is under threat. The proposed 55% cut to EPA’s budget would reduce the agency’s capacity to its lowest level since its founding in 1970, at a time when environmental emergencies are becoming more frequent and more severe. From the catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles, to the recent deadly tornadoes in Kentucky and Oklahoma, to hurricanes like Helene that ravaged the East Coast, communities across the country rely on EPA’s expertise in emergency response, air and water monitoring, hazardous materials management, and environmental recovery. Drastically reducing EPA’s funding undermines not only the mandate to provide clean air and clean water but also the government’s ability to respond rapidly and effectively when disaster strikes.

Here in Region 2, which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and eight federally recognized tribal nations, EPA’s work has been central to health, safety, and environmental progress. EPA has helped clean up toxic Superfund sites like the Hudson River and the Raritan River, restored safe drinking water access in cities like Newark and San Juan, and supported air quality improvements that have reduced asthma rates and premature deaths. These aren’t abstractions; they are measurable public health and environmental victories.

But, they depend on federal funding and expertise. The proposed budget would slash $2.46 billion from the clean water and drinking water state revolving funds, stalling long-overdue repairs of pipes in schools, homes, and hospitals. Drastic cuts to the Office of Research and Development would undermine the science that guides environmental health policy. Eliminating the Environmental Justice and Community Outreach program would turn a blind eye to communities long overburdened by pollution.

Some argue that states should simply take on more of this responsibility. But, EPA was never designed to replace the states; it was built to support them. EPA provides technical assistance, enforcement backing, and funding for state and territory-run air and water programs. Pulling federal support out from under states and territories won’t streamline regulation. It will leave communities with weaker protections, inconsistent enforcement, and fewer avenues for progress and accountability.

President Trump’s recent claim that pollution has “zero impact” reflects a deep misunderstanding of both science and governance. Pollution has real, well-documented effects on human health, from cancer and developmental disorders to respiratory illness and premature death. EPA exists because Congress recognized that the consequences of pollution cross state lines and demand a national response.

Congress now faces a critical decision. Will it honor its own environmental laws by funding the agency charged with enforcing them? Or will it impose cuts that prevent EPA from doing what it was created to do?

We urge Congress to reject the proposed FY2026 budget cuts and restore full funding to EPA. Environmental protection isn’t partisan; it’s a matter of law, of science, and of basic public duty. Undermining the EPA won’t eliminate the costs of pollution. It will simply shift those costs to states and local communities through higher health care bills, degraded ecosystems, and long-term harm to our children’s futures.

Congress set the mission. It must now stand up and continue to provide the means to fulfill it.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/06/EPA-Environmental-Protection-Agency.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:27:15.760303

The fundamental challenge with NEPA litigation is that plaintiffs can broadly accuse permitting agencies of failing to have adequately considered some environmental impact associated with a project. It’s almost impossible for an agency to recognize every potential environmental impact of a major infrastructure project, and the EIS at the center of the SCOTUS case was over 3,600 pages long. But agencies try to be as broad as possible, and project opponents can use NEPA litigation to further move the goalposts. SCOTUS is essentially putting the kibosh on this by clarifying that the law only requires adequate evaluation, not exhaustive.

The SCOTUS ruling makes a couple key points, the first of which is that EISs need only focus on the direct environmental impacts of the proposed project. Agencies don’t need to consider how a project might affect someone else’s decision to build or not build something else. This is big, because major infrastructure projects have what we nerds call “incidental environmental impacts,” the indirect effects—positive or negative—of a project, which are extremely difficult to credibly evaluate. For example, while building a bridge directly impacts water quality and animal life in and around the waters, it also affects what gets built around the bridge, which affects further construction, and so on. Importantly, however, SCOTUS says it’s not the role of agencies (or courts) to speculate on environmental effects from subsequent projects.

At R Street, we’ve argued that the evaluation of incidental environmental impacts is outside the scope of NEPA, beyond the expertise of permitting agencies, and creates unnecessary delays without producing any discernable environmental benefit. The SCOTUS ruling largely follows these lines, so we’ll assume the justices are avid readers of R Street’s permitting work.

The second key point from the SCOTUS decision is that when NEPA permits are litigated, the immediate reaction of the courts should not be to vacate the decision—that is, if the courts find a fault in an EIS, it doesn’t mean the permit should be revoked until new documentation is prepared. This is particularly important because evidence indicates that litigation rarely has any substantive effect on environmental reviews.

SCOTUS is now saying these permits should only be withdrawn when there is a good reason to suspect that additional EIS documentation would have changed the agency’s decision to issue the permit. This substantially raises the bar for litigants that seek to delay or prevent construction, since any permitting deficiency they claim to occur will need to have been substantial enough that it would materially affect a project’s compliance with environmental law.

Overall, the SCOTUS ruling is good news from a permitting policy perspective: Agencies now have clearer guardrails on what they must evaluate, and the SCOTUS decision should make it tougher for permits to be needlessly delayed—so is the permitting policy issue solved?

Unfortunately, not quite. While I expect the SCOTUS decision to benefit infrastructure development timelines, the core issue of NEPA’s vagueness remains. Only Congress itself can correct that, since only they have the authority to narrow the scope of NEPA—even if SCOTUS has narrowed how courts ought to respond to NEPA-related cases. There is also a question of policy: How will current or future administrations promulgate their permitting decisions, and what will they consider adequate compliance with NEPA absent clarification from Congress?

In practice, the main effect of the SCOTUS ruling will be that litigants challenging NEPA decisions must clear a higher bar when challenging projects, while defendants who want to sustain a permit’s eligibility have a clear-cut defense that courts should not needlessly delay project construction. But much of this procedure still rests with the discretion of the permitting agency, which is why there is still a need for Congress to better define such functions.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AdobeStock_114815662-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 08:27:18.915193
,American Energy,2025-06-06 10:01:29+00:00,Nebraska Examiner,Nebraska needs a nuclear energy strategy,"Bruce Bostelman, Julie Masters, Heath Mello, Gregory Wees",,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/06/06/nebraska-needs-a-nuclear-energy-strategy/,"However, even as multiple power sources failed, one remained steadfast — nuclear energy.
To avoid future blackouts and maintain affordable, resilient, firm and reliable power, Nebraska needs nuclear energy.
Nuclear energy, which currently generates 17% of Nebraska’s power, brings unique strengths.
The cost of new nuclear energy is within a penny per kilowatt-hour of other forms of new energy sources, including natural gas, wind and solar.
It has proven a huge help in incentivizing the development of nuclear power at a time when NPPD is exploring options.","In February 2021, thousands of Nebraskans found themselves in the dark of rolling blackouts. A brutal polar vortex froze wind turbines, strained natural gas supplies and exposed serious weaknesses in our energy grid. However, even as multiple power sources failed, one remained steadfast — nuclear energy.

That moment was a wake-up call. We can no longer afford to treat energy policy as a matter of convenience or short-term cost. To avoid future blackouts and maintain affordable, resilient, firm and reliable power, Nebraska needs nuclear energy. Wind and solar are intermittent. Natural gas is a vital bridge fuel, but it is vulnerable to supply shocks in extreme weather. This is about building a reliable and resilient energy source that can deliver for Nebraska families, farmers and businesses when it counts.

Nuclear energy, which currently generates 17% of Nebraska’s power, brings unique strengths. It provides carbon-free baseload power that runs around the clock regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining. During the 2021 deep freeze, Nebraska’s lone nuclear plant kept running at full strength while other sources faltered. The United Nations 2021 report, “Life Cycle Assessment of Electricity Generation Options,” shows that nuclear has the lowest overall impacts on human health and the environment by any measure and from any perspective.

The cost of new nuclear energy is within a penny per kilowatt-hour of other forms of new energy sources, including natural gas, wind and solar. Is that one cent too much to have a resilient, reliable power source for Nebraska?

We’ve seen what happens when nuclear gets overlooked. Omaha Public Power District’s Fort Calhoun plant and Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper Nuclear Station accounted for about a quarter of Nebraska’s net generation capabilities before Fort Calhoun was shut down in 2016. The shut down was nearly two decades ahead of schedule, a casualty of market conditions that failed to account for long-term reliability and energy needs. Hundreds of skilled jobs were lost. Our energy safety net shrank.

And just a few years later, that decision looked shortsighted as the grid buckled under pressure. To avoid repeating that mistake, policymakers should ensure that energy markets properly value reliability and resilience.

As 26 House Republicans made clear in a late April letter to congressional leadership, protecting the federal nuclear production tax credit (PTC) is one way to do so. It has proven a huge help in incentivizing the development of nuclear power at a time when NPPD is exploring options. For Nebraska, the credit helps create and protect hundreds of high-paying, skilled jobs, generating local tax revenue and sustaining a stable source of affordable power.

Another step Congress could take is expanding investment incentives for next-generation technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs). These compact, scalable reactors can serve Nebraska’s rural areas and industrial parks where large traditional plants aren’t practical, offering flexibility and grid stability. Policies like the Advanced Nuclear Production Credit and bipartisan permitting reform proposals can help accelerate local deployment.

U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., has advocated for nuclear’s role in America’s energy future on the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee, where it helps Nebraska to have a voice in ensuring that our state’s long-term energy interests remain protected.

Nebraska’s energy future isn’t just about keeping the lights on. It’s about protecting lives during extreme weather, powering our farms and factories and anchoring high-skilled jobs in our communities. If we want to avoid another round of blackouts, we should encourage policies that keep every reliable tool in the toolbox — including nuclear.

All Maryland ratepayers are already due to receive a rebate on their utility bills next month.","Discussions about rising energy costs may have dominated this past Maryland General Assembly session. But even higher bills are on the way.

Beginning June 1, elevated rates took effect for utilities across Maryland, from Baltimore Gas & Electric to Delmarva Power and Pepco. The reasons go back to economics class: low supply and high demand. But who is to blame depends on who you ask.

Ratepayer advocates are quick to point the finger at PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in a 13-state region, including Maryland, for policies that have driven rates higher. They argue it has been slow to bring renewable energy projects online, constraining the supply, and it failed to account for skyrocketing demand from data centers.

PJM says it’s been warning of the impending supply crunch since “early 2023,” and that a combination of other market forces are at play — including climate change policy shuttering coal plants.

Years of market changes and policy choices have landed Maryland ratepayers in their current predicament, said Laurel Peltier, chair of the Maryland Energy Advocates Coalition, which focuses on low-income utility ratepayers.

“It’s like a teapot that’s been simmering — and it’s been simmering for a decade,” said Peltier, who is also an AARP Maryland utility advocate.

How much are my bills going up this time?

The exact amount of the increase differs depending on where you live. A report from the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, released last August, estimated that Delmarva Power households could see a $4 monthly increase, Pepco and SMECO customers could see a $14 increase and Potomac Edison customers could see an $18 increase.

BGE customers would fare the worst, with a $21 jump. But BGE ratepayers got some welcome news last week, when Maryland’s utility regulator, the Public Service Commission, ordered the utility company to spread out the increase, dulling the impact this summer, when bills will already be soaring due to higher energy use, and sharpening the impact in the fall, when bills are typically lower.

As a result, the increase will be $10 to $15 less than expected on customer’s bills from June through August. But from September through November, bills will be $10 to $15 higher than expected, according to Kathy Fueston, a spokesperson for the PSC.

But ultimately, BGE customers will pay the same total amount.

What’s the reason for this latest increase?

The story starts with PJM Interconnection, which runs an annual auction called the capacity market auction, which essentially ensures there is sufficient power during peak times.

Last year’s auction, which covers 2025, cleared at a record high price — an 800% increase compared to the year before, costing ratepayers a total of $14.7 billion in capacity costs, compared to $2.2 billion previously.

PJM blames the shutdown of costly coal and oil plants, and energy demands from data centers and the electrification of homes and cars, among other factors.

“These higher prices are the result of a loss in electricity supply caused primarily by decarbonization policies that have led to an uptick in generator retirements, coupled with an unprecedented spike in electricity demand due largely to the advancement of data centers to power artificial intelligence, the electrification of vehicles and heating systems, and the onshoring of U.S. manufacturing,” wrote Jeffrey Shields, a spokesman for PJM, in a statement.

But Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp, who represents Maryland ratepayers, argued that PJM is “not being straightforward.”

He argues that power-hungry data centers, largely in Virginia, are the primary reason for the increase in demand. If it weren’t for those facilities, the demand, or load, on the PJM grid might not be increasing at all — even with the rise of EVs and electric heat pumps.

“Those load forecast changes are really driven by data-center growth,” Lapp said. “There has been very little growth in demand for quite some time, because of efficiency technologies. More efficient light bulbs, that sort of thing.”

It’s true that Maryland fossil fuel power plants are retiring, and this is impacting energy markets, Lapp said. But Lapp lays some of this blame at PJM’s feet.

Faced with a capacity shortage, PJM is requiring two fossil fuel power plants that were going to be retire this year, Talen Energy’s Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, to keep operating through 2029. It will cost ratepayers about $145 million annually to keep coal-fired Brandon Shores running and $35 million annually for oil-powered Wagner.

But when it held its annual capacity auction in 2024, PJM did not include the output from the two Talen Energy plants in the mix. That caused prices for 2025 to go up: The Office of People’s Counsel estimates that costs rose $5 billion in the auction because of the exclusion of the two plants.

Since last summer’s auction, PJM has changed its policy, with the approval of federal regulators. The electricity generated from “reliability must-run agreements,” like the ones for Brandon Shores and H.A. Wagner, must be included in the auction.

“Everyone knows that that’s not fair, to require customers to pay twice, and yet, that’s exactly what’s going to happen starting June 1,” Lapp said.

Emily Scarr, a senior adviser at Maryland PIRG who focuses on energy issues, said PJM also should have predicted that coal plants would retire, and it is responsible for planning adjustments to the electric grid accordingly.

“They say it’s a supply and demand imbalance. But what they don’t explain is: ‘Oh, we’re actually the ones who are in charge of controlling supply and demand, and we haven’t done our job,’” Scarr said.

Peltier, the low-income ratepayer advocate, worries about the customers who have been swept up in the recent price hikes, and are now behind on their bills. For instance, BGE recently reported that residential customers were a total of $171 million in arrears, compared to $97 million just last June. In a statement, BGE spokesman Nick Alexopulos cited cold temperatures in January and February 2025, which forced customers to use more energy to heat their homes.

But Republicans in the General Assembly say state policymakers are to blame for the supply shortage, and the resulting rate increases, which they attribute to the state’s policies to reduce carbon emissions. They note that all the state’s coal plants have announced plans to shut down in the years ahead.

“Maryland’s soaring electric rates are not a mystery — they’re a direct result of bad policy choices made by Democratic leaders,” wrote Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready in a recent statement.

“Their obsession with ‘green goals’ has come at the expense of energy reliability and affordability,” Ready wrote. “Now, plants they forced offline are still running because the grid can’t survive without them, and ratepayers are stuck paying hundreds of millions for that mistake.”

Lapp disagrees that Maryland policies played a role. Perhaps some of the blame could be chalked up to federal Clean Air Act policy requiring changes to how plants are operated, he said, but largely, it’s economics.

“Gas is a lot cheaper. Renewables don’t require fuel,” Lapp said. “So, there’s a reason why most of the PJM queue is wind and solar and battery.”

But a backlog in PJM’s queue for new power generation to come online has also influenced the supply curve, Scarr said.

“They’ve created this whole problem themselves, and if they just let clean energy connect, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” Scarr said.

A recent report predicted that Maryland ratepayers could save an average of $546 a year on their electric bills from 2025 to 2040 if PJM implements a laundry list of reforms to clear the bottleneck.

For its part, PJM argues that it is already making a number of reforms to the queue, including a new initiative to expedite “shovel-ready” projects.

In early May, PJM released the list of 51 projects it will expedite through the program, including 22 in Virginia and two in Maryland: a battery storage project in Harford County and an upgrade at a natural gas plant in Prince George’s County.

What happens next?

Lapp and the PSC, backed by 87 Maryland lawmakers, have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to provide relief from rising rates, by overturning the $5 billion worth of auction costs associated with the Talen Energy deal.

“You just can recalculate the results of the auction, by counting the [Talen Energy] units,” Lapp said. “They could do that quickly.”

A FERC spokesperson declined to comment on when the commission might issue a ruling.

Lapp’s office asked FERC for expedited consideration before June 1. With a decision now coming later than that, Lapp said it’s possible that consumers could receive a future credit on their bills, if FERC rules in his favor.

All Maryland ratepayers are already due to receive a rebate on their utility bills next month. The rebate is estimated at $40 per household, though it depends on a customer’s electricity usage. A second payment is scheduled for January.

It comes from the Maryland General Assembly, which passed an energy reform package just before it adjourned in April. The total sum, about $200 million, is coming from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund, which is fueled by electricity generators, who submit “alternative compliance payments” when they do not purchase the required amount of renewable energy credits to comply with state law.

But the main thrust of the General Assembly’s energy reforms was increasing power generation and energy storage in the state, by creating streamlined permitting processes for both at the Maryland Public Service Commission. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have highlighted the fact that the state imports more power from other states than it generates within its borders.

Lapp questions whether increasing power generation in the state is needed, especially given that improvements are underway to transmission infrastructure, including to accommodate the eventual closure of Brandon Shores and Wagner.

“The fact that Maryland is a net importer, that’s nothing new, and it’s nothing to be alarmed about, especially because the amount that Maryland imports does not reflect a limitation on Maryland’s ability to generate energy,” he said. “It’s economics.”

He also wonders whether the legislature’s streamlined permitting process at the PSC is a big enough carrot to actually spur significant new power generators to set up shop in Maryland.

“Private companies, they already are able to build plants in Maryland, if the economics work out. So the question there is, does a little easier siting process — Does that change the economics?” Lapp said. “I’m not sure that it will.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/transmission-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:22.206402

Since January 2025, enforcement and implementation of NEPA has been subject to attacks from all three branches of government:

Trump Administration

The Trump administration has cut federal employees and funding intended for expedited yet meaningful NEPA reviews.

On May 23, the administration rubberstamped a mine in just 11 days despite similar projects with complex proposals typically taking two years to meaningfully review, and

On May 28, Trump appointed the architect of the provisions that severely limited the timing of NEPA reviews in the Fiscal Responsibility Act to head the Permitting Council (formerly the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council).

,American Energy,2025-06-06 09:05:34+00:00,Inside Climate News,Trump Hastens 'Drumbeat' of Deferred Coal Plant Retirements - Inside Climate News,"Marianne Lavelle, Carrie Klein, Dana Drugmand",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06062025/trump-administration-defers-coal-plant-retirements/,"Nevertheless, company officials exulted because a surge of U.S. coal power plant shutdowns expected in 2025 was slowing.
Like most coal plants, Campbell was expensive to run.
That’s more heat-trapping emissions than any of the other 12 coal plants that had been slated to shut down this year.
Nevertheless, Campbell is now the second coal plant in the MISO region that will not be closing down as planned in 2025.
But the three deferred coal plant retirements put at risk nearly one third of the 47 million metric tons of carbon emissions cuts that were expected from the sector due to retirements this year.","The newest player on the U.S. coal scene, Core Natural Resources, had good news and bad news for investors when it announced its results for the start of the year.

The company missed Wall Street expectations with its net loss of $69 million, which it attributed mostly to birth pains: the costs of the January merger of Arch Resources and CONSOL Energy that created Core. The combined company has a solid position as the No. 2 coal producer in the United States, but that’s in a market where production has been cut in half in just a decade.

Nevertheless, company officials exulted because a surge of U.S. coal power plant shutdowns expected in 2025 was slowing. “Just since last fall, the delayed retirements have continued to build,” said Deck Slone, senior vice president for public policy, during the company’s May 8 earnings call. “Hopefully that drumbeat will continue.”

Last week, President Donald Trump’s administration grabbed the drumstick and picked up the pace. With an unusual emergency order, Energy Secretary Chris Wright blocked the retirement of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell Complex in Michigan, saying it was necessary to ensure that the lights stayed on for electricity customers in the Midwest this summer.

“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies [to] threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families,” Wright said.

There is little doubt that U.S. electricity demand is growing after decades of staying flat, mostly due to industrial and data center needs. But there’s a great deal of debate about whether there’s a crisis; although Trump declared an energy “emergency” on his first day in office, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that electricity prices were lower and less volatile in 2024 than in the previous few years.

The growth of lower cost renewable energy and record-breaking deployment of battery storage across the system helped meet the new burden. And in a report last year, President Joe Biden’s administration laid out a roadmap for keeping up with demand while driving down carbon emissions, through investments in advanced grid technology and transmission and greater deployment of storage, distributed solar, wind, geothermal and advanced nuclear. Academics have proposed similar plans.

The Trump administration, which is pressing Congress to end Biden-era spending on an energy transition, instead favors the coal industry’s argument that the solution to growing electricity demand is already at hand—keeping old plants open. Electric grid operators have bolstered that view, calling it “one of the easiest approaches” to address the strain the system may face in the high-demand summer months, particularly in the Midwest.

Consumer and environmental advocates argue that the Trump administration’s intervention in the marketplace to keep Campbell and other fossil fuel plants open will be costly—for consumers, the environment and health.

According to a new study, costs have been rising significantly at the Campbell plant, and it happens to have the largest carbon footprint of the 13 coal plants that had been scheduled to close in 2025. Its smokestacks are among the top 10 industrial sources of hazardous pollution in Michigan, according to the federal Toxics Release Inventory, spewing mercury, lead, ammonia and other compounds. Advocates have argued its closure would save nearby residents millions of dollars in health care costs.

Cutting Carbon, Cutting Costs

The Department of Energy did not immediately respond when asked about the criticisms of the order keeping Campbell open. The federal government has issued emergency orders under the Federal Power Act about 25 times in the past 25 years to keep power plants running. But for the most part, this has occurred because of hurricanes, heat waves and overt shortages, like the California crisis of 2000.

The Campbell plant directive was one of four emergency orders that the Trump administration issued in just the past month, all of them pushing aside environmental and public health concerns in favor of getting and keeping power online.

In two May 16 orders, Wright directed Puerto Rico’s public power authority to cut back vegetation and override environmental laws to get old fuel oil generation stations running. On May 30, Wright blocked the planned retirement of the aging Eddystone oil and natural gas plant in Pennsylvania, arguing it was needed to shore up the grid against potential summer outages.

It was essentially the same argument Wright made on May 23, when he directed Campbell’s owner, Consumers Energy, to keep its 63-year-old plant in operation for 90 days—the maximum period allowed under the law (although such orders can be renewed).

The planned May 31 shutdown of Campbell, on the east shore of Lake Michigan, had been part of Consumers’ much-vaunted transition to cleaner energy. The company was already moving its workers at Campbell to other facilities and had planned an open house for local communities in June to mark the Campbell closure, which was set to happen years ahead of schedule.

That’s not to say everyone was happy. At least one local township council passed a resolution urging the utility to keep the plant open, and a group of Republican state legislators from Michigan sent a letter to Trump administration officials asserting that the plant had “years of useful life yet.”

But Consumers’ move to shutter Campbell wasn’t only about climate. Like most coal plants, Campbell was expensive to run. Consumers Energy had projected the retirement would save ratepayers $600 million over the next 20 years. The think tank Energy Innovation has calculated that like 95 percent of the U.S. coal fleet, Campbell could be replaced with local wind or solar at an immediate savings to consumers. In a new analysis released Wednesday, Energy Innovation reported that costs per megawatt-hour of operations at Campbell increased 21 percent, faster than inflation, since the group’s last detailed look at the facility in 2021.

“This is a plant that was preparing for retirement,” said Michelle Solomon, a manager in Energy Innovation’s electricity program. “I imagine they’ve used up all of their coal stored on site that they bought with long-term contracts. There’s a question of, have they been doing the maintenance required to keep this plant operational over the summer, and if not, is it even going to be a reliable plant, whether or not it’s needed?”

Brian Wheeler, a spokesman for Consumers Energy, says that the company has arranged for new shipments of coal to keep the plant operating.

“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the Department of Energy order,” he said. “We are pausing decommissioning activities at the Campbell plant and will operate it in compliance with the order, working in conjunction with MISO,” the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the organization that manages the regional grid.

“The company is actively working to determine appropriate cost recovery consistent with applicable law and the federal order,” Wheeler added. Typically, such costs are recovered through charges on customer bills, after approval of state regulators.

The Campbell plant’s retirement was viewed by many environmentalists as another victory in a long campaign to get the nation to transition away from the most carbon-polluting electricity fuel. About 780 coal power units in the United States have shut down since 2000, and coal’s share of the nation’s electricity mix has fallen from 50 percent to 16 percent. Even so, coal’s carbon intensity is such that it still generated more than half of the power sector’s carbon emissions, as of 2022.

The Campbell plant released 6.6 million metric tons of carbon in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available. That’s more heat-trapping emissions than any of the other 12 coal plants that had been slated to shut down this year. An analysis by the Clean Air Task Force calculated that other pollutants from the Campbell complex, including harmful microscopic particles called particulate matter, were high enough to be associated with 44 premature deaths and 455 asthma attacks yearly.

“There is no basis for the DOE’s order whatsoever,” said Greg Wannier, a senior attorney at the Sierra Club, which has led a campaign to get the nation “Beyond Coal.” He pointed to an assessment of the Midwestern region’s electricity resources by MISO, completed just two days before Wright’s order, that concluded that the system’s capacity would be sufficient this summer if operations were normal.

But MISO and the other grid operators have been among the strongest voices calling for the old plants to stay open.

Grid Operators Urge Retirement Slowdown

In issuing his order to keep the Campbell plant open, Wright cited the summer assessment of the national grid oversight body, the North American Electric Reliability Corp., which found the entire middle of the country was at “elevated risk” for power outages at times of high demand.

MISO’s own senior vice president for planning and operation, Jennifer Curran, testified before Congress in March that the system was challenged by increasing demand at the same time that more intermittent resources like wind and solar were coming onto the grid. Even while MISO has maintained that its capacity resources are sufficient in the short term, she said more generation was “desperately needed to meet resource adequacy and reliability risks.”

“One of the easiest approaches,” she said, “is to slow down the retirement of existing resources.”

In emailed responses to questions from Inside Climate News, MISO spokesman Brandon Morris said the grid operator is working with Consumers Energy to comply with Wright’s order. To address reliability issues, he said, “delaying retirements or having a similar resource to replace it is still MISO’s position.” That doesn’t mean the grid operator is favoring coal, he said.

“MISO operates a fuel- and resource-agnostic market, calling on the most cost-efficient resources first to meet demand,” Morris wrote.

Nevertheless, Campbell is now the second coal plant in the MISO region that will not be closing down as planned in 2025. Vistra announced in December it would delay retirement of its Baldwin coal plant in Illinois “amid widespread concern over reliability in the MISO market.”

Meanwhile, the neighboring grid operator, PJM Interconnection, negotiated an agreement in January that keeps Talen Energy’s Brandon Shores coal plant in Maryland alive, a move protested by the state’s consumer advocate.

How often the Campbell, Baldwin and Brandon Shores plants run and how much coal they burn will depend on weather conditions and market prices as the grid operators work in real time to deploy generation to meet demand. But the three deferred coal plant retirements put at risk nearly one third of the 47 million metric tons of carbon emissions cuts that were expected from the sector due to retirements this year.

John Moore, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the emergency orders to keep plants open were “wholly unnecessary,” noting that both MISO and PJM had studied the retirements at the time they were proposed and found no need to keep the plants online. Moore said some of the issues grid operators now face are of their own making, due to poor planning and in PJM’s case, a years-long backup of clean energy projects that are queued up, waiting approval to be connected to the grid.

“To avoid actual grid emergencies in the future, the [grid operators] need to step up their resource adequacy game, especially PJM, whose planning, interconnection, and markets have not kept pace with the energy transition,” Moore wrote in an email.

“Grid operators should be opposing these orders,” he said. “Unfortunately, their tacit or explicit acceptance signals that their resource adequacy processes aren’t working. They need to robustly plan within and between grid regions and break the unacceptable logjam in the enormous interconnection queues. Until they do, consumers and public health will suffer the consequences.”

Staying “In the Mix”

The coal industry sees deferred retirements in a different light. Before the start of this year, the nation’s second-largest coal mine, Core Natural Resources’ Black Thunder Mine in Wyoming, was facing the imminent loss of nearly 12 percent of its sales volume due to power plant retirements, according to data collected by the Energy Information Administration. Campbell was the largest buyer of five Black Thunder customer plants that had recently closed or were closing in 2025.

Core Natural Resources made the case for action directly with Trump administration officials, according to its first quarter lobbying disclosure. Although it didn’t mention specific power plants, the company reported advocating on “grid reliability issues” and “energy-related executive orders.”

Core did not immediately respond to a request for more details on its pleas to the Trump administration. In recent years, the coal industry has been spending roughly $4 million per year on lobbying, according to the watchdog group OpenSecrets. That’s a fraction of the $14 million to $24 million it spent 16 years ago to block President Barack Obama’s effort to get Congress to pass climate legislation. Nevertheless, the diminished dollars have gone a long way. Trump laid the groundwork for the Campbell order in his first-day declaration of an energy emergency and a slew of orders he issued on April 8 aimed specifically at keeping the coal industry alive.

“It’s nice to have an administration that recognizes the industry and the importance that it has on the U.S. economy and really what it means relative to power prices in the U.S.,” said Core Natural Resources CEO Paul Lang in the company’s earnings call last month. “They believe coal should be in the mix and should stay in the mix.”

Whether presidential power can beat the forces lined up against coal remains to be seen. This week, Core notified 200 mineworkers in West Virginia they’d be losing their jobs this summer due to “weaker than expected market conditions.”

“The change in gas demand is pretty large without the tax credits.","Energy policy analysts are in broad agreement about one consequence of major legislation that Republicans are currently pushing through Congress: It will raise energy prices for the average American household by hundreds of dollars, once all is said and done.

That’s because the legislation, which President Donald Trump has dubbed the Big Beautiful Bill, will repeal the vast majority of clean energy provisions contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which a Democrat-controlled Congress passed in 2022. That earlier law provided a wide array of financial incentives for the deployment of electricity sources like solar, wind, battery storage, and nuclear power, as well as support for consumers looking to buy zero- and low-emissions products like electric vehicles. Choking off support for those measures not only hobbles U.S. efforts to fight climate change — the IRA, if left intact, could single-handedly reduce the country’s carbon emissions by 40 percent — but it also means there are fewer new sources of energy for a country that has started to need more and more of it. And reduced supply coupled with increased demand means higher prices.

That’s the virtually unanimous conclusion of the academics and policy experts who have been trying to understand the likely effects of the rollback for the past few months, though each group of experts used different assumptions about the full extent of IRA repeal, given that the legislation is still currently being revised by the Senate. Part of the reason for this unanimity is that, once constructed, many newer energy sources like wind and solar don’t have substantial operating costs, compared to traditional power plants that must be continuously supplied with fuel.

“Clean electricity has zero generation cost,” said Robbie Orvis, a senior director for modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. “One of the dynamics is that less clean electricity gets built, and that makes power generation more expensive, because we’re relying more frequently on fossil fuels with higher generation costs.”

Orvis’ group calculated that those higher power generation costs from using coal or natural gas, along with other price increases stemming from IRA repeal, would result in household energy costs rising by more than $33 billion annually by 2035, compared to a scenario in which the IRA were left intact. That works out to roughly $250 more per year per household. Other analysts came to similar conclusions: The Rhodium Group, an independent policy analysis firm, estimates that average household costs could be as much as $290 higher per year by the same date. Princeton University’s ZERO Lab projects that energy costs could grow even higher: Their estimates show that, in a decade, annual household prices will be $270 to $415 higher under the GOP plan.

Energy Innovation’s analysis calculated the effects of repealing the IRA on energy bills and transportation costs across the nation. They found that, if the tax credits for clean energy are taken away, utilities will increasingly rely on natural gas and coal, which have higher generation costs. These costs would then be passed on to customers. Additionally, as electric utilities’ demand for natural gas increases, the cost of the fossil fuel in the market will also rise, further raising household energy bills.

“Gas suppliers can’t respond immediately to large changes in the demand for gas,” said Orvis. “The change in gas demand is pretty large without the tax credits. So you’re really increasing the reliance on gas, and therefore, gas demand and gas prices.”

On the transportation front, the legislation passed by the House of Representatives eliminates IRA tax credits for electric vehicles and undoes the nation’s latest tailpipe standards, which limit the amount of pollution that new vehicles are allowed to emit. The result is a greater reliance on gasoline than would happen under the status quo — and more demand for gasoline means higher prices at the pump, per Orvis’ modeling.

These price spikes — and the electricity spikes in particular — won’t be felt uniformly across the nation. One key factor is how utilities in a state are regulated. Many states have just one utility that both generates power and provides it to electricity customers. But in so-called deregulated markets such as Texas and Pennsylvania, electricity providers compete on an open market to sell their power.

The rules around how utilities calculate and pass on the costs of generating electricity vary significantly between these two models. In regulated markets with just one provider, the cost of generating electricity and getting it to homes is averaged out and passed on to customers. But the competitive nature of deregulated markets means that customers can see wild fluctuations in price. During peak winter and summer, when demand for power is high, prices can be double or triple normal rates. As a result, customers in deregulated markets see more variation in their bills — because those bills closely track changes in the marginal cost of electricity. If those costs rise in a dramatic and systematic way because IRA repeal leads to fewer sources of energy, customers in deregulated markets will feel the full force of it. Customers in regulated markets like much of the Southeast, on the other hand, will be somewhat cushioned from the increase, because their costs reflect the average of all generation and transmission costs incurred by their utility.

“That helps minimize the impact of repealing IRA tax credits — though it also runs the opposite way and helps reduce savings when market prices go down,” said Jesse Jenkins, an associate professor at Princeton University who led the modeling conducted by the ZERO Lab, in an email.

These rising costs will come on top of U.S. energy bills that are already ticking upward. Electricity prices have been steadily rising since 2020, and the federal Energy Information Administration recently forecasted that that trend is likely to continue through 2026. Prices have increased for a variety of reasons, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupting global oil and gas supply chains, extreme heat and other weather shocks, costly maintenance needed to protected the grid from wildfires, and the buildout of additional capacity to meet growing demand. U.S. electricity demand is beginning to rise for the first time in decades, thanks to the construction of new manufacturing facilities and data centers, which support operations like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, as well as the growing adoption of electric vehicles.

Orvis said that the IRA has been helping meet that demand and maintain the country’s competitive advantage with China, one of the Trump administration’s stated goals. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill would undermine that progress by reducing the amount of energy available for new manufacturing and AI development — and making the electricity that’s left more expensive for everyone.

“The ironic thing is that what’s in the bill, the net results of it will be completely contradictory to what the [Trump] administration’s stated policy priorities are and will cede a lot of the AI development and the manufacturing to China specifically,” said Orvis. “That’s the important macro context for everything that’s happening now — and some of the un-modelable implications in the long run.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2217850172.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:36.978014

This steady growth in clean energy spending reflects a shift away from fossil fuels, yet the agency points to underlying weaknesses in grid infrastructure and a lack of progress across developing economies.

Clean energy outpaces fossil fuels

The IEA report makes it clear: clean energy investment is set to double that of fossil fuels in 2025.

The US$2.2tn forecast includes renewables such as solar and wind, nuclear power, electricity grids, battery storage, energy efficiency measures, electrification and low-emissions fuels.

Fossil fuels will account for around US$1.1tn.

Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA, says: “Amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security coming through as a key driver of the growth in global investment this year to a record US$3.3tn as countries and companies seek to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks.

“The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”

While some investors delay new approvals due to market uncertainties, Fatih notes that existing projects are mostly unaffected.

The share of clean energy investment has steadily grown over five years, supported by climate targets, post-pandemic economic recovery and industrial policy.

Electric mobility is a major growth area. In markets like China, electric vehicles (EVs) are now price-competitive with petrol-powered alternatives.

Electrification of transport is seen as a key route to emissions reduction.

Around 70% of the global growth in clean energy investment has come from countries that rely heavily on fossil fuel imports — including China, India and European nations.

In the United States, the push is also strategic, as competition with China shapes policy around clean tech supply chains.

Electricity sector investment alone is expected to hit US$1.5tn in 2025, which is 50% more than what will be spent on all fossil fuel supply.

Frederic Godemel, EVP of Energy Management at Schneider Electric, says: “It’s encouraging to see growing global investment in the energy transition. We’re getting closer to the US$3.5tn annual capital needed between now and 2050 to achieve net zero, but there’s still more to be done.”

“We cannot let geopolitical uncertainty or economic headwinds derail our progress, after all the climate crisis doesn’t abide by our political or economic cycles.

“We must move beyond cautious optimism. With many clean energy projects still stalling, we need to double down on demand-side solutions, which are half of the solution to net zero.

""We have the technologies to decarbonise today, now it’s about scaling Electricity 4.0 – the combination of electric and digital – to drive immediate progress.”

Solar, nuclear and coal jostle for space

Power generation from low emissions sources is gaining traction.

Investment in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is projected at US$450bn in 2025, making it the top investment area globally.

Battery storage, critical for grid flexibility, will attract US$66bn.

China continues to expand its solar influence.

Pakistan alone imported 19 GW of solar modules in 2024, nearly half its entire grid-connected capacity.

Nuclear power is also on the rise, with spending set to exceed $70bn in 2025 — up 50% over five years.

Small modular reactors are drawing interest, and new gas-fired capacity is being added in the US and Middle East.

However, the fossil fuel sector presents a mixed picture.

While upstream oil investment is expected to fall by 6% — the largest drop since 2016 — coal activity is rising.

China and India approved nearly 115 GW of new coal power in 2024, the highest since 2015.

In contrast, no new coal-fired steam turbines were ordered in advanced economies, a first.

Fatih recalls: “When the IEA published the first ever edition of its World Energy Investment report nearly ten years ago, it showed energy investment in China in 2015 just edging ahead of that of the United States.

""Today, China is by far the largest energy investor globally, spending twice as much on energy as the European Union and almost as much as the EU and United States combined.”

Grids and global inequalities hinder progress

While clean generation grows, electricity grids are lagging. Current annual grid investment sits at US$400bn — less than half of what is spent on generation assets.

This creates a bottleneck for renewables.

The IEA points to lengthy permitting, shortages in key components like transformers and cables, and financially weak utilities in developing nations.

Low-emissions fuel investment is projected to exceed US$30bn in 2025, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) could see a tenfold increase by 2027 if planned projects go ahead.

Hydrogen investment is expected to reach US$8bn in 2025, nearly double the previous year, although some schemes have been cancelled or delayed.

China, Europe and the US lead global clean energy investment.

Distributed under the Industrial Demonstrations Program at the Energy Department’s now-embattled Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the funding promised to bolster the manufacturing sector with a major investment in technologies meant to give American companies an edge in global markets.
In addition, federal researchers expected to gather information through the projects that could be used broadly throughout U.S. industry to improve output and bring down energy costs.
Absent that, Mulholland said, U.S. companies risk falling behind competitors who benefit from lower-cost labor and easily accessible components from nearby industrial clusters, like those in Vietnam, China, or Germany.
They need a government incentive to make the technological changes they were trying to do,” the former OCED official said.","Last week, the Trump administration canceled $3.7 billion in federal funding for two dozen green industrial projects that the Department of Energy claimed ​“failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable, and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

More than a quarter of that spending would have gone to 11 projects designed to cut planet-warming pollution from generating the heat used in factories — one of the trickiest decarbonization challenges to solve.

“This is a really, really significant setback for clean heat in the U.S.,” said Brad Townsend, the vice president of policy and outreach at the think tank Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES).

The wide-ranging projects included installing industrial heat pumps at up to 10 plants where giant Kraft Heinz Co. produces its foodstuffs, building an electric boiler at one of plumbing-fixture manufacturer Kohler Co.’s Arizona factories, and adding a heat battery to Eastman Chemical Co.’s facility in Texas.

Distributed under the Industrial Demonstrations Program at the Energy Department’s now-embattled Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the funding promised to bolster the manufacturing sector with a major investment in technologies meant to give American companies an edge in global markets.

Groups such as C2ES and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy estimated the federal support would generate hundreds of thousands of jobs in both direct construction and operations and indirect hiring at real estate firms, restaurants, and retailers near the industrial sites. In addition, federal researchers expected to gather information through the projects that could be used broadly throughout U.S. industry to improve output and bring down energy costs.

“The data and lessons learned in de-risking this technology would then translate into follow-up investment in the private sector,” said Marcela Mulholland, a former official at the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations who now leads advocacy at the nonpartisan climate group Clean Tomorrow.

“If you were in a technology area covered by OCED, you needed public investment to scale,” she added. ​“Something in the proverbial ​‘valley of death’ made it difficult for the private sector to advance the technology on its own.”

With the funding, U.S. industry had the chance to develop new approaches that could produce greener — and cheaper — materials, giving American manufacturers an edge over Asian or European rivals as corporate and national carbon-cutting policies put a premium on products made with less emissions. Absent that, Mulholland said, U.S. companies risk falling behind competitors who benefit from lower-cost labor and easily accessible components from nearby industrial clusters, like those in Vietnam, China, or Germany.

“It’s hard to overstate the scale of the loss,” Mulholland said.

Already, a handful of companies are considering shifting production overseas in the wake of the funding cuts, according to two sources who have directly spoken to leaders of firms that lost federal funding. The sources were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the plans.

“When these projects don’t go forward, we’re going to see challenges for the companies from a profitability perspective and from a global competitiveness perspective,” said Richard Hart, industry director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. ​“What happens then is other countries and other companies will step in to meet those demands.”

In the long term, he added, the cuts erode the value of a federal contract.

“When the U.S. government signs a contract with you, it’s reasonable to assume that that contract is gold and that you can use that contract to make plans as a company that … you can explain to investors, to employees, and to the full group of stakeholders around your facilities,” Hart said. ​“The loss of trust that comes from canceling those contracts is likely to be pervasive. That’s very sad.”

Part of the problem is that the contracts were cost-share agreements, which traditionally give the federal government the right to exit the deals without any legal penalty. In theory, OCED could have structured the federal contracts differently through a category known plainly as ​“Other Transactions.” The Department of Commerce, for example, issued money from the CHIPS and Science Act to semiconductor companies through such ​“other transactions” that lack the same off-ramps for the government.

But the Commerce Department did so under the advice of a legal memo from its general counsel. By contrast, the Energy Department ​“is way, way behind” on adopting alternative contract structures when disbursing money, according to a former OCED official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

As a result, the agency stuck to the financing mechanisms with which it was familiar — such as cost-share agreements.

Internally, the Trump administration said the cuts were justified in part because the companies involved were well funded and could manage the investments themselves, the official said.

“But I don’t think that’s the case. They need a government incentive to make the technological changes they were trying to do,” the former OCED official said.

“I would bet less than half of them keep going by themselves,” the official added. ​“It’s a big blow.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/doe-sign.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=61c5ff230926877f0c851058b51b54f5,N,,2025-06-06 08:24:33.770675

Last year, curtailments jumped by 29% compared with 2023, while California added only about 12% more utility-scale solar capacity.
California can continue to push buildings, vehicles, and industrial operations to electrify, creating more demand to soak up what is now surplus solar.
The state can also build lots and lots of batteries to store extra solar produced during the day for use in the evening.
In order to stop wasting clean electricity, California will need to sustain that battery boom in the face of significant federal policy headwinds — and place some bets on other, more elusive solutions like transmission and long-duration energy storage.","When the sun shines bright and the breeze blows hard, solar panels and wind turbines often produce more power than the grid needs or can handle. In those moments, the grid operator will order power plant owners to reduce their output. That’s called curtailment, and it’s common in places like California that have lots of renewables.

It’s no surprise that California is having to curtail power as it adds more solar to the grid — but curtailments are rising faster in the state than renewable generation capacity is growing. Last year, curtailments jumped by 29% compared with 2023, while California added only about 12% more utility-scale solar capacity.

Curtailments are at their highest in California during the spring, when the sun is strong enough to generate a lot of solar power but mild weather keeps air-conditioning use, and thus electricity demand, in check.

With power demand rising around the country thanks in large part to the rapid rollout of AI data centers, and with California behind on climate goals, it’s important for the state to try and reduce curtailments and use more of the clean power it’s already capable of generating.

There are a few ways to do that. California can continue to push buildings, vehicles, and industrial operations to electrify, creating more demand to soak up what is now surplus solar. It can support the construction of interstate transmission lines that would allow it to export more power to states with less solar generation.

The state can also build lots and lots of batteries to store extra solar produced during the day for use in the evening. In fact, it’s already doing that. It has installed more utility-scale storage than any other state, and the sector has grown rapidly in recent years: California had a total of 13.2 GW of utility-scale storage online as of last month, far more than the nearly 8 GW it had at the end of 2023.

On March 4, 2025, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in City and County of San Francisco v. Environmental Protection Agency, holding that EPA does not have the authority to issue “end-result” requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Emissions System (“NPDES”) permits under the Clean Water Act (“CWA”).

The CWA’s NPDES framework prohibits the discharge of pollutants from point sources to any “water of the United States” unless authorized by permit. A key statutory protection is the “permit shield”: if a permittee complies with its permit, it is deemed in compliance with the CWA (33 U.S.C. § 1342(k)).

At issue in this case was the City and County of San Francisco’s (“San Francisco”) NPDES permit for its Oceanside combined wastewater facility (mixed wastewater and stormwater). For years, the permit contained certain effluent limitations pertaining to the levels of pollutants that could be present in the material that was discharged, but in 2019, EPA added two so-called “end-result” requirements to the permit. These requirements did not set specifications for what could be discharged, but rather prohibited discharges that would violate water quality standards for the receiving water (the ocean) or otherwise pollute or contaminate it, leaving it to San Francisco to figure out how to achieve that. Specifically, the permit included the following two “end-result” requirements:

A prohibition on any discharge that would “cause or contribute to a violation of any applicable water quality standard . . . for receiving waters.”

A statement that “neither the treatment nor the discharge of pollutants shall create pollution, contamination, or nuisance” as defined by California law.

For many years, EPA routinely included these types of “end-result” requirements in permits as a backstop to effluent limitations. In this case, San Francisco challenged these requirements as beyond EPA’s authority under the CWA.

The case turned on the meaning of the term “limitation” as used in 33 U.S.C. § 1311(b)(1)(C) of the CWA. This section allows EPA to include “effluent limitations” and “any more stringent limitation” necessary to meet water quality standards in NPDES permits.

San Francisco first argued that EPA only has authority to issue effluent limitations. The Court rejected this argument, finding that Congress would not have used the language “any more stringent limitation” immediately after using the term “effluent limitations” if it intended to limit EPA’s authority to only effluent limitations.

However, the Court did agree with San Francisco’s alternative argument that the term “limitation” means that EPA must be the one to determine and implement standards to achieve water quality standards and cannot shift this responsibility onto permittees by prescribing only the outcome. The majority opinion pointed to three main reasons for this conclusion:

A “limitation” is defined as a “restriction . . . imposed from without,” meaning a “provision that tells a permittee that it must do certain specific things” and not an end-result requirement that puts the responsibility to figure out how to achieve it on the permittee.

The legislative history of the CWA suggests that it was Congress’ intent for the CWA to impose direct restrictions on pollution rather than to work backwards from pollution to assign responsibility. Working backwards was the statutory scheme of the original version of the CWA, and Congress overhauled it in 1972 because it did not think that system was working.

Two features of the broader statutory scheme of the CWA support this conclusion: (1) end-result requirements would negate the CWA’s “permit shield,” which protects permittees from liability as long as they are complying with their permit, even if they violate water quality standards; and (2) end-result requirements would provide no mechanism for fair allocation of responsibility when there are multiple dischargers contributing to violations of water quality standards.

In sum, the majority opinion concluded that “§1311(b)(1)(C) does not authorize the EPA to include ‘end-result’ provisions in NPDES permits. Determining what steps a permittee must take to ensure that water quality standards are met is the EPA’s responsibility.”

The dissent, on the other hand, believed that EPA had the authority to impose end-result requirements under the “any more stringent limitation” language in the statute.

Implications

This decision will impact how EPA and states with NPDES authority issue permits, compelling them to set more specific requirements and relieving permittees of the burden of figuring out how to achieve water quality standards. How this will affect the permit process is still unclear. In many instances, EPA lacks detailed information required to lay out specific effluent limitations a discharger must comply with. In the past, it has issued NPDES permits with end-result requirements to avoid delays or denials of permits. Now that this is no longer an option, as the dissent points out, this may slow down the permitting processes.

For large-scale dischargers like municipal stormwater and sewer systems, this decision may prove to be a double-edged sword. While the onus is now on EPA to set specific requirements in NPDES permits instead of leaving this to the discharger, this could cause issues in obtaining permits that would otherwise have been issued with end-result requirements. Moreover, it is unclear if the current administration’s efforts to downsize EPA will affect the permit process further. Affected dischargers should keep a close eye on how the impacts of this decision develop.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12559_3740.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 11:22:50.599958

Mike Dunleavy’s annual energy conference included visits from three of the Trump administration’s top officials, but it didn’t include any major developments on the financing of the proposed 800-mile trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.

U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, traveled to the North Slope and to Anchorage this week during a visit that coincided with the fourth annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference.

Despite the conference’s name, oil and gas development took top billing, with all three officials saying that they hope to increase oil and gas production in Alaska under the direction of President Donald Trump.

“President Trump wants to see the flows through (the trans-Alaska Pipeline System) doubled,” Wright said during a speech on the North Slope this week. “The oil is here. The discoveries are here. If we free Alaska and the people here (from regulation), we’re going to more than double the oil flow through the pipeline and build the big, beautiful twin, the natural gas pipeline, from the North Slope.”

Despite the week’s enthusiasm for the Alaska Liquefied Natural Gas pipeline, better known as AKLNG, it still isn’t clear who will pay for it to get built.

The natural gas pipeline and associated processing plants are expected to cost $38.7 billion, but that estimate was published in 2020, and it predates inflation-driven and tariff-driven cost increases under the Biden and Trump presidencies.

Energy developer Glenfarne, which is pursuing AKLNG on behalf of the state, announced this week that 50 firms had formally expressed interest in AKLNG contracts worth more than $115 billion.

Those contracts include possible supply agreements — people interested in selling things to AKLNG for construction — as well as possible investors.

An expression of interest isn’t a firm commitment, and no investors said this week that they will back the project. Officials from Japan, Korea and other nations — possible customers for Alaska gas — visited the state this week but made no announcements.

Taiwan’s state-run energy company, CPC, signed a non-binding agreement in March stating that it would buy liquefied natural gas from Alaska and invest in the project.

As currently envisioned, AKLNG would be constructed in two phases — the first would be a pipeline from the North Slope to Fairbanks and Southcentral Alaska for domestic, in-Alaska gas customers.

The second phase would involve facilities and equipment needed to export gas overseas.

Glenfarne is expected to announce a go/no-go final investment decision on the first phase by the end of the year.

Speaking to NBC reporters in Prudhoe Bay, Burgum said that the U.S. military could be a key customer for the first phase of the project.

“They’re ready to sign on to take an offtake agreement from this pipeline to get gas to our super strategic, important bases across Alaska,” he said on CNBC.

Actually signing a customer agreement could make financing easier to come by.

“If you get the commercial offtakers for the gas, financing is pretty straightforward,” Wright told CNBC.

Legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden allows $30 billion in federally guaranteed loans for the project.

This week, Wright told reporters in Anchorage that the U.S. Energy Department could make additional loans available.

“They’re going to get details of the project to come together, but I think it’s quite likely that you will see loan guarantees provided by the loan program office at the Department of Energy to build the pipeline part of that project,” he said.

Under the Biden administration, the DOE’s Loan Programs Office grew into a major financier for green-energy projects.

He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.
But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.
Democrats’ support rose from 37% to 52%.
“(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate.","This story was originally published by Floodlight.

Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released Thursday by the Pew Research Center.

The results mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to before Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study’s authors. “This isn’t a new trend,” he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump’s policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans’ favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats’ support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It’s hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That’s what Murphy’s groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. “Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,” Murphy said, “their appeal narrows.”

It’s a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition’s executive director, echoed Murphy’s strategy, adding that EVs have “become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.”

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: “EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.”

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support – 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Said Murphy: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/offshore_wind_turbines-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 09:03:46.260979

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Following through on the threat could cost Musk billions. His two largest companies, SpaceX and Tesla, both benefit from a wide array of government programs ranging from lunar launch contracts to electric car incentives.

Musk answered Mr. Trump with a threat of his own, vowing to cut off SpaceX's manned spacecraft program. Investors appear to be taking the squabble seriously: As the two men traded barbs Thursday, Tesla's share price tanked 14%.

SpaceX

Musk's rocket company has received tens of billions of dollars from the federal government over the last decade, including $3.8 billion in the 2024 fiscal year alone, according to federal records.

The bulk of those federal grants are from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA has paid SpaceX billions over the last decade to ferry astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. The agency has also awarded SpaceX upwards of $2 billion in recent years to design and build a lunar lander, as part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in a half-century.

NASA's partnership with Musk ramped up during the Obama administration, which hired SpaceX and Boeing to build spacecraft to transport astronauts — aiming to end NASA's reliance on Russia following the end of the Space Shuttle program. In recent years, SpaceX has carried out several missions to and from the space station using its Dragon spacecraft.

Musk responded to Mr. Trump's threat Thursday to cut off contracts by saying SpaceX would ""begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately."" Hours later, Musk wrote, ""Ok, we won't decommission Dragon,"" in response to an X user who encouraged him to ""cool off and take a step back.""

A NASA spokesperson told CBS News the agency will ""continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the President's objectives in space are met.""

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, dismissed the idea that the government would cancel contracts with Musk and his companies. ""I'm [not] going to comment on who's right or wrong. But [Trump's] not going to take away our only way to get to the Space Station [and] back. I mean, that's ridiculous,"" he told reporters Thursday.

SpaceX has received grants from a handful of other federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, which has awarded the company hundreds of millions for launch services.

Starlink — a division of SpaceX that offers satellite internet services — also has links to the federal government. As of earlier this year, the company was in line to take over a multi-billion dollar contract to upgrade the Federal Aviation Administration's aging air traffic control communication systems.

Tesla

Musk's electric car company gets far fewer direct federal grants than SpaceX — but it indirectly makes billions of dollars a year as a result of various state and federal programs.

The federal government has signed deals to buy cars from Tesla here and there, though a plan for the State Department to buy some $400 million worth of armored vehicles was called off this year.

More importantly, Tesla reported making almost $2.8 billion last year by selling ""regulatory credits"" to other carmakers, helping rival companies reach the car emissions rules set by various governments. Tesla is in an unusually strong position to sell credits because, unlike most carmakers, it exclusively makes zero-emission electric vehicles — and those credit sales come at a ""negligible"" cost to the company, Tesla said in its 2024 annual report.

Many credits are sold to comply with state-level emissions rules, most notably in California, though congressional Republicans have sought to roll back some of the federal waivers that California needs to impose tougher emissions standards than the federal government.

If California's regulatory credit program goes away, it could cost Tesla some $2 billion, JPMorgan Chase estimated in a report last month.

Tesla customers also benefit from a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, a program designed to increase sales of electric cars — including Teslas. And the company's solar power division gets a boost from federal renewable energy tax credits. Many of those incentives would end or face new restrictions under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a domestic policy bill containing Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. It passed by the House last month and is now being considered by the Senate.

The end of those tax credits may cost Tesla $1.2 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase.

Musk has previously shrugged off the idea of winding down electric car tax incentives: ""Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,"" he said on X last year. Some analysts — and possibly Musk — think an end to electric car credits would hurt Tesla's rivals more than Tesla. Nonetheless, in a post last month, Tesla pushed for a ""sensible wind down"" of some renewable energy tax credits, arguing an abrupt end would ""would threaten America's energy independence.""

Musk, for his part, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act a ""disgusting abomination"" this week, helping ignite the feud with Mr. Trump. The billionaire's public criticisms of the bill focus largely on the bill's cost. But Mr. Trump said Thursday that Musk ""went CRAZY"" after ""I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted.""

Tesla's early growth was also fueled by federal money. The company earned a $465 million Department of Energy loan meant to boost electric car production in 2010, and paid the government back several years later.

CBS News has reached out to Tesla and SpaceX for comment.

This isn't the first time the president has needled Musk over his companies' federal subsidies. In a 2022 feud, Mr. Trump claimed Musk would be ""worthless"" without hefty subsidies for ""electric cars that don't drive long enough"" and ""rocketships to nowhere.""

At that time, Musk argued Mr. Trump should not run for another term as president, saying he should ""hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.""

The two ended up mending their relationship. Musk spent hundreds of millions to help elect Mr. Trump in 2024, and he led the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration's early months, forging a tight alliance with Mr. Trump — until this week.

The tremendous influence of oil and gas companies over political decisions in Brazil is purely a matter of money.
The decision to halt the opening of new oil and gas fields in Amazonia must come from the top, that is, from President Lula.
The president’s support for the project is clearly inconsistent with his rhetoric on climate change.
This requires leading by example by immediately cancelling Brazil’s plans for new oil and gas fields.","On May 19, the head of IBAMA, Brazil’s federal environmental agency, overrode the technical opinion of the agency’s licensing department and issued a decision allowing proposed oil drilling in the FZA-M-59 drilling block in the mouth of the Amazon River to proceed for approval. Pressure on IBAMA has been intense with the approach of the massive June 17 auction of drilling rights, which includes 47 blocks in the mouth of the Amazon River.

Environmental approval of the first block is seen as essential to stimulate oil companies to risk their capital in purchasing drilling rights in the blocks that are up for auction. Direct pressure from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is a likely explanation for IBAMA’s change, as indicated by his comment that he would close the issue of licensing the mouth-of-the-Amazon project upon return from his recent visits to Moscow and Beijing.

At the same time, the National Congress was racing to approve a proposed law that would gut Brazil’s environmental licensing procedures, led by the most powerful proponent of the mouth-of-the-Amazon project: Senate president Davi Alcolumbre of Amapá, the state adjacent to the project that is expecting a financial bonanza from the offshore oilfields. The Senate approved the proposed law two days later, and Lula did not defend the position of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change against approval of the bill. Both houses of the National Congress and Brazil’s political structure as a whole are heavily stacked against action on climate and other environmental issues.

A pressing issue

The issue of oil and gas exploitation in the Amazon is pressing today because decisions are about to be made by the Brazilian government that would put in motion processes that will continue to impact the climate, Amazonian natural ecosystems and Amazonian peoples for decades to come (see here and here). The issue is also pressing because we are very near tipping points both for the global climate and for the Amazon Rainforest. These tipping points are intertwined: if the Amazon forest were to collapse, it would release more than enough carbon to push climate change past a point of no return, and if global warming escapes from human control, the Amazon forest would quickly succumb.

An oil spill at the mouth of the Amazon River would be catastrophic for biodiversity because it would be uncontrollable, at least for a period of many months or possibly years. This is shown by the experience of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, when oil spilled uncontrolled for five months before, with luck and many failed attempts, a concrete dome was lowered on a cable to cover the well. That event proved that no one in the world has the technology to plug a leak at the 1.5-kilometer (0.9-mile) water depth of the Gulf of Mexico site.

The 2.95-km (1.83-mi) depth at the site in the mouth of the Amazon that is up for licensing is essentially double this depth, and the site has ocean currents that are much stronger, more complex and more variable than at the Deepwater Horizon well. The currents flow in different directions at different depths in the water column, with a surface current flowing north and currents flowing south starting at 201 meters (659 feet) in depth. In other words, no one could stop a leak, which would affect eight countries.

On land, oil and gas extraction in the Amazon forest causes deforestation with the construction of access roads and subsequent land grabbing, land invasions and deforestation. The most critical case is the immense Solimões Sedimentary Area project planned in the TransPurus region in Brazil’s state of Amazonas (see here and here). The project, which would cover an area larger than California, would be accessed by the notorious AM-366 road, planned to connect the TransPurus area with the BR-319 (Manaus-Porto Velho) highway.

The opening of this last major area of intact Amazon forest to deforesters would be catastrophic for the climate as well as for biodiversity and local peoples. It is an enormous “elephant in the room” in the discussions of BR-319, the licensing for which completely ignores the impact of AM-366 and other state roads planned to connect to BR-319 (see here and here). The drilling rights in the first blocks have already been sold to the Russian oil company Rosneft, which claims to have the full support of the governor of the state of Amazonas, and, as one of the world’s largest companies, would have influence to obtain the state government’s priority for building AM-366 once the federal government’s planned reconstruction of BR-319 is complete.

Why has oil and gas exploitation in the Amazon not been stopped?

The tremendous influence of oil and gas companies over political decisions in Brazil is purely a matter of money. In Brazil, the discourse claiming that this extraction is needed to keep the country’s population from running out of fuel is simply mendacious. Brazil already exports half of the oil it extracts, and this percentage is expected to increase with the planned expansion of current oilfields and the opening of new ones. Brazil has much more oil in existing oilfields than it can use before the entire world must stop burning petroleum for fuel.

The opening of new oilfields, such as those proposed in the mouth of the Amazon, imply continued extraction of petroleum long after the world must stop using petroleum as fuel. The expectation is that it will take five years for these fields to begin commercial production, and then another five years to pay for the investment. Since no one will want to stop with zero profit, this implies continued extraction for many years.

This logic has even led the International Energy Agency (IEA), which is usually on the other side of environmental issues, to issue a report concluding that no new oil or gas fields should be opened anywhere in the world. The economics of opening new fields is different from that of continued exploitation of existing fields, which the IEA concludes must supply all fossil fuel use in the coming decades, with these fields continually reducing their rates of extraction to achieve net zero by 2050. Others would say that net zero must be reached significantly earlier to avoid a catastrophic escape of global warming from human control.

There is no other choice than a full transition away from fossil fuels, in addition to stopping deforestation and direct human degradation of Amazon forests, as by logging. The Global Stocktake issued by the Climate Convention at COP28 in 2023 calculated that the world must reduce its direct emissions (basically fossil fuels + deforestation + agriculture) by 43% by 2030 and 84% by 2050 to prevent the global average temperature rise from passing the 1.5° Celsius (2.7° Fahrenheit) limit above the pre-industrial average agreed under the Paris Agreement. The amounts by which human society must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions are not subject to negotiation; they are simply fixed unless someone does another scientific study that shows the numbers should be different. Because average global temperature since 2023 has been above the 1.5°C mark, such a study would probably indicate that emissions must be reduced by even greater percentages.

The 1.5°C limit is believed to represent a tipping point both in the global climate system and for the Amazon forest (see here, here and here), where exceeding it means that the annual probability of a catastrophic shift increases sharply, and, therefore, the cumulative probability of such a shift occurring at least once would pass the 50% mark in a much shorter span of years.

The most we can do to contain global warming is to not emit any more, not burning a single liter of fossil fuel or cutting a single tree. But if the emissions that are not “directly human induced” exceed what we emit deliberately, a point of no return is reached where the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase uncontrollably from sources such as forest fires, soil warming and tundra melting, as well as from warming seawater reducing the ocean carbon sink.

Brazil would be devastated if global warming escapes from control: the Amazon forest would be lost (including its vital water cycling function that maintains human water consumption in cities like São Paulo) (see here and here); northeastern Brazil would become a desert (see here and here), expelling tens of millions of people; the country’s agribusiness and family agriculture would be decimated (see here, here, here and here); the dense population along the country’s Atlantic coast would be exposed to unprecedented storms and sea-level rise (see here and here); and the combined effect of heat and humidity on human survival would make fatalities during heat waves a major source of mortality in much of the country (see here, here, here, here, here and here).

Meanwhile, Indigenous and local peoples are not benefited by fossil fuel extraction, as shown by the examples of the existing oil and gas projects throughout the Amazon. In addition to direct impacts, the “natural resources curse” and the “Dutch disease” are real phenomena in the Amazon (see here, here and here), as is also the case in the rest of Brazil (see here, here and here) and throughout the developing world and in much of the developed one as well (see here, here, here and here). The result is greater economic inequality and increased poverty. A vast social science literature exists on why countries with the greatest mineral wealth, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bolivia, are also the ones with the greatest poverty, among other social ills such as corruption and authoritarianism. This pattern is not a coincidence, and it is already playing out in the Amazon.

The decision to halt the opening of new oil and gas fields in Amazonia must come from the top, that is, from President Lula. This is not a problem to be resolved through environmental regulations, via measures to minimize impacts such as oil spills and increasing inspections and enforcement of the regulations. The Brazilian government is currently focused only on the licensing procedures, as in the case of the proposed mouth-of-the-Amazon oilfields. Making sure that the letter of the law has been followed in the licensing process does not face the fundamental issue of whether these proposed projects should exist at all.

President Lula lives in a “disinformation space” with respect to this issue, where he hears only the false narratives of his minister of mines and energy and the head of Petrobras, the government-owned oil company. The president’s support for the project is clearly inconsistent with his rhetoric on climate change. In addition to cancelling all plans for opening new oil and gas fields, the president needs to recognize that the energy transition is a national imperative and should be at the same level as health and education in having guaranteed funding, rather than being something optional that depends on monetary windfalls such as the money from proposed expanded fossil fuel extraction.

Because of the disastrous impact in Brazil if global warming is allowed to escape from control, President Lula needs to assume a leadership role in global efforts to end fossil fuel use. This requires leading by example by immediately cancelling Brazil’s plans for new oil and gas fields.

For many, the term “mobility” might conjure images of electric cars or public transit. For Reggaria Goddard of Detroit-based Crowned Venture Capital, the mobility opportunity is more expansive – encompassing deep tech, critical infrastructure and a holistic approach to urban development.

Goddard, a Detroit native, defines mobility as the “the way we move people, goods, and services over land, sea and water.”

In the latest Plugged In episode, host Sherrell Dorsey sits down with Goddard, formerly of GM Ventures, to unpack her journey from the legacy auto industry to the forefront of mobility investment, exploring the opportunities and challenges within this rapidly changing sector.

Mobility beyond the basics

“When I talk about the future of transportation and mobility, I think a lot of us get EVs as kind of the first intersection of that, and so I think a lot of minds get stuck there, but it’s so much broader than that,” Goddard explains.

She highlights the link between EVs and infrastructure, which extends beyond charging stations to the underlying grid, fiber optics, cloud storage, and more. Mobility, she notes, also falls squarely within deep tech, with advanced air mobility, eVTOLs, drones, and autonomous vehicles relying on sophisticated AI and other cutting-edge technologies.

“There are lots of overlap from other industries,” Goddard says. “So tech, deep tech, communication, insurance tech, all these things are wrapped up into mobility, and some are probably investing already in these spaces and not necessarily linking it to mobility, but it’s very intricate that all these things work together.”

Shifting landscapes

Despite recent rollbacks in federal funding and energy and transit projects originally slated with Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) dollars, Goddard is steadfast in her belief in the growth of the mobility sector.

She points to the presence of EVs on dealership lots and the increasing conversion of private fleets to electric vehicles, such as buses in Martha’s Vineyard and various city vehicles. These shifts are often driven by private capital and controlled environments, proving that progress can continue even without significant federal backing.

Goddard also emphasizes the role of technological advancements, such as longer-range batteries and inductive charging in roads, as well as the private sector’s increasing investment in charging infrastructure within new buildings and corporate lots. She also highlights the broader energy infrastructure needs that underpin not just EVs, but also the burgeoning fields of AI, cryptocurrency mining, and humanoid robots.

“While we’re not calling it EV infrastructure – it’s not charging stations – That energy infrastructure is still being created,” she notes, pointing to large-scale renewable farms funded by companies like Meta.

Cities as laboratories

Goddard offers a glimpse into cities that are actively pushing the boundaries of mobility and smart city initiatives, praising cities like Detroit for their adoption of electric vehicles. In Miami, initiatives like electric boat companies for passenger transport and the development of a “digital twin” project to test various technologies and energy capacities demonstrate a forward-thinking approach.

These examples underscore a crucial understanding among city leaders: “they can’t stay where they are because they will be left behind.” Cities are actively seeking advanced technologies and open policies to attract and retain talent, reduce congestion, lower emissions, and minimize accidents.

Scalable solutions

When evaluating potential investments, Goddard’s core thesis revolves around two key principles: problem-solving and scalability. “I’m really big on solving problems, so filling in those gaps, like the things that maybe no one’s thinking about, or sometimes it’s a simple solution,” she explains. She cites an example of a company converting garbage into energy, a seemingly small solution with immense potential for cities struggling with waste management and infrastructure.

Beyond addressing immediate needs, Goddard looks for ideas with the capacity for broad expansion. “Maybe it starts for the urban community, but it has a bigger footprint in the long run for all around the world,” she says. Her focus is always on understanding the utility of a solution today and its potential utility in the future.

Shifting sentiments

Goddard observes a growing awareness within the investor and private wealth communities regarding the importance of investing in mobility and its interconnected sectors. She attributes this shift to the significant overlap between mobility and other high-impact areas like deep tech, AI, energy infrastructure, and sustainability.

“When you couple that with electric vehicles, or you couple that with solar panels, or renewable energy, that’s a two fold” Goddard explains. Investors are increasingly seeing the “two for the price of one” benefit: impacting climate change while simultaneously investing in advanced technologies with far-reaching implications across multiple industries.",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/66e8ede7a22760d01e216b6b_Goddard.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 08:28:20.335919

The Well Done Foundation, a Montana-based national nonprofit, is spearheading the project in Erie County in collaboration with local and state entities, as well as Pittsburgh students.

A block north of busy West 26th Street, 15 feet from a house and right next to a stormwater pond sits Millcreek Township Orphan Well No. 1, which contains potentially dangerous gases that could cause cancer.

But thanks to a collaboration involving a Montana nonprofit, Millcreek Township officials, Pittsburgh students, a Texas fund, an Indiana crew and Pennsylvania money, work began the first week of June to plug the abandoned natural gas well at 2624 W. 25th St.

""This means a lot to our community as we take pride in keeping our residents healthy and also being responsible to the environment,"" Millcreek Supervisor Kim Clear said June 5 during a news conference at the site.

Joining Clear at the well were Millcreek Supervisor Jim Bock and Curtis Shuck, chairman of the Well Done Foundation.

The Montana-based foundation is a national nonprofit dedicated to plugging orphaned wells, reducing methane emissions and combating climate change. Well Done was working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which had the Millcreek well on a watch list, Shuck said.

What are orphan wells?

Orphaned wells are abandoned oil and gas wells that are no longer actively managed by an owner, according to the Well Done Foundation, which is coordinating the Millcreek project. These wells pose a significant environmental hazard, leaking methane and carbon dioxide equivalent, which contribute to climate change and global warming, according to Well Done.

Erie County's more than 100 orphan wells placed it ninth on a top 10 list, according to an Environmental Defense Fund fact sheet on orphan wells in Pennsylvania. McKean County led the state list with more than 2,300 orphan wells.

Shuck said there are few records on many of these abandoned wells, which number into the millions across the United States. The well along West 25th Street is believed to date to a 1900s farmstead but little else is known about it. Clear said Millcreek Township owns the land on which the well is located.

Millcreek well No. 1

The Millcreek well No. 1 will be the 58th that the Well Done Foundation has plugged nationally, its seventh in Pennsylvania, fifth in Erie County and first in Millcreek, Shuck said. A second well in the township, off West Eighth Street at the old Manor Motel site, is on the foundation's to-do list, he said.

The No. 1 well was leaking methane when Well Done first arrived on the scene in 2023, according to Shuck and the foundation's website. He said the foundation began monitoring the well's emissions, which were equal to more than 1,000 automobiles.

""This well, in addition to methane, also contains other potentially dangerous gases like benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene and those are known cancer-causing agents,"" he said at the site.

In the event of a catastrophic failure at the well, those chemicals could enter the nearby stormwater system and eventually make their way into Lake Erie, Shuck said.

A crew from Penn Mechanical Group in Indiana, Pennsylvania, was expected to start plugging the well starting June 5. The work was expected to take about a week.

Project contributors

A group of students at Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh raised $5,000 toward the project through their Dice Well Done Club. The club raised the money through fundraisers, including online appeals and movie days in the public school’s auditorium.

“Everyone my age wants to fight climate change but doesn’t know how to do it. I started the Dice Well Done Club because it was a clear opportunity to help a community that’s not too far away,"" sophomore Lucy Hurowitz, club founder and president, said in a news release.

She established the club with fellow Allderdice sophomores Seena Teshome, Jordan Block and Olivia Boyle. Clear thanked the students, who weren't able to be at the site. The money they raised will be matched by the Well Done Foundation and the Texas-based Reimer Family Climate Crisis Fund.

Shuck said his foundation suggested the Pittsburgh students raise money for the Millcreek well because it was ""closer on the execution list"" and not due to any particular connection between the school and the township.

The Detroit News

(TNS)

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump hit back at Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk over his criticism of Republicans’ massive budget proposal, suggesting the tech mogul is primarily upset over provisions that slash government support for electric vehicles.

“Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate … which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office. “They’re having a hard time, the electric vehicles. And they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. And, you know, Elon knew this from the beginning.”

Musk has been critical of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, calling it a “disgusting abomination” for how much it will increase the national deficit and put America “in the fast lane to debt slavery.”

The sweeping tax, spending and policy bill would—among many other changes—gut federal support for Biden-era policies that supported a transition to electric vehicles. The bill would eliminate or scale back several tax credits for the purchase and production of EVs, including a popular $7,500 consumer credit. It also would eliminate tailpipe emissions rules that push automakers to more aggressively electrify their offerings over the next decade.

Trump, speaking to reporters during a sit-down with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, gave an extended, minutes-long response to a question about Musk.

“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” the president said.

Musk, until last week, helped direct the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, a controversial cost-cutting effort meant to rapidly downsize the federal government. Trump hosted Musk in the White House for a sendoff last Friday, thanking the billionaire for his work in the early days of the administration.

“I’ll be honest, I think he misses the place. I think he got out there and all of a sudden he wasn’t in this beautiful Oval Office,” Trump said Thursday. He suggested Musk’s hostility toward the bill was a sign of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”

Trump added: “I’m very disappointed. Because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here … . He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate.”

Tesla, Musk’s all-electric car and truck company, sold about 634,000 vehicles in the United States last year. That represented nearly half of all EV sales nationally. Detroit-based General Motors Co. was a distant second, selling about 114,000 EVs.

Musk, via his social media platform X, responded to Trump’s comment: “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”

The bill passed in the House of Representatives but still needs approval in the Senate.

Related article: SALT Write-Off, Harvard Tax, Medicaid Cuts: What’s in Trump’s Bill

“Whatever,” Musk added in another post. “Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.”

Tesla, in addition to selling EVs, also has a solar energy generation and storage segment to its business that generated more than $10 billion last year.

Share prices for the company plunged after Trump’s comments, falling about 8.5% within an hour.

Trump and other Republicans had signaled their intentions to end renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credits throughout the 2024 election cycle and in the early months of Trump’s second term. Musk himself even invited an end to government subsidies for EVs.

“Take away the subsidies,” he wrote in July 2024. “It will only help Tesla. Also, remove subsidies from all industries!”

Musk and Trump appeared to develop a friendship over the past year as the tech mogul worked vigorously to get Trump elected and later joined his administration for the DOGE effort. Musk even referred to himself as Trump’s “first buddy.”

Even as he had furiously criticized the GOP bill on X over the past week, Musk did not criticize Trump directly. But that changed Thursday after the Oval Office comments, as the duo’s relationship quickly and publicly soured.

“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk wrote. “Such ingratitude.”

The 1,121 megawatt nuclear plant will help support Meta’s clean energy goals.

Starting in June of 2027, the agreement supports the relicensing and continued operations of the Clinton facility for another two decades after the state’s ratepayer funded zero emission credit (ZEC) program expires.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center was slated for closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, but its retirement was prevented by enactment of the Future Energy Jobs Act, which established a Zero Emission Credit program that provides financial support to the plant through mid-2027. Constellation’s agreement with Meta essentially replaces the ZEC program and ensures long-term operations of the plant without ratepayer support. The PPA will enable the Clinton Clean Energy Center to continue to flow power onto the local grid, providing grid reliability and low-cost power to the region for decades to come.

Under the deal, Clinton will also add 30 megawatts of increased output from nuclear uprates. With the guarantee that Clinton will continue to run for another two decades, Constellation is evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the plant site.

“Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place? We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation.

“[Meta] figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Clinton_Beauty.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 10:09:40.227571

Trump's budget proposal would cut the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' construction budget 16% from $1.85 billion enacted in 2025 to $1.56 billion in 2026.
The budget request includes $20.8 million for “deregulation activities” as the agency works toward cutting Biden-era fuel economy standards.","Washington ― President Donald Trump's budget request for next year would support the Flint Lead Exposure Registry and Great Lakes cleanup projects, but slash spending for Army Corps construction and harbor dredging and eliminate the heating assistance program for low-income households.

Trump's 2026 proposal serves as a starting point for negotiations with lawmakers and will likely change as the Republican-controlled Congress reviews it. A detailed spending plan for the Department of Defense hasn't yet been revealed.

But in a positive sign for the Flint registry, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services proposed spending another $5 million in 2026 for the project, which tracks residents who were exposed to lead during the Flint water crisis 10 years ago and links them up with resources, including social and health care services.

The registry funding for 2026 is being requested even though the project's grant for 2025 has been held up at the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention after the elimination of the agency's lead poisoning prevention team back in April amid widespread staff cuts at HHS.

The CDC's lead program is also funded in Trump's budget proposal at $51 million; however, the 26-person team of lead prevention experts remains on leave as part of staff cuts at HHS this spring.

""It's great to see that (the registry) is back in the proposed HHS budget for 2026,"" said Dr. Mona Hanna of the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine, the pediatrician who helped expose the Flint water crisis and has led the registry effort.

""It's even more exciting to see the funding continued for the national childhood lead poisoning prevention program, despite the loss of the entire department at the CDC.""

Paul Allwood, who led the CDC's Lead Poisoning Prevention and Surveillance Branch until his layoff in April, also was pleased to see the funding for his program in the budget proposal, though he was wary.

""Without the experts who built the program, I don’t see what will be achieved,"" Allwood told The Detroit News on Thursday. ""We are still waiting to hear that we are reinstated. We are anxious to get on with the work of protecting kids from lead poisoning.""

Hanna said she remains hopeful that the fiscal 2025 funding for the registry will be released. MSU, which sponsors the project, has already notified 20-plus staffers that they could be laid off if the grant money doesn't come through by July 31.

HHS said Thursday the Flint registry grant continuation award date is set for Aug. 1.

""We can't count on it this year because of everything that's happening. Because we have no program officers. We have no program staff. There is no more lead department to oversee this work,"" Hanna said.

""The hardest part is the uncertainty, but the good work will continue.""

The Democratic congresswoman who represents Flint applauded the proposed funding for the registry.

""I’m glad to see the president include its funding in the newest version of his budget, and I look forward to working with him and our bipartisan coalition of Congress members to secure its funding for 2026,"" said Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City.

Less federal support for dredging

Funding requested for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative in 2026 was flat at $368 million, which was the same level as 2025. Bipartisan members of Michigan's delegation have sought to renew the public-private program for another five years through 2031 and boost funding levels to $500 million in 2026.

Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Holland, told The News in January that protecting the funding for the program would be a top priority in the new Congress, noting that previous administrations, including Obama's and Trump's, tried to cut its funding.

Trump's budget proposal would cut the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' construction budget 16% from $1.85 billion enacted in 2025 to $1.56 billion in 2026. This follows Congress earlier this year passing a spending bill that saw the Corps' construction budget for 2025 drop over 40%.

The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, which pays for dredging operations at major harbors and rivers around the Great Lakes, would take a hit of about $1 billion or a 39% reduction to $1.7 billion, according to the budget request.

Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, warned at a hearing last month that the proposed cuts to the Army Corps budget and its workforce endanger lives and public safety and undermine economic growth.

""In the Great Lakes region alone, these investments ensure that goods — from American steel to Ohio soybeans — can reach domestic and global markets,"" Kaptur said. ""And cuts to this work would cause costly delays, limit our competitiveness and harm local economies.""

About $28 million in the Army Corps construction plan would be allocated for a key project in Illinois to try to prevent invasive carp from infiltrating Lake Michigan.

Trump in a presidential memorandum last month explicitly expressed support for the $1.15 billion project at the Brandon Road Lock & Dam in Joliet, Illinois, that would install several methods to serve as a barrier to the carp. The State of Illinois last month transferred a tract of land that was needed to start construction.

The Army Corps' Civil Works plan would also allocate $176.6 million toward the $3 billion, 10-year mega project in Sault Ste. Marie to build a second shipping lock capable of handling the largest Great Lakes freighters. All of the country's domestic iron ore passes through the Soo Locks.

The recommendation in the president’s budget for $176.6 million will maintain ""efficient"" funding for the lock project into next year and will allow for the remaining work on the upper approach walls to be awarded, in addition to the continuation of the third phase of construction, said Carrie Fox with the Army Corps' Detroit District that oversees the Soo project.

""While there will continue to be capabilities in future years for the New Soo Lock, we currently remain on track for a Summer 2030 completion,"" Fox said.

Heating assistance program faces cut

The budget proposal would eliminate a program for financing non-federal dam safety projects and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which sent more than $165 million to Michigan in 2024.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he understands the ""critical, historical importance"" of the program, which helps low-income families and seniors afford heating costs.

""President Trump's rationale and OMB's rationale is that President Trump's energy policies are going to lower the cost of energy so that everybody will get lower cost heating oil, and, in that case, this program would simply be another subsidy to the fossil fuel industry,"" Kennedy said at a Senate hearing last month.

The Department of Education is proposing to eliminate the group of federal programs known as TRIO, which aim to support low-income and first-generation students succeed in college.

When Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins asked why TRIO isn't worth the investment at a hearing this week, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said her department lacks the ability to audit TRIO to ensure the federal funding is being used appropriately, NPR reported.

Rural air service, EV chargers on chopping block

Trump's request also aims to cut over $300 million from the Essential Air Service program, which guarantees airport service to nine small communities in Michigan.

The GOP president's budget blueprint also eliminates funding for the refugee resettlement program, which had helped fuel population growth in Michigan in recent years, and would end funding for Community Action Agencies through the Community Block Grant Program.

The budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, would see a 27% cut under the proposal.

Budget requests from the Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy reemphasized the Trump administration’s goals of rolling back tailpipe emissions rules and ending federal support for a transition to electric vehicles.

The Energy Department proposal would rescind about $2.3 billion in credit subsidy funds for an advanced vehicle manufacturing initiative. Those funds have helped the agency’s Loan Programs Office issue major financial support for projects related to EVs and batteries.

LPO credit subsidies ― which enable far greater federal loans ― helped support EV battery projects for each of the Detroit Three automakers during the Biden administration. The federal loan commitments across three high-profile projects totaled more than $19 billion.

The Transportation Department proposal said it would cancel about $5.7 billion in unspent money for two EV charging programs funded via the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed in 2021 under former President Joe Biden.

The budget request includes $20.8 million for “deregulation activities” as the agency works toward cutting Biden-era fuel economy standards.

The Environmental Protection Agency did not assign a dollar value in its budget brief for pursuing Trump administration goals related to the auto industry.

The agency did, however, affirm its intention to make sure “Americans have the right to decide what vehicle is best for them: electric or gas-powered” and to “protect and bring back American auto jobs.”

North Carolina is projected to hit a deficit as soon as next year unless state lawmakers freeze tax rates in place.","Responding to the widespread devastation from Hurricane Helene will cost so much that it’ll set other road and bridge construction work back by years, state business leaders told reporters Thursday, as North Carolina braces for the upcoming 2025 hurricane season and whatever additional damage that might bring.

Meanwhile, Gov. Josh Stein raised alarms of his own during a separate briefing Thursday, saying President Donald Trump's cuts to federal spending will hurt efforts to predict and respond to natural disasters in the future. That will only end up leading to more damage and an even larger burden on North Carolina taxpayers to fix the damage, he said.

""Cuts to NOAA and FEMA are a man-made disaster,"" Stein said. ""We need these critical agencies to help us anticipate and respond to natural disasters. A lack of forecasting and a lack of funding both harm public safety.""

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] is in charge of forecasting storms. Trump has forced out more than 1,000 employees there since taking office in January. Trump has also advocated for eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], which handles most disaster response efforts. And Trump cut another 600 jobs at the National Weather Service, which last week failed to send alerts in North Carolina despite severe storms sweeping the state.

""We simply have to prepare for the very real possibility that these entities will be of diminished capacity,"" Stein said. ""That means, just to keep up, we will need more state funding. Potentially hundreds of millions of dollars more.""

Business interests, however, are already worried about how much money the state has diverted to emergency responses in the wake of Hurricane Helene last year — particularly for transportation and infrastructure funding — without taking steps to replace the funds that had been set aside for more run-of-the-mill road improvements.

“We have to have the resources to do both things,” Jake Cashion, the top lobbyist for the NC Chamber of Commerce, told reporters Thursday. “We must continue to support recovery in western North Carolina. And we must continue to make investments in the transportation network statewide.”

Focus on roads

As the state’s main business lobbying group, the Chamber is now working to highlight the domino-like effect that natural disasters can have on funding for roads and bridges, since having good roads affects so much of the state’s economy from tourism to trucking.

The Chamber wants to see more public-private partnership options — like toll roads — approved to help fund road construction. It also supports what it calls a State Infrastructure Bank that would offer low-interest loans to boost road funding.

Fixing storm-damaged roads takes away funding that would otherwise be spent on normally scheduled road widening or repairs. That causes those projects to be delayed, which causes costs to rise, which in turn might lead to even longer delays or fewer road projects being completed.

Cashion and others including a state Department of Transportation representative spoke with reporters Thursday about a new report from TRIP, a D.C.-based transportation research group, that estimated the state government will need to spend nearly $1 billion just on fixing roads and bridges damaged by Helene.

That’s equivalent to 3 years’ worth of spending on bridges statewide, or 18 months worth of road resurfacing work statewide — meaning that other non-emergency efforts are now likely going to need to be pushed back by months or years.

“The North Carolina Department of Transportation has really done a heroic job of addressing this devastating damage from Hurricane Helene,” said Rocky Moretti, TRIP’s research director. “But moving forward, they also have significant transportation challenges across the state.”

At the same time, climate change is making storms more severe, along with inflation causing recovery work to cost more. Hurricane Matthew in 2016 set a North Carolina record by doing $5 billion in damage. Two years later Hurricane Florence shattered that record. And in 2024 Helene set a new record, with $60 billion in estimated damage.

More hurricanes coming

Asked by WRAL about what the 2025 hurricane season might add to those pressures, Alyson Tamer, one of NCDOT’s top leaders for Helene recovery work, said Thursday that Helene drained much of the agency’s funding set aside for emergencies.

But DOT has flexibility, she noted, to take money from other road projects to pay for disaster response — if that’s the only option.

“We are working towards preparedness now,” she said. “We've learned a lot of lessons from Helene on steps that we can take, hopefully, to build back well.”

DOT's flexibility to delay or defund previously scheduled projects to pay for disaster response, however, frustrates some business leaders, even in the areas hit hardest by Helene.

“It also is not lost on me that we have transportation projects that are completely apart from anything related to hurricane relief that we want to see funded — as do people throughout the state,” Kit Cramer, president of the Asheville-area Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “So, we have an ongoing concern about the funding level for our transportation infrastructure.”

Wake County affected

Helene is far from the first storm to derail other road projects and lead to unintended consequences years later.

WRAL reported this past weekend that state lawmakers are looking to kill a proposed toll road on Capital Boulevard in Raleigh — even though local leaders say that’s their only option since the cost of widening Capital Boulevard has ballooned from a $93 million plan in 2012 to a $1.3 billion plan in 2025.

A large part of the reason that much cheaper 2012 plan never happened was because it was supposed to get started in 2018. But that year Hurricane Florence hit the state, causing transportation officials to put the Capital Boulevard project on hold to divert the money to repairing storm-damaged roads out east instead.

Since then, the rising costs of labor, construction materials and land have all contributed to the project’s cost exploding — now leaving local and state politicians in a stand-off over how to proceed.

Adam Wright, a Wake Forest Town Commissioner, told WRAL the toll road would never have come up as an option if the stat legislature had appropriated enough money for roads in the first place, to keep transportation officials from having to shuffle funds around and delay the project.

“We don’t want tolling,” he said. “But if you’re going to prevent us from tolling, can you at least give us the money? That’s the long and short of it. None of us want tolling. But NCDOT has been massively under-funded by the legislature for years.”

Fight over taxes

Concerns over transportation funding have been highlighted further this year as the Republican-led state legislature debates pressing ahead with more cuts to the state’s income tax rate, the main source of revenue for state services in general.

North Carolina is projected to hit a deficit as soon as next year unless state lawmakers freeze tax rates in place. Some Republican leaders in the state legislature now want to pump the brakes on tax cuts. But others say they don't believe their own budget analysts and are pushing to pass even more aggressive tax cuts than what's already planned.

That intra-GOP fight on tax policy is currently holding up passage of the new state budget, as well as a new round of funding for Hurricane Helene relief that might end up being tied to the budget.

The current state budget year ends on June 30, but lawmakers appear months away from reaching a final deal on a new budget.",https://images.wral.com/asset/news/local/2025/03/27/21931872/3271900-stein_six_months_since_helene-DMID1-66fravtut-640x480.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:33:56.712190

TRENTON – Governor Phil Murphy, Senate President Nick Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin today announced over $430 million in direct relief to lower the cost of energy bills. This comes in anticipation of the utility rate increase that took effect on June 1, 2025, as New Jersey ratepayers face record high wholesale electric prices which will hit customers with bills 20% higher than they were one year ago.

All 3.9 million ratepayers in New Jersey will receive at least $100 in direct relief, while eligible low-to-moderate income (LMI) New Jerseyans will see at least $150 more deducted from their energy bills.

These credits are funded by the Clean Energy Fund, the Board of Public Utilities’ allocation of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) proceeds, and the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment account.

“Today, we are coming together to provide critical economic relief to the people of New Jersey by directly lowering the cost of their monthly energy bills,” said Governor Murphy. “But let me be clear: this is a short-term solution for the people of our state being battered by rising energy costs. Moving forward, we are going to work alongside BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy and our legislative partners to hold PJM accountable for the untenable and unconscionable costs they have forced on our state’s residents. Together, we are going to explore every possible avenue for lowering the cost of energy in the long term to make our state more affordable for more families.”

“The upcoming spike in utility bills imposed on New Jersey residents is unaffordable and unfair,” said Senate President Nick Scutari. “PJM conducted a deeply flawed energy auction, and its continued incompetence is costing the State. These rate-relief credits will bring more immediate relief to consumers, putting money into their pockets to help offset utility costs. We can’t allow New Jerseyans to be left to themselves to shoulder the burden of PJM’s mismanagement.”

“As we continue our efforts in the Legislature to ease the burden of utility rate hikes for New Jerseyans, I am encouraged to see Governor Murphy announce these steps to deliver meaningful and immediate relief,” said Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin. “The return of the REAP program will provide our most vulnerable residents with sustained monthly support, and through the proposed universal credit, every ratepayer, regardless of income, would see relief. I thank my legislative colleagues for demanding relief for our residential ratepayers and commend the Governor and BPU for using the tools at our disposal to meet this moment with purposeful action. No one should have to choose between cooling their homes in the summer and paying for groceries or medication, and that’s why we will continue our legislative focus on keeping energy costs affordable for the long-term. We’ve passed bills that will strengthen oversight, improve accountability and protect New Jersey residents from unfair energy prices while also moving forward with an all-of-the above approach toward increased energy production in the state. Generating our own energy will bring down costs for residents and businesses alike, as well as lead to the creation of good-paying jobs. I expect our state’s electric utilities to be partners in helping us meet these challenges.”

“This will provide direct relief to ratepayers to help offset the costly burden of a sudden spike in utility bills imposed on them by a mismanaged PJM power generation auction,” said Senator John Burzichelli. “This assistance will be a welcomed relief for all ratepayers, but it will be especially helpful for working families and low-income residents who are already struggling to make ends meet. This, however, is not a permanent solution. We must continue to be aggressive in fighting for reforms to the PJM system that caused this crisis in energy costs. We need an energy market that operates effectively, serves the needs of ratepayers, and makes affordability the priority.”

“Families across New Jersey are already feeling squeezed by the rising cost of living, and the energy rate hikes will only make the issue of affordability worse,” said Senator John McKeon. “We cannot allow our residents to shoulder this burden alone. Governor Murphy’s plan to provide millions in direct relief to ratepayers will ensure that no one has to choose between putting food on the table and keeping the lights or air conditioning on. I look forward to working with the Board of Public Utilities to get these credits into the hands of the public as soon as possible.”

“We know that energy bills can spike in the summer, and families need relief now,” said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin. “The Assembly remains focused on keeping New Jersey affordable. This is the kind of targeted relief that helps while we continue building long-term, sustainable solutions. I appreciate Governor Murphy for putting forward this plan, and I look forward to working together to drive down utility costs.”

“As someone who represents communities in South Jersey, I’ve seen firsthand how devastating unpredictable energy costs can be for working families, seniors, and small businesses,” said Assemblyman Dan Hutchison. “While we continue working toward long-term solutions, I am proud to support this effort to deliver immediate, direct relief through programs like REAP and the proposed Universal Credit.”

“Today’s announcement demonstrates what good governance is all about – delivering real results to those who call New Jersey home, and I'm proud of the work the NJBPU has done to make this historic rate relief announcement a reality,” said NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. “Under Governor Murphy’s leadership, with support from Senate President Scutari and Speaker Coughlin, we will continue to make affordability a priority for New Jersey utility customers.”

As demand for electricity is on the rise, regional grid operator PJM Interconnection has failed to plan for increased energy capacity and has failed to bring new, renewable energy projects online.

In recent months, New Jersey has led the way in advocating for a solution to the cost crisis faced by multiple states that are members of the PJM region. In April, Governor Murphy called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to investigate whether market manipulation led to higher capacity auction prices.

The Governor also urged PJM to finally provide long-overdue approvals for new, clean sources of energy, such as solar power, that would help expand New Jersey’s supply of energy. This year New Jersey exceeded 5 gigawatts of installed solar capacity for the first time, enough energy to power 750,000 homes. PJM, however, has delayed the process for allowing new sources of clean, reliable energy to be added to the State’s grid.",https://nj.gov/governor/library/facebook_card.png,N,,2025-06-06 08:25:28.712234

NEW BRAUNFELS Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it.

The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road.

“It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees, outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.”

The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this buildout promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come.

The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.”

Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability.

“There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.”

IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers — giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said.

There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totalling 411,600 megawatts of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, Senate Bill 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies.

Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply.

Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today.

Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation.

Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try and slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand.

This buildout promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records.

Texas, with 9% of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15% of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26% of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state.

GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers.

For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand.

“The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.”

It forecast up to a 20% increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers.

Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate.

It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines has quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook.

“If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said.

The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March.

About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference.

“Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.”

Gas plants for data centers

Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 megawatts of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 megawatts of gas power generation capacity.

Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 megawatt cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940.

“Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.”

CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 megawatt gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 megawatt data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart.

Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 megawatt South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 megawatt megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 megawatts from the grid.

All together, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global.

“There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.”

However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals.

Restrictions on renewable energy

Looking forward to a buildout of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer.

Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power.

“It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.”

While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry.

One failed bill, Senate Bill 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, House Bill 3356 and Senate Bill 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating.

When the Legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund.

Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, SB 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas or nuclear — needs.

“It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass.

Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state.

Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue.

More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40% of their income.

He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the Legislature is headed with renewables.

“I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.”

A report published in April finds that targeted limitations on solar and wind development in Texas could increase electricity costs for consumers and businesses. The report, done by Aurora Energy Research for the Texas Association of Business, said restricting the further deployment of renewables would drive power prices up 14% by 2035.

“Texas is at a crossroads in its energy future,” said Olivier Beaufils, a top executive at Aurora Energy Research. “We need policies that support an all-of-the-above approach to meet the expected surge in power demand.”

Likewise, the commercial intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie expects the power demand from data centers to drive up prices of gas and wholesale consumer electricity.

Pollution from gas plants

Even when new power plants aren’t built on the site of data centers, they might still be developed because of demand from the server farms.

For example, in 2023, developer Marathon Digital started up a Bitcoin mine in the small town of Granbury on the site of the 1,100 megawatt Wolf Hollow II gas power plant. It held contracts to purchase 300 megawatts from the plant.

One year later, the power plant operator sought permits to install eight additional “peaker” gas turbines able to produce up to 352 megawatts of electricity. These small units, designed to turn on intermittently during hours of peak demand, release more pollution than typical gas turbines.

Those additional units would be approved to release 796,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases, 251 tons per year of nitrogen oxides and 56 tons per year of soot, according to permitting documents. That application is currently facing challenges from neighboring residents in state administrative courts.

About 150 miles away, neighbors are challenging another gas plant permit application in the tiny town of Blue. At 1,200 megawatts, the $1.2 billion plant proposed by Sandow Lakes Energy Co. would be among the largest in the state and would almost entirely serve private customers, likely including the large data centers that operate about 20 miles away.

This plan bothers Hugh Brown, who moved out to these green, rolling hills of rural Lee County in 1975, searching for solitude. Now he lives on 153 wooded acres that he’s turned into a sanctuary for wildlife.

“What I’ve had here is a quiet, thoughtful life,” said Brown, skinny with a long grey beard. “I like not hearing what anyone else is doing.”

He worries about the constant roar of giant cooling fans, the bright lights overnight and the air pollution. According to permitting documents, the power plant would be authorized to emit 462 tons per year of ammonia gas, 254 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, 153 tons per year of particulate matter, or soot, and almost 18 tons per year of “hazardous air pollutants,” a collection of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or other serious health impacts.

It would also be authorized to emit 3.9 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, about as much as 72,000 standard passenger vehicles.

“It would be horrendous,” Brown said. “There will be a constant roaring of gigantic fans.”

In a statement, Sandow Lakes Energy denied that the power plant will be loud. “The sound level at the nearest property line will be similar to a quiet library,” the statement said.

Sandow Lakes Energy said the plant will support the local tax base, provide hundreds of temporary construction jobs and dozens of permanent jobs. Sandow also provided several letters signed by area residents who support the plant.

“We recognize the critical need for reliable, efficient and environmentally responsible energy production to support our region’s growth and economic development,” wrote Nathan Bland, president of the municipal development district in Rockdale, about 20 miles from the project site.

Sandow says the plant will be connected to Texas’ public grid, and many supporting letters for the project cited a need for grid reliability. But according to permitting documents, the 1,200 megawatt plant will supply only 80 megawatts to the grid and only temporarily, with the rest going to private customers.

“Electricity will continue to be sold to the public until all of the private customers have completed projects slated to accept the power being generated,” said a permit review by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Sandow has declined to name those customers. However, the plant is part of Sandow’s massive, master-planned mixed-use development in rural Lee and Milam counties, where several energy-hungry tenants are already operating, including Riot Platforms, the largest cryptocurrency mine on the continent. The seven-building complex in Rockdale is built to use up to 700 megawatts, and in April it announced the acquisition of a neighboring, 125 megawatt cryptocurrency mine, previously operated by Rhodium. Another mine by Bitmain, also one of the world’s largest Bitcoin companies, has 560 megawatts of operating capacity with plans to add 180 more in 2026.

In April, residents of Blue gathered at the volunteer fire department building for a public meeting with Texas regulators and Sandow to discuss questions and concerns over the project. Brown, owner of the wildlife sanctuary, spoke into a microphone and noted that the power plant was placed at the far edge of Sandow’s 33,000-acre development, 20 miles from the industrial complex in Rockdale but near many homes in Blue.

“You don’t want to put it up into the middle of your property where you could deal with the negative consequences,” Brown said, speaking to the developers. “So it looks to me like you are wanting to make money, in the process of which you want to strew grief in your path and make us bear the environmental costs of your profit.”

Boviet Solar Technology Co. once again is recognized as a Tier 1 PV module manufacturer by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) for Q2 2025. Boviet first achieved this rankling in 2017.

“This recognition goes beyond an accolade; it represents the dedication and innovation our teams bring to the industry every day,” says Sienna Cen, President of Boviet Solar USA, added. “As we address the growing needs of utility-scale and large commercial and industrial applications, our unwavering focus remains on quality, innovation, and fostering strong collaborations with our valued partners.”

BloombergNEF Tier 1 status

BloombergNEF, a leading authority on research and analysis in the transition to a low-carbon economy, employs a stringent tiering system to assess the bankability of PV module manufacturers. BNEF’s Tier 1 bankability rating is benchmark that investors, developers, EPCs, and asset owners use as shorthand for a measure of a manufacturer’s long-term stability and product dependability.

Achieving Tier 1 status requires manufacturers to supply their own-brand, self-manufactured products to at least six separate solar projects, each backed by non-recourse financing from six different banks within the last two years. These projects, with capacities of 5.0 MW or more, must be listed in the BNEF database with publicly accessible details about their location, size, developer, financial backers, and module supplier.

Boviet Solar technology

Boviet Solar is solar energy technology company specializing in monocrystalline PV cells and Gamma Series Monofacial and Vega Series Bifacial PV modules. Engineered with advanced solar cell technology and intelligent design features, Boviet modules are crafted from robust components and subjected to rigorous quality control and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes.

Scott Chen, VP of Global Sales and Marketing at Boviet Solar, commented, “Achieving and maintaining Tier 1 status is a testament to the trust our partners have in us and the exceptional quality of our product portfolio. It underscores our leadership in providing solutions that consistently deliver reliability and bankability at the highest level.”

Boviet Solar Technology Co. officially opened the doors on its PV module plant in Greenville, Pitt County, North Carolina—its first U.S. manufacturing facility. The $294-million facility will produce high-performance Gamma Series Monofacial and Vega Series Bifacial PV modules with PERC and N-Type solar cell technology. Boviet Solar modules are built for residential, commercial, industrial, and utility-scale applications.

Boviet Solar bona fides

In addition to this accolade, Boviet Solar has also been ranked among the top 10 global bankable PV module manufacturers by Wood Mackenzie as well as the top 10 global financially stable PV module manufacturers by Sinovoltaics. Boviet Solar’s PV modules are known for their power, performance, and quality and have been rated as top performers on Kiwa PVEL’s PV Module Reliability Scorecard since 2019.

,Indiana Environment,2025-06-06 01:52:06+00:00,The Daily Reporter - Greenfield Indiana,Trump's EPA targets environmental rules projected to save billions — and many thousands of lives,The Associated Press,,,,,https://www.greenfieldreporter.com/2025/06/05/trumps-epa-targets-environmental-rules-projected-to-save-billions-and-many-thousands-of-lives/,"“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants.
In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.
Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.
But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.","When the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced a wide-ranging rollback of environmental regulations, he said it would put a “dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and introduce a “Golden Age” for the American economy.

What Lee Zeldin didn’t mention: how ending the rules could have devastating consequences to human health.

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated; they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

But experts say the numbers are conservative and that even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants. “More of this type of pollution that we know kills people will be in the air.”

What went into AP’s examination of the pollution rules

The AP set out to look at what could happen if all the rules were eliminated, by first examining exhaustive assessments the EPA was required to produce before the rules were approved. Though the agency’s priorities can change as presidential administrations change, the methods for the assessments have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan’s presidency and are deeply rooted in peer-reviewed scientific research.

The AP used those and eight different government and private group databases for its estimate of financial costs, some death estimates and analysis of pollution trends. AP performed additional analysis of potential deaths by drawing on peer-reviewed formulas and scientific research on the impacts of increased heat and pollution. And AP vetted its work with multiple outside health experts, who said it is scientifically justified, but likely an undercount.

Multiple experts say the science behind the rules is strong, and they pointed to the rigorous process that must be followed to change them, including requirements for public comment.

Zeldin acknowledged as much last month.

“I’m not going to prejudge outcomes with what will be a lot of rulemaking,” Zeldin said in April.

Virtually all the benefits from the rules come from restricting the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel industry was a heavy contributor to President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and Republicans overall. In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.

Calculating costs and benefits is contentious

Asked for comment on the AP findings, an EPA spokesperson said the agency’s plans would “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes’ on U.S. families.”

“Unlike the Biden EPA attempts to regulate whole sectors of our economy out of existence, the Trump EPA understands that we do not have to choose between protecting our precious environment and growing our economy,” spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said.

Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell LLP who represents energy and manufacturing interests, suggested that EPA analyses under the Biden administration emphasized worst-case scenarios, inflated health benefit claims and missed the big-picture economic benefits of booming industry.

“If you only count lives saved by regulation, not lives harmed by regulation, the math will always favor more regulation,” Segal said. “This framing misses the larger point: public health isn’t just about air quality — it’s also about job security, housing, access to medical care, and heating in the winter.”

The EPA regulatory analyses are immense documents that numerous health and environment researchers and former officials say are grounded in science, not politics. For example, in January 2024, the EPA produced a 445-page analysis of tightening standards on dangerous particle pollution that cited more than 90 different scientific publications, along with scores of other documents. The Biden EPA presented four different regulatory scenarios and ultimately chose one of the middle options.

Two experts who reviewed AP’s work said the EPA documents that underpinned the analysis were themselves conservative in their estimates. University of Washington health and environment professors Kristi Ebi and Howard Frumkin said that’s because EPA looked at added heat deaths and air pollution mortality, but did not include climate change’s expected deaths from increased infectious disease, flooding and other disaster factors.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,” said Frumkin, who was appointed director of the CDC’s National Center for Environmental Health during George W. Bush’s administration. ”It makes clear that regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration will have major, direct consequences for health and well-being. Because of these regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts, Americans will die needlessly.”

That’s a sentiment echoed by two former Republican EPA administrators, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George Bush and George W. Bush administrations respectively.

“This administration is endangering all of our lives — ours, our children, our grandchildren,” said Whitman, who led EPA under George W. Bush.

How regulations helped clear the air

A visit to Evansville, Indiana, helps show how EPA regulations have made a difference.

The city of about 115,000 lies where the state’s southwest tip meets Kentucky at the curving Ohio River. Industry lines the banks and coal barges float past carrying loads destined to fuel power plants.

Kirt Ethridge, 30, grew up in Evansville and still lives there. As a child, he recalls looking down from high ground into the bowl-shaped valley where the heart of the city lies and seeing a haze of pollution atop it. He thought that was normal.

He didn’t think much of the looming smokestacks of the coal-fired power plants and factories that ringed the city, nor the line of inhalers waiting on a bench before he and his classmates ran the mile. He suffered asthma attacks in class, sometimes more than once a week, that sent him to the nurse’s office. Once, he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

“It’s a very scary feeling, particularly as a kid, to not be able to get enough air in your lungs,” he said, describing it as like “breathing through a straw.”

In southwestern Indiana, coal-fired power plants were to blame for between 19,000 and nearly 23,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, according to work by Zigler published in the journal Science that examined death rates among Medicare recipients and modeled where plants’ pollution would spread.

Nationally, he and his team found a sharp decline in air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants after the mid-2000s, from an average of 43,000 a year to just 1,600 a year in 2020, with a similar cut in particle pollution. That’s when two different forces came into play: Cheaper and less polluting natural gas pushed aside dirtier and costlier coal, while at the same time stricter regulations required more pollution control devices such as scrubbers.

Duke Energy operates its biggest power plant near Evansville — Gibson Station, which can power about 2.5 million homes. Emissions have declined significantly as the company installed scrubbers that pull unwanted chemicals out of smokestacks, along with other pollution control technology. Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protegere said the scrubbers were a response to “regulations over the years as well as market factors.”

Put simply, the air got cleaner around places like Evansville. Vanderburgh County and neighboring counties violated national annual air standards for fine particles from 2005 to 2010, but no longer do, even as standards have tightened.

The same is true across the United States. The amount of tiny airborne particles in the last 10 years nationwide is one-third lower than 2000-2009, EPA statistics show. Smog pollution is down nearly 15% and sulfur dioxide has plunged 80%.

“The Clean Air Act, the EPA’s founding legislation, has been a powerful engine for improving public health as our air has grown visibly clearer and cleaner,” said Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under President Barack Obama and served as Biden’s White House climate adviser. “Millions of Americans have avoided illnesses, hospital visits, and premature deaths thanks to EPA’s cleaner car and truck standards in concert with rules that limit industrial pollution.”

Five rules saving more than $200 billion a year

Five rules together were estimated to have more than $200 billion a year in net benefits, based on EPA documents that estimated reduced illnesses and deaths and the costs for companies to comply.

Three rules dealt with cars and trucks. The “clean car rule” is a tightening of EPA emission standards for vehicles that was supposed to take effect for 2027 model years and eventually have annual net benefits of more than $100 billion a year, according to the agency’s 884-page regulatory analysis. The EPA estimated that over the next three decades this rule alone would prevent 7.9 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, 8,700 tons of particulate matter and 36,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.

Two other proposed rules — one that deals with car models from 2023 to 2027 and another aimed at heavy trucks and buses — are estimated to save nearly $38 billion a year combined through reduced health problems from air pollution, according to EPA’s own detailed calculations.

EPA plays up costs, plays down benefits of targeted rules

Almost none of those benefits are to be found in 10 fact sheets the EPA produced in conjunction with Zeldin’s announcement. Nine make no mention of benefits from the rules, while eight mention the costs.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

For example, Biden’s proposed power plant rule was designed to save more than $24 billion a year, prevent about 3,700 annual premature deaths and 3 million asthma incidents from fossil fuel-powered plants, according to EPA documents last year and work by the Environmental Protection Network. Under Trump, the EPA’s fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.

Another rule the EPA updated last year sets standards for pollution permitted in the air, called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The update, required by the Clean Air Act, cuts allowable soot particles by 25% to reflect new science on the harms from such pollution. The EPA in Biden’s time calculated the change would annually save as much as $46 billion, 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents.

But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.

“The human body count and human health toll of particulate matter alone is just absolutely massive,” said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top federal regulatory officer from 2021 to 2023. “Literally tens of thousands of people will lose their lives” if the standard is rolled back, he said.

A penguin-shaped nebulizer

In southwest Indiana, many people have noticed a positive difference from the EPA regulations. And they’re concerned about changes.

In Bloomfield, Jessica Blazier’s 11-year-old son Julian has multiple health conditions that make him more sensitive to air quality, including nonallergic rhinitis, which inflames his nasal passage and makes breathing “feel like a knife sometimes,” in his words. Jessica Blazier said the proposed EPA rule rollbacks are “almost adding insult to injury in our particular circumstance.”

In Evansville, Ethridge is now raising kids of his own, including a 5-year-old daughter who was born early and doesn’t tolerate respiratory illnesses well. Whenever Eliza gets sick, she uses a children’s nebulizer that is shaped like a penguin and stored in an igloo-shaped case.

“I want to raise my kids in Evansville,” he said. “I don’t want to raise my kids in a bowl of pollution.”

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that renewables are now 10 times more efficient than new nuclear at CO2 mitigation; 92.5% of all new power capacity added worldwide in 2024 was from renewables, with new nuclear virtually nowhere; new nuclear builds are vastly over-cost and over-time; large reactors on offer are the same ones offered 25 years ago – no new designs have been developed this century; since all small modular reactors are in the design stage, industry forecasts must be treated with scepticism; and waste, proliferation and siting problems are all deeply unresolved.

New nuclear has limited operational need and a poor business case. Even for the couple of hundred hours per year of dunkelflaute (low wind and low sun), it is possible to sustain a reliable power system by expanding renewable energy, rapid growth and modernisation of the electricity grid, faster interconnection, using electricity far more efficiently, smart energy management and deployment of today’s cost-effective storage technology.

And, by the way, it turns out that Sizewell C new nuclear station would be almost entirely cut off by climate-driven storm-surge floodwater at least once a year by the time it’s built.

But let’s be clear: The dual prospect of cuts to federal clean energy investments and the imposition of tariffs could threaten the gains we’ve seen across Arizona’s clean energy sector in recent years.

Transferable clean energy tax credits are allowing companies to build now and save later, resulting in more private investment to the tune of $12 billion since 2022 in Arizona. That growth has led to 30 projects in the clean energy sector and created more than 18,000 jobs across the state, much of it along the Interstate 10 corridor between Phoenix and Tucson.

For instance, LG Energy Solutions is already hiring for its $5.5 billion electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Queen Creek, a project that expects to create more than 2,500 jobs. Cirba Solutions is opening a battery recycling plant in Eloy. JA Solar has a $60 million solar panel fabrication facility in Phoenix, creating over 600 jobs locally.

Outside the I-10 corridor, Gunnison Copper is implementing clean tech at its facility in Cochise County in southeast Arizona. Near Wellton, EVelution Energy is building a $300 million facility to process cobalt, a critical mineral in lithium-ion batteries that power EVs.

Consumers are also reaping rewards. Tax credits for energy-reducing appliances are making many household upgrades more affordable. Arizonans who upgrade their windows, skylights and insulation are eligible for tax credits to help them reduce the cost of improvements that will lower their energy needs going forward, creating a win-win for homeowners. Solar energy tax credits are reducing the cost of rooftop solar panel installation for Arizonans by 30%. Small businesses, nonprofit organizations and houses of worship are eligible for the same tax credits.

Fortunately, Arizona leaders on both sides of the aisle recognize how important these investments are for Arizona’s economy and the household budgets of Arizona consumers. While some Republican members of Congress are trying to phase out these tax credits, they haven’t been able to do so. We need our congressional delegation to keep advocating clean energy tax credits as they benefit both business owners and consumers.

Proposed tariffs under the current administration could bring significant short- and long-term challenges to Arizona’s clean energy businesses. Arizonans know Mexico is our largest trading partner, and our shared border with Mexico attracts investment because manufacturers tap into both supply chains. A 25% tariff on Mexico — as well as tariffs on Arizona’s other major international trading partners, Canada and China — threatens our standing as a major player in clean energy manufacturing and undermines businesses that are already here. Beyond the impact on businesses, tariffs drive up costs for consumers across the board.

Arizona’s economic growth in recent years puts us on the forefront of the clean energy transition, and our leaders understand that to remain competitive, we must keep growing and creating new jobs. Arizona’s congressional delegation needs to make the case to the president and other national leaders that clean energy tax credits are good for consumers and good for business, but tariffs threaten the future that Arizonans are working so hard to build.

One of the largest manufacturing investments in Ohio’s history has transformed cornfields in a rural county into a battery factory that could soon have thousands of employees.

The plant, a joint venture of Honda and LG Energy Solution, is part of a wave of new factories developed across the country following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, most of them in states and counties that usually vote Republican.

So what happens now, when the tax credits that support this plant and others like it are under threat in Washington as Congress and President Donald Trump try to find a way to pay for large tax cuts?

The answer, so far, is unsatisfying. The debate over the budget reconciliation measure that its authors call “One Big Beautiful Bill” has included little discussion of the manufacturing and energy tax credits as Republicans and Democrats place more emphasis on the parts of the bill that deal with tax cuts and Medicaid.

Midwest utilities face challenges from extreme weather, aging infrastructure, and the need to integrate renewable energy while maintaining grid reliability. Regulatory pressures to decarbonize add complexity, as utilities transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives.

If enacted as currently written, the bill would lead to a more rapid phaseout of a tax break for battery production and other manufacturing, and it would eliminate a consumer tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles.

I am based in Ohio and have heard little outcry from business leaders or state officials here about provisions in the bill that would severely harm the battery plant, which is near the village of Jeffersonville. An exception is the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, whose president, former Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers, wrote an op-ed praising the manufacturing tax credits and urging their retention.

“Each manufacturing job supports an entire ecosystem in the local economy—restaurants, retailers, housing, and small businesses all benefit from manufacturing growth,” he wrote. “Communities once facing economic uncertainty now see renewed vitality.”

Honda referred questions about the reconciliation bill to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group for auto manufacturers.

“We believe the consumer credits are critical for automakers to achieve current federal and state emissions standards,” said Brian Weiss, a spokesman for the group, in an email.

Let’s take a step back and remember some of the politics around the passage of the IRA. It was a party-line vote, with every Republican voting against, but the authors wrote the bill in a way that would encourage manufacturing investment everywhere. They knew that much, if not most, of the investment would be in Republican-leaning areas, based on which places have open land for new factories and the larger trends of rapid development in the Southeast.

Part of the idea was that by spreading the benefits, the IRA would gain bipartisan support. It would transform rural portions of Ohio, Georgia, South Carolina and other states and show how government policies could bring manufacturing jobs back to this country and make the United States more competitive with China and others.

Was this idea wrong? I don’t think so, despite what’s now happening in Washington.

To help explain, I got in touch with Jigar Shah, a longtime energy entrepreneur who served as director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office during the Biden administration.

He is skeptical of any attempt to connect the IRA to a hypothesis about U.S. politics and thinks it would have little to do with the current budget debate except for the fact that it has dollars that can be redirected to tax cuts.

“The IRA just happens to have a large bill because it was so damn successful,” he said. “The IRA wouldn’t have any cost associated with it at all if we didn’t have 1,000 new manufacturing plants that got announced during the last four years.”

Shah is relieved that the cuts to the manufacturing tax credit are not deeper. The House bill ends the credit in 2031 instead of a phaseout that concludes in 2032, as specified in the IRA, and it adds new restrictions to the credit’s transferability and places other limits that could reduce its use.

The more immediate cuts are to consumer-facing credits for climate-conscious acts such as buying rooftop solar and EVs.

Shah sees opportunities for the Senate, which is now working on the bill, to change some of the most onerous parts of the House bill. One easy fix, he said, would be to throw out or revise a provision that could be read to mean that a manufacturing project is ineligible for credits if it has even one component from a “foreign entity of concern,” such as China.

Let’s get back to Ohio.

President Barack Obama won Ohio’s electoral votes in 2012 largely because he painted Mitt Romney as someone who bought up companies and laid people off, Shah said.

“The IRA understood that people wanted stuff to be built in Ohio and that’s exactly what was inspired in communities that haven’t seen these types of investments in more than a half century,” he said.

He pointed to a database from the U.S. Department of Energy showing that Biden-era policies led to announcements of 11,684 new jobs and $12.5 billion in investment in Ohio.

The IRA was a large step forward, but it’s still in an early stage. The Honda plant has hired about 450 employees in anticipation of starting battery production by the end of this year.

It’s nowhere close to the 2,200 jobs that would be there if the plant was running at full capacity. The same is true of many other projects that benefit from IRA incentives and are still ramping up hiring.

Most of the employees and family members who would be calling their members of Congress to defend the tax credits haven’t been hired yet.

So, when environmental advocates and others wonder why there isn’t more of an outcry from places like Ohio in the budget debate, I think they may misunderstand the extent to which IRA benefits have arrived. This law needs more time for its constituency to grow.

We will learn, maybe within weeks, whether it will get that chance.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LG-Energy-Solution-Honda-Battery-Plant.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:30:27.124124

For two days now, the tech titan has been posting — and reposting — on X about the bill's impact on the debt. Multiple independent forecasters have said that the version of the bill passed by the House last month would add more than $2 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.

Musk has taken to calling it the ""Debt Slavery Bill,"" said the bill is at odds with the goals of DOGE, exhorted his followers to call members of Congress about to get them to oppose it, and repeatedly urged Republicans to scrap the bill and start anew.

He also posted a promotional photo from the 2003 thriller ""Kill Bill.""

Republicans' response has been muted. Trump has yet to publicly weigh in on Musk's ongoing post-storm, while GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill are largely dismissing it.

House Speaker Mike Johnson visibly rolled his eyes when reporters asked him about Musk's call for a new bill on Wednesday.

""We don't have time for a brand new bill,"" Johnson said. ""And I want Elon and all my friends to recognize the complexity of what we've accomplished here.""

Some Republicans have also insinuated that Musk may be upset about the fact that the bill phases out tax credits for electric vehicles that Congress passed under President Joe Biden. NBC News reported that Musk lobbied to keep those tax credits in place, and Johnson even brought up the credits when he initially responded to Musk's criticism on Tuesday.

""I know that has an effect on his business, and I lament that,"" Johnson said.

Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

All of this comes after Musk's departure from the White House last week, which followed a media blitz in which he expressed disappointment about public perceptions of DOGE and the backlash faced by his companies, including Tesla.

His criticism of the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" has been greeted warmly by Republicans who share his concerns about the deficit, but so far, his comments don't seem to have changed the overall dynamic within the party on the bill.",https://i.insider.com/6841a592c19ab3675c10b3b0?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 08:23:28.671459

The stock’s decline follows reports that Musk is now actively opposing the Biden-era EV tax credit framework after initially lobbying to preserve it.

At the center of the market reaction is a new report from Bloomberg suggesting Musk has pivoted his strategy, now aiming to dismantle the $7,500 EV tax credit after failing to sway lawmakers in Tesla’s favor. Musk criticized the proposed budget bill, claiming it “negates all the cost savings supposedly achieved by the DOGE [Tesla’s discount program] at great personal cost and risk,” implying the legislation would harm Tesla’s competitiveness.

While the exact outcome remains uncertain, political winds in Washington signal trouble for the EV credit. Senate Republicans, particularly those from red states with major EV manufacturing hubs, have been reluctant to fully strip the credits. But increasing pressure from House GOP leaders makes it likely that at least some elements of the tax benefit — especially for higher-income buyers — could be rolled back or eliminated.

That spells particular concern for Tesla, which may have more at stake than rivals. Though the $7,500 credit is limited by income thresholds for direct purchases, leased vehicles can still qualify for the full credit without such restrictions. According to Experian, about 50% of all EVs in the U.S. are leased — and Tesla’s numbers are likely even higher. In Q4 of last year, the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y topped the list of most-leased EVs, accounting for 12.2% and 9.1% of all leased electric vehicles, respectively.",https://financialbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cropped-Financialbuzz-Logo-symbol2-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-06 08:23:34.178733

Eric Bott at Americans for Prosperity, which has been a driving force behind the nationwide expansion of the REINS Act, notes there has been a more than three-fold increase in the number of REINS Act states since Governor Scott Walker (R-Wisc.)
As the REINS Act makes progress in North Carolina, opponents are speaking out.
In addition to Louisiana and North Carolina, Ohio lawmakers are also on the cusp of passing REINS Act legislation.
What’s more, REINS Act legislation is primed for further expansion next year in South Carolina, Montana, Missouri, and a host of other states.","Earlier this week, U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced a formal rescission of “18 obsolete or redundant Bureau of Land Management regulations.” The June 3 DOI statement announcing the recission called it “a decisive move to advance America’s energy independence and economic vitality.”

“This effort embodies our dedication to removing bureaucratic red tape that hinders American innovation and energy production,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “By rescinding these outdated regulations, we are not only reducing costs and streamlining processes but also reinforcing our commitment to energy independence and national prosperity — all while maintaining the highest standards of environmental stewardship.”

While the Trump administration continues to pursue reforms that reduce the federal regulatory burden, which now exceeds the combined cost of personal and corporate income taxes, governors and state lawmakers across the country are making progress this year when it comes to taming state regulatory burdens, namely by passing state-level versions of the REINS Act. The federal REINS Act, which would subject new regulations whose cost exceeds $100 million to congressional approval, is still awaiting consideration on Capitol Hill. In the meantime, the number of states with their own version of the REINS Act is continues to grow.

Eric Bott at Americans for Prosperity, which has been a driving force behind the nationwide expansion of the REINS Act, notes there has been a more than three-fold increase in the number of REINS Act states since Governor Scott Walker (R-Wisc.) signed legislation in 2017 making Wisconsin only the second state to have enacted this reform, with Florida being the first. Going into 2025 three states (Wisconsin, Kansas, and Florida) had a state-level REINS Act on the books, subjecting state regulations that exceed a specified cost to legislative approval. In three other states — Indiana, West Virginia, and Idaho — lawmakers had already approved reforms installing mechanisms similar to REINS, but with slight variations. New Hampshire has such a comparatively weak governor with so many checks in place, Bott explains, that the need for a REINS Act almost isn’t applicable in the Granite State.

“Florida has had REINS in the form of legislative rules ratification in place since 2010, and the process has earned the praise of regulators, legislators, and even the Florida Bar Journal,” notes Jon Sanders of the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina-based think tank. “It causes regulators to work with legislators when they perceive the need for a costly regulation. This produces the coexistence between legislators and regulation that best serves people.”

Thus far in 2025, lawmakers in Kentucky, Wyoming, Utah, and Oklahoma have enacted REINS Act legislation. At least three more state legislatures are likely to pass a REINS Act this summer. REINS Act legislation introduced in Louisiana, Senate Bill 59, is now working its way toward Governor Jeff Landry’s (R) desk, with the Louisiana House passing SB 59 on June 2.

“Louisianans face multiple legal and regulatory barriers to starting and running a business,” said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute for Public Policy, a Louisiana-based think tank. “SB 59 by Senator Reese will empower legislative oversight committees to review, and approve or reject rules promulgated by agencies that will have a $200K per year or $1M impact over five years on regulated individuals or companies.”

On June 4, two days after the Louisiana House unanimously passed SB 59, the North Carolina Senate Regulatory Reform Committee held a hearing advancing HB 402, REINS Act legislation approved by the North Carolina House in April. The next stop for HB 402 is the Senate Rules Committee and then, supporters hope, the Senate floor.

As the REINS Act makes progress in North Carolina, opponents are speaking out. The Southern Environment Law Center, for example, testified against HB 402 during the North Carolina Senate Regulatory Reform Committee hearing this week, as did a representative for Democracy Out Loud, an organization that describes itself as a “peaceful activist community works together for a democracy that improves people’s lives.”

“We have regulatory agencies,” the Democracy Out Loud representative told lawmakers during the June 4 hearing. “You appoint people to the regulatory agencies. You have some control over major rules that come. You don’t need this law to take over.”

The irony of a pro-democracy group opposing a reform that would give democratically-elected officials final say on the costliest regulations, rather than unelected bureaucrats who are not accountable to voters, was not addressed during the June 4 hearing. It could, however, come up in the Rules Committee.

In addition to Louisiana and North Carolina, Ohio lawmakers are also on the cusp of passing REINS Act legislation. In a joint letter to Ohio legislators, a coalition of conservative organizations wrote that enactment of the REINS Act “will establish the necessary checks and balances by requiring legislative approval for new rules or regulations that impose a significant fiscal burden, ensuring that such decisions are made by elected representatives rather than unelected bureaucrats.”

If lawmakers in Ohio, North Carolina, and Louisiana enact the pending REINS Act bills in the coming weeks, as many expect, nearly a quarter of all states will have a REINS Act on the books going into 2026. What’s more, REINS Act legislation is primed for further expansion next year in South Carolina, Montana, Missouri, and a host of other states.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6841b836f437c66d91982eea/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-06 08:41:14.858657

What's happening?

It would behoove North Carolinians to alter their approach and work with nature rather than against it, Duke University marine biology student Ava Kocher wrote for the North Carolina Coastal Federation's Coastal Review.

She said residents were fighting a losing battle to maintain their properties along the state's coast, warning that seawalls and bulkheads were a waste of money and suggesting that living shorelines can help shift ""this combative approach"" as ""a step in the right direction.""

The Tarheel State's coastal marshes are shifting as rising global temperatures melt ice and expand seawater. These ecosystems are able to retreat with this slow onslaught — unless they are blocked by concrete or another human-made structure.

Alyson Flynn, an environmental economist at the North Carolina Coastal Federation, told Kocher that the construction of such infrastructure on individual properties has forced neighbors to put up the same walls, as their land was eroding faster without it. ""They felt like the only way to protect their property was to also put up a seawall,"" she said. ""And so then it had this barricading effect across the whole shoreline.""

Why is this important?

North Carolina will lose 98,000 acres of salt marsh by 2100, Coastwatch magazine reported last year. This is because rising sea levels are accelerating and outpacing land elevation gains.

The results include a higher water table and more frequent and severe floods — and all the problems that come with those symptoms of the rapidly overheating planet, such as increasing fatalities, property damage, and insurance costs from extreme weather events such as hurricanes.

""Sea level rise, that might be like your allergies … and then comes a hurricane,"" Christine Voss, a retired research associate at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Institute of Marine Sciences, told Kocher. ""And because you may have been worn down by your allergies, when the cold or the pneumonia or the flu comes by, you're actually more susceptible.""

Instead of hardening land in an impossible bid to ward off the sea, however, living shorelines — featuring plants, sand, or rock — can help mitigate risk and buy time, as one Havelock family showed. Kocher noted that homeowners Vernon and Michele Kelly chose this route instead of replacing a worn-out bulkhead.

""Minnows seem to have figured out, 'Hey, we've got a sort of … haven here.' I've seen an increase of blue crabs in that sill area. And I actually had one oyster starting to grow,"" Vernon Kelly said.

""What we've done, it'll save it for my lifetime, maybe my kids. But if Mother Nature really decides she wants to do something, we can't stop her,"" he added.

What's being done about sea level rise?

As Vernon Kelly noted, this may be a long-term solution compared to a human lifespan, but it's actually temporary.

Because the warming of Earth is caused primarily by the burning of dirty energy sources, the solution is to transition to cleaner forms of power, such as solar and wind. Swapping personal vehicle trips for public transit rides, making your next car an electric vehicle, and shopping at thrift stores help cut down the production of heat-trapping pollution — and will save you money.

""Living shorelines are not the answer to save the coasts but they are a potential action toward reimagining future coastal resilience,"" Kocher concluded. ""Relinquishing the ideal of a manicured waterfront is the start of embracing an alliance with the ecosystems we inhabit. Starting in backyards like Kelly's, there is an opportunity to recognize the value of wetlands and begin to dissolve the walls, physical and philosophical, built between humans and the sea.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sea-level-riseimage-recw5FD8I1e8ilYF7-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:34:14.835561

The U.S. May Have Other Plans.,"Anton Troianovski, Jeanna Smialek, Melissa Eddy, www.nytimes.com, anton-troianovski, jeanna-smialek, melissa-eddy",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/05/world/europe/us-russia-nord-stream-gas-pipeline.html,"European leaders are maneuvering to ensure the region doesn’t return to dependence on cheap Russian gas, worried about the leverage it would give the Kremlin.
That was not his job, Mr. Lynch says he answered, predicting that the Germans would eventually persuade themselves of the benefits.
Mr. Lynch argues that Europe will inevitably accept that it would benefit from the ability to increase Russian gas flows.
Undersea blasts in 2022 damaged both strands of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, and one of the two strands of Nord Stream 2.
European officials and analysts have been confused by the Trump administration’s ambiguous position on Russian gas for Europe, in part because it would undercut more expensive liquefied natural gas shipped from the United States.","European leaders are maneuvering to ensure the region doesn’t return to dependence on cheap Russian gas, worried about the leverage it would give the Kremlin.

Their recent moves come amid a push by an American investor and donor to the Trump campaign, who is betting that Europe will change its mind — and that the United States will be interested.

In a meeting last month with German economic officials, the investor, Stephen P. Lynch, proposed buying a much-criticized Russian undersea pipeline, called Nord Stream 2, to eventually deliver natural gas to Germany. He had already made the pitch to the Trump administration, figuring that the United States would want Americans controlling a pivotal piece of energy infrastructure.

The German officials were skeptical, Mr. Lynch recalled in an interview with The New York Times. And Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who is meeting with President Trump at the White House on Thursday, will reiterate his opposition to using Nord Stream 2 if the issue comes up, his spokesman said this week.

The position of the Trump administration on such a deal is unclear, though the American president, in his re-engagement with President Vladimir V. Putin, has said he wants to do business deals with Russia. American officials in April outlined a potential peace framework for Ukraine that included possibly resuming U.S. energy cooperation with Russia, according to two people with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.

The geopolitical jockeying over the pipeline shows how the future of Europe’s energy supply is once again emerging as a source of tension and vulnerability.

When Russia first mobilized for war, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed that, if Moscow invaded, “there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.” He imposed sanctions on the state-controlled company that owned it, while Germany refused to allow the newly completed pipeline to begin operation.

After the invasion, European businesses and governments sharply reduced their dependence on Russian gas, trying to punish Moscow economically even though the effort came at considerable cost to themselves.

In his May 6 meeting in Berlin, Mr. Lynch recalls, German officials asked how he intended to persuade them to allow Russian gas to flow through the pipeline, which was partially sabotaged in 2022. That was not his job, Mr. Lynch says he answered, predicting that the Germans would eventually persuade themselves of the benefits.

Mr. Merz declared last week that Germany would do “everything we can” to ensure that Nord Stream 2 “cannot be put back into operation.” The European Union said last month it was considering sanctions to “dissuade any interest, and notably interest from investors, in pursuing any activity on Nord Stream.”

“For Europe, it looks like Trump is still trying to make a separate peace with Putin,” said Sergey Vakulenko, an energy analyst at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “Europe is doing all it can to show that they won’t go along with it.”

The German Economy Ministry, where Mr. Lynch held his May 6 briefing at what he said was the ministry’s request, declined to comment for this article. The German news outlet Die Zeit reported earlier that Mr. Lynch had met with ministry officials.

The new European push to choke off future use of Nord Stream 2 comes as American and Russian officials suggest that their two countries could team up, rather than compete, in selling fossil fuels to Europe. The activities of well-connected investors like Mr. Lynch who see ways to profit from a warmer relationship between Washington and Moscow have added to the urgency.

Mr. Lynch argues that Europe will inevitably accept that it would benefit from the ability to increase Russian gas flows. Having Nord Stream 2 owned by an American entity would increase Western oversight over Russian gas sales, he contends, and it would allow Europe to avoid doing business directly with Russian entities and people under Western sanctions.

“When they decide that they need gas from Russia — which they will — we’ll be there,” Mr. Lynch said in an interview in London last week. “Eventually the European leadership will change their posture.”

Mr. Lynch, who spent two decades living in Moscow and is now based in Miami, describes his specialty as the “de-Russification” of Russian assets.

In 2022, the Treasury Department granted him approval to buy the Swiss subsidiary of the sanctioned Russian state bank Sberbank. He faced criticism for playing into the Kremlin’s hands in 2007 when buying up remnants of a Russian oil company whose main owner, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, had run afoul of Mr. Putin.

He unsuccessfully lobbied the Biden administration last year for a license that would have allowed him to negotiate for Nord Stream 2.

He renewed his push after Mr. Trump’s inauguration and in February filed a new application with the Treasury Department to deal with some Russian businesses and people under U.S. sanctions, according to a person close to Mr. Lynch who requested anonymity to speak about the ongoing process.

Mr. Lynch has donated more than $700,000 to Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign and other Republican causes since last year, Federal Election Commission filings show. Mr. Lynch added that he’d argued to U.S. officials that Nord Stream 2 “can be a geopolitical tool to align Russia with the West.”

“Absolutely no gas would flow until there is peace” in Ukraine, Mr. Lynch said.

The $11 billion pipeline, which is owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom and was financed by a who’s who of European energy companies, has been going through debt restructuring proceedings in a Swiss court. Mr. Lynch says that if granted a license to negotiate for it, he would line up other investors to join him and would expect to buy it at a steep discount. Any funds earmarked for Russia would be held in escrow until the Ukraine war ends, he says.

Mr. Putin began hinting at the idea in January, when he said after Mr. Trump’s inauguration that Moscow and Washington could work together to keep energy prices not “too high” and not “too low.” In March, the Russian president said that if “the United States and Russia agree on cooperating in the energy field, then a gas pipeline to Europe can be ensured.”

The head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, has discussed the idea of U.S. companies working with Russia to increase Russian gas sales to Europe with the White House envoy Steve Witkoff, according to former officials in Moscow and Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.

Undersea blasts in 2022 damaged both strands of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, and one of the two strands of Nord Stream 2. Germany would have to certify the safety of the pipelines before they could be used.

The European Commission declined to comment when asked whether new sanctions, now under development, against the Nord Stream pipelines would prevent companies and nations from buying fuel sent through them if they were American-owned.

European officials and analysts have been confused by the Trump administration’s ambiguous position on Russian gas for Europe, in part because it would undercut more expensive liquefied natural gas shipped from the United States.

But analysts say it could appeal to Mr. Trump if reduced European demand for American gas is seen as keeping U.S. energy prices in check.

Mr. Vakulenko, the Carnegie scholar, has described a Nord Stream 2 deal as a “viable prospect,” given the geopolitical advantages for Washington and because “German industry would benefit significantly from Russian gas.” But he warned in an interview that it would be a “bad” deal for Europe and for Ukraine, because from their perspective, “it’s making a deal behind their back.”

Germany was Europe’s biggest buyer of Russian gas before the Ukraine invasion, but it has since reduced its direct imports of Russian pipeline gas to zero. While Mr. Merz has taken a hard line against Nord Stream, some voices in his center-right party — not to mention in Germany’s Russia-friendly far left and far right — are urging a different tack.

“Production costs are too high,” Michael Kretschmer, the center-right governor of the eastern German state of Saxony, said in an interview published May 25 on the news outlet Zeit Online. He urged the government to reconsider its opposition to Nord Stream.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/03/multimedia/00russia-trump-energy-kmqb/00russia-trump-energy-kmqb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:34:18.814280

As the demand for renewable energy grows, the role of tax incentives in shaping our energy future is becoming increasingly important. More and more companies in the United States are seeking to meet their power needs with emissions-free electricity. To support this shift, tax incentives, along with legislation and policy, play a key role in determining energy prices and how quickly we are able to adopt clean energy technologies.

At Constellation, our advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. ensure these credits support the continued operation and growth of nuclear energy — the nation’s largest source of carbon-free power. These incentives make clean energy projects more affordable and also drive innovation and sustainability efforts across the energy industry. Understanding how these policies work and their potential impact is essential for any business that wants to get on the path to a more sustainable future.

Benefits of Tax Incentives

Tax incentives have been significant in encouraging businesses to adopt clean energy generation. By reducing the financial burden, more businesses are likely to invest in clean energy projects because they fit within their budgets. One key part of these incentives is tech-neutral tax credits, which ensure that all types of clean energy technologies get equal support. This approach helps drive innovation and diversification in the clean energy industry, creating a competitive environment that moves us forward.

For example, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) have played a large role in the growth of solar and wind energy in the United States. These credits have helped lower the cost of renewable energy projects, making them more competitive with traditional energy sources. The recently enacted production tax credit for existing nuclear plants has assured the continued operation of highly reliable nuclear units, the nation’s largest source of clean energy.

Tech-neutral tax credits are essential because they don’t favor one clean energy technology over another. This allows businesses to implement the most efficient and effective solutions for their operations. It also encourages innovation and the adoption of a wide range of clean energy solutions, from solar and wind to emerging technologies like advanced nuclear and carbon capture.

Impact on Electricity Prices

Tax incentives significantly influence electricity prices by lowering the cost of clean energy generation, which can stabilize and reduce prices for consumers. However, if these tax credits were removed, the cost of generating clean energy could rise, leading to higher electricity prices. This would negatively impact consumers and also slow down the transition to a cleaner energy grid. Therefore, it’s important to keep supportive policies in place to ensure clean energy remains affordable and accessible, benefiting both the economy and the environment.

Future Federal Policy Considerations

Looking ahead, it’s important to take a balanced approach to federal policy. Policymakers need to focus on the long-term goal of creating a self-sustaining market for clean energy. This means not only maintaining existing incentives but also looking into advancing manufacturing credits and other innovative policy measures. By doing so, we can support the growth of the clean energy industry and support a more stable economy.

Advanced manufacturing credits can play a significant role in this transition by supporting the development and implementation of new technologies. These credits can lower the cost of manufacturing clean energy technologies, making them more competitive with traditional energy sources. Future federal policies should also focus on creating a stable and predictable regulatory environment, which is key to attracting investment and fostering innovation.

Texas’ ERCOT market has the most to lose with 128 GW of clean energy capacity expected to come online in 2028 or later.
“With the stroke of a pen, Congress could put an end to the clean energy boom that has transformed the country over the last decade.","After the House passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in May, the Solar Energy Industries Association released the report, America’s solar industry is under threat that found the bill could jeopardize the buildout of domestic manufacturing and lead to the loss of planned solar projects.

Cleanview, a clean energy market intelligence company based in Boulder, Colorado corroborates this in its report, Repealing the IRA puts 600 GW of clean energy capacity at risk.

An earlier iteration of the bill presented by the House Ways and Means Committee proposed a gradual step-down in tax credits, but the House bill, which is now with the Senate for possible changes and a vote, has a much more stringent process for qualifying for tax credits. For example, in order for developers to qualify for 45Y Production Tax Credit and 48E Investment Tax, construction must begin within 60 days of the President signing the bill into law and the projects must be placed into service by the end of 2028.

In addition, rules around foreign entities of concern (FEOC) would deny tax credits to owners of projects that use materials and equipment from companies in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.

Cleanview commented on the fact that a project will lose its credit entirely if it is not operational by the end of 2028, stating that it creates “much more risk for a project developer who has little control over whether a local county issues their permit or if a 100-year pandemic wreaks havoc on global supply chains.”

While projects may be planned and ready for development, American Clean Power finds that clean energy projects experience delays in permitting or supply chain issues of 16 months. With supply chain problems at risk of getting worse due to recent tariffs, “these compressed timeframes put a huge portion of planned utility-scale solar, wind and battery projects at risk,” according to Cleanview. “Developers will essentially have to rush to begin work within a two-month window and achieve completion within ~3.5 years.”

Cleanview estimates that 223 GW of solar projects are at risk.

At greatest risk

Storage projects face the highest risk with 265 GW of capacity planned for 2028 and beyond, according to the report. Cleanview finds that 136K of storage is planned to come online in 2028, with 127K expected to come online after 2028.

Energy storage faces high risk in part due to its incredible success. “In recent years, developers have planned hundreds of gigawatts of storage capacity, thanks to falling costs and the IRA’s unprecedented policy support,” Michael Thomas, Cleanview founder and CEO told pv magazine USA. “That’s led it to be disproportionately represented in the interconnection queues.”

In states with notoriously slow permitting timelines, like California, projects face an even higher risk. Cleanview projects that 183 GW (or 79%) of projects in California’s CAISO face the highest risk.

Texas’ ERCOT market has the most to lose with 128 GW of clean energy capacity expected to come online in 2028 or later. The report authors acknowledge that this may overstate the amount of capacity at risk in the Texas market because of the speed at which Texas has granted permits in the past.

To generate the figures for the report, Cleanview used its project tracker to quantify how many projects that could lose tax credits are at risk of cancellation given how important the incentives are to project viability. Cleanview looked at how much capacity is expected to come online between 2028 and 2035 across the major RTOs and ISOs because any coming online in 2029 or later would not qualify for tax credits.

Cleanview said revision and/or passage of the Bill represents a pivotal moment for America’s energy future. “With the stroke of a pen, Congress could put an end to the clean energy boom that has transformed the country over the last decade. In doing so, they could put many national priorities, shared by Democrats and Republicans alike, at risk.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/12/BLM-e1590101643259.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:17.610638

Ocean Conference here next week, scientists are urging them to take action to combat a dual climate and biodiversity crisis plaguing marine ecosystems, and base their decisions on the best available science.

To guide them, the International Scientific Committee of the One Ocean Science Congress unveiled a list of comprehensive recommendations for ocean recovery its members hope can be transformed into actionable policy.

“We say, act where science is clear,” said François Houllier, a member of the committee and president and managing director of Ifremar, a French ocean research institute that co-organized the scientific summit.

The 18-member committee spent the last year developing the list of recommendations and included insights from some of the 2,000 scientists in attendance at the four-day congress in the French Riviera.

“This is our responsibility to clearly tell what we know,” said Houllier.

The list of recommendations are organized around 10 topics that will be discussed during next week’s conference, which will be co-hosted by France and Costa Rica and bring together not only heads of state and government, but also financial institutions, NGOs, civil society groups, Indigenous peoples and philanthropists.

The main objective of the summit will be to implement one of the U.N.’s 17 sustainable development goals—Goal 14 or Life Below Water—aimed at managing the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, marine biodiversity and resources.

Historically, many scientists at the congress said, this goal has been overlooked and underfunded. On average, nations dedicate less than 2 percent of their research budgets to ocean science, which is significantly less than what they spend on other areas of research, according to UNESCO.

But they’re paying the price.

The global ocean is warming at an alarming rate. Coral reefs, which support more than 25 percent of all marine life, are bleaching en masse due to repeated and long-lasting marine heatwaves.

Overfishing and illegal fishing are contributing to fish stock declines, particularly in some of the most populated parts of the world that depend on seafood as a main source of protein. As temperatures continue to rise, so do sea levels and the intensity of more frequent catastrophic storms.

“You cannot deal with the crisis of the climate without also dealing with the crisis of the ocean and vice versa,”said John Kerry, the former U.S. secretary of state, during a live-streamed video speech he gave Thursday to scientists.

The ten recommendations made by the congress address both. Some reiterate what scientists have been calling for for decades— a “strong and urgent phase out of fossil fuel use” in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, for instance.

Efforts to end marine plastic pollution entangling sea turtles, whales and other marine species must be made by investing in new technologies that can produce alternatives to plastic. Recently, some companies have begun to use seaweed for such purposes, said Houllier.

Likewise, governments should end illicit, unreported and unregulated fishing by eliminating harmful government subsidies that incentivise overfishing in international waters.

“Many nations are subsidizing the fishing industry, which leads to too large a number of boats,” said Jean-Pierre Gattuso, an oceanographer and research director of the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), a French organization that co-organized the congress with Ifremar. He is also a member of the scientific committee that developed the recommendations. While the fishing industry has grown significantly since 1950, he said, “there is no increase in the amount of fish that is available.”

The first recommendation promotes a newer and more inclusive marine conservation approach by encouraging a shift from humanity’s extractive relationship with the sea to one that promotes “responsibility, respect and reverence,” according to the first recommendation titled “Inspiring Ocean Stewardship.”

Inspiring Ocean Stewardship

To do this, the list of recommendations recognizes the importance of integrating Indigenous and other traditional knowledge systems in marine policy and encouraging their collaboration with scientists. It also recognizes the intrinsic rights of marine life and states: “We advocate for legal personhood initiatives for marine ecosystems to advance conservation and raise awareness.”

Other recommendations promote a precautionary and equitable approach to utilizing marine resources. The fourth recommendation asks leaders to pause harmful activities in the deep ocean such as oil and gas extraction, deep sea mining and destructive fishing practices like bottom trawling. Instead, it suggests more robust efforts be made to understand deep ecosystems better through vigorous research in this largely unexplored realm.

Proceeding With Caution

The second recommendation aimed at promoting safe and equitable ocean-based climate solutions encourages decision makers to explore marine carbon dioxide removal from the ocean with caution.

“It is a hot topic because there is an urgency to decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere,” said Gatusso. “All eyes are turning to the ocean,” as sequestration of carbon on land proves difficult.

Capturing and storing carbon dioxide in the ocean relies on various techniques, including cultivating or sinking seaweed, ocean alkalinity enhancement and nutrient fertilization. Some estimates, according to the World Resources Institute, show that billions of tons of carbon could be stored in the ocean each year by midcentury. “There are also some risks,” said Houllier. “Here we say, please let us continue to do research before taking decisions that could be harmful.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/OceansNice.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:27:25.552320

Large-scale biomass plants, including Drax Power Station, are an important part of the U.K.’s renewable energy mix. Current government support for large-scale biomass power plants ends in 2027.

The DESNZ in February announced plans to move forward with a short-term support mechanism for large-scale biomass generators. The extended subsidies aim to both support the move to BECCS and support the U.K.’s energy security. Biomass currently supplies approximately 5% of U.K. electricity generation.

The U.K. government has indicated that transitional support for biomass power will be for lower volumes of generation than under current subsidies and will be designed to maximize energy security benefits. The transitional support will be offered as a contract for difference (CfD) with a generation collar. The new subsidies will be limited to biomass generators that have a minimum electricity export of 100 megawatts (MW). Eligible generators will also have to meet biomass sustainability criteria. In addition, the government has set a greenhouse gas (GHG) threshold at t 36.6 gCO2e/MJ, which aligns with the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED III).

According statements issued by Drax earlier this year, the transitional subsidies will be available for all four biomass units at Drax Power Station with an aggregate collar of c.6TWh pa (and a minimum of c.5TWh pa). The subsidies will be available from April 2027 through March 2031.

The SAU is an agency that assists public authorities by providing independent non-binding reports in relation to subsidies or subsidy schemes that meet certain statutory requirements.

In its June 4 announcement, SAU said it will prepare a report evaluating DESNZ’s assessment of whether the proposed subsidy complies with subsidy control requirements. The report is scheduled to be published by July 10.

Additional information is available on the SAU website.

Trump had largely remained silent as Musk stewed over the last few days on his social media platform X, condemning the president’s signature tax cuts and spending bill. But Trump clapped back Thursday in the Oval Office, lamented their frayed relationship and said he was “very disappointed in Musk.”

Musk responded on social media in real time. Trump ratcheted up the stakes when he turned to his own social media network, Truth Social, and threatened to use the U.S. government to hurt Musk’s bottom line with his internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX.

“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social media network. “I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”

“This just gets better and better,” Musk quickly replied on X. “Go ahead, make my day.”

The deepening rift unfurled much like their relationship started — rapidly, intensely and very publicly.

It also quickly hit Musk financially, even before Trump’s threat.

After Trump started speaking about Musk, shares of his electric vehicle company Tesla fell 9%, their latest notable move since the election. The shares doubled in the weeks after Trump was elected, gave back those gains and more during Musk’s time at DOGE and then rallied after he vowed in April to focus much more on Tesla and his other companies.

Musk later offered up an especially stinging insult to a president sensitive about his standing among voters: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk retorted. “Such ingratitude,” Musk said in a follow-up post.

Politicians and their donor patrons rarely see eye to eye. But the magnitude of Musk’s support for Trump, spending at least $250 million backing his campaign, and the scope of free reign the president gave him to slash and delve into the government with the Department of Government Efficiency is eclipsed only by the speed of their falling out.

Musk announced his support for Trump shortly after the then-candidate was nearly assassinated on stage at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally last July. News of Musk’s political action committee in support of Trump’s election came days later.

Musk soon became a close adviser and frequent companion, memorably leaping in the air behind Trump on stage at a rally in October. Once Trump was elected, the tech billionaire stood behind him as he took the oath of office, flew with him on Air Force One for weekend stays at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, slept in the White House’s Lincoln Bedroom at the president’s invitation and joined his Cabinet meetings wearing a MAGA hat (sometimes more than one).

“I’ll be honest, I think he missed the place,” Trump said Thursday. “He got out there, and all of a sudden he wasn’t in this beautiful Oval Office.”

Musk bid farewell to Trump last week in a subdued news conference in the Oval Office, where he sported a black eye that he said came from his young son but that seemed to be a metaphor for his messy time in government service.

Trump, who rarely misses an opportunity to zing his critics on appearance, brought it up Thursday.

“I said, ‘Do you want a little makeup? We’ll get you a little makeup.’ Which is interesting,” Trump said.

The Republican president’s comments came as Musk has stewed for days on social media about Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” warning that it will increase the federal deficit. Musk has called the bill a “disgusting abomination.”

“He hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that will be next,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office. “But I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.”

Observers had long wondered if the friendship between the two brash billionaires known for lobbing insults online would flame out in spectacular fashion. It did, in less than a year.

“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump said.

The president said some people who leave his administration “miss it so badly” and “actually become hostile.”

“It’s sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it,” he said.

He brushed aside the billionaire’s efforts to get him elected last year, including a $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes in Pennsylvania. The surge of cash Musk showed he was willing to spend seemed to set him up as a highly coveted ally for Republicans going forward, but his split with Trump, the party’s leader, raises questions about whether they or any others will see such a campaign windfall in the future.

Trump said Musk, the CEO and founder of Tesla, “only developed a problem” with the bill because it rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles.

“False,” Musk fired back on his social media platform as the president continued speaking. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”

In another post, he said Trump could keep the spending cuts but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.”

The bill would unleash trillions of dollars in tax cuts and slash spending but also spike deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, which for decades has served as the official scorekeeper of legislation in Congress.

Besides Musk being “disturbed” by the electric vehicle tax credits, Trump said another point of contention was Musk’s promotion of Jared Isaacman to run NASA.

Trump withdrew Isaacman’s nomination over the weekend, days after Musk left his government role.

“I didn’t think it was appropriate,” Trump said, calling Isaacman “totally a Democrat.”

Musk, reverting to his main form of political activity before he joined forces with Trump, continued slinging his responses on social media.

He shared some posts Trump made over a decade ago criticizing Republicans for their spending, musings made when he, too, was just a billionaire lobbing his thoughts on social media.

“Where is the man who wrote these words?” Musk wrote. “Was he replaced by a body double!?”

Envision Automotive Energy Supply Co. (AESC) announced the work stoppage Thursday, two years after breaking ground on the facility near Florence.

“AESC has informed the state of South Carolina and our local partners that due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement. “We anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize.”

The Japanese-headquartered firm already has invested more than $1 billion into the Florence facility, Grantham said.

He said the company “fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years,” but did not indicate what the new timeline might be. The company declined to provide further comment.

Gov. Henry McMaster, while speaking to reporters, pointed to uncertainty in Washington, D.C., as a reason.

“We hate to see that happen, but a pause is OK,” he said, noting a temporary suspension last week at Volvo’s Lowcountry plant.

The staunch supporter of President Donald Trump said “there’s no doubt” that changes must be made to international trade policy, while recognizing the administration’s roller coaster tariff announcements will have an effect.

“The tariffs are going up and down, and some of those are being paused,” McMaster said.

He also addressed the uncertainty of what Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending will do for the electric vehicle industry. As passed by the U.S. House, the bill would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits, both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those who install EV charging stations at their homes or business. It’s unclear what the Senate will do.

Regardless, McMaster said he’s confident that South Carolina’s economy, “despite all the ups and downs, is still going up, up, up.”

He said he’s communicating with South Carolina’s delegation, company officials, and the White House.

“Let things play out, because all of these changes are taking place,” the governor said. “So, I’d say, relax if you can. … We believe that, give it some time, and it’ll work out.”

The industry already wasn’t meeting early growth expectations before Trump took office.

However, electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally.

Electric vehicle battery companies in SC among the latest to hit speed bumps

But the lag in growth has led to multiple setbacks for the fledgling industry, with canceled investments both nationally and in the Palmetto State. Automakers have also eased away from goals of going all-electric in favor of a mix of electric and plug-in hybrids.

A repeal of consumer tax credits could further slow progress.

AESC’s pause comes just four months after the battery cell manufacturer pulled back on earlier plans to expand the plant beyond its original scope.

BMW contracted with AESC to produce battery cells for the German auto giant’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in the Upstate. The automaker has already invested $700 million dollars in its own battery plant in Woodruff, planning to place the cells it receives from AESC into the batteries it assembles there.

BMW spokesman Steve Wilson said those battery assembly plans are still on schedule to begin in 2026.

Between the initial announcement in 2022 and March 2024, AESC rolled out three separate rounds of investment and promises of jobs in Florence. In addition to supplying BMW’s Spartanburg County assembly plant, the company made plans for a second building that was supposed to produce battery cells for a BMW plant in Mexico.

But in February, AESC told the state the first factory would be enough to meet the demand for both of BMW’s facilities. It pulled out of plans for a second, $1.5 billion building, along with the 1,080 jobs that came with it.

In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.

The incentives claw back was a rare move for the state. But even with the pull back, AESC’s remaining plant had still been on track to become the largest economic development deal in the Pee Dee region, according to the state Department of Commerce.

The remaining $121 million in bonds and $135 million in grants Commerce offered as an initial incentive to lure AESC to South Carolina are so far unaffected by the shutdown, Commerce spokeswoman Alex Clark.

“South Carolina is fully and unequivocally committed to supporting existing companies, including AESC,” Clark said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47658/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/governor_secretary_aesc_edited_photo-1024x6831749181296.png?h=199d8c1f&itok=i0QKsF1v,N,,2025-06-06 08:24:15.241340

» MORE: After West Texas fire, lawmakers approve ban on outdoor chemical storage facilities near homes — Travis Bubenik, Marfa Public Radio","After 140 days at the Capitol in Austin, the Texas Legislature has just wrapped up its 89th session.

This year, state lawmakers passed over 1,200 bills. Among them were several important pieces of legislation focused on energy and the environment. Barring a veto from Gov. Greg Abbott, these will soon become law in Texas.

Here's a breakdown of some of those measures.

A push for water security and wildfire resilience

Abbott opened this year's legislative session by naming water as one of his top priorities.

""We will make the largest investment in water in the history of Texas,"" said Abbott in his State of the State address. ""We will tap into new water supplies and repair pipes to save billions of gallons of water each year.""

The numbers back up the need: According to the Texas Water Development Board, groundwater availability is expected to drop by 25% by 2070. Supply will be decreasing even as demand is expected to double – possibly much sooner.

Across the Texas Plains and Panhandle, farmers rely heavily on groundwater for irrigation, putting enormous pressure on the state's aquifers. But that's also changing in Texas.

""Our municipal demand is steadily increasing and will surpass the irrigation,"" said L'Oreal Stepney, chairwoman for the Texas Water Development Board, before lawmakers earlier in the session.

""Municipal is going to be the number one user, and it'll be here before we know it,"" she added.

A new bill, Senate Bill 7, would pump $1 billion each year into the Texas Water Fund. The money will go toward developing new water sources and shoring up old infrastructure — a lifeline for both farmers and growing cities.

Meanwhile, the Panhandle, still reeling from the state's largest-ever wildfire last year, saw movement on another front. Lawmakers passed SB 34, aimed at strengthening rural firefighting capacity — most of which relies on volunteers. The bill boosts potential grant funding and support for those departments.

Both the water and wildfire bills are now on Gov. Abbott's desk.

Lawmakers say no to renewable energy limits – but yes to grid investment

One of the big questions this session: would Texas put the brakes on renewable energy?

Proposals like Senate Bill 715 and Senate Bill 388 sought to limit the growth of wind and solar – or at least make them more expensive to develop. Supporters argued that would help stabilize the grid. Critics warned it would only drive up costs.

In a rare alliance, environmental, business and renewable energy groups pushed back and both bills failed. Bryn Baker, senior policy director for Texas Energy Buyers Alliance, was among those leading the opposition.

""This is about cost and reliability. Full stop. And if you're talking about making things more expensive – you've got a whole bunch of folks interested and concerned,"" Baker said.

Instead, lawmakers approved a major expansion of the Texas Energy Fund: $5 billion more to help build new power plants and fund grid resilience projects.

Keeping chemical storage away from homes

Texas lawmakers have approved a ban on certain types of outdoor chemical storage facilities being located close to homes, a response to an Odessa-area industrial fire nearly a year ago that allegedly filled a neighborhood with ""black sludge.""

State Rep. Brooks Landgraf (R-Odessa) proposed the ban after the massive fire in July 2024 at Permian Basin Containers, a facility where a mix of oil industry-related chemicals and liquids were stored in stacked piles of large plastic tubs.

People living right next door to the facility said in a resulting lawsuit that the fire flooded their neighborhood with a mysterious sludge that seeped into homes and cars. The neighbors also reported a strong, noxious odor in the wake of the fire. Landgraf also raised concerns about the potential for groundwater contamination from the incident.

Landgraf's legislation, House Bill 3866, was sent to the governor's desk in the final days of the state's 2025 legislative session. It creates a ban on ""intermediate bulk container recycling"" facilities being located within 2,000 feet of a private residence.

Tesla Inc.’s shares sank as Elon Musk and President Donald Trump’s simmering feud devolved into a public war of words between two of the world’s most powerful people.

Trump on June 5 said that he was “very disappointed” by the Tesla CEO’s criticism of the president’s signature tax policy bill. Musk fired back in several social media posts, saying in one that “without me, Trump would have lost the election.”

The president later floated terminating federal contracts and subsidies extended to Musk’s companies and said he had asked the Tesla and SpaceX leader to leave his administration, which Musk said was a “lie.” Musk went a step further late in the day, saying he would decommission a SpaceX craft used by the U.S.

Tesla’s shares dropped 14% on June 5 in New York, the stock’s biggest decline since March 10. The rout erased about $150 billion from the electric vehicle maker’s market value. The stock fell another 2.2% as of 4:39 p.m. in post-market trading.

The spectacle of the world’s richest person and the leader of the free world lobbing insults toward one another on social media marks a stunning breakup of a once formidable political alliance.

Musk spent more than $250 million to help secure Trump’s return to the White House. Trump in turn deputized Musk to lead a sweeping effort to slash government spending and reshape the federal bureaucracy before the mercurial billionaire stepped back from that role last week.

Ross Gerber, the CEO of Tesla shareholder Gerber Kawasaki, sharply criticized Musk’s behavior in a Bloomberg TV interview, saying it could lead to lawsuits from the automaker’s investors and cut the value of SpaceX in half.

“Elon isn’t functioning to the benefit of his shareholders,” said Gerber, whose firm has substantially reduced its Tesla holdings over the last few years. The meltdown is leading to the “dismantling of the Musk empire in real time.”

The conflict raises the specter of Trump wielding government powers to retaliate against Musk’s companies, similar to actions the president has taken to attack other perceived enemies, such as Harvard University.

It also injects doubts about whether Trump’s administration will deliver key policy changes Musk has sought, namely a framework that would liberalize deployment of autonomous vehicles that Musk has said are critical to Tesla’s future and its market value.

RELATED: Tesla Targets June 12 Rollout of Robotaxi Service in Austin

Already, policies being advanced by Trump and Republican lawmakers are putting billions of dollars at risk for Tesla, which is by far Musk’s largest business.

Trump’s massive tax bill would largely eliminate a credit worth as much as $7,500 for buyers of some Tesla models and other electric vehicles by the end of this year, seven years ahead of schedule. That would translate to a roughly $1.2 billion hit to Tesla’s full-year profit, according to JPMorgan analysts.

RELATED: House Backs Electric Vehicle, Hybrid Fees in Budget Bill

After leaving his formal advisory role in the White House last week, Musk has been on a mission to block the president’s signature tax bill that he described as a “disgusting abomination.” The world’s richest person has been lobbying Republican lawmakers — including making a direct appeal to House Speaker Mike Johnson — to preserve the valuable EV tax credits in the legislation.

Separate legislation passed by the Senate attacking California’s EV sales mandates poses another $2 billion headwind for Tesla’s sales of regulatory credits, according to JPMorgan.

Taken together, those measures threaten roughly half of the more than $6 billion in earnings before interest and taxes that Wall Street expects Tesla to post this year, analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a May 30 report.

Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The House-passed tax bill would aggressively phase out tax credits for the production of clean electricity and other sources years earlier than scheduled. It also includes stringent restrictions on the use of Chinese components and materials that analysts said would render the credits useless and limits the ability of companies to sell the tax credits to third parties.

Tesla’s division focused on solar systems and batteries separately criticized the Republican bill for gutting clean energy tax credits, saying that “abruptly ending” the incentives would threaten U.S. energy independence and the reliability of the power grid.

The clean energy and EV policies under threat were largely enacted as part of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. The law was designed to encourage companies to build a domestic supply chain for clean energy and electric vehicles, giving companies more money if they produce more batteries and EVs in the U.S. Tesla has a broad domestic footprint, including car factories in Texas and California, a lithium refinery and battery plants.

With those Biden-era policies in place, US EV sales rose 7.3% to a record 1.3 million vehicles last year, according to Cox Automotive data.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-06/Musk-Trump-1200.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:24:19.202656

Getting federal approval for permits to build bridges, wind farms, highways and other major infrastructure projects has long been a complicated and time-consuming process. Despite growing calls from both parties for Congress and federal agencies to reform that process, there had been few significant revisions – until now.

In one fell swoop, the U.S. Supreme Court has changed a big part of the game.

Whether the effects are good or bad depends on the viewer’s perspective. Either way, there is a new interpretation in place for the law that is the centerpiece of the debate about permitting – the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, known as NEPA.

Taking a big-picture look

NEPA requires federal agencies to document and describe the environmental effects of any proposed action, including construction of oil pipelines, renewable energy and other infrastructure projects.

Only after completing that work can the agency make a final decision to approve or deny the project. These reports must evaluate direct effects, such as the destruction of habitat to make way for a new highway, and indirect effects, such as the air pollution from cars using the highway after it is built.

Decades of litigation about the scope of indirect effects have widened the required evaluation. As I explain it to my students, that logical and legal progression is reminiscent of the popular children’s book “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,” in which granting a request for a cookie triggers a seemingly endless series of further requests – for a glass of milk, a napkin and so on. For the highway example, the arguments went, even if the agency properly assessed the pollution from the cars, it also had to consider the new subdivisions, malls and jobs the new highway foreseeably could induce.

The challenge for federal agencies was knowing how much of that potentially limitless series of indirect effects courts would require them to evaluate. In recent litigation, the question in particular has been how broad a range of effects on and from climate change could be linked to any one specific project and therefore require evaluation.

With the court’s ruling, federal agencies’ days of uncertainty are over.

Biggest NEPA case in decades

On May 29, 2025, the Supreme Court – minus Justice Neil Gorsuch, who had recused himself – decided the case of Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado, the first major NEPA dispute before the court in 20 years.

At issue was an 85-mile rail line a group of developers proposed to build in Utah to connect oil wells to the interstate rail network and from there transport waxy crude oil to refineries in Louisiana, Texas and elsewhere. The federal Surface Transportation Board reviewed the environmental effects and approved the required license in 2021.

The report was 637 pages long, with more than 3,000 pages of appendices containing additional information. It acknowledged but did not give a detailed assessment of the indirect “upstream” effects of constructing the rail line – such as spurring new oil drilling – and the indirect “downstream” effects of the ultimate use of the waxy oil in places as far flung as Louisiana.

In February 2022, Eagle County, Colorado, through which trains coming from the new railway would pass, along with the Center for Biological Diversity appealed that decision in federal court, arguing that the board had failed to properly explain why it did not assess those effects. Therefore, the county argued, the report was incomplete and the board license should be vacated.

In August 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed and held that the agency had failed to adequately explain why it could not employ “some degree of forecasting” to identify those impacts and that the board could prevent those effects by exercising its authority to deny the license.

The railway developers appealed to the Supreme Court, asking whether NEPA requires a federal agency to look beyond the action being proposed to evaluate indirect effects outside its own jurisdiction.

A resounding declaration

Writing for a five-justice majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh delivered a ringing, table-pounding lecture about courts run amok.

Kavanaugh did not stop to provide specific support for each admonition, describing NEPA as a “legislative acorn” that has “grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development.” He bemoaned the “delay upon delay” NEPA imposes on projects as so complicated that it bordered “on the Kafkaesque.”

In his view, “NEPA has transformed from a modest procedural requirement into a blunt and haphazard tool employed by project opponents.” He called for “a course correction … to bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense.” His opinion reset the course in three ways.

First, despite the Supreme Court having recently reduced the deference courts must give to federal agency decisions in other contexts, Kavanaugh wrote that courts should give agencies strong deference when reviewing an agency’s NEPA effects analyses. Because these assessments are “fact-dependent, context-specific, and policy-laden choices about the depth and breadth of its inquiry … (c)ourts should afford substantial deference and should not micromanage those agency choices so long as they fall within a broad zone of reasonableness.”

Second, Kavanaugh crafted a new rule saying that the review of one project did not need to consider the potential indirect effects of other related projects it could foreseeably induce, such as the rail line encouraging more drilling for oil. This limitation is especially relevant, Kavanaugh emphasized, when the effects are from projects over which the reviewing agency does not have jurisdiction. That applied in this case, because the board does not regulate oil wells or oil drilling.

And third, Kavanaugh created something like a “no harm – no foul” rule, under which “even if an (environmental impact statement) falls short in some respects, that deficiency may not necessarily require a court to vacate the agency’s ultimate approval of a project.” The strong implication is that courts should not overturn an agency decision unless its NEPA assessment has a serious flaw.

The upshot for the project at hand was that the Supreme Court deferred to the board’s decision that it could not reliably predict the rail line’s effects on oil drilling or use of the oil transported. And the fact that the agency had no regulatory power over those separate issues reinforced the idea that those concerns were outside the scope of the board’s required review.

A split court

Although Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote that she would have reached the same end result and upheld the agency permit, her proposed test is far narrower.

By her reading, the federal law creating the Surface Transportation Board restricted it from considering the broader indirect effects of the rail line. But her finding would be relevant only for any federal agencies whose governing statutes were similarly restrictive. By contrast, Kavanaugh’s “course correction” applies to judicial review of NEPA findings for all federal agencies.

Though the full effects remain to be seen, this decision significantly changes the legal landscape of environmental reviews of major projects. Agencies will have more latitude to shorten the causal chain of indirect effects they consider – and to exclude them entirely if they flow from separate projects beyond the agency’s regulatory control.

Now, for example, if a federal agency is considering an application to build a new natural gas power plant, the review must still include its direct greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on the climate. But emissions that could result from additional gas extraction and transportation projects to fuel the power plant, and any climate effects from whatever the produced electricity is used for, are now clearly outside the agency’s required review. And if the agency voluntarily decided to consider any of those effects, courts would have to defer to its analysis, and any minor deficiencies would be inconsequential.

That is a far cry from how the legal structure around the National Environmental Policy Act has worked for decades. For lawyers, industry, advocacy groups and the courts, environmental review after the Eagle County decision is not just a new ballgame; it is a new sport.

Stock prices in the electric vehicle company dropped 47 points by the end of trading, down from its midday peak of 335.53.

Why It Matters

A growing division has emerged between Musk and Trump since the former left the White House at the end of May, with the president's ""big, beautiful bill"" becoming a major point of contention between the two former allies.

What To Know

During a White House meeting on Thursday, Trump said that he had been disappointed in Musk's criticism of the budget bill, suggesting that the billionaire opposed it because it removed electric vehicle tax credits.

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,"" Trump told reporters. ""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to to cut the EV mandate.""

""Whatever,"" Musk shot back on X, formerly Twitter, in what began a flurry of furious posts aimed at the president.

He later claimed that Trump would have lost the election without his support, adding ""such ingratitude.""

Trump responded with his own post on Truth Social, suggesting that the government should ""terminate"" Musk's federal subsidies and contracts.

The war of words has already taken a toll on Tesla, which saw a double-digit percentage drop. Forbes estimates the drop wiped $17.2 billion from Musk's previous $400 billion fortune.

Tesla stock had begun to rally last month, jumping 22 percent after Musk announced he was leaving the Department of Government Efficiency and would focus on his role as Tesla's CEO. The electric car company has suffered since Musk joined the Trump administration, with protests at dealerships and a rapid decline in sales and stock prices.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday: ""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore.""

Elon Musk, on X: Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude.""

President Donald Trump posted on social media: ""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!""

What Happens Next

Trump and Musk continued to spar online through Thursday afternoon. Meanwhile, the president has given senators until July 4 to pass the bill.

As passed by the U.S. House, the bill would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits, both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those who install EV charging stations at their homes or business.
However, electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally.
In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.
“South Carolina is fully and unequivocally committed to supporting existing companies, including AESC,” Clark said.","A battery cell maker is pausing work on its manufacturing plant under construction in the Pee Dee, delaying its pledge of 1,600 new jobs for South Carolinians.

Envision Automotive Energy Supply Co. (AESC) announced the work stoppage Thursday, two years after breaking ground on the facility near Florence.

“AESC has informed the state of South Carolina and our local partners that due to policy and market uncertainty, we are pausing construction at our South Carolina facility at this time,” spokesman Brad Grantham said in a statement. “We anticipate being able to resume construction once circumstances stabilize.”

The Japanese-headquartered firm already has invested more than $1 billion into the Florence facility, Grantham said.

He said the company “fully intends to meet our commitments to invest $1.6 billion and create 1,600 jobs in the coming years,” but did not indicate what the new timeline might be. The company declined to provide further comment.

Gov. Henry McMaster, while speaking to reporters, pointed to uncertainty in Washington, D.C., as a reason.

“We hate to see that happen, but a pause is OK,” he said, noting a temporary suspension last week at Volvo’s Lowcountry plant.

The staunch supporter of President Donald Trump said “there’s no doubt” that changes must be made to international trade policy, while recognizing the administration’s roller coaster tariff announcements will have an effect.

“The tariffs are going up and down, and some of those are being paused,” McMaster said.

He also addressed the uncertainty of what Republicans’ massive bill on taxes and spending will do for the electric vehicle industry. As passed by the U.S. House, the bill would eliminate electric vehicle tax credits, both for people who purchase new or used electric vehicles and those who install EV charging stations at their homes or business. It’s unclear what the Senate will do.

Regardless, McMaster said he’s confident that South Carolina’s economy, “despite all the ups and downs, is still going up, up, up.”

He said he’s communicating with South Carolina’s delegation, company officials, and the White House.

“Let things play out, because all of these changes are taking place,” the governor said. “So, I’d say, relax if you can. … We believe that, give it some time, and it’ll work out.”

The industry already wasn’t meeting early growth expectations before Trump took office.

However, electric vehicle sales have continued to rise, both nationally and globally.

Electric vehicle battery companies in SC among the latest to hit speed bumps

But the lag in growth has led to multiple setbacks for the fledgling industry, with canceled investments both nationally and in the Palmetto State. Automakers have also eased away from goals of going all-electric in favor of a mix of electric and plug-in hybrids.

A repeal of consumer tax credits could further slow progress.

AESC’s pause comes just four months after the battery cell manufacturer pulled back on earlier plans to expand the plant beyond its original scope.

BMW contracted with AESC to produce battery cells for the German auto giant’s U.S. manufacturing facilities in the Upstate. The automaker has already invested $700 million dollars in its own battery plant in Woodruff, planning to place the cells it receives from AESC into the batteries it assembles there.

BMW spokesman Steve Wilson said those battery assembly plans are still on schedule to begin in 2026.

Between the initial announcement in 2022 and March 2024, AESC rolled out three separate rounds of investment and promises of jobs in Florence. In addition to supplying BMW’s Spartanburg County assembly plant, the company made plans for a second building that was supposed to produce battery cells for a BMW plant in Mexico.

But in February, AESC told the state the first factory would be enough to meet the demand for both of BMW’s facilities. It pulled out of plans for a second, $1.5 billion building, along with the 1,080 jobs that came with it.

In turn, South Carolina withdrew its offer of $111 million in state funding for that particular phase.

The incentives claw back was a rare move for the state. But even with the pull back, AESC’s remaining plant had still been on track to become the largest economic development deal in the Pee Dee region, according to the state Department of Commerce.

The remaining $121 million in bonds and $135 million in grants Commerce offered as an initial incentive to lure AESC to South Carolina are so far unaffected by the shutdown, Commerce spokeswoman Alex Clark.

Businesses have cancelled or delayed more than $14 billion of investments in US clean energy projects so far this year, reflecting their uncertainty and pessimism over federal support amid President Donald Trump’s climate policy retreat, industry analysts reported Thursday.

The sector still is showing resilience—at least $4.2 billion in new renewable energy, grid, electric vehicle and battery projects were announced over the same time period, from January through April, according to the tracking report by the nonprofit group Environmental Entrepreneurs, or E2, and its research partner, Atlas Public Policy.

Some 10,000 jobs are expected to be created by these newly announced projects—including an electric truck assembly plant that the Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Auto said it would site in Warsaw, Indiana. That’s equal to the estimated number of job losses from all the clean energy projects that have been abandoned so far this year. Nevertheless, it’s a sharp reversal of trends E2 tracked in the sector over the previous three years, when $127.7 billion in new clean energy project announcements outpaced cancellations at a rate of nearly 50-to-1.

Officials at E2, a nonpartisan group of clean energy business leaders and investors, said it was an ominous sign as the Senate prepares to take up Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the House-passed tax and spending cut package that would eliminate most of the clean energy tax credits Congress passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

“If the tax plan passed by the House last week becomes law, expect to see construction and investments stopping in states across the country as more projects and jobs are cancelled,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director for E2. “Businesses are now counting on Congress to come to its senses and stop this costly attack on an industry that is essential to meeting America’s growing energy demand and that’s driving unprecedented economic growth in every part of the country.”

The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the report.

The biggest of the cancellations that E2 tracked came in April. The United Auto Workers announced that Stellantis would not go forward with a $3.2 billion battery plant it planned to add to a giant shuttered assembly facility it is reopening in Belvidere, Illinois. And global energy giant RWE announced it was shuttering its US offshore wind operations “for the time being” due to “the political environment” in the United States. RWE had invested $1.1 billion to develop wind projects offshore of New York, Louisiana and California.

While E2 tracks public announcements of new projects and cancellations, other efforts at tracking what’s happening in the clean energy sector provide a more detailed picture—and in some senses, a more optimistic one.

The Clean Investment Monitor, a project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the consulting firm Rhodium Group, tracks actual capital spending in the quarter of all projects that have broken ground, and also includes investment in decarbonization projects at energy and industrial plants as well as consumer spending—for example, on EVs, rooftop solar and efficiency upgrades. For the first quarter of 2025, Clean Investment Monitor reported $67.3 billion in spending, a 6.9 percent increase from the same period in 2024. However, it was a 3.8 percent falloff from the previous quarter, and the second consecutive quarterly decline after an unbroken record of quarterly expansion that began in 2021.

Retail purchases of clean energy technology by households and businesses clearly were the driving force in investment in early 2025, the Clean Investment Monitor reported. Its analysis, like that of E2, noted the cancellation of a number of big clean energy projects over the quarter. And it warned of the headwinds for the clean energy supply chain, not only due to uncertain federal policy but the escalation of tariffs and broader macroeconomic pressures.

The American Clean Power Association (ACPA), which tracks utility-scale electricity projects, also put out its first quarter report Thursday, showing that developers installed 7.4 gigawatts of solar, wind and storage capacity, marking the second-strongest start to a year on record. (The strongest start on record was 2024, when 8 gigawatts came on line.) That brings total utility-scale clean power capacity to more than 320 gigawatts, which the association estimates is enough to power nearly 80 million US homes. Of course, that electricity is not only powering homes but also businesses, where power demand is rising sharply due to data centers.

It was a record-setting quarter for battery storage capacity, which surpassed 30 gigawatts, a 65 percent increase from last year. Indiana quadrupled its energy storage capacity in just one quarter, with the help of a big system owned by the energy company AES that opened in April at the site of a former coal power plant.

Texas continued to lead the nation in both utility-scale solar and land-based wind capacity, with its total clean energy portfolio reaching more than 80 gigawatts, a 20 percent increase from a year ago, ACPA said. In all, eight of the top 10 states for clean power additions in the quarter voted Republican in the 2024 presidential election.

The association also saw continuing growth in the project development pipeline, with a 12 percent year-over-year increase in projects under construction or in the advanced stages of development. If all are built, it would add up to $328 billion in investment, said the group’s CEO, Jason Grumet.

“Clean power is shovel-ready at scale,” he said, while echoing E2’s concerns about the retreat from federal support for the sector in Washington.

“With unprecedented demand growth for electricity, we must send consistent investment signals across the energy sector,” Grumet said. “The greatest threat to a reliable energy system is an unreliable political system.”",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/06/03/54362410944_c919e831e3_b.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:25:59.200558

A closer look at EV batteries shows how tariffs will hit the U.S. clean tech sector hard.
One small consolation for clean energy advocates could be last week’s executive orders to boost nuclear energy, although those efforts will take many years to come online.","On May 22, the Republicans controlling the U.S. House of Representatives passed their “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation bill. Among many other measures, the bill rolls back tax credits and other subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Biden administration’s flagship legislation to support U.S. clean technology firms, including those involved in renewable energy, battery production, and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing.

Combined with U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff plans, the IRA repeal will hit green energy businesses hard. Tariffs on imported components will raise the prices of U.S. clean tech products to such highs that they will struggle to compete both domestically and in international markets. Meanwhile, the repeal of IRA tax credits adds insult to injury by dampening private sector investment in the industry, undermining the United States’ long-term ability to play a leading role in the global green energy landscape.

Tariffs on China make a great starting point to understand how Trump’s policies will harm U.S. clean tech firms. Granted, the United States has made great strides to relocate the production of such goods to U.S. soil in recent years, with manufacturing capacity now close to meeting domestic demand for EV batteries and solar panels.

Yet this will not be enough for the country’s clean tech firms to dodge the tariff bullet, for a simple reason. To source the inputs that they need to assemble green energy gadgets—such as polysilicon wafers for solar panels and cathodes for EV batteries—U.S. firms rely on China, the hegemon of clean tech. Analysts from Bloomberg New Energy Finance, for instance, estimate that Chinese companies produce around 70 percent of the global supply of most of the components that go into finished clean tech goods.

If you thought that the current legal circus around tariffs might provide relief, think again. Most of the measures that damage green energy prospects look set to remain in place.

A closer look at EV batteries shows how tariffs will hit the U.S. clean tech sector hard. Thanks to a recent IRA-fueled investment boom, U.S. firms now have the capacity to build enough American-made batteries to meet domestic demand. Yet the United States remains a long way off from full self-sufficiency: The country’s battery makers import roughly 85 percent of the materials that they use on their production lines, mostly from China.

Trump’s willingness to impose tariffs on just about the entire world (except Russia) means that turning to countries other than China is not a viable option. Alternative suppliers of EV batteries, such as South Korea, also face the prospect of U.S. tariffs come early July. The upshot? Economists reckon that Trump’s tariff salvos could translate into a 17.5 percent rise in the price of U.S.-made batteries by 2026.

But higher prices for U.S.-made clean tech gadgets could soon raise tricky questions. At a time when the global clean tech sector is facing a glut of supply (mostly because of Chinese overproduction), the rationale for onshoring has less to do with economics than with national security. From that perspective, Washington has every interest in creating China-proof supply chains for clean tech in order to limit reliance on Chinese firms and boost the United States’ energy independence.

Tariffs, however, make this easier said than done. It is hard to imagine that U.S. green energy firms could thrive if tariffs fuel the manufacturing costs of their goods to such highs that they are not competitive abroad. What’s more, Chinese clean tech firms could soon choose to cut prices to cement their global market shares (particularly in big markets like Europe or Japan), further weighing on the export competitiveness of U.S.-made green goods.

The United States has—or rather, had, given the likely IRA repeal—a way out of this competitiveness conundrum: subsidizing private investment in domestic production to such an extent that these products could compete against foreign-made goods at home and abroad. Beyond job-creation purposes, this was the point of the IRA tax credits. The legislation envisioned trying to make the United States a leading player in the clean tech sector at a time when China dominates the field.

To the Biden administration’s credit, the United States registered some success in the field: From the adoption of this legislation in the third quarter of 2022 through the first quarter of this year, private investments in electric vehicle, battery, solar, and wind projects totaled $664 billion, a 89 percent rise compared to the same period preceding the Inflation Reduction Act. However, such largesse is over. The high likelihood of a significant IRA repeal has shown that hopes to see the federal government subsidize clean tech firms under Trump are vain.

The cancellation of IRA tax credits would likely have a deep impact on the U.S. clean tech sector at a time when investors have already become cautious. Recent data paints a stark picture. In the first quarter of 2025, U.S. clean tech projects worth $7.7 billion were canceled—the highest level on record and more than four times the total of all cancellations in 2024.

Things could soon get worse: Analysts predict that a repeal of the IRA could threaten the development of around $500 billion in clean tech projects. (Some researchers think this figure could top $1 trillion by 2035; estimates vary greatly since the amount depends on private investment plans.) Amid a bleak outlook, the only silver lining for green energy firms could come from the state level: Some U.S. states mandate the use of renewable sources in the energy mix, offering a lifeline to the sector. In California, for instance, utility providers will need to source 50 percent of power sales from clean energy sources by 2030.

Financial considerations are not the only factor dampening private investment in U.S. clean tech projects. Under Trump 2.0, the climate has become toxic for green energy firms as the administration ramps up criticism of environmentally friendly policies; true to form, Trump calls the IRA the “Green New Scam.”

The fate of Norwegian energy company Equinor’s $5 billion Empire Wind offshore wind project near New York City illustrates this. In April, the secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior ordered an immediate halt to the construction of this project following a January executive order mandating a pause in future wind projects and a government review of current ones. Construction restarted after a month, but the saga sent chilling vibes to potential investors. In turn, many firms are now adopting a wait-and-see approach—possibly for Trump’s entire term.

The impact of a dent in U.S. investments in clean tech projects looks set to outlive Trump. Even if his policies were to be reversed on the day he leaves the White House, the next three and a half years will probably be lost for the sector. This could prove especially true for projects to develop next-generation technologies such as green hydrogen, direct air carbon capture, or geothermal power—the only green energy fields where the United States is a major global player on a par with China.

The green hydrogen sector—still far from commercial viability and thus particularly dependent on government subsidies—could be hit especially hard; analysts reckon that the end of IRA tax credits could lead to the cancellation of 95 percent of green hydrogen projects. To make matters worse, the Energy Department is considering shutting down its Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, potentially cutting roughly $9 billion in funding to develop nascent green technologies.

The U.S. clean tech sector faces a perfect storm as it braces for the combined impact of tariffs and the loss of IRA tax credits—two policies that look set to have an impact on the country’s ability to play a leading role on the global green energy landscape well beyond Trump’s term. Perhaps MAGA-inclined voters will find this is well and good—and that the country’s focus should solely be on a policy of “drill, baby, drill” for fossil fuels, as Trump put it.

One small consolation for clean energy advocates could be last week’s executive orders to boost nuclear energy, although those efforts will take many years to come online. But 93 percent of new capacity added to the U.S. electrical grid so far this year has been coming from renewable sources. Even if that capacity is not always available because of the weather, it is not clear how the White House will manage to keep the lights on without green tech amid a boom in electricity demand fueled by power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.

As Europe, Japan, and other developed economies double down on clean energy investments, that makes the United States an outlier. Trump’s energy strategy (or lack thereof) is yet another item on the growing list of his shortsighted plans.",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trump-climate-green-tech-GettyImages-2154228971-e1749135474696.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:02.413234

With that in mind and with Project IKE here in Oak Ridge, we step forward on a new mission of equal consequence. We are developing an American enrichment facility that will fuel not just reactors, but the future—powering new technologies that will define the next century.""

The event included speeches marking the milestone by Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, Congressman Chuck Fleischmann, Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart McWhorter, State Senator Ken Yager, and Oak Ridge Mayor Warren Gooch.

The enrichment facility's development is in line with President Trump's recent executive orders regarding nuclear energy, which are intended to revitalize and expand the U.S. nuclear industry, aiming to quadruple nuclear electricity production by 2050.

""The announcement of a major global enrichment company opening its office in Oak Ridge, paired with President Trump's strong movement forward in nuclear energy, is about to change the world and change the world for the better,"" Governor Lee said. ""Tennessee will lead this change.""

Palayer emphasized that applying Orano's 60 years of nuclear expertise in America and its proven centrifuge technology can enable a quicker ramp up for production of advanced nuclear fuels, including high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) and low-enriched uranium (LEU/LEU+).

""America needs new nuclear power,"" said Palayer. ""The world needs new nuclear power. And new nuclear power needs Tennessee and Project IKE in Oak Ridge.""

Located less than 10 miles from Orano's selected Project IKE site near the Oak Ridge Horizon Center Industrial Park, this first group of office employees, including engineers, project managers, and licensing personnel, is in addition to the 300-person workforce expected to operate Orano's uranium enrichment facility.

The new Oak Ridge office joins Orano's 15 other sites in the United States including manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, canister operations in Kentucky, nuclear medicine research in Texas, and headquarters in Maryland.

Later this year, Orano is celebrating 60 years in the United States as one of the longest operating nuclear energy companies in the nation. For more than 40 years, Orano has reliably produced and supplied American reactors with enriched uranium. Orano's Project IKE is designed to continue this performance from an American facility to provide a reliable, significant, domestic nuclear fuel supply for U.S. advanced reactors and the existing reactor fleet.

Orano's planned uranium enrichment center in Oak Ridge is designed as a multi-structure commercial production site covering approximately 750,000 square feet, making it one of the largest in America.

Depending on federal funding and customers' support, the facility will produce LEU/LEU+ to fuel existing commercial nuclear energy reactors and, potentially, HALEU to help develop and power advanced reactors.

Orano has already taken active steps to support the American market and foster energy independence by launching a 30% uranium enrichment capacity expansion at its operating Georges Besse 2 facility in France.

Through its SUSTAINera Circular Economy division, the automaker has teamed up with Enel and Aeroporti di Roma (ADR) to support the PIONEER project, Italy’s largest second-life battery energy storage system. The project utilizes old EV batteries to store solar energy and power Rome Fiumicino Airport, one of Europe’s busiest travel hubs.

Launched back in 2022, the partnership also includes Enel X, system integrator Loccioni, and the scientific support of Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute. Their goal? Take EV batteries from Stellantis vehicles—specifically from B-segment models built on the eCMP platform—and give them a new job after they’re no longer fit for driving.

Instead of sending these used batteries straight to recycling, SUSTAINera contributed 78 second-life packs, each capable of storing 50 kWh of energy. That’s enough to add up to 3.9 megawatt-hours (MWh) of capacity, all integrated into a larger 10 MWh Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) powered by a massive 31 GWh solar farm operated by ADR.

The result? A smart, sustainable setup that’s expected to eliminate 16,000 tons of CO₂ emissions over the next decade.

This PIONEER project is a major win for Stellantis, and it’s only the beginning. It’s part of a broader effort by the company to establish a circular economy around electric vehicles, where batteries are reused, repaired, remanufactured, and ultimately recycled when they are no longer viable.

Through its Free2move eSolutions joint venture with NHOA, Stellantis is now also developing test units that explore how second-life batteries can support homes, businesses, and industrial sites right here in the U.S. The aim is to build scalable energy storage systems from batteries originally meant for cars—reducing waste and helping the electric grid in the process.

It’s all part of Stellantis’ long-term strategy to be a more sustainable carmaker. And with EV adoption on the rise, the ability to reuse and repurpose old batteries could become just as important as building new ones.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PIONEER_SecondLifeBatteriesenergystorage.jpeg,N,,2025-06-06 08:30:20.604108

From solar-powered elementary schools to heat-mitigation projects in disinvested communities, we have become an example of what real, local climate solutions can look like.

But now, as Congress works to advance President Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill,” this momentum is under attack — fueled by partisan politics, disinformation and a deliberate effort to derail federal investments designed to protect our current and future health, environment and economy.

As the vice mayor and representative of Tucson’s Ward 1, I see firsthand how clean energy investments are not abstract policy — they’re already improving lives in our communities.

At Manzo Elementary, a school rooted in Barrio Hollywood, solar panels not only lower utility bills but also power classrooms and help teach the next generation what environmental stewardship looks like. Recognized as a national leader in place-based sustainability education, Manzo integrates aquaponics, school gardens, composting, rainwater harvesting and outdoor learning spaces to make climate education hands-on and culturally relevant. These efforts build climate literacy and leadership from the ground up. Manzo is a model for what community-rooted climate solutions can be: locally led, accessible and built for the future. Investments from the Inflation Reduction Act help schools like Manzo thrive, not just survive rising energy costs.

But here in the desert, we’re up against more than utility hikes — we’re facing deadly heat. Every summer, Tucson sets new records for heat-related emergency room visits. In neighborhoods like mine, where many families live in older homes without modern cooling systems, heat can be a public health emergency. The clean energy investments under threat aren’t just about grid resilience — they’re about saving lives.

What’s at stake couldn’t be clearer. Just this spring, Tucson lost over $7 million in federal funding after Republicans began targeting what they’ve called “green new scam” programs — money that would have gone to community-led climate resilience projects right here in Ward 1. That includes shade infrastructure at 20 high-use bus stops, battery storage upgrades at public-serving facilities, and transforming asphalt heat islands into green stormwater harvesting sites like the South 12th Avenue Greenway. These weren’t abstract ideas — they were shovel-ready plans that would have made our streets safer, cooler and more livable for families already on the frontlines of extreme heat. Now, they’re stalled. We can’t afford to let partisan attacks derail solutions our communities have been building for years.

To make matters worse, the current GOP budget bill being considered in Congress uses the tax dollars “saved” by gutting these critical investments to instead help pay for nearly $4 trillion in tax cuts for corporations and the rich. They want to take from communities like ours and reward Wall Street and the very wealthiest Americans.

Cities like Tucson have used IRA funding to advance clean transportation, invest in urban greening, and build neighborhood cooling solutions in areas most affected by extreme heat. Rather than gutting these programs, we should be expanding them. Imagine what we could do with continued support: more shaded bus stops across our cities, solar panels on every school, green jobs for youth, heat preparedness and home weatherization programs to protect our most vulnerable.

I urge all of Arizona’s elected leaders in Washington to put Arizona first and vote no on stripping these critical investments from communities like ours that rely on them.",https://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2023/04/KellerSolar2-WEB.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:27:44.301640

The House recently passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would increase primary (non-interest) budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the fiscal year (FY) 2025–2034 budget window; with interest, the OBBBA would increase budget deficits by $3.0 trillion through FY 2034.

If the OBBBA is enacted, the national debt would climb to 124 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of FY 2034, compared to 117 percent of GDP under current law.

The OBBBA is currently in the Senate for consideration, and changes are likely; thus, the actual fiscal impact of the legislation is likely to change as it moves through Congress.

Introduction

The House recently passed its fiscal year (FY) 2025 reconciliation legislation: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) score of the OBBBA estimates that it would increase primary (non-interest) budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the fiscal year (FY) 2025–2034 budget window. Including interest costs, the legislation would increase budget deficits by $3.0 trillion and boost the national debt to 124 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of FY 2034, compared to 117 percent of GDP under current law.

A Closer Look at the Provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act

The FY 2025 budget resolution adopted by the House and Senate included reconciliation instructions to 11 House committees to allow up to $3.3 trillion of primary deficit increases over the FY 2025–2034 budget window (the budget resolution instructs the Senate to craft measures that would increase primary deficits by up to $2.0 trillion). CBO’s score of the House-passed OBBBA estimates that the 11 committees’ reconciliation measures and the interactions between them would increase primary budget deficits by $2.4 trillion through FY 2034, which is the net effect of $4.2 trillion of gross costs that is partially offset by $1.7 trillion of gross savings. After including the $551 billion in higher interest costs that would come from the additional borrowing, the OBBBA would increase budget deficits by $3.0 trillion through FY 2034. While CBO scores the OBBA as increasing budget deficits over the next decade, the Administration has argued the revenue from the tariffs it’s imposed through executive action will effectively offset this cost. In fact, CBO recently estimated that the administration’s tariffs will reduce budget deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.

The two companies signed a strategic collaboration agreement under which MSP will store carbon dioxide captured at Southern Energy’s biomass-to-methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, scheduled for construction in Louisiana.

This $1 billion facility, projected to begin production in 2028, will use biomass sourced from the Southern Wood Basket— a region considered the largest timber and biomass producer in the United States.

The groundbreaking plant will utilize the biomass to produce biofuel like methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), generating carbon removal credits to be rolled out on the voluntary carbon market and qualifying for 45Q tax credit benefits.

To permanently store the CO2 captured at Southern Energy’s Louisiana facility, MSP will leverage its Class VI storage site, expected to come online in 2027.

MSP is driven by a professional team that relies on carbon credit expertise from DevvStream to deliver solutions for companies looking to decarbonize and generate environmental assets value.

Adam Farris, CEO of Monroe Sequestration Partners, shared that the company is thrilled to partner with Southern Energies, calling this collaboration “a powerful alignment of technology, infrastructure, and purpose.”

He commented, “This partnership is exactly the kind of collaboration we envisioned when forming MSP—to connect strategic industrial emitters with carbon storage solutions that are both technically sound and commercially viable.”

“Our work with Southern Energy represents a shared commitment to climate innovation, and we’re proud to be part of a project that will help define the future of low-carbon fuel,” he added.

Farris goes on to note that Louisiana is positioning itself as the carbon capture capital of the U.S., adding that MSP is proud to be part of that transformation.

Deep South Center for Environmental Justice v. EPA, No. 24-60084 (5th Cir. 2025).

The groups, Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, Healthy Gulf, and Alliance for Affordable Energy, filed a petition in February 2024 with the Fifth Circuit requesting that the court “hold unlawful, vacate, and set aside” EPA’s final rule that approved Louisiana’s 2021 application for Class VI Primacy. Several intervenors in the suit, including the State of Louisiana and oil and gas trade associations, disputed the groups’ ability to establish standing. To rebut the intervenors’ standing argument, the groups alleged a number of economic, aesthetic, and recreational injuries, among others, resulting from EPA’s approval of Louisiana’s primacy application.

However, the Fifth Circuit found that the groups’ alleged injuries associated with the grant of primacy to the State of Louisiana for permitting Class VI wells were too hypothetical and rested on a “highly attenuated chain of possibilities.” The groups’ expenditures to oppose the Class VI buildout, the chance that EPA’s approval of the Louisiana program would increase energy costs to consumers, and the potential injuries of group members should a Class VI well be permitted and experience some mishap were all held to be too speculative to establish the standing required to challenge EPA’s grant of primacy. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the groups’ petition for review for a failure to demonstrate standing.

Virginia is home to several conventional nuclear power plants.
With the opening of the George Mason E2 Center, NuScale now has E2 facilities at 11 schools or research sites worldwide.
NuScale Power two years ago formed a research partnership with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory on economically and technically assessing its SMRs’ ability to provide cost-effective steam heat augmentation.
In fact, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a $900 million funding solicitation for Gen III+ SMR nuclear startups.","The opening of the latest NuScale E2 Center follows a series of positive moves for the SMR industry as a whole. Those steps forward include last month’s U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval of NuScale’s 77-MW US460 SMR reactor design, partially based on the company’s US600 approved two years ago by the NRC.

The NRC also has recently agreed to review construction permits for SMR projects involving Dow and X-energy, as well as a separate application by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Nuclear energy offers baseload, high-capacity factor and carbon-free power as the nation’s looks to meet a future challenge of exponential data center and electrification load growth.

Virginia is home to several conventional nuclear power plants. It’s also holds more data centers per area than any state in the U.S.

""A reliable and increasingly clean energy future is what the Virginia Clean Energy Innovation Bank is all about,"" said Glenn Davis, director of the Virginia Department of Energy, in a statement. ""With this investment alongside world-class higher-education partners at George Mason and cutting-edge industry leaders at NuScale, we're ensuring Virginia has the energy to power our thriving economy and the expertise to continue leading the nation in innovation, education, and opportunity.""

With the opening of the George Mason E2 Center, NuScale now has E2 facilities at 11 schools or research sites worldwide. The others are at Idaho State University, Ohio State, Oregon State, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Texas A&M, Nevada-Los Vegas, South Carolina State, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Ghana Atomic Energy Commission and Seoul National University in South Korea.

“The opening of NuScale’s E2 Center at George Mason reinforces our mission to drive innovation in nuclear energy and inspire the next generation of leaders,” said John Hopkins, NuScale President and CEO. “Together, we are shaping a skilled nuclear-ready workforce and fostering a more informed public, providing a strong foundation for the future of clean, reliable energy in Virginia and around the world.”

The NRC approval for NuScale’s 77-MW US 460 is only a preliminary safety approval. SMR developers would still have to seek construction permit approvals to move forward with physical projects.

“The US460 design continues to use natural 'passive' processes such as convection and gravity in its operating systems and safety features,” reads the NRC official release about the design approval. “The US460’s six modules, producing a total of approximately 460 megawatts of electricity, are all partially immersed in a safety-related pool built below ground level.”

Many industrial product manufacturers and data center companies see SMR nuclear as path forward for both resilient and sustainable power in the coming decades. Tech firms which have sought SMR or conventional nuclear partnerships include Microsoft, Meta, Google, Oracle and Amazon Web Services.

NuScale Power two years ago formed a research partnership with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory on economically and technically assessing its SMRs’ ability to provide cost-effective steam heat augmentation.

The path to commercialization for NuScale’s SMR design hit a costly and potentially devastating roadblock nearly two years ago when it and partner Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems mutually agreed to terminate the so-called Carbon Free Power Project. The CFPP was going to be an SMR plant built in Idaho, pegged as the first commercially operational facility, but it was killed because not enough customers would sign on to make the multi-billion projects financially viable.

Since then, however, SMR nuclear’s momentum has revived with successful research collaborations for X-energy, Natura Resources, Aalo Atomic, Oklo and others.

In fact, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a $900 million funding solicitation for Gen III+ SMR nuclear startups. The program was a rare Biden-era initiative reissued by the Trump DOE to promote new nuclear capacity for the future.

No SMR projects have yet been built in the U.S. Work on similar reactors is moving forward in Canada, Russia and China.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/06/6841e9835b07b7fd413c734f-nuscale_e2_center_at_george_mason.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-06 08:26:25.035906

AUSTIN, Texas — Today, three prominent state-based environmental organizations offered their assessment of the 89th Texas Legislature, which concluded on Monday, regarding environmental issues. The organizations highlighted advancements in energy, renewable investments, building codes, water management, wildfire response, and other key areas.

Still, the groups warned against viewing this year’s session as a sea change for a state legislature that is too often on the side of corporate profits at the expense of the environment. For example, misinformation about renewable energy sources persisted, and too little was done about air quality; lawmakers were also willing to hand even more power to the world’s richest man.

Key wins for the environment include:

Clean Energy: SB 819, SB 388, SB 715, and other anti-renewable energy bills that would have imposed costly fees and discriminatory requirements on clean energy producers all failed. Meanwhile, it’ll be easier and cheaper for Texans to install solar panels and home batteries thanks to SB 1202, which streamlines the permitting process for backup power.

Wildfire prevention: The legislature passed a package of bills that includes HB 143 and HB 144 in response to the February 2024 Panhandle Wildfires, the worst in the state’s history

Protecting urban transit, including Austin’s Project Connect and Dallas Area Rapid Transit, and bike infrastructure investments from harmful state interference.

Enacting the “Right to Repair” law (HB 2963): Gives Texans more freedom to fix their electronics and appliances and reduce waste.

Improved Energy Codes for New Construction: SB 783 allows the State Energy Conservation Organization to move forward with rulemaking to update the minimum state energy codes for new residential and commercial construction, as well as high-performance energy and water conservation codes for public universities and state agencies.

Energy Waste Advisory Committee: HB 5323 requires eight Texas state agencies that deal with the “demand-side” of energy to collaborate, design programs to help make our Texas grid more reliable, and report back to the Legislature on ways to optimize energy savings and demand reduction programs.

Leaky Pipe Water Audits and Action Plans for Major Cities: HB 29 requires the six largest public utilities to conduct additional water audits, comparing them against a threshold set by the TWDB for water loss, and design mitigation plans to conserve water.

Decreased impact fees for water conservation and higher efficiency programs: SB 1253 requires cities to lower water and wastewater impact fees if new developments install water conservation or high-efficiency appliances that go beyond required codes, providing an incentive to use less water.

Better transparency and protection of consumer costs from new electricity demand (large loads): SB 6 addresses large loads interconnecting to the grid, requires interconnection standards and new demand management tools, and necessitates a review of how transmission costs are allocated to consumers.

Major investment in water infrastructure: While somewhat of a mixed result, SB 7 and HJR 7, combined with money from the “supplemental” budget bill, will set aside $2.5 billion for new water infrastructure over the next two years, and another $1 billion per year if voters approve the constitutional amendment. While the original versions of the bills could have set aside up to 80% for ‘new water supply” like conveyance systems, produced water, or marine desalination, the final versions include 50% for new water supply and projects funded by SWIFT, a program which includes water reuse and water conservation, lessening the impact of potentially dangerous projects.

The legislature also failed to take significant positive steps or passed harmful bills in the following areas:

SpaceX Giveaway: Despite stopping multiple versions of bills that would have allowed SpaceX and its new city of Starbase to proceed, a coalition of stakeholders opposed, the Legislature snuck an amendment into the Conference Committee Report of HB 5246 at the 11th hour that allows a new Space Commission working with Starbase to close the highway and beach. The legislature also added $300 million for grants to Space companies.

Water Quality Issues and Protections for Bays and Estuaries: Bills intended to address plastics, highly saline brine, and PFAS, which directly impact our most precious resources, including our bays and estuaries, had hearings but never even made it out of committee, as powerful industrial interests opposed them.

Concrete batch plants: Legislation to protect Texans from the fine particulate matter generated by these facilities stalled

Liability protection for oil and gas companies: HB 45 provides broad liability protection for oil and gas producers of “produced” water, wastewater that results from the hydraulic fracturing process. While the bill improved slightly during the process, it still ultimately could leave Texans and the state holding the bag if pollution results from the treatment and discharge of produced waters.

Nuclear energy: The legislature approved bills that will hand $350 million to developers of unproven small modular reactors in a costly, time-consuming bid to address rising energy demand. They also added $120 million to one company through a budget rider, bringing the total handout to $470 million.

Energy Efficiency and Building Codes: Despite a few positive bills making it to the Governor’s Desk, a myriad of other good bills passed one chamber but never made it to the floor of the other, including Energy Savings Goals (SB 2994), Low-Income Payment Assistance (HB 1359), Raising Overall Minimum Building Codes (HB 871), Energy Use Reporting and Planning for Major Cities, Universities and State Agencies (HB 3732), Energy Efficiency Grants through the Texas Energy Fund (HB 5623), and the Energy Efficiency Council (HB 3826).

And the legislature also considered harmful legislation that stalled, including:

Bad preemption bills that would have undermined city action on health, safety and environmental progress, including HB 4313 and HB 4314 by Cecil Bell, and SB 2858 and SB 3016 by Creighton.

A bad constitutional amendment (HJR 138) that would have prevented Texas from implementing a climate fee and dividend or carbon tax.

The groups issued the following statements about the 89th legislative session:

“It was encouraging to see some of the worst legislation stall out or face opposition so overwhelming that it made passage much more difficult,” said Adrian Shelley, Texas director of Public Citizen. “This legislature is not, by any means, prioritizing air quality, a just transition to wind and solar energy, or accountability for corporate polluters.”

“Every session, our first goal is simple: stop any backsliding on environmental progress,” said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas. “This year, we not only fended off a wave of anti-renewable energy and anti-transit bills—we also helped win meaningful progress on clean energy, water, and conservation.”",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:18.251321

The Energy Choice Act will provide certainty, security, and assurance for much-needed permitting reform and energy infrastructure development.
The Energy Choice Act limits states’ permitting requirements and promotes a more resilient energy infrastructure.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Nick Langworthy (NY-23) and Senator Jim Justice (R-WV) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral H.R. 3699, the Energy Choice Act(link is external)toprohibit states or local governments from banning an energy service's connection, reconnection, modification, installation, or expansion based on the type or source of energy to be delivered. Congressman Langworthy, who serves as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and as a member of the Energy and Environment subcommittees, has made protecting Americans’ energy choices a top priority.

“Governor Hochul and Democrats in Albany have waged an extremist crusade against natural gas that’s sent home energy costs through the roof, crippled our energy supply, and left New York teetering on the edge of an energy crisis—all to satisfy the radical fantasies of the far-left climate cult. New York has been ground zero for the Green New Deal, where common sense goes to die and working families get stuck with the bill,”said Congressman Langworthy.“That’s why I’ve introduced the Energy Choice Act—to slam the brakes on these reckless, ideological mandates and restore sanity to America’s energy policy. People deserve the freedom to choose energy that is affordable, reliable, and proven—not be forced into rolling blackouts to please eco-activists who don’t live in the real world. I thank Senator Justice for introducing this bill in the Senate and urge its swift action.”

“I am an energy guy from an energy-rich state. I know how important freedom of energy production is - which is why I’m proud to introduce Energy Choice Act of 2025. President Trump has stated the need to unleash American energy, and this bill helps facilitate just that. We have too great an energy crisis in this country, and we don’t have the luxury of picking the winners and losers when it comes to energy production. Americans ought to have the right to choose what is best for their energy needs,” said Senator Jim Justice.

Original cosponsors of this legislation include Representatives Michael Baumgartner (R-WA), Jack Bergman (R-MI), Mike Bost (R-IL), Robert Bresnahan Jr. (R-MI), Ken Calvert (R-CA), Mike Carey (R-OH), Jeff Crank (R-CO), Chuck Edwards (R-NC), Jake Ellzey (R-TX), Brad Finstad (R-MN), Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Lance Gooden (R-TX), Pat Harrigan (R-NC), Clay Higgins (R-LA), Jeff Hurd (R-CO), Darin LaHood (R-IL), Michael Lawler (R-NY), Ryan Mackenzie (R-PA), Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), Tracey Mann (R-KS), Tom McClintock (R-CA), Addison McDowell (R-NC), Mark Messmer (R-IN), Dan Meuser (R-PA), John Moolenaar (R-MI), Tim Moore (R-NC), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), August Pfluger (R-TX), John Rose (R-TX), Michael Rulli (R-OH), Jefferson Shreve (R-IN), Elise Stefanik (R-NY), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), GT Thompson (R-PA), David Valadao (R-CA), Beth Van Duyne (R-TX), Tony Wied (R-WI), Roger Williams (R-TX), Ryan Zinke (R-MT).

Original cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV).

“Democratic-controlled states like New York are waging an all-out attack on domestic energy production, undermining Americans' right to choose their preferred energy source. The Energy Choice Act combats these authoritarian regulations by preventing state and local governments from banning specific energy sources. To achieve true energy independence, we must ensure Americans have access to a full range of options, including natural gas,""said Congresswoman Tenney.

“Montanans know the value of reliable, affordable energy, especially during winters when access to natural gas, coal, and other traditional fuels isn’t just a convenience, it’s a necessity,” said Congressman Zinke. “Heavy handed policies from places like Albany and Sacramento don’t reflect the realities of rural America, where energy diversity is vital. The Energy Choice Act is common sense legislation that defends our right to choose the energy sources that work best for our homes and businesses, and I am happy to co-sponsor it again.”

“In order to achieve American energy dominance, we must utilize an all-of-the-above energy strategy that prioritizes affordability and reliability. By prohibiting states and local governments from banning a service based on the source of the energy, we can ensure that families and small businesses are not being forced to utilize more costly energy sources. I thank Rep. Langworthy for his leadership as we work to make energy more affordable and reliable for our constituents,” said Congressman Newhouse.

“Energy freedom is essential to both our economy and national security,” said Congressman Mike Rulli. “Efforts by state governments to ban natural gas and other traditional energy sources not only hurt working families through higher costs but also jeopardize grid reliability - especially in regions with harsh winters like ours. I’m proud to support the Energy Choice Act and thank Congressman Langworthy for putting consumers first and ensuring that no American is forced into an energy system that doesn’t work for them or their community.”

“Strengthening America’s energy independence requires an all-of-the-above energy strategy that ensures consumer demand and industry experts, not bureaucrats and extreme environmentalists, lead the expansion and delivery of energy services. Banning certain types of energy, like California and New York have tried to do, only raises prices for Americans,” said Congressman Chuck Edwards (NC-11). “The Energy Choice Act will safeguard the diversification of energy sources in our nation and make sure that Americans have access to reliable and affordable energy.”

At a time when families are recovering from record high inflation, the last thing we need are misguided state and local policies that eliminate affordable heating options. The Energy Choice Act protects market competition, preserves consumer choice, and promotes energy affordability and reliability. We urge Congress to pass this common-sense legislation without delay.”

“NAHB commends Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.Y.) for championing the Energy Choice Act, legislation that prohibits state and local governments from banning or limiting access to natural gas, electricity, and other energy sources. A gas ban would exacerbate the housing affordability crisis by increasing costs on new homes and placing added stress on the nation’s electrical grid. With more than 40 million U.S. households relying on natural gas for heating, cooking, and hot water, preserving access to this affordable and reliable energy source is vital for American families,”said Buddy Hughes, Chairman, National Association of Home Builders.

“On behalf of millions of AFP’s grassroots activists across the country, we applaud Rep. Nick Langworthy for introducing the Energy Choice Act to ensure energy freedom throughout the United States. Regardless of where Americans live, they shouldn’t be forced to endure energy poverty. The Energy Choice Act will provide certainty, security, and assurance for much-needed permitting reform and energy infrastructure development. Rep. Langworthy’s legislation will ensure American dominance in energy and lower costs for consumers while embracing an “all-of-the-above” approach on the federal level,” said Brent Gardner, Chief Government Affairs Officer, Americans for Prosperity.

“The Energy Choice Act represents a critical step in protecting consumer access to clean, affordable, and reliable energy sources like propane,”said Stephen Kaminski, President and CEO of the National Propane Gas Association. “NPGA commends Rep. Langworthy and Sen. Justice for their leadership in introducing this legislation to defend energy diversity and empowering Americans to choose the energy solutions that best meet their needs. This bill safeguards consumers from rising energy costs driven by overreaching government mandates.”

“The American Public Gas Association (APGA) strongly supports Representative Langworthy’s Energy Choice Act. This important legislation will safeguard American consumers’ right to choose the energy that best meets their household and budget needs. Access to affordable, reliable, and efficient natural gas is essential to the success of American families, businesses, and communities. APGA applauds the bill’s sponsors for their leadership in protecting consumer choice and promoting energy affordability,” said Dave Schryver, President & CEO, APGA.

“The refusal of certain state and local governments to consider policies that provide a more sustainable transition to a less carbon-intensive future, coupled with the economic burdens placed on the American people through restrictions or bans on fossil fuel heating sources, necessitates federal preemption to ensure homeowners can continue to afford living in their homes while having robust options for maintaining home comfort. The Energy Choice Act provides that recourse and PHCC supports its immediate passage,” said Dan Callies, President, Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors, National Association.

“Passage of this important legislation is a no brainer. We encourage House lawmakers to pass the bill immediately to restore consumer choice and support small business energy marketers across the country,”said Rob Underwood, Energy Marketers of America President.

“At a time when no New Yorker is immune to statewide affordability challenges, having the freedom to choose energy solutions that work best for their homes, businesses, and communities is critical to keeping costs manageable for everyday people. The Energy Choice Act ensures we are taking an all-of-the-above approach to meeting energy needs — opening opportunities to tap into existing solutions like biofuels that advance clean energy goals, while also fostering continued innovation to build a more secure, affordable energy future. We support this commonsense legislation, thank Congressman Langworthy for his leadership, and urge House lawmakers to pass the Energy Choice Act to deliver real energy solutions for all Americans and support the small business energy marketers who help power our communities,”said Kris DeLair, Executive Director of the Empire State Energy Association.

“GPA Midstream appreciates Representative Langworthy taking action to introduce legislation to protect consumer choice. New Yorkers and all Americans deserve the right to choose the energy source, such as natural gas or propane, that is reliable and best fits their budget needs,”said Stuart Saulters, VP of Federal Affairs, GPA Midstream Association.

""Americans deserve reliable, affordable energy without bureaucratic roadblocks or special interests getting in the way. This bill protects consumer choice and energy innovation by ensuring that no state or local government can block access to energy sources based on political agendas or bad politics. This bipartisan bill is a common-sense step toward securing our energy future, protecting American energy jobs, and most importantly protecting the pockets of working class Americans who should not have to pay more for energy. The LIBRE Initiative is grateful for Rep. Langworthy’s leadership on this important issue,” said Helder Toste, Government Affairs Liaison, The LIBRE Initiative

China gave the green light to almost 100 gigawatts of new coal-fired plants in 2024, and India a further 15 gigawatts, pushing global approvals to their highest level since 2015, the Paris-based agency said.

“The capacity in coal is increasing,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in an interview as the agency published its annual World Energy Investment report. “But we also see that the capacity utilization rate in China is lower than in previous years, they are mainly using this when there are major challenges to meet the electricity demand.”

Investments in coal supply continue to tick upward with another 4% increase expected in 2025, a slight slowdown compared with the 6% annual average growth seen over the last five years, the IEA said. “Nearly all the growth in coal investments in 2024 came from China and India to meet domestic demand,” according to the report.

Trends in coal and other carbon-intensive sources may not be conducive to meeting global climate targets, but global investments in clean energy are set to be twice as much as spending on fossil fuels in 2025 for the second year in a row.

Capital flows to all energy industries are set to rise 2% to $3.3 trillion this year, compared with 2024, the IEA report said. This includes $2.2 trillion going to renewables, nuclear, power grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and electrification — twice as much as the $1.1 trillion going to oil, natural gas and coal.

Investments in electricity are set to reach $1.5 trillion in 2025, about 50% higher than the amount being spent on bringing oil, natural gas and coal to market. This trend is being shaped by the rapid rise in electricity demand for industry, cooling, electric mobility, data centers and artificial intelligence.

“Investment in grids is struggling to keep pace with the rise in power demand and renewables deployment,” the IEA report said.

Spending on solar, both utility-scale and rooftop, is expected to reach $450 billion in 2025, making it the largest single recipient of the world’s energy investments.

The bill provides critical clarification to ensure that both geothermal energy generation and geothermal-based energy storage are eligible for funding under the Texas Energy Fund (TEF)—a key financing mechanism for dispatchable electricity infrastructure. The TEF statute has long supported dispatchable generation projects but excluded “electric energy storage facilities” from eligibility. This created uncertainty around how geothermal technologies—which can both generate power and store thermal energy—fit into the framework.

SB 1762 directly addresses two key points:

- Geothermal energy qualifies as dispatchable under TEF guidelines, as it can reliably supply electricity on demand.

- Geothermal storage is distinct from battery storage and therefore is not excluded from eligibility.

These clarifications resolve prior ambiguity and ensure geothermal projects are fully recognized under the TEF program. Particularly, SB 1762 also amends the Texas Natural Resources Code to define geothermal energy conservation wells as “wells used for the retention of energy that may be used to provide a dispatchable generation of electricity for the power grid.” This is the commonsense conclusion the geothermal industry was hoping to clarify—geothermal power will be treated as a fully dispatchable energy resource under Texas law, including when used for storage.

Additionally, this classification places geothermal wells within the scope of the Texas Utilities Code provisions that require electricity generators to be dispatchable during periods of low grid reserves. For developers, this means geothermal projects must meet certain operational standards for grid reliability, requirements that geothermal energy is naturally suited to fulfill. While this may modestly raise compliance obligations, it also streamlines project approval, reinforces the resource’s value as a firm generation asset, and aligns geothermal development with the state’s broader reliability and grid stability objectives.

With statutory language now supporting both geothermal generation and storage, developers are in a stronger position to pursue TEF support and navigate regulatory requirements with greater certainty. While the loan application window under the TEF closed in July 2024, the completion bonus program remains active, offering:

- $120,000 per MW for projects interconnected before June 1, 2026; and

- $80,000 per MW for projects interconnected between June 1, 2026, and June 1, 2029.

As grid reliability becomes a higher legislative and regulatory priority, geothermal’s inclusion under the TEF positions it as a pivotal zero-carbon, dispatchable energy resource for Texas’ future.

SB 1762 is currently awaiting Governor Abbott’s signature, which is expected.

HB 4370: Geothermal Facilities Can Now Be Considered Public Improvement Projects.

House Bill 4370 amends the Texas Local Government Code to designate geothermal water conveyance facilities as Public Improvement Projects. This important classification opens the door for cities, water districts and local special-purpose districts to develop, operate and maintain geothermal infrastructure, and, more critically, to finance such projects through public bonds.

By granting geothermal facilities the same status as traditional public infrastructure, HB 4370 enables expanded public-private partnerships and provides new mechanisms for local governments to invest in geothermal energy systems, including thermal energy networks (TENs). These changes lay the foundation for a broader market for geothermal development in Texas, encouraging new investment in clean, dispatchable energy resources.

The legislation positions local communities to play a more active role in the state’s growing geothermal sector by giving them tools to plan, fund and manage geothermal projects at scale.

HB 4370 is currently awaiting Gov. Abbott’s signature, which is expected.

SB 879: Regulatory Relief for Closed-Loop Geothermal Projects

SB 879 delivers targeted regulatory relief for closed-loop geothermal systems, helping reduce development costs and simplifying permitting. The bill removes several oversight and fee requirements that previously applied to geothermal injection wells, further supporting geothermal’s role as a firm, dispatchable energy source in Texas.

Particularly, under SB 879, closed-loop geothermal wells are now exempt from certain Texas Railroad Commission regulations, reflecting their lower environmental and operational risk. In addition, reporting requirements for geothermal injection wells have been reduced, and injection well application fees have been eliminated.

These regulatory updates lower administrative and financial hurdles for developers, helping accelerate deployment of geothermal systems that provide reliable, dispatchable electricity. By easing the burden on closed-loop technologies, Texas continues to position itself as a leader in geothermal innovation and grid resilience.

SB 879 has been signed into law by Gov. Abbott and becomes effective September 1, 2025.

Taken together, these bills reflect a growing bipartisan commitment to unlocking Texas’s geothermal potential by lowering barriers to development, expanding financing tools, and clarifying regulatory treatment. With geothermal now formally recognized as a dispatchable energy source eligible for TEF incentives, and local governments empowered to treat geothermal infrastructure as public works, the stage is set for broader deployment of this clean, firm power source. While larger structural reforms remain on the horizon, the 2025 session delivered meaningful progress—offering developers greater certainty and signaling to investors that geothermal has a firm foothold in Texas’s evolving energy mix.",https://www.pillsburylaw.com/a/web/w3WwvjtoSP3zPZbw9BEDSF/arkWur/w3WwvjtoSP3zPZbw9BEDSF.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:20.983008

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A coalition of nearly 250 companies and business and labor groups on Thursday urged top U.S. Republican senators to preserve a credit for the emerging hydrogen fuel industry as they hash out President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill.

Oil and gas lobbying group the American Petroleum Institute, a local unit of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and DuPont urged Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senator Mike Crapo to extend the construction deadline to December 31, 2029 for hydrogen projects to receive a tax break.

The Senate is debating its version of the bill after the House of Representatives terminated the so-called 45V credit for any project which begins construction after the last day of 2025.

""If this course of action is adopted by the Senate, it will drive tens of billions of dollars in planned private sector investments out of the United States and into other countries,"" the groups said in a letter to the senators, dated June 5. ""Failing to act now by preserving 45V means ceding the future of hydrogen to China.""

The Business Council for Sustainable Energy and the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative also signed the letter.

House Republicans slashed the credits which had been included the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark climate legislation signed by former President Joe Biden, a Democrat. Under the IRA, hydrogen producers got tax credits for projects that began construction before 2033.

Industry analysts say clean hydrogen, or hydrogen produced from non-fossil energy sources, or natural gas paired with technology to capture carbon emissions and store them underground, is needed to decarbonize heavy industry and some vehicles.

The letter said clarity from lawmakers would spur tens of billions of dollars in private capital, boost domestic manufacturing, and create long-term employment in construction, operations, and technology.

Secret agreements Our research, reviewing nearly 50 public utility commission proceedings about data centers’ power needs across 10 states, uncovered dozens of secretive contracts between utilities and data centers.
Other public costs Our paper also explores other ways that the public pays for data center energy costs.
Because some regions are building new transmission capacity to accommodate data centers, our analysis finds that the public has been forced to pay billions of dollars for data center growth.
Data center energy costs can also be shifted when data centers connect directly to existing power plants.","In the race to develop artificial intelligence, large technology companies such as Google and Meta are trying to secure massive amounts of electricity to power new data centers. Electric utilities see the prospect of earning large profits by providing electricity to these power-hungry facilities and are competing for their business by offering discounts not available to average consumers.

In our paper Extracting Profits from the Public, we explain how utilities are forcing regular ratepayers to pay for the discounts enjoyed by some of the nation’s largest companies and identify ways policymakers can limit the costs to the public.

Shifting costs

In much of the U.S., utilities are monopolists. Within their service territories, they are the only companies allowed to deliver electricity to consumers. To fund their operations, utilities split the costs of maintaining and expanding their systems among all ratepayers – homeowners, businesses, warehouses, factories and anyone else who uses electricity.

Historically, a utility expanded its system to meet growing demand for electricity from new factories, businesses and homes. To pay for its expansion − new power plants, new transmission lines and other equipment − the utility would propose to raise electricity rates by different amounts for various types of consumers.

Public utility commissions are state agencies charged with ensuring that the public gets a fair deal. These commissions monitor how much money the utility spends to provide electric service and how its costs are shared among various types of ratepayers, including residential, commercial and industrial consumers. Ultimately, the public utility commission is supposed to approve any rate increases based on its assessment of what’s fair to consumers.

Splitting the utility’s costs among all consumers made perfect sense when population growth and economic development across the economy stimulated the need for new infrastructure. But today, in many utility service territories, most of the projected growth in electricity demand is due to new data centers.

Here’s the problem for consumers: To meet data center demand, utilities are building new power plants and power lines that are needed only because of data center growth. If state regulators allow utilities to follow the standard approach of splitting the costs of new infrastructure among all consumers, the public will end up paying to supply data centers with all that power.

A big price tag

One particularly acute example is in Louisiana. A Meta data center under development in the northeastern corner of the state is projected to use, by our calculations, twice as much energy as the city of New Orleans.

Entergy, the regional monopoly utility, is proposing to build more than US$3 billion worth of new gas-fired power plants and delivery infrastructure to meet the data center’s energy demand. Rather than billing Meta directly for these costs, Entergy is proposing to include the costs in rates paid by all customers.

Entergy claims its contract with Meta will cover some portion of the $3 billion price tag and that will mitigate any increases in consumers’ bills. But Entergy has asked state regulators to keep key terms of the contract secret, and only a redacted version of its application is available online.

The public has no idea how much it might pay if the commission approves the contract. And if the Meta data center ends up using much less power than the company anticipates, the public does not know whether it would be on the hook to pay higher electricity rates for longer periods to guarantee Entergy a profit.

Secret agreements

Our research, reviewing nearly 50 public utility commission proceedings about data centers’ power needs across 10 states, uncovered dozens of secretive contracts between utilities and data centers. Unlike Louisiana, most states require utilities to submit to the public utility commission their one-off deals with data centers, but they allow utilities to conceal the pricing terms from the public.

In normal rate-review cases, numerous parties advocate for their interests in a public proceeding, including members of the public, industry groups and the utility itself. But as our paper finds, utility commission reviews of data center contracts are based on confidential utility filings that are inaccessible to the general public. Few, if any, outsiders participate, and as a result the commission often hears only the utility’s version of the deal.

Because the pricing terms are secret, it is impossible to know whether the deal that a utility is offering to a data center is too low to cover the utility’s costs of providing power to the data center, which would mean that the public is subsidizing the deal. History shows, however, that utilities have a long history of exploiting their monopolies to shift costs to the public, including through secret contracts.

Other public costs

Our paper also explores other ways that the public pays for data center energy costs. For instance, many high-voltage interstate transmission projects, which connect large power plants to local delivery systems, are developed through regional planning processes run by numerous utilities. These alliances have complex rules for splitting the costs of new transmission lines and equipment among their utility members.

Once a utility is charged its share, it spreads the costs of new transmission projects among its local ratepayers. Because some regions are building new transmission capacity to accommodate data centers, our analysis finds that the public has been forced to pay billions of dollars for data center growth.

Data center energy costs can also be shifted when data centers connect directly to existing power plants. Under what are called “co-location” deals, the power plant stops selling energy to the wider public and just sells to the data center. With less supply in the overall market, prices go up and the public faces higher bills as a result.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/671379/original/file-20250530-56-5o928q.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C505%2C6058%2C3029&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:32.951391

There’s about 900 or close to 1,000 solar jobs lost in West Virginia by 2030.","The U.S. House of Representatives last month passed a bill that would wipe out tax credits for solar projects of every scale, from those generating power for utilities to rooftop panels producing electricity for homeowners.

Curtis Tate spoke with Sean Gallagher, vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, about the economic consequences of the House bill, statewide and nationwide.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tate: What does the House reconciliation bill put at risk?

Gallagher: We’re in an era where we have increasing energy demand, and solar power and energy storage powered by solar is the resource that’s available on the timeline that we need it to meet the rising energy demand from things like data centers and new manufacturing facilities. By putting the brakes on solar energy installations, the House bill poses a real threat to America’s energy future, to our country’s economic stability and to our global competitiveness, and frankly, it threatens to sort of throw the whole AI race to China, the very opposite of what I think the president wants to accomplish.

Tate: The Trump administration is pushing to keep older coal and gas power plants in operation longer. Will that be enough?

Gallagher: I do think we may see some more of that sort of thing with older power plants being asked to stay online longer. But that’s not going to be sufficient to meet the increased energy demand we need to meet that increased energy demand to power the data centers that are going to enable the artificial intelligence that’s coming quickly. Those new sources of energy, as you note, are broadly speaking, going to be solar power and storage. Natural gas turbines simply aren’t available in sufficient quantity in the timeline that’s required. New nuclear, new advanced geothermal are coming along, probably in the 2030s, but on the order of 75% of the power that’s available to be put online in the next five years is solar and energy storage.

Tate: What’s the jobs impact?

Gallagher: We’d lose about 330,000 solar jobs by 2028 including about 94,000 manufacturing jobs. There’s about 900 or close to 1,000 solar jobs lost in West Virginia by 2030. We’ve seen in the last three years a renaissance in solar and energy storage manufacturing here in the United States, largely in Republican districts and in Republican-led states. And we could see as many as 330 factories close down or factories that are in the planning and construction stages now never open. So that would be a real loss for those communities.

Tate: Would this affect homeowners who’d like to install rooftop solar as well?

Gallagher: 100%. The bill, as passed, would basically terminate the availability of the residential tax credit at the end of this year, and that would dramatically reduce the economics of rooftop solar for homeowners and lead to devastating losses in that sector, and also to reduce the ability of homeowners to control their energy bills, and to contribute to grid stability and reliability. It would also result in very large increases in energy prices to consumers across the country if the bill were to be enacted as it’s currently written, because, among other things, it would reduce the amount of power that comes online. And when supply fails to keep up with demand, prices go up. That’s economics 101.

“Through the Brownfields program, Region 8 is helping Montana communities turn yesterday’s liabilities into tomorrow’s opportunities,” said EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western. “By cleaning up these sites, we’re not only improving the environment, but creating opportunities for economic growth, job creation and healthier communities.”

These grants are part of $267 million in Brownfields Grants nationally announced by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. This funding put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

“Thank you Administrator Zeldin and Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western, for your commitment to supporting critical projects that improve the health of our local communities and economies,” said Governor Greg Gianforte. “Through this investment, we’ll continue to ensure Montana remains a treasure for generations to come.”

“The announcement of $8 million in Brownfield Grants in Montana is wonderful news for our state,” said U.S. Senator Steve Daines.“These much-needed cleanup projects will support local economies and improve the health of our communities. I applaud EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and our Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western for their commitment to addressing Montana priorities, and I look forward to working with them on more ways to keep Montana the Last Best Place.”

“I appreciate the EPA’s commitment to bring millions of dollars of investment to Montana so we can work together to build a safer and more prosperous future for Montanans,” said U.S. Senator Tim Sheehy. “These fiscally responsible investments in Montana will go a long way in better stewarding our lands, boosting economy vitality, and making Montana’s communities safer and more vibrant.”

“Through the Brownfields program, DEQ and our incredible local partners have assisted with the redevelopment of over one thousand underutilized properties in Montana,” said Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Sonja Nowakowski. “EPA’s $8 million dollar investment in our state and local programs demonstrates how successful we have been over the years. This EPA funding will augment the recently created Montana Brownfields Fund and ensure blight and contamination in our downtowns can be investigated and cleaned up to bring new investment, jobs, and energy to communities across Montana.”

The following recipients in Montana were selected to receive grant funding for Brownfields assessment activities and cleanup projects:

Beartooth Resource Conservation and Development Area, Inc. – $1,000,000 Revolving Loan Fund: Grant funding will be used to provide four loans and two subgrants to support cleanup activities. Funding will focus on Big Horn (including the Crow Reservation and part of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation), Carbon, Stillwater, Sweet Grass and Yellowstone Counties.

Big Sky Economic Development – $500,000 Assessment Grant: Funding will be used to complete environmental assessments at five properties in Billings to identify if contamination such as asbestos and lead-based paint are present at the sites.

In February, Lucid also signed a binding offtake agreement with Syrah Resources for the supply of Louisiana graphite for battery anodes.

Graphite One has committed to supplying its graphite concentrate from its Graphite Creek deposit in Nome, Alaske, as well as active anode material (AAM) from a facility which is to be built in Warren, Ohio, but remains subject to financing. The initial term for the supply deal will run for a period of five years. The sales price is not entirely clear, but it is “based on a price formula agreeable to both parties,” as Graphite One writes.

“This agreement complements the deal we struck with Lucid in 2024 – which marked the first synthetic graphite agreement between a U.S. graphite developer and a U.S. EV company. We made history then – and we’re continuing to make history now, as the deal makes Graphite One the only company to date to provide both natural and synthetic graphite materials required for battery anodes to a U.S. EV company,” said Graphite One CEO Anthony Huston. “From Presidential Executive Orders to increase mineral resource production and leveraging Alaska’s resource potential, to the recent inclusion of our Company on the Federal Fast-41 Permitting Dashboard — we are building momentum for our efforts to develop a fully domestic graphite supply chain, to meet market demands and strengthen U.S. industry and national defense.”

As mentioned above, Syrah Resources will start supplying Lucid with natural graphite starting next year, which the company also mentioned again in the press release. According to the release, Syrah’s natural graphite AAM will be sourced from its vertically integrated AAM production facility in Vidalia, Louisiana, and Syrah will deliver the graphite for a three-year period.

With the signed supply agreements, Lucid is attempting to build a robust supply chain in the USA, in order to help get around the tariffs set up by the current White House administration, as well as finally launch production in a profitable manner, which the U.S. startup is getting closer to, having achieved its highest turnover yet in 2024, as well as setting a new delivery record. While the delivery record stands at only 3,109 vehicles delivered between January and March of this year, this is nonetheless a steady improvement for the company.

If the Republican-dominated House of Representatives has its way, the Inflation Reduction Act will die a slow and impactful death. Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act will take the wind out of the Biden–Harris administration’s clean energy plans, as popular programs like incentives for solar panels and electric vehicles will be eliminated.

Some — but not all — Senators are eager to fully repeal the IRA, because to do so would reportedly reduce the GDP by $1.1 trillion. It would also please the self-anointed King of the United States, who is tied to Big Oil and the financial endorsements of oil companies and oil billionaires.

There are a number of consequences to canceling the Act: slowing the transition to a less polluted nation, killing investments in factories and reducing future investments, reducing current and future green jobs, and raising consumer energy bills will be by-products of the IRA’s loss.

Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish many current investments in manufacturing, and a lot of those investments have been located in red states where labor and land costs tend to be cheaper. The amount of total investments has been substantial: $321 billion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean-energy facilities, representing 4.7% of all US private investment in the first quarter of 2025. An additional $522 billion of outstanding investment is in jeopardy: 2,217 facilities, with 680,000 operational and construction jobs.

The Rhodium Group outlines how an “often-stated goal of these changes is to bring costs down for American households. We find that repealing the energy tax credits has the opposite effect, increasing household energy costs by $95-290 in 2035—a 2-7% increase in costs that year.”

Jobs and investment: The IRA has sparked more than 400,000 new jobs and $600 billion of private investment in clean energy. Repealing it, says Energy Innovation, will force consumers to pay more for energy and will cost US jobs. Doing so will:

increase cumulative household energy costs by $32 billion from 2025–2035;

cost America nearly 790,000 jobs in 2030 and more than 700,000 jobs in 2035;

decrease GDP more than $160 billion in 2030 and nearly $190 billion in 2035; and,

increase climate pollution by more than 530 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2035, equal to adding 116 million cars to the road.

Households and clean energy: The Residential Clean Energy Credit currently gives households a federal tax break worth 30% of the price of installing solar panels, batteries, geothermal heat pumps, and other energy-producing and energy-saving systems. Its value is uncapped, but in 2023, the more than 1.2 million US families who claimed the credit received an average of roughly $5,000. These upgrades more than pay for themselves over the appliance’s lifetime, according to Rewiring America.

Clean energy production: Clean electricity production and investment tax credits will be eliminated as early as 2026. Moreover, highly restrictive and administratively complex limits on sourcing of components, subcomponents, and critical materials used at a facility will accompany the loss. Both red and blue states are currently struggling to meet the energy needs of their citizens.

Solar: The House bill as it is eliminates a 30% federal tax credit for residential solar systems at the end of the year. Solar array renters will see their premiums jump as companies lose their tax credit for leasing systems to homeowners. Shares of Sunrun Inc., America’s biggest rooftop-solar company, fell as much as 42% on May 22 — the most ever in intraday trading, according to Bloomberg. Equipment provider SolarEdge Technologies Inc. slid as much as 27%. NextEra Energy Inc., the biggest US developer of wind and solar projects, slid as much as 10.7%, the most since October 2023.

Heat pumps: Replacing an oil hot water heater with a high-efficiency electric heat pump through a $2,000 federal tax credit for the devices won’t be available after the end of the 2025.

Electric vehicles: The $7,500 federal tax rebate for new electric vehicle purchases no longer would have an end date of 2032 — it would end in December 2025. And there’s pain for those of us who already own an EV: the House bill adds a $250 charge to registration fees for electric vehicles and a similar $100 charge to registration of hybrid vehicles. Supposedly, this value tax assuages lost gasoline tax revenue for non-internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs).

“Notably, updates to the Inflation Reduction Act more than doubled the amount of owners who indicated they received a federal tax credit/rebate,” JD Power wrote, “and more than half of BEV buyers cited tax credits as a reason for purchasing their vehicle, which is among the most influential purchase drivers.”

Emissions: And the repercussions of cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act go deeper than just financial considerations. Emissions could increase anywhere between at least 500 million metric tons and more than a gigaton in 2035.

Carbon capture: Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act actually will have one good consequence. Eliminating $3.7 billion in funding previously earmarked by the Department of Energy (DOE) for carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen fuels, synthetic fuels, and a variety of other industrial decarbonization technologies is the right move, albeit an accidental one.

Hope Springs Eternal that Cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act Won’t Be as Devastating

Not every Senator is hot to implement cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act. Several Republican senators seem to have questions about the phaseout of incentives, including for clean electricity.

Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), who is up for reelection next year in the purple state, was one of four Senate Republicans who signed an April letter urging a targeted approach to reforming renewable energy tax incentives rather than a wholesale repeal. The letter emphasized “the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.” The Senators agreed that “fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code” were appropriate, they also cautioned “against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader.”

The other signatories to the April letter were Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, and John Curtis of Utah.

Canary Media describes the extent of clean energy in NC: “a leader in the emerging electric vehicle supply chain, with lithium mines, Toyota’s massive battery plant in Randolph County, and EV factories all in the works.” The state has over 109,000 clean energy jobs, the ninth most in the country.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters that the Senate plans to write its own version of the bill. Nonetheless, renewable energy stocks are on a downward spiral, even as some Wall Street analysts concur that the final Senate bill isn’t likely to be as damaging to the industry as the House version would be.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DALL·E-2023-12-21-10.35.51-A-panoramic-metaphorical-image-showcasing-a-giant-heat-pump-massively-outweighing-a-smaller-scale-building-efficiency.-The-scene-is-set-in-a-balanced-800x457.png,N,,2025-06-06 08:31:30.348073

Reduced federal enforcement – coupled with potential cuts in EPA funding for state environmental programs, if enacted – will likely create more opportunities for these private citizen enforcement cases.
EPA's Brownfields Program would face a 50 percent cut ($12.9 million reduction from $25.7 million), with various state brownfield assistance grants being slashed or eliminated entirely.
Companies face immediate compliance considerations as regulations remain in effect even if federal enforcement thereof diminishes, and personnel reductions could lead to longer-than-expected delays in any planned regulatory repeals or adjustments.
Reduced federal enforcement may also lead to increased citizen suits and more aggressive state enforcement actions, creating different enforcement priorities and approaches in some states compared to traditional federal enforcement patterns.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) budget proposal for fiscal year (FY) 2026 fundamentally reimagines the federal government's role in environmental policy and regulation. If enacted by Congress, EPA's budget would be cut from $9.14 billion in FY 2025 to $4.16 billion in FY 2026 – a roughly 54 percent reduction without precedent in the last 50 years. EPA's workforce would be capped at 12,856 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions – the lowest staffing levels in 40 years, down from FY 2025 levels (14,130 FTE).

The proposed budget frames these changes as signaling ""a return to common sense environmental policy"" and emphasizes ""a back-to-basics approach that will lower the cost of living, remove unnecessary barriers for business and industry, empower states, and return the Agency to administering core statutory obligations as Congress intended.""

The budget proposal recognizes that states, Tribes and local governments ""are best positioned to address the unique environmental challenges facing their communities"" while concluding that ""many programs are mature or have accomplished their purpose"" with previous federal funding. The emphasis for the remaining funding shifts to Tribal capacity building with a goal of ""encouraging greater independence from federal oversight."" If enacted, the significantly reduced federal funding could present barriers for states and local governments in their budget processes and regulatory compliance efforts, particularly as they seek to build or repair critical infrastructure.

EPA's Five Priority Pillars

The budget outlines five priorities for 2026, titled as follows:

Ensure Clean Air, Land, and Water for Every American

Restore American Energy Dominance

Permitting Reform, Cooperative Federalism and Cross-Agency Partnership

Make the United States the Artificial Intelligence Capital of the World

Protecting and Bringing Back American Auto Jobs

Infrastructure and State Grant Eliminations

The budget makes dramatic cuts to programs supporting state and local environmental infrastructure, representing the largest dollar reductions. Water infrastructure funding faces cuts of nearly 90 percent: Clean Water State Revolving Fund would be cut by $1.5 billion from $1.64 billion (90.5 percent reduction), Drinking Water State Revolving Fund by $976.1 million from $1.13 billion (87 percent reduction), and Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act funding by $64.3 million from $72.3 million (89 percent reduction). All but three categorical grants to states would be eliminated entirely, with only Underground Injection Control, Tribal General Assistance Program and Tribal Air Quality Management grants left in place (and at approximately FY 2025 levels). The largest categorical grant eliminations include State and Local Air Quality Management ($235.6 million), Pollution Control Section 106 grants ($225.4 million), Nonpoint Source Section 319 grants ($174.3 million), Public Water System Supervision ($115.8 million) and Brownfields ($46.2 million), with categorical grants totaling approximately $1 billion in cuts.

Additional major program eliminations include Atmospheric Protection ($108.4 million), Resource Recovery and Hazardous Waste Grants ($101.4 million), Environmental Justice ($100 million) and the Diesel Emissions Reduction Grant Program ($90 million), among other programs totaling $557.1 million. The proposal would also cut more than $83 million from regional water quality ""geographic programs,"" with the largest reductions affecting San Francisco Bay (76 percent cut), Lake Pontchartrain (54 percent cut), Puget Sound (47 percent cut) and Lake Champlain (37 percent cut).

Air and Climate Programs

The budget proposal reflects EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin's announced intentions to significantly restructure the agency's Office of Air and Radiation by eliminating the Office of Atmospheric Protection (OAP) and Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), along with restructuring their components into two new offices: Office of State Air Partnerships and Office of Clean Air Programs. The budget proposal would result in substantial cuts in numerous air and climate programs, including several areas slated for 100 percent elimination, including State and Local Air Quality Management Categorical Grants ($235.6 million), Atmospheric Protection Program ($100 million) and Diesel Emissions Reduction Act Grant Program ($90 million), among others. Additional areas are slated for major decreases, such as the proposed 65 percent cut to air quality research (from $96 million to $33 million).

The proposed budget would increase funding for a few key priorities:

Stationary Source Deregulatory Actions. The budget highlights and indirectly opines on multiple Clean Air Act rules EPA intends to reconsider, including greenhouse gas requirements for power plants, methane rules ""throttling"" the oil and gas sector, and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) requirements that ""improperly target"" coal-fired power plants. The administration proposes to set aside funding to support its efforts to reconsider these and other Clean Air Act rules.

State Implementation Plan (SIP) Backlog. The budget proposal sets aside funding within the Federal Support for Air Quality Management Program ""to address and resolve the backlog of SIPs,"" despite an overall $18.7 million reduction to this program. This reflects the administration's previously stated priority to clear the backlog of SIPs awaiting EPA action. Extra funding and resources devoted to this issue could help ensure that as the agency works to clear this backlog, it does so not only swiftly but in a durable and legally defensible way.

Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS). The administration also proposes to increase funding and staffing for programs aimed at reducing ODS under the Clean Air Act.

Enforcement Transformation

The budget reflects EPA's enforcement approach, with the agency stating it will ""focus[] enforcement on clear and substantial violations of the law that cause significant harm and that cannot be addressed by states."" Major cuts include a 30 percent reduction in civil enforcement (cutting $61.1 million from $201.3 million), 49 percent cut to criminal enforcement (cutting $29.6 million from $60 million), 35 percent reduction in compliance monitoring (cutting $38 million from $107.1 million) and complete elimination of enforcement funding for environmental justice purposes.

The agency states it ""will target enforcement and compliance assurance on pollution, ensuring a fair approach to environmental remediation"" and ""focus on critical national security actions"" such as illegal imports.

The proposed cuts reinforce signals of a clear federal retreat from enforcement activities. Unlike regulatory actions subject to statutory deadlines, EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have enormous discretion regarding enforcement cases. The administration has already shifted and narrowed enforcement priorities simply by aligning them with its own directives and executive orders, regardless of congressional action on the proposed budget. However, most of the major EPA-enforced statutes also include citizen suit enforcement provisions, often allowing private actors to sue over alleged environmental violations in federal court. Reduced federal enforcement – coupled with potential cuts in EPA funding for state environmental programs, if enacted – will likely create more opportunities for these private citizen enforcement cases.

Superfund and Cleanup Programs

Congressional appropriations for the Superfund remedial program would be eliminated entirely, with the administration arguing that renewed Superfund taxes from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act can fund the program. The program would gain 45.7 new full-time positions while transitioning entirely to tax-based funding to ""conduct critical pre-construction projects, continue ongoing construction projects, and initiate new remedial work at National Priority List (NPL) sites to address contaminants including lead and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).""

EPA's Brownfields Program would face a 50 percent cut ($12.9 million reduction from $25.7 million), with various state brownfield assistance grants being slashed or eliminated entirely.

Enhanced Economic Analysis and Permitting Reform

The budget includes funding for ""a more detailed employment analysis"" of rulemakings that would account for ""regulatory job displacement, including through offshoring of production,"" focusing on electric power, oil, gas and auto manufacturing sectors. This suggests the administration is intent on not just advancing abstract legal arguments, but also building a robust economic justification to support its deregulatory agenda. Those factual considerations could prove important as courts continue to defer to agencies on discretionary, technical details even though no longer deferring to agency statutory interpretations.1

Despite overall cuts, EPA proposes $8 million for an Integrated Environmental Strategies Program to improve permitting and environmental review processes while promoting economic growth. The budget specifically calls for ""data tracking, analysis, and problem-solving to support permitting reform initiatives such as implementing a continuous improvement project to reduce the time it takes for EPA to issue Class VI well permits and standardize EPA's Class VI permitting process across regions.""

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementation would receive a 6 percent increase ($1.2 million additional funding from $19.9 million), reflecting the administration's focus on permitting reform and making environmental reviews ""faster, and more cost effectively while building capacity and improving testing on innovations.""

Next Steps

During the first Trump Administration, Congress ultimately did not support similarly focused proposed cuts to EPA's budget following advocacy from those who would be adversely impacted by them. However, even if Congress acts to reject most or all of the projected reductions in funding when it acts on the FY 2026 budget, significant staffing reductions that have already taken place and are expected to continue to progress will likely slow activities such as permit reviews, chemical and pesticide reviews and approvals and rulemaking processes. The departing staff are expected to include some of EPA's most experienced senior scientists and other personnel, representing a wide range of expertise in administering EPA programs. This expertise will be very difficult to replace.

Companies face immediate compliance considerations as regulations remain in effect even if federal enforcement thereof diminishes, and personnel reductions could lead to longer-than-expected delays in any planned regulatory repeals or adjustments. The combination of reduced federal oversight, slowed rulemaking efforts and potential increases in state-level regulations creates regulatory uncertainty since states may pursue alternative approaches or standards that don't require federal approval, potentially creating a patchwork of requirements.

Reduced federal enforcement may also lead to increased citizen suits and more aggressive state enforcement actions, creating different enforcement priorities and approaches in some states compared to traditional federal enforcement patterns.

The FY 2026 budget proposal represents a shift toward deferring to state agencies while also proposing to dramatically reduce federal support for those state agencies, all while EPA is also making significant reductions to the numbers of personnel who would typically be charged with writing new regulations and providing support in federal oversight or enforcement efforts. Companies should monitor congressional appropriations processes closely, prepare for increased state-level regulatory activity and potential citizen suit enforcement actions, and consider how voluntary compliance agreements might provide certainty in an uncertain regulatory environment.

Currently, tracking how much carbon is produced from electricity use relies on broad, outdated averages that don't reflect exactly when or where the power was used.

A new ""consumed emissions"" dashboard, launched by Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Singularity Energy, is tackling the issue of tracking energy and creating near-real-time, location-specific data on the carbon footprint of electricity usage across a 15-state region, from Louisiana to North Dakota.

The tool was developed to solve a longstanding blind spot in U.S. emissions tracking: the inability to measure the carbon intensity of electricity consumption in real time and at a granular, location-specific level.

Since 2022, MISO has shared public dashboards showing past power plant pollution, and this new consumed emissions dashboard adds updates that show how much pollution is being created and which fuels are causing it.

Greg Miller, research and policy lead at Singularity, told Canary Media, ""This may be for only one region in the U.S. But it proves it's possible to calculate this data — and other grid operators can do it too, if this data were required more broadly in accounting standards.""

The dashboard provides hour-by-hour carbon data at the state and county level, which enables utilities, companies, and regulators to see the environmental impact of power on the grid. That level of specificity matters because electricity generation is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions globally, and decarbonizing the grid requires data on major sources of emissions.

The tool helps reduce inefficiencies by providing details on power plant emissions and how electricity flows across the grid, and it can be used to prevent double-counting resources. Clarity about energy consumption ensures emissions reductions are real, not just estimates.

In previous years, the grid's inefficiencies have cost ratepayers over $20 billion. With better emissions visibility, states can plan infrastructure investments more wisely, avoid costly overbuilds of gas-fired power plants, and focus instead on low-emission solutions like solar or wind energy.

Also, as utilities reduce emissions in energy production, they also reduce pollutants produced from burning fuel that currently kill about 100,000 Americans each year.

Democrats’ support rose from 37% to 52%.
“(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate.","This story was originally published by Floodlight.

Republicans and Democrats alike are less likely to support renewable energy than they were five years ago, according to a survey released Thursday by the Pew Research Center.

The results mirror growing pockets of opposition to solar farms, reignited political support for coal plants and moves by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to kill federally funded clean energy projects.

This shift in opinion dates back to before Democratic President Joe Biden took office, said Brian Kennedy, Pew senior researcher and one of the study’s authors. “This isn’t a new trend,” he said.

Still, Kenneth Gillingham, professor of environmental and energy economics at the Yale School of the Environment, was surprised.

“I see this shift … as a successful effort to link climate change and renewable energy to broader culture war issues,” Gillingham said. He added that in the past, “prominent” Republicans supported renewables and sought solutions to climate change, but those stances could now be seen as “disloyal” to Trump.

The survey of 5,085 U.S. adults taken April 28 to May 4 revealed that while 79% of Americans favored expanding wind and solar production in 2020, that number has dropped to 60%. And 39% of Americans today support expansion of oil, coal and natural gas — almost double the 20% that supported it in 2020.

Combustion of fossil fuels — in transportation, energy generation and industrial production — is the No. 1 cause of climate change.

Much of the change in opinion is driven by Republicans, whose support of oil and gas grew from 35% in 2020 to 67% today. But Democrats also indicated less support for renewable energy and more for fossil fuels than five years ago.

While many results reflect Trump’s policies opposing most renewables and boosting fossil fuels, Pew found a few notable exceptions: 69% of all respondents favor offshore wind — a technology Trump has specifically targeted.

Both Democrats and Republicans indicated stronger support for nuclear power, with Republicans’ favorable opinions increasing from 53% in 2020 to 69% in 2025. Democrats’ support rose from 37% to 52%. The Trump administration has signaled support for a nuclear renaissance, despite its high cost.

There were wide partisan splits on several topics. In March, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would scale back environmental regulations. Pew asked whether it was possible to do that and still protect air and water quality: 77% of Republicans said yes and 67% of Democrats said no.

Pew didn’t ask the respondents why their attitudes have shifted. But Kennedy said in Pew’s past surveys, Republicans have expressed concern about the economic impacts of climate change policies and transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

Mike Murphy, a Republican consultant and electric vehicle backer, said when the environmental benefits of clean technologies are touted, it polarizes Republicans. Instead, Murphy said messages should be about pocketbook issues — like lower fuel costs — and jobs.

“It’s hard for pro-climate people to understand,” said Murphy, who has advised dozens of state and national GOP campaigns including John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid. “(They think) we just need to shout louder and hit people over the head about climate, climate, climate. The key is you want to talk about jobs and national security and other events that naturally resonate a lot more with right-of-center people.”

That’s what Murphy’s groups, the EV Politics Project and the American EV Jobs Alliance are trying to do to depoliticize electric vehicles. “Whenever electric cars are seen through a climate lens,” Murphy said, “their appeal narrows.”

It’s a strategy also being used by the Electrification Coalition, a left-of-center pro-EV group. Ben Prochazka, the coalition’s executive director, echoed Murphy’s strategy, adding that EVs have “become overly politicized and caught in the culture wars, impacting markets and ultimately hurting our ability to realize their many benefits for all Americans.”

Prochazka noted that once introduced to EVs, consumers support them: “EV drivers love their vehicles, with more than eight out of ten reporting that their next car will also be electric.”

Perhaps those practical messages are getting through. In the Pew survey, electric vehicles were the one item that saw an uptick in support – 4 percentage points in the past year.

But popular support might not be enough to stop Congress from killing a $7,500 electric vehicle credit, which Murphy said would be “policy disaster.”

Republicans, he said, are in a “real squeeze,” because “they don’t have enough money for the tax cuts the president has promised.”

Said Murphy: “It’s easier for Republicans to cut Biden electric cars … than it is for them to cut more Medicaid.”

Gillingham is still optimistic that solar, wind and other greenhouse gas-reducing technologies will move forward — because they are the cheapest.

“The continued decline in the price of renewable energy and battery technologies, as well as other new technologies, is a reason to continue to have hope that the worst impacts of climate change can be addressed,” he said.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/offshore_wind_turbines-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:45.166285

Voluntary conservation practices help farmers and ranchers better steward the land and should remain in the next farm bill, Texas Farm Bureau President Russell Boening told a Congressional subcommittee this week.

“Voluntary conservation practices have become a cornerstone of modern agricultural operations,” Boening said. “Our family implements conservation practices to improve water quality, soil health and wildlife habitat while keeping our land productive. We are not unique. Farmers across Texas and the country are seizing the opportunity to utilize conservation programs.”

Boening testified Thursday, June 5, before the U.S. House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Research and Biotechnology, helping lawmakers understand how conservation efforts drive sustainability and why continued support is essential.

From planting cover crops and rotating livestock to restoring native grasses and managing water use more efficiently, farmers and ranchers are using science-based strategies to protect natural resources without sacrificing yields.

Programs like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program have helped farmers execute these on-farm conservation practices.

But continued success, Boening said, requires Congressional support and practical improvements.

“All of these programs have become increasingly oversubscribed, with demand consistently surpassing available funding,” Boening said. “The greatest challenge for producers is gaining entry. For Texans, EQIP is of utmost importance given the 50% set aside for livestock operations.”

He urged the subcommittee to increase funding and raise payment rates so that implementing conservation practices is more financially feasible. He emphasized the need to simplify application processes and reduce paperwork burdens.

Boening also called for more flexibility in program design and expanded technical assistance, noting that many farmers struggle to access help due to agency staffing shortages.

“Farmers often express concern about the shortage of technical service providers available to assist with conservation practices, as this lack of support can delay or limit their ability to implement these programs,” Boening said.

The shortage is especially challenging in rural or underserved areas, where access to trained professionals is already limited. Boening noted expanding and better supporting the trained service professionals is essential to ensure farmers can navigate the programs and achieve conservation goals.

“We challenge members of this subcommittee to work toward reauthorizing the farm bill to ensure that farmers have access to conservation programs that promote environmental stewardship,” Boening said.",https://texasfarmbureau.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Boening-Testimony.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:27.108906

Watch Chairman Arrington's remarks HERE.

Excerpts from the Chairman’s Speech

Comparing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to the Inflation Reduction Act

“Let’s do a comparison and contrast with our Democrat colleagues when they had control of both chambers and the White House. They too used the tool of budget reconciliation to advance what was their partisan Democrat agenda. They spent over the last four years, under the Biden-Harris administration and Democrat control, they added $8 trillion to the national debt. They did it by expanding the federal government, offering Obamacare to people making hundreds of thousands of dollars, price-fixing in the drug markets and having premiums go up on seniors. They did it by expanding the IRS by 80,000 IRS agents and by offering tax subsidies to green energy corporations to the tune of $850 billion dollars. So, when they had the tool of budget reconciliation and unified Democrat leadership, that’s what they offered to the American people: more spending, more debt, more government and less freedom.

We have the tool and the unified Republican control of both chambers and we’re investing in border security and defense because we believe the safety and security of the American people is job number one. Providing the common defense is the first and most important job of the federal government.

Secondly, we’re spending money to allow hardworking American families to keep more of their money and to incentivize investment, growth, job creation, wage increase because we have been sputtering along because of the failed economic policies of the failed economic policies of my Democrat colleagues and the Biden-Harris administration and their unbridled reckless spending.

So, there’s your comparison. One gives you more government, with more spending and debt and the other has a completely offset [approach], with a modest reduction in deficit spending, a ten-point reduction in debt to GDP. And we have the largest tax cut, the largest spending cut, the largest investment in border and defense in the history of this country… [It’s] the most significant commitment to unlocking American energy resources in our nation’s history.”

Setting the Record Straight on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s Growth Assumption

“In defense of some of the myths and false claims that [have] propagated, [like suggestions] this bill will somehow increase the debt — [that] is totally false and is using a baseline CBO score with a growth assumption based on the policies and laws of the last four years.

I think 1.8% growth is actually generous considering the last four years and the economic policies of our Democrat colleagues. What we did was we assumed a growth rate not based on CBO or JCT or any other predictive modeling. We said the best way to predict future achievement is past performance. What did President Biden have as an annual average growth rate? What did President Trump achieve? On average, Biden was at 2.7 percent if you control for COVID. If you control for COVID, then Trump had a 2.8 percent annual average. Since World War II, the annual average has been a little over 3 percent. We picked a conservative number, but we know we’ll outperform it with good energy policies, work incentives, deregulation, America First trade, and locking [in] low taxes from TCJA. Well, that 2.6 percent annual average, that conservative growth assumption, will yield $2.5 trillion over the ten-year budget window.

If you stack the spending reforms— which by the way, are the deepest cuts by two times in our nation’s history—[and] you add the two, you totally offset the cost of border, of defense, and any cost associated with reducing taxes. So, it’s fiscally responsible. It will do the two things that you primarily need to do in order to restore the fiscal health of this country and put it on a stable path, and prevent or stave of a debt crisis of some magnitude. It grows the economy; it deals with economic growth which brings revenue to the Treasury. One percent growth over the projections of CBO is $3 trillion against the deficit and it starts to bend the curve on deficit spending.”

Another route is to forgo downscaling and bias correction and instead build global climate models at superhigh resolutions.","Austin, Texas—A wastewater treatment plant isn’t top on everyone’s sightseeing itinerary. But on a cloudless, breezy day in April, Agmed Weber, operations manager for the Walnut Creek plant—which handles more than half of the sewage here in Texas’s booming capital city—is an enthusiastic tour guide. He marvels at the foresight of those who built the jumbo plant a half-century ago, when Austin was a third of its current size. “They were really thinking about the future,” he says. Weber feels a similar pressure—to prepare for not only continued population growth, but also a hotter future. Austin is “in a tight space where we need to think ahead,” he says.

The plant is dominated by vast outdoor pools in which microbes chew through waste until it is clean enough to return to rivers. But in one corner sit two large tanks and a series of purple pipes that route some of the treated wastewater back to the city to water lawns or flush toilets. Based on a climate study that predicts more severe droughts in Austin’s future, the city is planning, by 2050, to increase the amount of reused wastewater by more than 10 times, as part of a $1 billion expansion of the plant. “That program is going to grow exponentially,” Weber says.

Like many cities around the world, Austin is now facing questions about how to build and adapt for a changing climate. A growing number of these cities—as well as insurance companies, home builders, and farmers—are turning to climate modelers for answers. But despite decades of effort, forecasting how global warming will play out on a local scale remains a stubborn challenge, riven with uncertainty. There is little agreement on how best to convert climate models, which simulate the entire world at coarse resolutions, into the detailed local forecasts of temperature and rainfall that planners crave. Different methods lead to drastically different projections, especially in terms of rainfall—even when using the same climate model. “It really is a mess right now,” says Alex Hall, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The problem has become more pronounced with the discovery that global climate models, good at the big picture, often miss local impacts that are already painfully evident. For example, despite nailing the overall pace and intensity of global warming, models did not predict the more frequent heat waves that are plaguing Europe. In order to make local forecasts, modelers must not only do the global-to-local conversion, but also adjust for these model biases. Tiffany Shaw, a climate dynamicist at the University of Chicago, calls this “the other climate crisis.” “The cat’s going to get out of the bag, and the question will be, what value does this information have?”

While scientists fret about the limitations of their models, others are not as cautious. Dozens of firms have sprung up selling climate risk products, often promising unrealistic levels of detail, down to a city block. “It’s unfortunately closer to a Wild West scenario right now,” says David Lafferty, a climate scientist at Cornell University. “There is a real need to evaluate those products.”

But there is little time. City by city, county by county, decisions must be made about the capacity and resilience of infrastructure in a fast-approaching future that humanity has never experienced. Deep in the heart of Texas, reservoirs need to be built and pipes need to be laid.

Located in the dry Texas Hill Country, Austin has always depended on the Colorado River for its water. Not that Colorado River, but rather the Texas Colorado River, which slashes nearly 1400 kilometers through the state before emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. The Colorado was a source of life, but also of hardship when it flooded or dried up. Finally, in the late 1950s, the state built a series of dams, creating reservoirs. One sits astride Austin’s downtown: a long placid lake lined with boardwalks, running trails, and the reflections of newly built high-rises.

The reservoirs made Austin more resilient but not impregnably so. From 2008 to 2016, the city suffered its worst drought since the 1950s. Reservoir levels dropped by two-thirds. Residents faced severe water-use restrictions, and farmers downstream lost billions of dollars’ worth of crops. It was a scary time, says Marisa Flores Gonzalez, who leads water resources planning at Austin Water, the city’s utility. “When you’re in the middle of a drought that’s very severe, you don’t know where the bottom is.”

Prompted by that drought, Flores Gonzalez and her colleagues wondered how much lower the bottoms might be in a warmer future. “We are a land of extremes,” she says. “We have to be prepared.” At the state level, Texas does not factor climate change into assessments of future drought risk, a policy that may reflect the dominance of climate-skeptical Republicans in its government. But Austin, the state’s leading Democratic stronghold, is under no such restriction.

Flores Gonzalez had studied the Texas landscape from an early age. As a teen, she helped her father with his small business, which used geographic information systems (GIS) tools to help energy and water utilities plan infrastructure. In college at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin, she first pursued an English degree. “I was going to be the next great Mexican American writer,” she says. Then the 2008 recession hit, and she switched to geography. “I knew utilities. I knew GIS. And so I adjusted my plans.”

She joined Austin Water just as the city kicked off a study of its future water supply, an effort it calls Water Forward. The scientists who contributed to the first report followed standard practice at the time. They took the outputs from 20 different global climate models (using only the most severe greenhouse gas emissions scenario—one now seen as implausible). They took temperature and rain measurements from local weather stations and adjusted them based on the projected climate change signal. Then they used those forecasts to estimate the key factor for water infrastructure: future flows in the Colorado near Austin.

In some ways, the projections that ended up in the 2018 report weren’t surprising: Austin would have more dry days, and on days when it did rain, it would rain more, reflecting the ability of warmer air to hold more water. Overall, annual flows on the Colorado in the last 2 decades of the century would be 30% lower than today’s.

But a few outliers among the 20 models suggested that, because of extreme rainstorms, annual flows in some years could end up seven times today’s annual average—an Amazonian prediction that didn’t sit right with Flores Gonzalez and made her question the whole modeling process. Austin was preparing to be drier. But should it really prepare to be wetter, too?

When you hear the phrase “climate model,” it’s tempting to think researchers have created a silicon simulacrum of the planet, down to the finest detail. But because of computational constraints, most climate models simulate the planet coarsely, dividing the atmosphere and oceans up into gridlike boxes 100 kilometers wide or more. Using the equations of fluid dynamics, the models calculate how the atmosphere evolves as energy and moisture flow from box to box in discrete time steps.

Big picture, the models get a lot right: They’ve precisely charted the nearly 1.5°C rise in temperatures the world has experienced since the 1800s, along with accelerated warming in the Arctic and over the continents. “The basic physics is sound,” says Timothy Palmer, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford. But they do have stubborn biases, particularly when it comes to how winds and moisture flow around the planet. Those biases often emerge not from the equations of fluid dynamics, but rather the empirical codes used to handle processes, such as cloud formation, that the models can’t simulate directly.

Until recently, Shaw says, “we were making predictions of worlds we couldn’t see.” But with the warming so strong now, and with several decades of observations in hand, climate scientists can now identify model flaws by comparing their predictions with what has transpired in the real world.

Last year, Shaw co-led a workshop that confronted the problem head on, leading to a paper this year in Science Advances that ran through a laundry list of the models’ failures. Not only did they fail to predict heat waves in Europe, but they also missed a cooling in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. They overlooked the strengthening of the North Atlantic jet stream in winter, which increases rain and snow in Northern Europe, and they also missed the more frequent occurrence of stalled high-pressure systems over Greenland, which bring sunny days and rapid ice melt. They failed to capture a cooling in the Southern Ocean, and they predicted that arid regions would get moister when they didn’t. “I really think this is a time of reflection and maturation,” Shaw says.

Given the models’ limitations, many climate scientists eschew regional projections and think the even harder task of making hyperlocal predictions is a fool’s errand.

But a whole field nevertheless arose to do just that. Like investigators in a crime procedural show who magnify a telling detail in a photo, somehow increasing its pixel density in the process, these approaches aim to wring local detail from a coarse global picture.

One way to do this “downscaling and bias correction,” as it is known, is by taking the output from a global climate model and feeding it into another model that covers a smaller area at high resolution. Such models can capture the details of storms and the way mountains affect weather, but because they still rely on input from the global models, they inherit biases that must be accounted for. And they are computationally expensive to run: A supercomputer that can run a global model would not have the power to simulate Texas alone at a resolution of 10 kilometers.

A more common—and computationally cheaper—method was pioneered several decades ago by Andy Wood, a hydrologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. He took daily, local records of temperature and precipitation, averaging them together to match the grid size of a global climate model and its monthly cadence. He could then compare the historical records with the climate model to gauge the magnitude of the model’s bias. Finally, after adjusting the local records based on the model’s forecast for the region, he undid the averaging imposed at the start to create new high-resolution climate projections.

By now, these techniques have proliferated into a whole cottage industry of ever more complex statistical matching. But the complexity hasn’t brought certainty. Even when the same climate model is used for the exact same region, the adjustments can produce widely varying results, as Wood and others laid out in a study in Environmental Research Letters (ERL) in April. For example, one method predicts the Pacific Northwest should expect 90 millimeters of summer rain by 2100; under another, that projection drops in half. For other parts of the United States, like the Rocky Mountain West, the choice of method can mean the difference between expecting more rain than the present—or less.

The adjustments can also wipe out any trends predicted by a climate model. Last year, Auroop Ganguly, a climate scientist at Northeastern University, and his colleagues applied a widely used downscaling and bias correction method to two different outputs: real climate model data and random noise. To their shock, the results were statistically indistinguishable. Every lesson from the model was lost, they found in a study published in ERL. “All the science that goes into building these earth system models was rendered meaningless,” Ganguly says. Adaptation planners and scientists in developing countries use the technique, so its shortcomings could have practical consequences. “The implications are really serious,” Ganguly says.

Wood has grown frustrated as downscaling methods have gotten more elaborate. “We still have no real confidence to determine that one downscaling method is better than another” at projecting future climate, he says. “At some point it becomes unpalatable. It, to some extent, destroys confidence in the results.”

He also wonders whether the projections from global models, however coarse and unreliable, are good enough for practical purposes. “It may get you to the same decision for your infrastructure as if you went through that increasingly unpalatable process,” he says.

The first Austin Water Forward report was a tremendous learning experience for Flores Gonzalez, who now comfortably drops climate science jargon like “CMIP”—the acronym for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, of course. When city officials began planning a second report in 2018, they wanted the best possible projections. They created an advisory group to provide real-time peer review of the process. And this time the city hired climate scientists at UT, including Zong-Liang Yang and his graduate student at the time, Sabiha Tabassum.

Yang and Tabassum made several changes at the start. First, they used projections for high-, medium-, and low-emission futures, representing a broader spread in possibility. Second, knowing the different biases that existed, they didn’t treat every climate model as equally valid. Rather, they sifted through 35 climate models and found the ones that best captured the Texas climate. This filtering led them to five models, from South Korea, Australia, and Europe. “We have high confidence they are giving the right results for the right reasons,” Yang says.

All too often, local climate projections skip this step, says Douglas Maraun, a climate scientist at the University of Graz. “The key aspect is model evaluation.” Often researchers use the model they are most comfortable with, whatever it says—or they use a global suite of data that has already been downscaled. Such global data sets are particularly problematic, as rarely does one model handle everywhere in the world well, says John Nielsen-Gammon, the state’s climatologist at Texas A&M University. “The users of downscaled information typically do not know what the strengths or weaknesses are.”

The UT team converted the models’ output into a regional forecast using standard downscaling and bias correction methods. But because the models tracked the region so well, Yang says, the corrections were relatively minor. After that, the data were converted into Colorado River flow, the numbers that mattered for Austin.

The results looked more plausible than before. The number of dry days increased, while rain grew concentrated into more severe storms. “But those extreme flows were less prevalent in this round than the last one,” Tabassum says. After integrating these projections with others, such as population growth, the team found that, in half of the scenarios considered, the city would begin to run out of water in 2070.

The new Water Forward report, approved by the Austin city council late last year, includes strategies to forestall that future. The city should drastically expand its use of reclaimed water in its distinctive purple pipes. It should encourage its residents to use less water. It should explore storing water in a dedicated underground aquifer for use during drought; it should add a backup reservoir, an existing lake previously used by a power utility; and it should study the possibility of desalinating groundwater. Finally, the report said, the city should prepare for true emergency scenarios where treated water from its sewage plant would be fed back into a reservoir and reused as drinking water.

In short, it said: The future is drier—and riskier—but still livable.

The next time Austin—or any other city—sets out to forecast its climate future, it may have better tools. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funded a project co-led by Benjamin Kirtman, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami, to pit different downscaling techniques against each other, applying them to different climate models and seeing how the results diverge. “Do this over and over again and you can ultimately assess how well they work,” he says. His ultimate aim is to help develop the underpinnings of a climate projection service for wide use by local governments.

Later this year, Berkeley Earth, a California climate nonprofit previously known for its focus on historical climate records, will debut another approach, which it calls its Climate Model Synthesis. The project will take 40 global climate models and, for each region in the world, find the ones that best match historical observations. It will then use a machine-learning algorithm informed by Berkeley Earth’s high-resolution temperature record to downscale the results. The end result should be local, reasonably accurate projections that reflect “the breadth of uncertainty and expertise represented by the models,” says Robert Rohde, Berkeley Earth’s chief scientist.

Another route is to forgo downscaling and bias correction and instead build global climate models at superhigh resolutions. That’s the drive at Destination Earth, an EU initiative costing more than €300 million that has now run prototype global models at a 5-kilometer resolution, using some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. “The idea is to operationalize climate projections for the first time” by regularly updating these projects, says Irina Sandu, its director. “It’s creating a globally consistent map of downscaled information.”

But even with all its computing power, the team has only been able to complete projections out to 2040. And running the models multiple times to capture the spread of possibilities is prohibitively expensive. That’s why Sandu and others believe they will need to take advantage of the promising ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to emulate climate models and repeat their runs quickly—an approach that is already catching on for ordinary weather forecasting, with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the world’s leading forecaster, pioneering it.

ECMWF and Google, among others, have teams looking at how to use such advanced AI to entirely replace the downscaling done by high-resolution regional climate models. After training on a climate model, Google’s AI substitute proved particularly good at capturing compound extremes such as high heat and winds. “It allows us to really sample all the possible states of the atmosphere,” says Ignacio Lopez-Gomez, who led a Google study published in April in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And the limited computation needed to run it could make its power widely available.

Early one morning back in downtown Austin, Boyce Freitag descended into an underground concrete cistern the size of a large rowhouse. From a balcony, he looked onto the dark pool below. Light from a hole in the ceiling illuminated the grimy patina of the cistern’s walls. “Hope spiders don’t give you the skeevies,” he says. Originally built for a defunct power plant, the cistern found a purpose again last decade when Austin built its new central library next door. “This is where the magic happens,” adds Freitag, the library’s building manager.

The cistern collects rainwater from neighborhood storm drains, which is then pumped to the gleaming library to flush toilets. It’s just one example of where the city is going, Flores Gonzalez says. After the first Water Forward report, the city rolled out leak-detecting smart water meters to nearly every resident. And now new, large commercial buildings will be required to incorporate water reuse into their plans from the start.

Austin Water’s collaboration with the UT researchers will continue. Flores Gonzalez takes pride in their analysis of Austin’s future, but they still have more to do: They want to better understand just how much river flow could increase in future years when a warmer atmosphere delivers exceptional rainfall, for example. But Austin knows enough to act, she says. “The next 10 years are going to be some of the most important years in Austin Water’s history.”

The adaptation can’t come soon enough. Several years ago, the city once again plunged into drought. And its bottom is still unknown.",https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.zmq4rob/abs/_20250605_nf_fuzzy_atmosphere_drought.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:31.735261

I support thoughtful and strategic development, particularly projects that enhance ecotourism—provided they maintain environmental integrity and deliver lasting benefits to our communities. My vision is one of balance: protecting our region’s ecological assets while fostering sustainable economic growth.

Throughout my tenure, I have consistently championed nature-based solutions to improve flood protection, preserve critical watersheds, restore native habitats, and enhance regional resilience. My leadership is grounded in science-based planning, strong community partnerships, and a steadfast commitment to protecting natural ecosystems for future generations.

Environmental Initiatives

• Bahía Grande Restoration and Dust Control Initiative:

Launched in 2001, the Laguna Madre Area Dust Control Committee was established to address air quality issues and electrical disruptions caused by dust on AEP transmission lines. The Bahía Grande Restoration Project, including the expansion of the Carl “Joe” Gayman Channel, restored vital tidal flows, revitalized degraded wetlands, and reduced dust pollution. These efforts have significantly improved quality of life for surrounding communities such as Port Isabel, Laguna Vista, and South Padre Island—culminating in the largest wetlands restoration project in the United States.

• South Texas Ecotourism Center (STEC):

I proudly supported the creation of the South Texas Ecotourism Center in Laguna Vista, in collaboration with the Cameron County Commissioner’s Court, the Town of Laguna Vista, and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. This regional hub promotes conservation education, native habitat awareness, and sustainable ecotourism. STEC showcases the ecological richness of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and provides the public with opportunities to engage in environmental stewardship and water conservation.

• Cameron County Nature Resiliency Department:

Recognizing the growing threat of flooding and erosion in our region, I led the effort to establish a dedicated county department focused on nature-based resiliency. The department oversees coastal restoration, supports the development of green infrastructure, and advances watershed protection initiatives. These projects promote both ecological integrity and community resilience.

• Green Infrastructure Vision:

The Cameron County Green Infrastructure Vision, developed through The Nature Conservation Fund’s Green Infrastructure Program, serves as a foundation for sustainable development in the region. It complements the Cameron County Transportation Corridor Plan and aims to conserve and connect the area’s rich ecological and cultural resources while supporting economic resilience. This science-driven plan was created through the collaboration of more than 40 stakeholders, including local governments, federal and state agencies, conservation organizations, academic institutions, and community leaders—ensuring it reflects regional priorities and diverse perspectives.

• Wildlife and Habitat Safeguards at County Facilities:

My leadership has extended to integrating habitat protection and flood prevention into county-managed lands. Notable initiatives include restoring habitat for the endangered Northern Aplomado Falcon near the Port Isabel–Cameron County Airport and implementing shoreline stabilization at Adolph Thomae Jr. County Park. These projects help preserve ecological function, reduce flood vulnerability, and strengthen the Cameron County Parks System on South Padre Island.

Closing Statement

My vision of environmental stewardship is grounded in balance—ensuring that Cameron County grows with purpose, safeguards its natural beauty, and builds long-term resiliency for the benefit of both current and future generations.

Oil and gas companies that have invested in green energy might also be disadvantaged by that change and by early termination of the tax credit for hydrogen production. Utilities developing renewable energy say that proposed limits on the transferability of certain tax credits will result in higher customer bills. And foreign investors in U.S. green energy facilities could be impacted by provisions that restrict access to certain credits by entities from foreign adversary nations.

The energy title of the House draft would rescind over $3 billion in unobligated funds from IRA programs under the Department of Energy’s (DOE) State-Based Energy Efficiency Grants and other DOE offices. But it includes several provisions intended to accelerate the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects in the U.S., including a provision to fast-track permitting for certain fossil fuel and pipeline project applicants for a fee equivalent to the lesser of 1 percent of the expected cost of the applicable construction or $10 million. And it includes a provision to fast track the export of natural gas from the U.S. to non-free trade agreement (FTA) countries or to import natural gas from a non-FTA country for a $1 million application fee.

Another provision in the natural resources title of the bill would attempt to streamline federal permitting for U.S. infrastructure projects, including energy projects. That language would allow entities seeking National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review to pay for the cost of the required environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA) plus an additional 25 percent for a guaranteed completion of the review process within six months (for an EA) or a year (for an EIS). The EIS or EA would not be subject to judicial review under NEPA.

The House will amend the draft, including provisions relating to IRA tax credits, before voting on it. And the Senate almost certainly will make additional changes when the bill goes to that chamber for consideration.

The decision is part of a broader $1.7 billion investment in BMW’s North American manufacturing operations. Of that, $1 billion will be used to upgrade the Spartanburg plant for EV production, and $700 million will go toward building a new battery assembly facility in nearby Woodruff, SC. The new facility will produce sixth-generation cylindrical battery cells developed in partnership with Envision AESC.

Spartanburg, BMW’s largest production site globally, will serve as the hub for electrified versions of its X-series lineup. In addition to the iX5 and iX7, the plant already produces plug-in hybrid variants and is expected to manufacture at least six fully electric models in the U.S. by 2030.

The iX5 will be offered alongside gasoline, diesel, and plug-in hybrid versions, maintaining BMW’s multi-powertrain strategy. The electric SUV will feature dual-motor xDrive configurations, including a high-performance iX5 M70 variant and a hydrogen-powered fuel cell version scheduled for 2028.

Lucid’s latest move expands on a 2024 agreement with Graphite One to supply synthetic graphite from the same Ohio site and follows another partnership with Syrah Resources, which will deliver natural graphite active anode material processed in Vidalia, Louisiana, starting in 2026.

The shift toward domestic sources comes amid growing geopolitical tensions and the potential for additional tariffs under the Trump administration, which has prioritized reshoring strategic materials. Lucid’s leadership believes that domestic production is not only a supply chain solution but also a key to scaling the U.S. graphite industry.

“The automotive industry can provide the critical scale that you need to make those mines profitable,” Marc Winterhoff, Lucid’s interim CEO, told Bloomberg. “We need so much of it.”

Winterhoff also emphasized the strategic importance of localizing resources: “A supply chain of critical materials within the United States drives our nation’s economy, increases our independence against outside factors or market dynamics, and supports our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our vehicles.”

Graphite is an essential component of lithium-ion batteries, playing a major role in high-performance and fast-charging electric vehicles. Both synthetic and natural graphite materials are used in battery anodes, and securing these resources from within the U.S. aligns with broader national goals for clean energy and industrial independence.

Graphite One CEO Anthony Huston called the agreement historic, adding that it builds momentum for a fully domestic graphite supply chain to “meet market demands and strengthen U.S. industry and national defense.”

Lucid manufactures its EVs, including the flagship Lucid Air and the upcoming Gravity SUV, at its advanced production facility in Arizona.

Do you have any ideas for charging your EV with solar power?","Are electric vehicles coal powered? The honest answer is, that in some cases, to a small extent, yes. The good news is that, according to Morningstar, about half of U.S. power generation will be renewable energy by 2032. Because the cost of renewable energy is dropping, its proportion of power generation will likely continue to increase. If you own an EV, you don’t need to wait around for this to happen. You can take matters into your own hands. One idea recently posted on Reddit spurred a string of interesting comments.

“I have this power station with some solar panels and I can charge my car with it. The fact that this is even possible in the first place is what fascinates me. The fact that the energy transition allows me to generate and store my own power, making me independent from oil and gas companies is just wonderful. I get why big oil dumps so much anti-EV propaganda on the net. If everyone does this, we're no longer dependent on them!”

If building your own solar EV charger isn’t your thing, on another Reddit thread, r/electricvehicles discusses a clever, manufactured rooftop solar charger built by GoSun.

“While this makes zero sense for your typical commuter, it could make sense for someone camping or leaving their car parked for more than a few days. For example, at a trailhead or an airport.”

According to the GoSun website, you can generate up to 20 miles per day with solar self-charging. Their compact rooftop carrier contains eleven hundred watts of solar power and has an estimated price of $3,000 and may be eligible for a 30% tax credit.

Further down the thread, someone posted some interesting calculations:

“A 7x4ft 500w panel could give 1.5 -to- 2 miles per hour. The Average one-way commute in the US is around 15 miles. So if you drive 15 miles, park for 8 hours outside the office, and drive back 10-15 miles, it’s near perfect.

Even if it only averaged 8 miles a day for the year, that’s 3,000 miles. Thats 1/4 of the driving done by the average American.

That’s on the low-end worst-case scenario for efficiency. Someone in the southwest could probably average 15 miles a day, which would be more than half of their annual driving.

It’s not a bad idea to have it as an option for people who can’t install solar at home or those that park outside.”

Let’s Get Back to the Electricity Coming Out of Your Wall

When it comes to traditional out-of-the-wall power, the amount of your electricity that is generated by renewable sources depends on where you live. Electricity in the United States is generated from a variety of sources including petroleum, natural gas, renewables, and coal. Coal accounts for less than 10%. Renewable energy includes wind, solar, hydroelectric and nuclear. However, the amount of electricity generated from renewables varies wildly by state.

Solar Photovoltaics Are About One Third Cheaper Per Megawatt Hour Than Coal

The small solar power systems shown above are pretty cool, but did you know that solar photovoltaics (PV) is set to become the largest source of renewable energy by 2030? It’s being driven by good old capitalism, as the cost of solar panels has steadily fallen over the past few decades. From 2018 to 2023, global solar capacity has tripled. Early solar PV generation was mostly from rooftop installations on households and companies.

Between 2025 and 2030, the amount of solar PV power generation is expected to accelerate due to the construction of new, large solar power plants. So where does that leave the future for coal? For that, we can once again turn to capitalism. It is now more expensive to keep running coal-fired power plants than it is to build new solar operations. On average, the cost to add one additional megawatt hour from coal production is $36, whereas the cost to add an additional megawatt hour of solar PV production is about $24.

EVs Are About Two and a Half Times More Efficient Than Gas-Powered Vehicles

Another really important point to remember is that electric vehicles are much more efficient than ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. Even if your electric vehicle is recharged 100% by electricity generated from fossil fuels, its electric motors are much more efficient at transforming the energy stored in their batteries into motion. Efficiency is a measure of how much energy you get from fuel put into a vehicle (gasoline or electricity) compared to how much you get out to power your wheels and move you forward. The US Department of Energy found that EVs convert more than 75% of the energy received from the electrical grid to power at the wheels. Typical ICE vehicles only convert 12% to 30% of the energy stored in gasoline to power at the wheels. This makes EVs about two and a half times more efficient than ICE vehicles. That means less money spent per mile, and much less damage to the environment.

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Dig down about a mile or two in parts of the United States and you’ll start to see the remains of an ancient ocean. The shells of long dead sea creatures are compressed into white limestone, surrounding brine aquifers with a higher salt content than the Atlantic Ocean.

Last summer, ExxonMobil sponsored weeklong camps to teach grade school students from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi about the virtues of these aquifers, specifically their ability to serve as carbon capture and sequestration wells, where oil, gas, and heavy industry can bury harmful emissions deep underground. In one exercise, students were given 20 minutes to build a model reservoir out of vegetable oil, Play-Doh, pasta, and uncooked beans. Whoever could keep the most vegetable oil (meant to represent liquified carbon dioxide) in their aquifer, won.

This kind of down-home carbon capture boosterism is a relatively new development for the oil and gas giant. Over recent years, ExxonMobil and other fossil fuel companies have spent millions lobbying for government support of what they see as industry-friendly green technology, most prominently carbon capture and storage, which many scientists and environmental activists have argued is ineffective and distracts from eliminating fossil fuel operations in the first place. According to Exxon’s website, it’s evidence that they are leading “the biggest energy transition in history.”

Now that Congress has turned its attention to rolling back government spending on renewable energy, it appears that most of the climate “solutions” being left off the chopping block are the ones favored by carbon-intensive companies like Exxon. Corporate tax breaks for carbon capture and storage, for instance, were one of the few things left untouched when House Republicans passed a budget bill on May 22 that effectively gutted the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation. What remained of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits were incentives for nuclear, so-called clean fuels like ethanol, and carbon capture.

When the IRA was passed in 2022, there was immediate backlash against the provisions for carbon capture. “Essentially, we, the taxpayers, are subsidizing a private sewer system for oil and gas,” said Sandra Steingraber, a senior scientist at the nonprofit Science and Environmental Health Network.

The tax credits for nuclear power plants, which produce energy without emitting greenhouse gases, are meant to spur what President Donald Trump hopes will be an “energy renaissance,” bolstered by a flurry of pro-nuclear executive orders he issued a day after the budget bill cleared the House. Projects will be able to use the tax credits if they begin construction by 2031; wind and solar companies, however, will lose access to tax credits unless they begin construction within 60 days of Trump signing the bill, and are fully up and running by 2028.

That the carbon capture tax credit was never in danger of being revoked is a testament to its importance to the oil and gas industry, said Jim Walsh, the policy director at the nonprofit Food and Water Watch. “The major beneficiaries of these tax credits are oil and gas companies and big agricultural interests.”

The carbon capture tax credit was first established in 2008, but the subsidies were more than doubled when it was tacked on to the IRA in order to get former senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia’s vote. Companies now receive $60 for every ton of CO2 captured and used to drive oil out of the ground (a process known as “enhanced oil recovery”) and up to $85 for a ton of CO2 that is permanently stored. As roughly 60 percent of captured CO2 in the United States is used for enhanced oil recovery, detractors see the tax credit as something of a devil’s bargain, a provision that props up an industry at taxpayer expense.

How much carbon is actually captured by these projects is also a matter of debate. The tax credit requires companies that claim it to self-report how much CO2 they inject to the Internal Revenue Service. The Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, is in charge of tracking leaks. There are tax penalties if captured carbon ends up leaking, but those penalties only apply if the leaks occur in the first three years after injection. Holding companies accountable is made more complicated by the fact that tax returns are confidential, and Walsh cautions that there is very little communication between the EPA and the IRS. Oversight is “very, very minimal,” added Anika Juhn, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a research firm.

“You can keep some really played out oil fields going for a long time, and you can get the public to pay for it,” said Carolyn Raffensberger, the executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network, explaining the potential impact of the budget bill. “So the argument is, ‘This is a win for the climate, it’s a win for energy dominance.’ [But] it’s really a budget buster with no guardrails at all.”

Existing carbon-capture facilities have been plagued by technical and financial issues. The country’s first commercial carbon capture plant in Decatur, Illinois, sprung two leaks last year directly under Lake Decatur, which is the town’s main source of drinking water. When concentrated CO2 hits water it turns into carbonic acid, which then leaches heavy metals from rocks within the aquifer and poisons the water.

Although a certain level of public health concerns come with many emerging technologies, critics point out that all of this risk is being taken for a technology that has not been proven to work at scale, and may actually increase emissions by incentivizing more oil and gas production. It could also strain the existing electrical grid—outfitting a natural gas or coal plant with carbon capture equipment can suck up about 15 to 25 percent of the plant’s power.

The tax credits exist “to pollute and confuse people,” said Mark Jacobsen, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, who has argued that there is essentially no reasonable use for carbon capture. They “increase people’s [energy] costs and do nothing for the climate.”

But the technology does have its defenders among scientists. The 2022 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called an increase in carbon capture technology “unavoidable” if countries want to reach net-zero emissions. Jessie Stolark, the executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, an umbrella organization of fossil fuel companies, unions, and environmental groups, contends that arguments like Jacobsen’s unnecessarily set the technology against renewables. “We need all the solutions in the toolkit,” she said. “We’re not saying don’t deploy these other technologies. We see this very much as a complementary and supportive piece in the broader decarbonization toolkit.”

Stolark said that carbon capture didn’t make it out of the budget process entirely unscathed, as the bill specified that companies could no longer sell carbon capture tax credits. So-called “transferability”—the ability to sell these tax credits on the open market—has been invaluable to small energy startups that have struggled to secure financing in their early stages, according to Stolark. The Carbon Capture Coalition is urging lawmakers to restore transferability now that the bill has moved from the House to the Senate.

Still, the kinds of companies likely to claim carbon capture tax credits—often major players in oil and gas, ammonia, steel, and other heavy industries—are less likely to rely on transferability than more modest companies (often providers of renewable energy), whose smaller tax bills makes it harder for them to realize the value of their respective tax credits.

“A lot of the factories, the power plants, the industrial facilities deploying within the next ten years or so, are expected to be these really big [facilities] with the big tax burdens,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovations, a clean energy think tank based in San Francisco. “They’re not the type of smaller producers—like small solar companies—that are reliant on transferability in order to monetize the tax credit.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250605_CCS-Well_2000px.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-06-06 08:31:41.887348

PAE has been seeking for years to advance a project to build an LNG plant on the Delaware River, to export 7.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually.

Penn LNG would be close to the vast, low-cost Marcellus natural gas resources, and, when compared to U.S. Gulf Coast projects, it offers shorter shipping distances to Europe and other key LNG markets, Penn America Energy says. Moreover, the Delaware River ship channel has been deepened to enable the region’s full participation in global marine commerce.

While such a project could take advantage of the abundant natural gas resources and production close to Pennsylvania, the need for more pipelines and local opposition has stymied progress in the initial stages of the project.

This week’s meeting was to “provide intelligence” to the White House about the project, James told Reuters.

“Developing a project in the Northeast is quite different than the Gulf Coast, Louisiana and Texas, so it requires a great deal of support, not only politically in the state, but also with communities ... in terms of pipeline -transmission as well as ... along the Delaware River,” the executive said.

Support needs to be found not only on the federal level, which could be readily available with the Trump Administration’s pledge to unleash America’s energy resources and LNG exports. Penn LNG will need to obtain state and local permits, as well as federal permits, to go forward.

The company is still considering which site to pick for a potential LNG terminal, James told Reuters.

Analysts say the project faces challenges in obtaining permits amid opposition from local communities and the state.

Meanwhile, developers of U.S. LNG export projects have started taking final investment decisions on new facilities this year, with several plans expected to be added in 2025 to Woodside’s Louisiana LNG approval, despite rising construction costs due to President Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs.

Cyrus Reed with the Sierra Club Texas says there were many missed opportunities when it comes to grid reliability.
""It was a big, big session for water,"" Reed said.
""As environmental advocates, we see a direct link between climate change, hotter temperatures, and more severe droughts, and extended wildfire seasons,"" Shelley said.
""Within the small measuring stick we use, this was a marginal session,"" Shelley said.","As the dust settles on the 89th Legislative Session, environmental groups in Central Texas came together Wednesday morning to celebrate the bills that passed and mourn those that didn't.

Adrian Shelley with Public Citizen says, despite attempted attacks on clean energy this Legislative session, many of the bills they were most concerned about ended up dying.

""It ended up, on the whole, a net positive for the environment, is my take,"" Shelley said.

Luke Metzger with Environment Texas says it remains a thriving industry.

""We are producing, every year, record amounts of wind, solar, and battery storage, which is helping reduce pollution, saving consumers money, and keeping our grid stable,"" Metzger said.

One of those bills was Senate Bill 819, which would have imposed additional fees and requirements on renewable energy generation facilities in favor of the rights of nearby private properties. It passed the Senate 27-to-4, but never even made it to committee in the House.

We reached out to author Senator Lois Kolkhorst, but did not hear back. Before its final passage in the Senate back in April, she said the bill was about balance.

""The people questioned what they could do about 600-foot towers in probably the most gorgeous part of Fayette County and perhaps one of the prettiest parts of Texas,"" Kolkhorst said on the floor. ""It only applies to 10 megawatts or more. We were just talking, I think 10 megawatts can power 7,200+ homes.""

Cyrus Reed with the Sierra Club Texas says there were many missed opportunities when it comes to grid reliability. However, he is celebrating the creation of an eight-member energy waste advisory committee.

""[The committee will] look at ways to optimize energy efficiency savings programs and funding, demand reduction programs, and come back to the Legislature with a report,"" Reed said. ""And that's going to be important.""

Then there was water. One of Governor Abbott's top priorities, the package created an annual $1 billion funding stream, a compromise on new versus recycled water sources, and new incentives for developers who go above and beyond on water conservation.

""It was a big, big session for water,"" Reed said. ""In addition, the bill had good language around what can be funded with that money, in terms of things like leaky pipes, water reuse, and wastewater treatment. Overall, maybe not the bill Sierra Club would have written, but overall we think it's a good result.""

Shelley says he was also glad to see bipartisan action on efforts to mitigate extended wildfire seasons, such as a new state requirement for wildfire mitigation plans.

""As environmental advocates, we see a direct link between climate change, hotter temperatures, and more severe droughts, and extended wildfire seasons,"" Shelley said. ""Our lawmakers haven't acknowledged the relationship between climate change and wildfires, but we can credit them for taking good action this year.""

The environmental groups would have liked to see more to combat air pollution. Particularly as it came to bills which failed, such as one looking to curtail a rock crushing plant in Burnet and another looking for action on fine particulate matter in the air.

""When there are powerful economic interests that don't want you to study stuff or look at things, it's hard to accomplish those things in this Legislature,"" Reed said.

Overall, the three agree they'll take their wins and get ready to fight again in 2027.

""Within the small measuring stick we use, this was a marginal session,"" Shelley said. ""We beat back the worst things, there were a few small things. At best, we're cautiously hopeful about what happened.""",https://cbsaustin.com/resources/media2/16x9/551/986/3x0/90/59fea1ac-b87b-4152-af4a-8099188b3a7b-dome.png,N,,2025-06-06 08:32:43.757563

“Our state is growing fast, and American manufacturers are eager to open up plants in North Carolina instead of shipping those jobs overseas,” said Arp.
Several prominent organizations voiced support for the bill during the public comment period, including the North Carolina Chamber, North Carolina Electric Cooperatives, ElectriCities, and the American Petroleum Institute.
“If there are blackouts like we have seen in other states, they’re not going to be coming to North Carolina.
And if our energy is not affordable, they’re not going to be coming to North Carolina.”","A major energy reform bill that would repeal North Carolina’s interim goal of cutting carbon emissions 70% by 2030 is now advancing in the state House after passing the Senate last month. Supporters say the move, part of a broader package, will help save electricity customers nearly $15 billion by reducing construction and compliance costs tied to future power generation.

The Power Bill Reduction Act (SB 266) was introduced in the House Regulatory Reform Committee on Wednesday. Rep. Dean Arp, R-Union, called it a collaborative effort between utilities, manufacturers, and consumer advocates to refine the legislative goals to save ratepayers money.

“Our state is growing fast, and American manufacturers are eager to open up plants in North Carolina instead of shipping those jobs overseas,” said Arp. “Simply meeting the current demand – and including residential, industrial, and the tens of thousands of new manufacturing jobs coming to North Carolina – requires new, reliable energy at lower costs.”

The bill’s centerpiece is the repeal of the 2030 interim carbon reduction target originally set in House Bill 951. It retains the long-term 2050 carbon neutrality goal but removes the earlier benchmark that state regulators now estimate would add $13 billion in costs for new power infrastructure.

The bill will reduce consumer electricity costs by a total of $15 billion through the policy changes, which also include a financing requirement that reduces the cost of constructing new natural gas and nuclear plants by about 5%. It also protects consumers from rate hikes and unnecessary and unexpected costs associated with fuel costs, legislators explained during the committee meeting.

The legislation, which now heads to the House Rules Committee, is being fast-tracked with no formal opposition from major stakeholders.

“It’s very rare that you get all the power companies and all the customers to agree on legislation, and yet, that’s what this bill does,” said Arp.

Several prominent organizations voiced support for the bill during the public comment period, including the North Carolina Chamber, North Carolina Electric Cooperatives, ElectriCities, and the American Petroleum Institute. They emphasized the bill’s role in ensuring reliable, affordable energy to meet the state’s growing economic and industrial demands.

Donald Bryson, CEO of the John Locke Foundation, expressed support for the bill and described it as “energy policy grounded in reality and responsible governance.”

“If North Carolinians and lawmakers want to continue to meet long-term emission goals by the 2050 target without driving up costs and undermining reliability, then we must give utilities and regulators flexibility to use the least-cost, technology-neutral strategy,” said Bryson. “It removes an arbitrary interim carbon deadline, strengthens cost recovery tools for baseload generation, and authorizes the prudent use of securitization…This bill enables a rational energy transition that balances environmental goals with economic growth and ratepayer protection.”

Ryan Minto, managing director of government affairs at Duke Energy, pointed to estimates that show an eightfold increase in the demand for energy in North Carolina.

“With this legislation, you will ensure that the energy component of our state’s competitive advantages continues well into the future with affordable, reliable power for businesses and residents,” Minto said.

Rep. Neal Jackson, R-Moore, commented on the recent news that Amazon is investing $10 billion in a new high-tech cloud computing and artificial intelligence Innovation Campus in Richmond County. With Amazon planning to employ 2,000 construction workers for eight to ten years, Jackson said the power grid’s reliability and affordability are crucial for the state’s business appeal.

“Here’s what I say for all of my colleagues, these companies would not be coming to North Carolina unless our energy is reliable,” Jackson said. “If there are blackouts like we have seen in other states, they’re not going to be coming to North Carolina. And if our energy is not affordable, they’re not going to be coming to North Carolina.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/piedmont_employees_2-e1749145779884-768x560.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:26:54.843778

“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. … He had no problem with it,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

“All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we’re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that’s billions and billions of dollars,” he added.

Musk’s car company was a major beneficiary of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded and extended $7,500 tax credits for consumers who purchased EVs as they became more affordable and accessible for many Americans.

Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which was passed by the House last month and now awaits action in the Senate, axes those tax credits.

It also seeks to overturn a Biden administration regulation that is expected to require automakers to shift toward more electric fleets, or purchase credits from companies like Tesla that outperform the regulations.

Musk, who headed up the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, has claimed that his company does not need the consumer incentive.

In response to Trump’s comments on Thursday, Musk wrote “Whatever.” in a post on social media.

“Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,” he added.

Musk has launched a barrage of criticism at the legislation since leaving the Trump administration. He has talked not only about its moves to axe EV and solar energy incentives, but also its potential to add to the federal deficit.

“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” he said Thursday.

Once finished, this facility will be North America’s biggest green hydrogen plant. It can produce 22,000 tons of green hydrogen every year.

The project aims to meet the rising demand for clean energy. It will also help the United States shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources.

Sun-Powered and Self-Sufficient: A Hydrogen First

The Lancaster Clean Energy Center stands out for its commitment to sustainability and innovation. The facility will run on 100% solar energy, using over 650 megawatts (MW) of solar power. Also, long-duration battery storage systems will support it. This setup lets the plant run 24/7 without needing grid electricity or fossil fuels. This way, hydrogen production stays clean and emission-free.

The plant will use advanced electrolyzers. These machines split water into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity. The hydrogen produced is called “green” because it comes from renewable energy sources.

Traditional methods, on the other hand, burn fossil fuels and release greenhouse gases. The facility will produce gaseous and liquid hydrogen. It will distribute them with zero-emission fuel cell trucks.

The Project’s Environmental and Community Benefits

Reducing Carbon Emissions:

One of the main goals of the Lancaster Clean Energy Center is to reduce carbon emissions. If the plant produces 22,000 tons of green hydrogen each year, it can replace diesel or natural gas in transport and industry.

This switch could cut carbon dioxide emissions by over 200,000 tons annually, helping California reach its climate goals. These goals aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030.

Improving Air and Water Quality:

Using green hydrogen instead of fossil fuels also improves air quality. Hydrogen fuel produces only water vapor as a byproduct, which helps lower local air pollution and benefits public health.

The Lancaster plant will use groundwater from a nearby aquifer. It will only take 15–20% of the water that was used for farming on the same land. This change will ease the pressure on local water resources and promote sustainable development.

Supporting Local Communities

The project will create jobs during construction and operation. This includes roles for contractors, engineers, electricians, and plant workers. Local businesses that provide equipment and services will benefit too. This will help boost the regional economy.

The growth of green hydrogen plants also comes from tax incentives and state programs. One key program is California Jobs First. It promotes clean energy and boosts economic growth in the area.

The Role of Green Hydrogen in the Energy Transition

Green hydrogen is viewed as a vital solution for cutting carbon emissions in hard-to-electrify sectors. This includes heavy-duty transportation, shipping, and steelmaking.

Green hydrogen is different from fossil fuels. It doesn’t release harmful gases when used. This makes it important for countries and regions aiming to meet strict emissions targets.

Making hydrogen from renewable sources also boosts energy security. It lowers the need for imported oil and gas.

The Lancaster Clean Energy Center is part of a larger trend toward adopting green hydrogen across North America. The market for green hydrogen is growing rapidly, with projections showing that it could meet up to 22% of the world’s energy needs by 2050.

In the United States, government incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act are boosting major projects. They also speed up the shift to clean energy.

Here are three notable green hydrogen plants in the U.S.:

SoHyCal (California): The largest operational green hydrogen plant in North America, producing up to three tons daily using solar power, supporting hydrogen refueling stations. It could fuel up to 210,000 cars or 30,000 city buses annually once fully operational by mid-2025.

Sauk Valley (Illinois): Operated by Invenergy, this plant produces about 40 tons annually, using solar energy to supply hydrogen for industrial and power generation uses.

St. Gabriel (Louisiana): A joint venture by Plug Power and Olin, under construction to produce 15 tons daily, aiming to reduce CO₂ emissions and create jobs. Operation can start by the end of 2025.

Hydrogen Goes Global: A Market on the Rise

The global green hydrogen market is growing fast. It is set for major expansion in the next ten years.

Estimates say the market, worth about $7.98 billion in 2024, might grow to between $25 billion and $60 billion by 2030, depending on the source. The annual growth rates could range from around 22% to almost 39% from 2025 to 2030. This growth comes from more government support, new technology, and higher demand in many industries.

RELATED: Indian Government Announces Massive New Green Hydrogen Project

Government initiatives worldwide are critical drivers. Countries like India, Japan, Germany, and the United States are pushing hard on hydrogen. They have started strong strategies and funding programs. Their goal is to boost green hydrogen production and build the needed infrastructure.

For example, India aims to produce 5 million metric tons annually by 2030, while Japan targets 20 million tons by 2050.

These policies support global goals from the Paris Agreement. They position green hydrogen as a key way to cut emissions in hard-to-electrify areas like steelmaking, heavy transport, and chemical manufacturing.

New technology is lowering the costs of electrolyzers and renewable energy. This makes green hydrogen production cheaper and more practical. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, work with electrolyzers to create clean hydrogen. This method ensures steady hydrogen production, which helps with energy storage and keeps the grid stable.

Also, infrastructure investments are growing worldwide. This includes hydrogen production plants, refueling stations, and distribution networks to meet rising demand.

From Lancaster to the World: A Blueprint for Clean Hydrogen

Looking ahead, green hydrogen could supply up to 24% of global energy needs by 2050, with the market potentially reaching $700 billion by 2040. Asia-Pacific, Europe, and parts of the Middle East and Latin America have many renewable resources. These regions are becoming leaders in green hydrogen development.

North America, especially states like California, is quickly embracing hydrogen technologies. They aim to achieve bold climate goals and build clean energy economies.

The Lancaster facility could set a new standard for large-scale green hydrogen production in North America. As more areas and companies aim for net-zero carbon goals, projects like this show how useful and efficient green hydrogen can be.

The plant’s output will help with transportation, public transit, port operations, and aviation. This will aid in decarbonizing many sectors and will inspire more investment and growth in the sector.

The Element Resources initiative represents a major step forward for green hydrogen in North America. As the largest green hydrogen plant on the continent, it will serve as a model for future projects and play a crucial role in the transition to a sustainable energy future.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Element-Resources-to-Build-Americas-Largest-1.85B-Green-Hydrogen-Plant-in-California.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:23:59.646685

But the Tesla CEO shot back on X, the social media platform he owns, that he doesn’t care if the GOP scraps tax credits and other policies favoring EVs.

Trump said he was “very surprised” and “very disappointed” with Musk’s opposition in recent days to the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

The billionaire has said his opposition stems from the trillions of dollars the bill could add to the federal deficit. The president and other some Republican lawmakers see other motives.

“Elon’s upset because we took the EV mandate — which, you know, was a lot of money for electric vehicles … they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,” Trump told reporters in an Oval Office appearance with visiting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

The comments were the latest dustup in a growing feud between Musk and Republican leaders. Musk until last week was a top adviser to Trump and launched the U.S. DOGE Service, also known as the Department of Government Efficiency.

The spat threatens to derail the bill’s passage through the Senate and again through the House, especially after Musk has threatened to work to unseat lawmakers who vote for it.

Musk brushed off Trump’s comments. “Whatever,” he wrote on X. He said Republicans can “Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill,” but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK.”

In recent days, however, Tesla has publicly called for Republicans to keep at least some clean energy incentives. And Musk on Thursday repeated a complaint that “no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!).”

Trump said Musk had been closely involved in talks that led to the House passing the megabill last month. “I’m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here. Better than you people,” the president said, referring to top administration officials.

“He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it,” Trump said. “All of the sudden, he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out we were going to have to cut the EV mandate. Because that’s billions and billions of dollars.”

Musk denied that. “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it,” he wrote on X.

Trump compared Musk to other officials in his administration who have left and made negative comments about him.

“Some of them actually become hostile. I don’t know what it is. It’s sort of Trump Derangement Syndrome, I guess they call it,” Trump said, deploying a term he and his supporters use to mock his opponents.

In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.
In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.
Under Trump, the EPA's fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.
But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.","When the head of the Environmental Protection Agency announced a wide-ranging rollback of environmental regulations, he said it would put a “dagger through the heart of climate-change religion” and introduce a “Golden Age” for the American economy.

What Lee Zeldin didn’t mention: how ending the rules could have devastating consequences to human health.

The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.

It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated; they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.

But experts say the numbers are conservative and that even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.

“More people will die,” said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants. “More of this type of pollution that we know kills people will be in the air.”

What went into AP’s examination of the pollution rules

The AP set out to look at what could happen if all the rules were eliminated, by first examining exhaustive assessments the EPA was required to produce before the rules were approved. Though the agency’s priorities can change as presidential administrations change, the methods for the assessments have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan’s presidency and are deeply rooted in peer-reviewed scientific research.

The AP used those and eight different government and private group databases for its estimate of financial costs, some death estimates and analysis of pollution trends. AP performed additional analysis of potential deaths by drawing on peer-reviewed formulas and scientific research on the impacts of increased heat and pollution. And AP vetted its work with multiple outside health experts, who said it is scientifically justified, but likely an undercount.

Multiple experts say the science behind the rules is strong, and they pointed to the rigorous process that must be followed to change them, including requirements for public comment.

Zeldin acknowledged as much last month.

“I’m not going to prejudge outcomes with what will be a lot of rulemaking,” Zeldin said in April.

Virtually all the benefits from the rules come from restricting the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel industry was a heavy contributor to President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and Republicans overall. In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.

Calculating costs and benefits is contentious

Asked for comment on the AP findings, an EPA spokesperson said the agency’s plans would “roll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden ‘taxes’ on U.S. families.”

“Unlike the Biden EPA attempts to regulate whole sectors of our economy out of existence, the Trump EPA understands that we do not have to choose between protecting our precious environment and growing our economy,” spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said.

Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell LLP who represents energy and manufacturing interests, suggested that EPA analyses under the Biden administration emphasized worst-case scenarios, inflated health benefit claims and missed the big-picture economic benefits of booming industry.

“If you only count lives saved by regulation, not lives harmed by regulation, the math will always favor more regulation,” Segal said. “This framing misses the larger point: public health isn’t just about air quality -- it’s also about job security, housing, access to medical care, and heating in the winter.""

The EPA regulatory analyses are immense documents that numerous health and environment researchers and former officials say are grounded in science, not politics. For example, in January 2024, the EPA produced a 445-page analysis of tightening standards on dangerous particle pollution that cited more than 90 different scientific publications, along with scores of other documents. The Biden EPA presented four different regulatory scenarios and ultimately chose one of the middle options.

Two experts who reviewed AP’s work said the EPA documents that underpinned the analysis were themselves conservative in their estimates. University of Washington health and environment professors Kristi Ebi and Howard Frumkin said that’s because EPA looked at added heat deaths and air pollution mortality, but did not include climate change’s expected deaths from increased infectious disease, flooding and other disaster factors.

“This is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,'' said Frumkin, who was appointed director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health during George W. Bush's administration. ”It makes clear that regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration will have major, direct consequences for health and well-being. Because of these regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts, Americans will die needlessly.""

That's a sentiment echoed by two former Republican EPA administrators, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George Bush and George W. Bush administrations respectively.

“This administration is endangering all of our lives — ours, our children, our grandchildren,” said Whitman, who led EPA under George W. Bush.

How regulations helped clear the air

A visit to Evansville, Indiana, helps show how EPA regulations have made a difference.

The city of about 115,000 lies where the state's southwest tip meets Kentucky at the curving Ohio River. Industry lines the banks and coal barges float past carrying loads destined to fuel power plants.

Kirt Ethridge, 30, grew up in Evansville and still lives there. As a child, he recalls looking down from high ground into the bowl-shaped valley where the heart of the city lies and seeing a haze of pollution atop it. He thought that was normal.

He didn’t think much of the looming smokestacks of the coal-fired power plants and factories that ringed the city, nor the line of inhalers waiting on a bench before he and his classmates ran the mile. He suffered asthma attacks in class, sometimes more than once a week, that sent him to the nurse’s office. Once, he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

“It’s a very scary feeling, particularly as a kid, to not be able to get enough air in your lungs,” he said, describing it as like “breathing through a straw.”

In southwestern Indiana, coal-fired power plants were to blame for between 19,000 and nearly 23,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, according to work by Zigler published in the journal Science that examined death rates among Medicare recipients and modeled where plants' pollution would spread.

Nationally, he and his team found a sharp decline in air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants after the mid-2000s, from an average of 43,000 a year to just 1,600 a year in 2020, with a similar cut in particle pollution. That's when two different forces came into play: Cheaper and less polluting natural gas pushed aside dirtier and costlier coal, while at the same time stricter regulations required more pollution control devices such as scrubbers.

Duke Energy operates its biggest power plant near Evansville — Gibson Station, which can power about 2.5 million homes. Emissions have declined significantly as the company installed scrubbers that pull unwanted chemicals out of smokestacks, along with other pollution control technology. Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protegere said the scrubbers were a response to “regulations over the years as well as market factors.”

Put simply, the air got cleaner around places like Evansville. Vanderburgh County and neighboring counties violated national annual air standards for fine particles from 2005 to 2010, but no longer do, even as standards have tightened.

The same is true across the United States. The amount of tiny airborne particles in the last 10 years nationwide is one-third lower than 2000-2009, EPA statistics show. Smog pollution is down nearly 15% and sulfur dioxide has plunged 80%.

“The Clean Air Act, the EPA’s founding legislation, has been a powerful engine for improving public health as our air has grown visibly clearer and cleaner,” said Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under President Barack Obama and served as Biden's White House climate adviser. “Millions of Americans have avoided illnesses, hospital visits, and premature deaths thanks to EPA’s cleaner car and truck standards in concert with rules that limit industrial pollution.”

Five rules saving more than $200 billion a year

Five rules together were estimated to have more than $200 billion a year in net benefits, based on EPA documents that estimated reduced illnesses and deaths and the costs for companies to comply.

Three rules dealt with cars and trucks. The “clean car rule” is a tightening of EPA emission standards for vehicles that was supposed to take effect for 2027 model years and eventually have annual net benefits of more than $100 billion a year, according to the agency’s 884-page regulatory analysis. The EPA estimated that over the next three decades this rule alone would prevent 7.9 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, 8,700 tons of particulate matter and 36,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.

Two other proposed rules — one that deals with car models from 2023 to 2027 and another aimed at heavy trucks and buses — are estimated to save nearly $38 billion a year combined through reduced health problems from air pollution, according to EPA’s own detailed calculations.

EPA plays up costs, plays down benefits of targeted rules

Almost none of those benefits are to be found in 10 fact sheets the EPA produced in conjunction with Zeldin's announcement. Nine make no mention of benefits from the rules, while eight mention the costs.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

For example, Biden’s proposed power plant rule was designed to save more than $24 billion a year, prevent about 3,700 annual premature deaths and 3 million asthma incidents from fossil fuel-powered plants, according to EPA documents last year and work by the Environmental Protection Network. Under Trump, the EPA's fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.

Another rule the EPA updated last year sets standards for pollution permitted in the air, called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The update, required by the Clean Air Act, cuts allowable soot particles by 25% to reflect new science on the harms from such pollution. The EPA in Biden's time calculated the change would annually save as much as $46 billion, 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents.

But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change — about $614 million — and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.

“The human body count and human health toll of particulate matter alone is just absolutely massive,” said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top federal regulatory officer from 2021 to 2023. “Literally tens of thousands of people will lose their lives"" if the standard is rolled back, he said.

A penguin-shaped nebulizer

In southwest Indiana, many people have noticed a positive difference from the EPA regulations. And they're concerned about changes.

In Bloomfield, Jessica Blazier's 11-year-old son Julian has multiple health conditions that make him more sensitive to air quality, including nonallergic rhinitis, which inflames his nasal passage and makes breathing “feel like a knife sometimes,"" in his words. Jessica Blazier said the proposed EPA rule rollbacks are “almost adding insult to injury in our particular circumstance.”

On Thursday, May 22, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a Joint Statement of Interest (the “Joint Statement”) in a lawsuit led by the State of Texas against three large investment companies (the “Asset Managers”).1 The lawsuit, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, has been joined by 10 other states (the “Plaintiff States”) and accuses the asset managers of using their positions in climate-focused investment initiatives to manipulate coal markets, driving up the cost of energy and resulting in higher energy prices for American consumers. This action, as the DOJ publicly notes, is the first formal statement by the Agencies in federal court on the antitrust implications of common shareholdings.2

This Joint Statement strongly endorses the Texas-led lawsuit. The Joint Statement further affirms that asset managers and institutional investors may be held liable under Section 7 of the Clayton Act when they use their stock holdings in multiple competitors to achieve anticompetitive outcomes. The Joint Statement signals further potential enforcement on the horizon. The agencies urged the district court to reject several of the arguments advanced by the asset managers in their dismissal motion, including that the alleged conduct falls under a safe harbor exemption for passive investors.

Key takeaways

By filing this Joint Statement, the FTC and DOJ signal an interest in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. These types of cases were pursued under the first Trump administration, and it appears ESG could be a focus of this U.S. administration as well.

This lawsuit, now joined by both U.S. federal competition enforcement agencies, raises the stakes for the case that will test how freely Asset Managers may act with the wealth they manage for investors.

The FTC and DOJ re-affirm their interest in promoting competition in America’s energy markets as a top priority of the U.S. Administration under Trump.

Shareholders who abandon passive investment strategies and bring about a substantial lessening of competition will likely no longer enjoy a safe harbor under Section 7 of the Clayton Act.

In more detail

Case Background

In November of 2024, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the launch of a lawsuit against three large investment companies, joined by 10 other states. The lawsuit alleges that the Asset Managers artificially reduced output of the U.S. coal in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The Complaint notes that Defendants collectively hold substantial shares in major coal companies, including more than 30% stakes in two Midwest mining companies, which together account for approximately 30% of the coal produced in the U.S. With these large holdings in place, the suit alleges that the firms violated the Clayton Act, which prohibits the acquisition of shares of companies in which “the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition.”3

The Complaint details how the Asset Managers used the influence of their ownership shares in U.S. coal companies to reduce production in the relevant coal markets—dramatically increasing the price of coal. These actions occurred while privately held coal companies, in which Defendants have no ownership stake, scrambled to increase production and capture larger market shares.4

The Complaint identified two relevant product markets. First, the market for South Powder River Basin Coal. Defendants own 30.43%, 34.19%, and 32.87% of the three publicly traded companies that produce South Powder River Basin Coal. Those companies control 63.5% of this relevant market. Second, the market for Thermal Coal. Defendants own between 8.3% and 34.19% of the eight publicly traded companies that produce Thermal Coal. These companies control 46% of the market in Thermal Coal. Plaintiff States allege that each Defendant’s ownership of the Coal Companies creates the sort of anticompetitive arrangement that Section 7 forbids.

The Arguments of the Joint Statement

The Joint Statement supports the Texas-led lawsuit and criticizes the arguments of both the Defendants and the amici in the case. It takes aim at a number of the dismissal arguments asserted by Defendants.

First, the Joint Statement refutes that the Fund Manager’s investments are protected by the “solely for investment” exemption in Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The DOJ and FTC argue that Plaintiff States have alleged conduct far beyond mere investment—that any investment or ownership stake have been used to lessen or harm competition—which is not protected by any exemption. The Joint Statement explains that allegations in this case, that the Asset Managers used their investments to influence or pressure management of the target firms to reduce production, create conduct fully subject to Section 7.

Second, the Joint Statement argues that minority stakes in companies are still not subject to antitrust scrutiny because they allow the Asset Managers to influence business decisions. The Joint Statement further argues that plaintiffs do not need to link competitive harm to specific stock acquisitions, as argued by Defendants in the case. As such, the scope of Section 7 is not merely limited to controlling interests in companies.

Third, the Joint Statement provides assurances that these legal interpretations of Section 7 do not inhibit beneficial practices like passive investing and corporate governance. The DOJ and FTC clarify that they are not seeking to interfere with typical asset manager behavior.

Fourth, the DOJ and FTC explain the general principle that concerted action subject to antitrust scrutiny includes arrangements, including invitations to participate in a plan, that can establish an unlawful conspiracy under the Sherman Act. This applies even where there is no explicit prior agreement but where an invitation contemplates concerted action and where the Defendants’ behavior demonstrates acceptance. The Joint Statement notes that good intentions, such as environmental or climate protection, do not validate concerted anticompetitive behavior like the output restrictions alleged in this case.

Finally, the Joint Statement refutes the Defendants’ position that increases in coal production are a defense from the alleged behavior. The relevant test is whether the concerted behavior resulted in production that was lower than it would otherwise would have been—likely resulting in higher prices than the but-for world where the anticompetitive conduct did not occur.

Significance of the Joint Statement

Companies were already on notice that there has been an interest by the U.S. Administration under Trump on ESG. This Joint Statement is an indication of potential future enforcement, and could embolden private litigants to bring more anticompetitive ESG claims across the country. The Joint Statement also highlights the importance of the energy sector for the U.S. Administration. “The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater.5 The Antitrust Division’s leader declared in her public statement: “We will not hesitate to stand up against powerful financial firms that use Americans’ retirement savings to harm competition under the guise of ESG.”6

The FTC and DOJ clarify the applicability of the Clayton Act to investment behavior that is taken to lessen competition or result in anticompetitive harm. Here, the agencies are concerned about conduct in the energy sector that reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance.7

This Joint Statement, along with subsequent public statements by FTC and DOJ leadership, indicates potential changes in enforcement action by the U.S. Administration within the energy sector as well as wealth management companies that focus on ESG policies. Safe harbor exceptions may also be subject to further scrutiny.

Changing the rules requires following a process The Trump administration has not said how far the targeted rules would be rolled back.","The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump has served notice it wants to back away from at least 30 major rules that seek to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change. The agency’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, says doing so would mean a new “golden age” for America.

It’s not certain the rules will go away. They can’t be changed without going through a demanding federal rulemaking process.

But an examination by The Associated Press found that gutting the rules would come with high costs in both money and lives.

Here are some takeaways from AP’s work:

Hundreds of billions of dollars in costs, thousands of deaths

The AP examination found that the targeted rules are estimated to save at least $275 billion a year and more than 30,000 lives annually. Those figures were built in part on regulatory impact reports prepared by the EPA itself to factor in things such as reduced illnesses and deaths, as well as how much it would cost companies to comply with the rules. AP also worked with research by the Environmental Protection Network of former agency employees.

AP found about 10,000 American lives were expected to be saved as the rules cut traditional pollutants such as soot, smog and heavy metals like mercury and lead. AP also calculated that doing away with the rules entirely would mean rising greenhouse gas emissions that would in turn drive deadly heat that would account for 25,000 more deaths each year around the world. That calculation also relied on a think-tank report and scientific studies that calculate deaths per ton of emissions.

What some of the rules look like

Some of the rules have been in place for years, while others were written under President Joe Biden and have not yet taken effect because of court challenges or because they are designed to kick in during later years.

One example is a proposed update to existing EPA emissions standards for vehicles that’s aimed at jump-starting electric cars. It’s supposed to take effect for 2027 model years. The EPA’s own analysis estimated net annual benefits of more than $100 billion a year.

Another rule sets the level of traditional pollutants allowable in air that’s deemed clean. The Clean Air Act requires that it be updated every few years. Public health and experts say one type of traditional pollution, particulate matter — better known as soot — is the most deadly in America, with severe consequences when reaching a person’s lungs. In 2024, the Biden administration cut by 25% the amount of particulate matter that states are allowed to emit into the air.

The EPA calculated a net benefit from that rule of as much as $46 billion a year, and the prevention of 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents annually.

Fact sheets that cite all the costs and (almost) none of the benefits

Under Trump, the EPA has created fact sheets that emphasize the costs but not the benefits of the rules.

Nine of 10 fact sheets make no mention of benefits at all. But eight of the fact sheets cite costs.

For example, a fact sheet for one rule that would require newer coal-powered plants to cut or capture carbon emissions by as much as 90% noted that it would cost nearly $1 billion. But that sheet made no mention that the rule was estimated to save more than $24 billion a year.

In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses that AP examined, the estimated benefits are larger than the costs — and sometimes far larger.

Changing the rules requires following a process

The Trump administration has not said how far the targeted rules would be rolled back. And Zeldin has vowed to follow federal law.

Experts say the targeted rules were the product of rigorous impact analyses that got close scrutiny from the EPA and other federal agencies.

Such rules cannot be undone without presenting scientific justification through a federal rulemaking process that can take years to complete and includes requirements for public comment.

There’s no question that so far, 2025 is a seller’s market for the automotive industry. On top of that, President Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to spark high economic uncertainty.

The combination of high prices and a deteriorating labor market makes this an especially difficult time for automakers that primarily deal in expensive vehicles, such as Tesla (TSLA) . But a new company in the space recently revealed something positive for consumers.

As car prices surge, a little-known startup may provide relief

Even as car prices rise, electric vehicle (EV) demand isn’t slowing down. While Industry leader Tesla TSLA has reported declining sales across multiple markets, a report from Cox Automotive shows that EV sales rose more than 11% year-over-year (YOY) in Q1 2025.

Part of Tesla’s problem has been its inability to sell the Cybertruck, its futuristic electric truck that hasn’t been as popular as the company initially estimated. Photos have shown Cybertrucks sitting idly in parking lots across the country. Some drivers who did buy them have attempted to trade them in, despite high value depreciation.

For anyone seeking a fuel-efficient truck, though, a company described as the “Anti-Tesla” is working hard to provide a much more affordable alternative. A Jeff Bezos-backed startup called Slate Automotive is turning heads with its electric pickup trucks, described as “affordable, deeply customizable, and very analog” with no infotainment screen.

Slate’s small, sleek, traditional-looking trucks even come with manual windows, harking back to a previous manufacturing era. In other words, its vehicles are a stark contrast to the highly priced, futuristic Tesla Cybertruck.

As The Street reports, so far, demand for these vehicles has been high, with the number of pre-reservations exceeding 100,000 as of early May. While those figures aren’t sales yet, they indicate that many consumers are interested in owning a Slate truck.

Now the company may be about to add even more prospective buyers to that list. Jeff Jablansky, Slate’s head of public relations, recently revealed that even without EV tax credits, the company’s new trucks will be priced in the “mid-$20,000s,” making them more affordable than many used vehicles.

“When [consumers] turn to something that is more affordable, it usually has higher miles, probably is older, the condition is not as great,” he states. “So we’re working in that framework.”

Musk initially promised that the Cybertruck would cost only $40,000 before raising its price to $100,000. However, Jablansky adds that Slate won’t budge on keeping its prices below $30,000. He also believes that the company will be able to deliver on the range it has promised, something else that Tesla did not do.

Slate Automotive isn’t worried about tariffs, either

Trump’s tariffs have raised some concerning questions for U.S. automakers, as companies brace for rising production costs and supply-chain constraints. But since Slate’s trucks are being built at the company’s facility in Indiana, Jablansky sees the company as shielded from the impact of these policies.

“The next year and a half, pretty much till delivery, we’re refining what we’ve done. We’re not making big engineering decisions — those have been done already. At this point, we’re testing, evaluating, refining,” he says.

If Slate is indeed more protected than its larger peers from the impact of Trump’s tariffs, the company will likely be able to deliver on its promise to keep prices low as its trucks move from the production line to the road.

Additionally, if new vehicle prices continue rising, consumer incentive to buy a new brand of truck for less money is likely to remain high. Slate’s strategy of creating an affordable electric truck for workers that reintroduces basic design features could be poised to pay off.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE0NzE2NzI2OTk3MTY1ODYw/elonmuskteslademandproblem.jpg,N,,2025-06-06 08:37:54.025689

Illinois helps subsidize Constellation Energy’s nuclear plant, the Clinton Clean Energy Center, with a ratepayer-funded zero-emissions credit program that awards benefits for the generation of power virtually free of carbon emissions. With Meta’s power purchase agreement, it will provide the plant with an unspecified amount of money to help with relicensing and operations.

I discovered this is actually the third time a power arrangement like this had been reached in the U.S. Google had previously secured power to supply its data centers from Kairos and its reactors in California, and Microsoft made a deal with Constellation to start up Three Mile Island Unit 1again (Unit 2 is the one that had the accident).

Artificial intelligence is partially responsible for the hyperscalers looking to secure “clean” electricity as U.S. power demand rises significantly. to supply its data centers.

Hyperscalers like AWS, MSFT, Google, etc.) are facing immense power challenges for their massive, centralized data centers due to:

Explosive Growth of AI: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) require unprecedented computational power, leading to a massive increase in server rack density and overall power consumption. GPUs, especially, are far more power-hungry than traditional CPUs.

Grid Strain: Existing electrical grids in many regions are struggling to provide enough power to meet the demand from new hyperscale data center builds. This leads to delays in bringing new capacity online and can strain local grids.

Sustainability Goals: Hyperscalers have ambitious renewable energy and net-zero goals, which are becoming harder to meet as their total energy consumption skyrockets. Sourcing enough clean, firm power (24/7 renewable energy) is a significant hurdle.

Transmission and Distribution Limitations: Even if generation capacity exists, the physical infrastructure (transmission lines, substations) may not be sufficient to deliver that power to concentrated data center campuses.

In addition to the concerns that have led to these deals for the hyperscalers come the concerns of the power companies themselves, which is why 20-year contracts have been put in place by Constellation.

“We’re definitely having conversations with other clients, not just in Illinois, but really across the country, to step in and do what Meta has done, which is essentially give us a backstop so that we could make the investments needed to relicense these assets and keep them operating,” said Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation.

Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, explained that, “One of the things that we hear very acutely from utilities is they want to have certainty that power plants operating today will continue to operate.”

Conclusion:

It’s no doubt the demand is real and going to drive a lot of commitment between power companies seeking “a backup” while the hyperscalers seek a dedicated resource that they can rely on now and in the future.

As to whether or not nuclear power plants are going to have a resurgence, I am not sure. Relabeling nuclear as” clean energy,” might match up to all the other reversals of rules going on these days. I personally will find it ironic that the people who attended “no nukes” rallies are going to have to rethink their positions or give up their favorite social media platforms.

In justifying climate rollbacks, the president says many of his predecessor’s policies have hurt rather than helped the American people.","BOSTON (TNS) — Electric car subsidies are heading for the chopping block. A tax bill recently passed by House Republicans is set to stop billions in taxpayer cash from being spent on electric vehicle purchases.

If embraced by the Senate and signed into law by President Donald Trump, the bill would gut long-standing government handouts for going electric.

The move comes on the heels of another climate policy embraced by Republicans. Earlier this year, Trump announced plans to roll back burdensome rules that effectively force American consumers to buy electric, rather than gas-fueled, cars. The Environmental Protection Agency has called that move the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.”

Not everyone sees it that way. Jason Rylander, legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, assailed Trump’s efforts, noting that his “administration’s ignorance is trumped only by its malice toward the planet.”

Other similarly aligned groups have voiced similar sentiments arguing that ending these rules would “cost consumers more, because clean energy and cleaner cars are cheaper than sticking with the fossil fuels status quo.”

Backtracking on EV purchasing mandates seems to have hit Trump haters particularly hard. That mandate — established by President Joe Biden — would have pushed U.S. automakers to sell more EVs. Millions more. Electric cars currently account for 8% of new auto sales. Biden ordered— by presidential fiat — that figure to climb to 35% by 2032. If you believe the hype, the result would be an electric nirvana, one defined by cleaner air and rampant job creation.

I’m not convinced. For one thing, cleaner air courtesy of electrification requires that EVs replace gas-powered autos. They’re not. In fact, study after study suggests that the purchase of EVs adds to the number of cars in a household.

And two-thirds of households with an EV have another non-EV that is driven more — hardly a recipe for climate success given that EVs must be driven (a lot) to deliver climate benefits. Fewer miles driven in an EV also challenges the economic efficiency of the billions Washington spends annually to subsidize their purchase.

Claims of job creation thanks to EVs are even more questionable. These claims are predicated around notions of aggressive consumer demand that drives increased EV manufacturing. This in turn creates jobs.

A recent Princeton University study noted, “Announced manufacturing capacity additions and expansions would nearly double U.S. capacity to produce electric vehicles by 2030 and are well sized to meet expected demand for made-in-USA vehicles.”

Jobs would be created if there were demand for EVs. Except that’s not what’s happening. Rather, consumer interest in EVs has effectively cratered. In 2024, 1.3 million EVs were sold in the United States, up from 1.2 million in 2023. This paltry increase is even more worrying given drastic price cuts seen in the EV market in 2024. Tesla knocked thousands of dollars off its best-selling Model 3 and Model Y. Ford followed suit by cutting prices on its Mach-e. So did Volkswagen and Hyundai.

Despite deep discounts, consumer interest in electrification remains — to put it mildly — tepid at best. So, when people equate electrification with robust job creation, I’m left wondering what they are going on about.

Even if jobs were created, EV advocates are coy about how many of those jobs would benefit existing autoworkers. Would all these workers — currently spread across large swaths of the Midwest — be guaranteed jobs on an EV assembly line? If not, how many workers should expect to receive pink slips? For those who do, will they be able to find new jobs that pay as much as their old ones? Touting job creation for political expediency is one thing. Fully recognizing its impact on hardworking American families today, another.

Some Americans may decry Trump’s actions on climate, but they have only themselves to blame. Many of the pro-climate policies enacted, particularly during the Biden era, deliver little in the way of climate benefits (or any benefit for that matter) while making a mockery of the real economic concerns businesses and consumers have about climate action.

No more. In justifying climate rollbacks, the president says many of his predecessor’s policies have hurt rather than helped the American people. He’s right and should be commended for doing something about it.

California-based Mullen said it as acquired an additional 21% stake in Bollinger, bringing its ownership to 95%, with Mullen's CEO David Michery now also taking over as head of Bollinger. A spokesperson said Bryan Chambers, the former CEO, is no longer with the company.

“Our investment in acquiring the vast majority of remaining shares and resolving certain significant outstanding debt demonstrates our belief in and continued commitment to Bollinger's vehicle lineup and future,"" Michery said in a statement.

Bollinger started making an electric chassis cab truck called the B4 last year, and a larger version, the B5, was scheduled for release in 2026.

A Mullen statement on the case's resolution said that Bollinger would continue to operate as an ""independent majority subsidiary, maintaining its own brand identity and focus."" It added current and future Bollinger customers should expect ""business as usual.""

Court records say Mullen agreed to fund the expenses of the receiver, Gene Kohut, and recent payroll costs during the receivership as it resolved the company's $10 million outstanding loan from Robert Bollinger.

While Bollinger Motors will live on, questions have been raised around Mullen's own troubled financial situation and ability to support the truck maker going forward. It has racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in losses over the last year, U.S. Securities and Exchange filings show. At a Detroit court hearing last month, Bollinger company executives said as the company faced increasing strain and ran low on cash in recent months, majority-owner Mullen had not provided sufficient support or direction to avoid issues that included halts to its production, missed payments to suppliers and landlords, and problems making 401(k) contributions to employees.

Then-CEO Chambers also said in early May that the company had sold two of its trucks in the prior month, with about 40 in inventory.

“In the past several weeks our message to customers and dealers is that we are open for business, focused on our customers and optimistic about our future,” Jim Connelly, chief revenue officer for Bollinger Motors, said in a statement. “The market for commercial EVs is full of opportunity and we continue to deliver world-class vehicles to help customers meet their fleet electrification needs.”

Michery told Crain's Detroit Business this week that he wants production of the company's Class 4 trucks to resume in 8 to 10 weeks, and promised to eventually grow its current Detroit-area staff of about 85 people. He was not immediately available for an interview Thursday.

DETROIT — The automotive industry is experiencing unprecedented disruption and uncertainty when it comes to regulations, electric vehicles, software innovations and competition from China.

Such disruptions have been years in the making, but many of the issues are coming to a head sooner rather than later, causing chaos for automakers and their plans for new vehicles.

""The unprecedented EV head-fake has wreaked havoc on product plans,"" Top Bank of America Securities analyst John Murphy said in the firm's annual ""Car Wars"" report. ""The next four+ years will be the most uncertain and volatile time in product strategy ever.""

The proprietary ""Car Wars"" report predicts future products and plans over the next several years. The thesis of the report is that replacement rate (or the percentage of vehicles that are expected to be replaced by newer models) drives showroom age, which drives market share, which drives profits and stock prices.

Automakers above an industry average replacement rate of 16% over the next four years include Tesla (22.4%), Honda Motor (16.9%), Hyundai Motor/Kia (16.5%) and Ford Motor (16.1%), according to Car Wars. At the bottom end of the analysis are Nissan Motor (12.3%), Toyota Motor (13.7%) and traditional European automakers (15.2%). General Motors is at 15.7%, while Stellantis is at 15.4%.

Aside from the replacement rates, Murphy on Wednesday made several predictions about the auto industry. Here are five investors should know about:

EV write-downs

Murphy expects the roughly $1.9 billion in expenses and write-downs Ford announced last year due to the termination of a planned all-electric three row SUV will be the first of many such losses for automakers regarding EVs.

""There's a lot of tough decisions that are going to need to be made,"" he said Wednesday during an Automotive Press Association event in suburban Detroit. ""Based on the ['Car Wars'] study, I think we're going to see multibillion-dollar write-downs that are flooding the headlines for the next few years.""

Automakers rushed to spend billions of dollars in recent years for EVs in anticipation of a market that hasn't developed as quickly as expected.

Return to core

Amid the EV uncertainty, many automakers have pivoted to ""customer choice,"" which means significant investments in other technologies such as hybrids and plug-in hybrid vehicles, as well as in traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE).

Due to that volatility and uncertainty, Murphy said automakers must lean heavily into their core products, including internal combustion engines, to generate capital.

Toyota

""Really, everybody is leaning back into their into their core over the next four years in very uncertain times,"" Murphy said, noting that cash ""is going to be critically important"" for automakers in the years ahead.

The title of this year's ""Car Wars"" investor note underscores that change: ""The ICE Age Cometh as EV Plans Freeze.""

China industry collapse

Industry uncertainty isn't exclusive to the U.S. The Chinese auto industry — the world's largest car sales market — is in the midst of a price war and stalling sales.

""What you're seeing in China is a bit disturbing because there is a lack of demand; there's extreme price cutting, and there's a lot of export that's rising, particularly over the last four or five years. Essentially net neutral to over 7 million units last year,"" Murphy said.

The top BofA analyst described this as the Chinese market beginning to ""implode on itself"" due to the price war, which is expected to cause mass consolidation of China's hundreds of automotive brands.

In China, the average car retail price has fallen by around 19% over the past two years to around 165,000 yuan ($22,900), according to a Nomura report this week, citing industry data from Autohome Research Institute.

Price cuts were far steeper for hybrid or range-extension vehicles, at 27% over the last two years, while battery-only cars saw prices slashed by 21%, the report said. It noted that traditional fuel-powered cars saw a below-average 18% price cut.

While very few exports come to the U.S., Murphy said it's expected Chinese brands will eventually compete in the market. However, he cautioned it might be best to shield the U.S. market from Chinese brands in the near-term to avoid such issues domestically.

""I don't think just from a technology or geopolitical perspective, that you really want to wall off the U.S. from China. It may be just simply that massive excess capacity you want to protect the U.S. market from until it works itself out and we see massive consolidation in the Chinese market,"" he said, adding there's good reason for massive tariffs on Chinese car imports.

Product shifts

""Car Wars"" predicts there will be a shift in new vehicle introductions during the second half of this decade, as automakers refocus product lineups and slow replacement rates in the near term.

A major shift is in crossover vehicles — which have a combination of SUV and car characteristics — that have significantly grown in popularity in past decades.

BofA reports the crossover ""surge is done."" For the first time nearly 20 years, Murphy said crossovers underrepresented versus the launch gains for the past 10 to 20 years.

""What's wild this year is that we expect 159 models to be launched over the next four years. Last year was over 200; traditionally, it's over 200,"" Murphy said. ""We have never seen this kind of change before.""

Part of the shift comes as the Detroit automakers — major producers of such vehicles — have focused on updating or redesigning their highly profitable full-size pickup trucks.

Japanese automakers have also had an uncharacteristically volatile product cadence, with a focus on cars, according to the report.

Auto growth area?

Investors have been skeptical of many auto stocks in recent years as expected growth areas have faltered.

But Murphy believes there's still notable potential for automakers as well as their retailers in software — a focus area for companies as of late that also has not grown as much as initially expected.

""In the near term, it's leveraging the connectivity, going after what we know is a very lucrative part of the value chain,"" Murphy said. ""They've been somewhat shut off from lack of attention to the consumer and a dealer body that needs to be reworked to some degree in a significant way, will create a real, real opportunity.""

The aftermarket industry and business at dealerships, including sales and service, represents $2.4 trillion in revenue, Murphy said. Of that $1.2 trillion captured by dealers, they generate about $53 billion in profits. He argues there's another $1.2 trillion that's escaping automakers, with $133 billion in profitability that could be gained through vehicle connectivity.

""It is vision critical that you get the dealers on board with this and drive this,"" Murphy said regarding getting customers into dealerships instead of non-franchised repair shops.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108138834-1746032874620-IMG_8425.JPG?v=1746033011&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-06-05 14:25:59.813018
,Indiana and Evs,2025-06-05 17:08:56+00:00,Factor This™,DOE is forcing Campbell to run—but it's not a reliability must run unit.,Rao Konidena,,,,,https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/energy-business/policy-and-regulation/doe-is-forcing-campbell-to-run-but-its-not-a-reliability-must-run-unit/,"The Department of Energy (DOE) is requiring MISO to keep Michigan’s 1,560 MW Campbell coal-fired unit online after reviewing the capacity prices from MISO’s latest auction.
The Campbell unit was scheduled to retire at the end of May 2025.
Electricity markets like MISO already have a process for ensuring units stay online for reliability, known as Reliability Must Run (RMR).
MISO did not request to keep Campbell online.
It doesn’t help reliability—MISO itself didn’t make that claim—and it distorts price signals.","The Department of Energy (DOE) is requiring MISO to keep Michigan’s 1,560 MW Campbell coal-fired unit online after reviewing the capacity prices from MISO’s latest auction. The Campbell unit was scheduled to retire at the end of May 2025. This kind of federal directive is virtually unheard of in wholesale energy markets. MISO—regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)—should reject DOE’s order. It sets a troubling precedent.

Electricity markets like MISO already have a process for ensuring units stay online for reliability, known as Reliability Must Run (RMR). In MISO, the equivalent designation is called System Support Resource (SSR). These SSR contracts are time-limited, cost-based, and must be filed with FERC. MISO only pays the operating costs necessary to keep the plant online until a transmission or non-wires alternative is in place.

What DOE is doing here bypasses that process. MISO did not request to keep Campbell online. News reports quote MISO as confirming this. The State of Michigan also did not request DOE intervention. So we have a situation where the market doesn’t need the unit, the state supports its retirement, and yet DOE is forcing its continued operation. That’s a clear overstep.

At any given point in time, MISO has “unplanned” generation outages. During the course of the year, on average MISO has 15,750 MW on these unplanned outages. So, does MISO really need a 1,560 MW unit to maintain reliability?

DOE justifies this decision by citing NERC’s 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment, which flagged an “elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand or low resource output” in MISO, particularly in August. DOE’s order claims that the Campbell retirement would “further decrease available dispatchable generation” and that “additional dispatch of the Campbell Plant is necessary to best meet the emergency and serve the public interest”.

DOE points to high capacity prices in the recent MISO auction—but these prices are the result of MISO and its Independent Market Monitor moving away from the old vertical demand curve. That previous curve did not provide efficient locational price signals because prices were either flat or spiked to the Cost of New Entry (CONE), with no granularity in between. MISO sought FERC’s approval to shift to a Reliability-Based Demand Curve (RBDC), which FERC accepted. That’s why prices are higher now—not because of a sudden, urgent need for one specific coal plant.

MISO’s own 2025-26 Planning Resource Auction report clearly stated that capacity was sufficient overall, but highlighted that “new capacity additions were insufficient to offset…retirements” in some areas. Importantly, MISO still did not designate Campbell as a System Support Resource despite these findings.

High capacity prices are a signal. They can be addressed through supply (e.g., new generation), demand response, storage, or other solutions. It’s not MISO’s job—or DOE’s—to pick a preferred technology like coal. Resource adequacy is the responsibility of individual states in MISO. If a state like Indiana wants to offer incentives for retiring coal units to stay open, that’s its prerogative. That’s how a multi-state ISO should work—allowing diverse state policy preferences to feed into a unified market structure.

MISO has long respected these variations. Its market algorithm balances generation and load across the region to find the least-cost solution to serve the next megawatt. That’s how renewables are able to operate in MISO today, supported by state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and policies—like those in Minnesota and Iowa—that require transmission buildout. MISO’s first Multi-Value Projects (MVP) portfolio was a direct response to these policies.

DOE’s order overrides this entire market-based approach. It directs MISO to “take every step to employ economic dispatch of the Campbell Plant,” and compels Consumers Energy to comply with MISO’s orders regarding the plant’s availability. This is the first known use of Section 202(c) to override a planned retirement not deemed essential by the RTO itself.

Forcing a coal unit to stay online despite no SSR designation undermines the market. It doesn’t help reliability—MISO itself didn’t make that claim—and it distorts price signals. That’s bad policy and bad economics.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/5282775793_cc38f2f84d_z-1.webp,N,,2025-06-06 08:38:02.198504

These credits had been central to the Biden administration’s climate agenda, offering incentives for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and industrial decarbonization.

The House-passed version of the bill would eliminate the majority of these subsidies, as Republican leaders continue to falsely frame the IRA as the Green New Deal. According to Heatmap, Senate Republicans have so far preserved most of the House’s repeals, though the Finance Committee has yet to weigh in on the most contentious element — the IRA’s tax credits, which are now a flashpoint among Republicans as backlash grows in red districts that have reaped the law’s economic benefits.

That intraparty tension stems from a geographic and economic reality: Many of the IRA’s largest beneficiaries are Republican districts. According to a June 2024 CNN analysis of Rhodium and MIT data, nearly 78% of IRA-linked clean energy investments, totaling $268 billion, have gone to GOP-held districts, fueling EV plants, solar factories, and battery storage facilities across the South and Midwest. With repeal now on the table, some Republicans are hedging, criticizing the Biden-era law rhetorically while quietly working to safeguard the economic gains in their own districts.

This tension was highlighted during the June 4 episode of CNN's Inside Politics, when chief climate correspondent Bill Weir walked through the political risk Republicans face. While hardliners demand an immediate repeal of the credits, others within the GOP are urging caution, with some warning they may oppose the bill entirely if the clean energy incentives are gutted.

Featured: Fiduciary Future

The ugly details of the Big Beautiful Bill’s damage to US clean energy competitiveness. Cuts to Medicaid and other health programs in the current version of the Republican tax and budget bill now before the US Senate could lead to more than 51,000 deaths annually, according to researchers at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania, President Trump’s alma mater. More than three million people would lose access to SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps. And the $2.4 trillion the bill would add to the national debt, according to the Congressional Budget Office, caused even Trump’s one-time First Buddy Elon Musk to slam it as “a disgusting abomination.”

And then there’s the damage the GOP budget, known officially as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would wreak on the roll out of clean energy capacity and the reshoring of key supply chains that was just gaining traction. “There is nothing beautiful about the current budget bill’s obstruction of US clean energy progress and American economic competitiveness,” Danielle Fugere and Diana Myers of As You Sow, the nonprofit shareholder advocacy organization, write in a Fiduciary Future guest post on ImpactAlpha. “Pulling the plug on these crucial investments weakens the innovation ecosystem that historically fueled America’s economic leadership, putting the US at a competitive disadvantage with geopolitical rivals like China.”

Making the case. Should the budget bill pass the Senate in its current form, it would slash funding for critical research and development in technology and clean energy, and abruptly repeal key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, despite its success in driving $321 billion in new private investment across 2,369 domestic clean-energy facilities. Impact and climate fund managers descended on Capitol Hill this week to try and stem the damage. “To keep capital flowing and projects moving forward, investors need stable, predictable policy,” said Mike Reynolds of Ultra Capital, a Philadelphia-based growth equity investor. “We encourage the Senate to continue its support of the energy tax credits, which will help to unlock more private investment and fuel America’s energy dominance.” Reynolds was part of a delegation from Impact Capital Managers that met with members of the Senate Finance Committee this week.

Second thoughts. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she would have voted against the bill in the House over the section that would strip states’ ability to regulate artificial intelligence for at least a decade – she said she hadn’t read the full bill. Musk, who once supported cuts to clean energy investments and EV credits, has also changed his tune. Tesla has reportedly spent some $240,000 on lobbying to keep the EV credits, among other issues. Tesla faces an even bigger threat, if California is forced to end its zero-emission vehicle mandate. Tesla has padded its bottom line by $11 billion over the past decade by selling compliance credits to other auto makers that don’t meet the state’s emission regulations and federal fuel standards. The Senate has voted to end California’s waiver of federal regulations it needs for the emissions regulations. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in January that Tesla would lose $1.2 billion a year from the repeal of the EV tax credits and another $2 billion in profits from proposed changes to California’s credit program. In this year’s first quarter, Tesla would have reported a loss without the $442 million in revenues from regulatory credits.

How the Mission Driven Bank Fund is tackling wealth inequalities in US communities. Microsoft and Truist answered a call from the US government’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation four years ago to create a pooled investment fund to finance mission-driven banks in underbanked US communities. The corporations helped launch the Mission Driven Bank Fund with an initial $120 million, which also included an anchor commitment from Warner Brothers Discovery. The private investment fund sought to raise $500 million to offer flexible, below-market-rate capital and technical assistance to FDIC-insured, mission-driven banks as well as federally designated minority depository institutions and community development financial institutions. It has raised just over $70 million in additional funds. The Mission Driven Bank Fund (unaffiliated with Mission Driven Finance) has secured commitments from banks including Enterprise Bank and Trust, Hancock Whitney Bank, Banner Bank and Lake City Bank.

Community Finance. The fund has backed 10 mission-driven banks to date, including Grand Bank for Savings, or Grand.bank, a minority depository institution and federal savings bank in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Grand.bank has a goal to improve the financial wellbeing of more than a million people in the state’s underserved communities by 2030. The community bank hopes to do so through “affordable homeownership” products like down-payment assistant loans and seller-financed mortgages for first-time home buyers. “The financial and technical services support of the Mission Driven Bank Fund will help us reach that goal,” said Grand.bank’s Chris Sawyer. Mission Driven Bank declined to disclose the investment amount. Other banks in Mission Driven Bank’s portfolio include American Bank, an MDI in Texas, and FNBC Bank, a CDFI that operates in Arkansas and Missouri’s underserved communities.

Bridging wealth gaps. Mission Driven Bank, co-managed by Black-led asset management firm Elizabeth Park Capital Management and impact investor Calvert Impact, has a pipeline of 300 mission-driven MDI and CDFI banks the managers believe could make a dent in the racial wealth gap by expanding the financial capacity of local banks to finance homeowners and small businesses. Misperception of risk and other racial biases in lending from national lenders have also played a key role. Just 142 of the approximately 4,500 banks and savings institutions the FDIC insures qualify as minority depository institutions with 51% or more of the voting stock owned by minority individuals.

Altérra commits $56.3 million alongside I Squared Capital for Italian solar and battery storage projects. The UAE’s $30 billion private climate investment fund Altérra, via its Altérra Acceleration Fund, committed €50 million ($56.3 million) to Absolute Energy, an Italian developer of small to medium-scale solar projects. American infrastructure-focused private equity firm I Squared Capital, which acquired a 95% stake in Absolute Energy in 2023, was a co-investor in the deal. The funding will support the development of 1.4 megawatts of solar and battery storage projects, as part of a larger 6 megawatt pipeline. I Squared Capital’s Sadek Wahba said the two investors shared a “commitment to deploying capital with urgency and impact.”

Capital mobilization. Altérra invests in large-scale projects via its $25 billion acceleration fund and provides risk mitigation capital for emerging markets via its $5 billion transformation fund. It has committed $6.5 billion since its launch at COP28 in 2023, either directly or via various climate transition funds managed by TPG, Brookfield and BlackRock. Its investments span wind, solar, battery storage and waste management projects in India, South Korea, Sri Lanka, France, Australia, the UK and other countries. Altérra also partnered with the Global Energy Alliance for People And Planet or GEAPP and the Rockefeller Foundation last year, to mobilize public, private and philanthropic capital for clean energy transition projects in emerging markets.

‘Triple dividends’ of climate resilience investments are highest in health and disaster management. Each dollar invested in climate adaptation and resilience yielded more than $10 dollars in benefits over the course of a decade, according to the World Resources Institute. The nonprofit calculated the returns from 320 such investments across a dozen countries totaling $133 billion, and found potential returns of $1.4 trillion, for an average annual return of 27%. The highest returns came from health projects, which had an annual rate of return of 78.5%. The high returns from health projects “is not surprising since the value of avoided losses, measured in terms of mortality and morbidity is very high,” write the authors of the report, “A Triple Dividend Approach.” The triple dividend refers to risk reduction from losses avoided due to climate disasters, economic growth from job creation, improved yields and overall social and environmental health that encompasses health and biodiversity improvement.

Resilient infrastructure. The Kenya Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Program, for example, was launched with a total project cost of $458 million to provide climate-resilient water and sanitation services. WRI estimated the project to have a net present value of $2.57 billion. In Bangladesh, the $129 million Weather and Climate Services Regional Project, funded by the World Bank, had a net present value of $414 million. The project aims to strengthen the ability to deliver reliable weather, water, and climate information in the flood-prone country. In South Africa, the C40 Cities Finance Facility supported Transformative Riverine Management in the eThekwini Municipal Area. The nature-based solution aims to tackle flooding in the region, alongside creating jobs and improving transportation. WRI places its net present value at $2 billion, nearly six times its original cost.

“We acknowledge that the states need a role because we are responsible for resource adequacy,” said Jacob Finkel, deputy secretary for policy for Pennsylvania Gov.","Ensuring the nation’s power grids can reliably deliver electricity is clashing with the tech industry’s voracious appetite for energy — pushing the risks of power outages to new highs, executives of regional power markets told federal regulators Wednesday.

Grid rules developed during periods of relatively slow growth aren’t equipped for the demands of Silicon Valley’s investment in artificial intelligence, extreme weather shocks, and deep national and state political divisions over energy and climate policy, grid operators told members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

“AI is going to change our world,” said Manu Asthana, CEO of the PJM Interconnection, grid operator for 67 million customers in all or parts of 13 Eastern states and the District of Columbia.

“In our forecast between 2024 and 2030, currently we have a 32-gigawatt increase in demand, of which 30 is from data centers,” Asthana said. “We need to stabilize market rules and find that intersection between reliability and affordability that works both for consumers and suppliers, and that intersection is getting harder and harder to find.”

Lanny Nickell, CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, PJM’s counterpart in a band of Great Plains states, said extreme weather threats and the increasing role of weather-dependent wind and solar power put outages at 125 times more likely to happen than eight years ago. “As if this wasn’t challenging enough,” he said, “we are now projecting our peak demand to be as much as 75 percent higher 10 years from now, and that’s largely driven by electrification and data center growth.”

Jim Robb, CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the architect of transmission grid standards, said grid operators need “much deeper insight” into future electricity supply and demand and the probabilities of extreme storms and heat waves that could push power demand to new peaks. Limited real-time information about the effect that dangerous storms have on gas pipeline deliveries to electric turbines is also an area of concern that has been left unresolved by the broader energy industry.

Current industry risk analysis cannot do the job, Robb said in comments filed for a two-day conference at FERC’s Washington headquarters.

“This will require stronger modeling of fuel and capacity performance to assess reliability risk,” Robb said. The industry needs to establish an agreed-upon profile of the likely risks operators face, like the “design basis” accident scenarios that nuclear power plant operators are required to defend against.

Susan Bruce, counsel to a group of industrial power customers, said her coalition shares “serious concerns” about regional grid reliability and the ability to add enough new electric generation to keep pace with demand, particularly from “unprecedented but undefined” growth of data center and cryptocurrency mining operations.

“There is a lack of trust that even very high prices” in grid markets “can move the needle” to get new nonrenewable generation in service, she said in remarks filed with the commission.

“New rules of the road are necessary,” she said.

‘States leaning on other states’

Sharp divisions at national and state levels over climate policies is apparent inside PJM, said FERC Chair Mark Christie.

Christie told PJM’s Asthana, “You’ve got 13 states plus the District, you’ve got widely divergent policies from New Jersey to West Virginia, from Indiana to Maryland.

“It puts you in an impossible position,” Christie continued. “How can you guys balance these incredibly divergent political goals and try to run a market … that fits the economic textbooks?”

One answer, broached by Christie and several state regulators at the conference, was to push more responsibility on states to meet grid reliability challenges. Panelists at the FERC conference debated whether electricity reliability and affordability would be helped if states ordered utilities to purchase part of the generation they expect to need in the future, rather than relying on PJM’s competitive energy markets to deliver supply.

“How do we make it work without the states having a much larger role?” Christie asked.

“We acknowledge that the states need a role because we are responsible for resource adequacy,” said Jacob Finkel, deputy secretary for policy for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), who has led a challenge to PJM policies by Democratic governors in its region. “We have a responsibility to our ratepayers for affordability.”

“It’s easy to throw darts at PJM,” said Kelsey Bagot, a member of the Virginia State Corp. Commission. “To the extent we want a larger role in the process, we have to demonstrate that as a group of states with very different regulatory structures and very different goals and policies, that we can actually function as a collaborative body and make decisions.

“I think that challenge has been handed to us,” Bagot said.

Dennis Deters, a member of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, sided with Bagot, a fellow red-state regulator. “We are reactive,” he said. “Too many states are relying on [PJM] to provide resource adequacy.

“I do shudder to think of injecting more politics into an engineering effort,” he added.

Michael Richard, a member of the Maryland Public Service Commission, said the divisions were over principle rather than politics. “You know, Maryland policymakers, we believe the science on climate change.”

Christie several times pressed panelists for opinions on whether states should be held accountable if their utilities aren’t building enough generation to meet reliability needs, which, in his calculation, means generation that can operate around the clock, not renewables. “If you don’t build enough, maybe you need to pay a penalty. Clearly, there are states leaning on other states,” he said.

“The states have the ability to do a lot of direct contracting and direct support for their policies,” PJM’s Asthana said. “We have seen the state of New Jersey, for example, directly support offshore wind. We have supported them in that pursuit, and that can work.”

Gordon van Welie, president of ISO New England, said that states can lose control. “We know from experience that it’s very hard building fossil resources in New England,” he said. A key part of the region’s answer was investment in offshore wind. Now the Trump administration has thrown up barriers to that option, he added.

“So that puts us in a very difficult place as we enter 2030,” he said. “Something’s got to give in that equation. Otherwise we have trouble.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2f/13/14c1db8e45ee91be9bd57760dd2b/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/506185902,N,,2025-06-06 08:36:37.398128

President Donald Trump’s proposed budget, released Friday, would reduce federal funding for waste and recycling activity. The budget is for fiscal year 2026, which begins Oct. 1, and is Trump's opening offer before negotiations take place with Congress on the final budget.

The proposal includes wide-ranging cuts, including to the U.S. EPA. It would cut the Superfund program’s appropriated funds by about 47%. It would also cut the Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery's budget by 42%.

The cuts are the administration's latest efforts to shrink or otherwise curtail federal action on a range of environmental issues. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has characterized those moves, which include staff cuts, as essential to operating as efficiently as possible.

Dive Insight:

The Trump administration has halted or attempted to rescind funds that were allocated through grant programs during the Biden administration, calling them wasteful. That’s caused temporary disruptions in funding for Recycling Education and Outreach grant recipients and canceled Community Change Grant contracts which would have supported composting.

The agency has also sought broad authority to dismiss federal employees. Earlier this week, Zeldin said he wanted to return the EPA to Reagan-level staffing levels. Since Jan. 1, the EPA has lost an estimated 733 staffers, according to The Hill. The total rate of attrition could be higher, as that number reportedly does not include employees who took a buyout or are probationary and may have been dismissed, pending court cases.

The budget proposal anticipates staffing cuts alongside changes to program office funding. It would cut funding across RCRA activities. Within the program office, corrective action funding would decline roughly 35% to about $25.1 million; waste management funding would decline roughly 44% to about $40.4 million; and waste minimization and recycling funding would decline by 56% to about $4.3 million. The proposal did not give an explanation of those cuts.

The Superfund office's budget reflects ""the need for efficiencies and operational improvements"" across the EPA, according to Trump's proposal. It also reflects a proposal to fund the office's remediation program through annual income from recently reinstated excise taxes, rather than through general appropriations. The taxes, which expired in 1995 but were revived by the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act, add fees to certain chemicals, substances and petroleum products. Trump's budget anticipates $1.6 billion in funds collected in FY 2025 available for the upcoming fiscal year.

The plan for the office would add 45.7 full-time employees while zeroing out appropriated funding, which totaled $187.8 million in the FY 2025 budget.

Of the total funding requested, $6.8 million and 812.8 full-time employees are for Superfund enforcement-related activities. That represents a cut of about $10 million year over year.

The agency's civil enforcement division would also take a hit through the proposal. Trump proposed slashing the division's budget by $61 million while cutting 180.8 full-time employees. In its explanation, the proposal states: ""EPA will return to reasonable enforcement actions and refocus efforts toward areas with significant noncompliance issues and where enforcement can address the most substantial impacts to human health and the environment.""

The agency proposed revisiting its enforcement priorities — which in recent years has included a focus on landfill emissions and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — the same day it announced dozens of regulatory rollbacks.

The budget requests $5 million to administer the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grants program, which has handed out tens of millions of dollars in funding in recent years. In April, the EPA said it was still working to approve about $78 million in grants through the program.

Other grant programs are on the list of cuts. The budget would eliminate Resource Recovery and Hazardous Waste Grants, which totaled more than $101 million in FY 2025. It would also eliminate a categorical grant program for brownfield remediation, while reducing a related State and Tribal Assistance Grant program by $18 million.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-8h5nd1HCb53sxIqgtEzMp7qIT7zdJ1DsDsXH54EFyU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfODkwMS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-06-05 14:25:22.546018

Dive Brief:

Meta and energy producer Constellation Energy announced a 20-year nuclear power purchase agreement on Tuesday that will give the social media and tech conglomerate access to zero emissions power for its artificial intelligence goals and help keep an Illinois facility online.

The agreement will give Meta 1,121 megawatts of nuclear energy beginning in June 2027 from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. The PPA will also support the relicensing and continued operations of the Illinois power plant when a state zero emissions energy tax credit expires in 2027.

Meta is among a growing number of tech giants who have turned to nuclear to help offset growing data center energy needs driven by artificial intelligence. The company previously released requests for proposals seeking up to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy generation capacity to support its “AI innovation and sustainability objectives.”

Dive Insight:

Meta’s deal will also allow Constellation to expand the facility to generate an additional 30 megawatts of power during the 20-year extension of operations, which will also preserve more than 1,000 jobs and deliver an estimated $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the June 3 release.

The Clinton Clean Energy Center had previously been saved by a state zero emissions tax credit program, after it was slated for closure in 2017. Meta’s power purchase agreement is designed to replace that credit and support the continued operations of the plant “without ratepayer support,” according to Constellation.

Meta Head of Global Energy Urvi Parekh said in the release that in addition to ensuring the long-term operation of the plant and preserving jobs, the deal demonstrates that “this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” The deal will also aid the global tech and social media conglomerate in its goal to reach zero emissions across its supply chain by 2030.

“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Parekh said.

Constellation said it is also exploring strategies that would extend an existing early site permit at the plant or approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop either an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor at the Illinois site.

This deal marks the second high-profile nuclear power purchase agreement Constellation has signed with a tech giant, following Microsoft’s 20-year agreement with the energy producer last fall. This deal will restart operations for a nuclear generator at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island facility in 2028.

Constellation CEO and President Joseph Dominguez said that after its plans to restart the Three Mile Island facility became national news, Meta questioned why “such a valuable plant” would be allowed to close in the first place, then “figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy.”

Meta — along with fellow tech giants Google and Amazon — was among a group of “large energy users” who signed a pledge to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 at S&P Global’s CERAWeek conference in March. Google recently announced a deal with Elementl Power to advance the early stage development of three advanced nuclear energy projects.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/TPehPRs8AWvOZJWpiR6PZZfFa7-leXXYlInZNZu3Lb4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DbGludG9uX0NsZWFuX0VuZXJneV9DZW50ZXJfY291cnRlc3R5X0NvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-06-05 14:22:14.999790

Since then, the IEA said that continuously growing investment in renewable energy has been driven by “technologies that are increasingly mature and cost-competitive.” While emissions reductions are a major factor driving investment and supportive policies, the IEA said the economic and energy security benefits of renewable energy are increasingly driving investment decisions.
This trend holds true across much of the developing world, which has lagged significantly behind wealthier nations in electrification and carbon reduction investment.
Even India, one of the leading markets for solar PV and renewable energy investments and one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, has issues around the cost of capital for utility-scale renewables projects.
The IEA report said: “India’s cost of capital for grid-scale renewable energy is one of the lowest among its emerging market and developing economy counterparts.","The World Energy Investment 2025 report did caveat this growth, saying that the prospects for new projects (rather than existing ones) are less certain:

“Open questions about the economic and trade outlook mean that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new project approvals, but we have yet to see significant implications for spending on existing projects,” the report said.

The biggest sectors for investment are renewable energy (predominantly solar and wind), and energy efficiency and end-use investments, with US$780 billion and US$773 billion, respectively.

The figures continue the growth which began in the post-pandemic era, with government recovery packages and efforts to increase energy independence in China, the EU and India. Since then, the IEA said that continuously growing investment in renewable energy has been driven by “technologies that are increasingly mature and cost-competitive.”

While emissions reductions are a major factor driving investment and supportive policies, the IEA said the economic and energy security benefits of renewable energy are increasingly driving investment decisions.

Some broad and familiar trends hold true in the new report. Grid infrastructure is failing to keep pace with growing power demand and increased renewable energy penetration across the world; current investment will need to double if the world is to meet the COP28 commitment to triple renewables capacity by 2030; renewable energy technologies (like solar modules and energy storage systems) are trending downwards in cost.

R&D shifts

The makeup of the top firms for research & development (R&D) has shifted dramatically in the last ten years, the IEA said.

Where in 2015, the top 20 R&D firms were “dominated by US and European automotive companies and oil and gas players”, just three state-owned fossil fuel firms are in the 2024 list: Petrochina, Sinopec and Saudi Aramco.

They have been replaced by electric vehicle companies BYD and Tesla, and Chinese pure-play battery manufacturer CATL.

Global distribution

The IEA also said that reductions in the cost of capital for clean energy investments in the developing world “need to be the cornerstone” of efforts to reach COP29 targets to mobilise US$1.3 trillion for low-emissions projects in developing economies by 2035.

“Scaling up climate finance to developing countries requires targeted policy action to address a variety of real and perceived risks impeding investments in clean energy that are driving up the cost of financing in these countries,” the report said.

This trend holds true across much of the developing world, which has lagged significantly behind wealthier nations in electrification and carbon reduction investment.

Even India, one of the leading markets for solar PV and renewable energy investments and one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, has issues around the cost of capital for utility-scale renewables projects.

The IEA report said: “India’s cost of capital for grid-scale renewable energy is one of the lowest among its emerging market and developing economy counterparts. However, it is still 80% higher than in advanced economies. Higher financing costs affect the financial viability of projects, leading to higher energy prices. Furthermore, real and perceived risks affect the attractiveness of projects to investors.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lightsource-bp-utility-scale-solar-PV-plant.jpg,N,,2025-06-05 14:22:20.119660

Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee and co-chair of the Senate Climate Change Task Force, today released the following statement after Senate Republicans released the Environment and Public Works portion of their reconciliation bill text.

“Time is revealing Senate Republicans’ willingness to abandon communities nationwide and put Oil Above All —above the law, above the economy, and above the health and wallets of working families. Their proposed cuts would eliminate the safeguards and funding needed to reduce harmful air pollution and environmental health risks. Their cuts would also destroy the $20 billion climate bank I secured in the Inflation Reduction Act, which was already at work creating jobs, lowering Americans’ energy costs, strengthening our energy independence, and combating the climate crisis.

“Republicans have no interest in bringing down costs or helping everyday Americans. Instead, they are picking winners and losers to deliver a big bonus to Big Oil and Gas. Republicans want to cut funding for clean energy, community resilience, and pollution reduction, all while giving polluters a golden ticket to skirt any meaningful reviews to get their projects permitted – rubberstamping dangerous polluting infrastructure.

“These Republican cuts will ensure frontline and fenceline communities continue to bear the burden of disproportionate levels of pollution. Ripping away the tools needed to curb methane and reduce carbon and hazardous pollutants will only make Americans sicker while the rich get richer. We must say no to these dangerous cuts and stop this big billionaire sell-out once and for all.”

Senator Markey secured numerous provisions in the historic Inflation Reduction Act, including the creation of a $27 billion national climate financing network based on his National Climate Bank Act with Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (MI-06). He also secured historic environmental justice funding for air quality monitoring, environmental inequity mapping, and addressing extreme heat.

Senator Markey has been a champion of vehicle emission standards that would be rolled back by the Senate reconciliation text, which would increase pollution and force drivers to pay more at the pump. He has also long championed a robust National Environmental Policy Act, which the Senate Republican bill undermines with an opt-in fee for project sponsors to pay to expedite their project’s environmental review and avoid judicial review – rubberstamping potentially harmful infrastructure.

The rollout of the Rivian-made electric trucks at the Florence shipping hub is part of a company-wide effort to reduce pollution. The cost of these upgrades has totaled over $1 billion and added 20,000 electric vehicles to its U.S. fleet.

This is being complemented by a rollout of electric semi trucks for long-distance delivery. Investment in solar energy generation, plastics research, and packaging reduction are just a few other avenues the retail behemoth is taking in sustainability.

Electric vehicles are a big part of the future of transportation. Medium- and heavy-duty trucks generate about 23% of U.S. transportation emissions. Cutting gas out of the equation means reducing the incidence of destructive weather patterns, ocean warming, and loss of sea ice.

""You don't hear anything. It's very quiet. And in the other vans, it would be very bumpy and rough sounds,"" said driver Hannah Jones of the new vehicles, per Spectrum News 1.

Despite the environmental benefits of electric truck deployment, Amazon still faces challenges. Its massive data centers tap into polluting energy sources, and it has relied on offsets rather than renewable power to meet its net-zero commitments.

Amazon also enables the sale of just about any physical good someone could need. Manufacturing generates a large chunk of global pollution, but Amazon's Scope 3 reporting only includes goods made under its brand. Meanwhile, other retailers include outside manufacturing in their accounting. Even for its own products, Amazon is being hit with a class action lawsuit for falsely claiming its branded toilet paper is eco-friendly.

Still, Amazon's staff take its net-zero goals seriously.

""We're obviously a big company and we have very big goals,"" said Florence site lead Bryan Dzialo, per Spectrum News 1. ""One of those is to be net zero carbon emissions by 2040, and given the scale of our kind of logistics operation, that's a big undertaking.

California-based Mullen acquired an additional 21% of Bollinger, bringing its ownership stake in the Oak Park-based company to 95%, Mullen announced Monday as it executed its second reverse stock split in as many months to stay compliant with Nasdaq rules on share prices.

In tandem with Mullen’s transaction, Bollinger was discharged from receivership Monday and the case dismissed with prejudice, according to a filing in U.S. District Court Eastern District of Michigan.

Mullen Automotive CEO and Chairman David Michery said the company paid $11 million to Robert Bollinger, who in March sued the company he founded, claiming it was broke and seeking to recover his loan.

Mullen, which has faced a host of financial issues beyond Bollinger, is all-in on the EV startup, Michery said Wednesday in a sit-down interview with Crain’s Detroit Business and affiliate publication Automotive News. Bollinger Motors — despite the spat with its namesake — will persevere as a brand that “will outlast everyone,” Michery vowed at the startup’s Oak Park headquarters.

“You can’t blame Bollinger for the current market, you can’t blame Bollinger for tariffs, you can’t blame Bollinger for the disruption that occurred with Robert filing this frivolous lawsuit,” Michery said. “That hurt the company.”

Now, Mullen is putting its chips on Bollinger Motors to weather the storm. Michery said production of Class 4 trucks would resume in 8-10 weeks and its staff of about 85 in metro Detroit would soon swell in line with a predicted increase in demand — though that remains in question with a stagnant market.

Mullen will close its engineering base in Irvine, Calif., and consolidate it to the company’s tech center in Troy, where 40-50 employees will be added, Michery said.

“I want all engineering, all manufacturing, everything in the state of Michigan,” he said.

While Michery serves as CEO of Bollinger Motors, the company’s daily operations will be overseen by James Taylor, who will return to the company as a consultant after departing in March.

Another priority is cleaning up the company’s supply chain. Bollinger Motors has been sued by several suppliers claiming they were being stiffed by the startup. Michery said he is in the process of paying debts, including to Livonia-based contract manufacturer Roush, which makes the Class 4 trucks for Bollinger.

Mullen’s earnings reports to the SEC seem to indicate big financial trouble. It lost $162 million on revenue of $7.9 million in the first quarter; it posted a $115 million loss on revenue of $2.9 in the prior quarter.

The company lost its 675,000-square-foot former AM General factory in Mishawaka, Ind., last month to settle a financial dispute with GEM Yield Bahamas Ltd.

However, Michery said the company has ample liquidity, including a $150 million equity line allowing the company to use its stock as currency — an instrument approved by the SEC and shareholders.

“Picture a credit card,” he said. “Mullen has a $150 million credit card that it can use at will.”

Mullen’s 1-for-100 reverse stock split executed Monday was designed to bring its stock price above $1 per share to meet Nasdaq requirements.

Birmingham-based financial adviser Alex Calderone said the move is window dressing and does not solve underlying business performance issues.

“I would not surmise that would impact company valuation at all or shareholder rights at all,” Calderone said. “It just appears to be a cosmetic change to be able to adjust the share price. … It’s like if I traded you a hundred-dollar bill for a hundred singles.”

On Wednesday, Mullen’s stock shot up to above $16 per share, tripling its value over the course of the day, as Michery pointed out after pulling up the market summary on his phone.

“They knew we were coming out here to put Bollinger back in business,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump lashed out on Thursday against Elon Musk, saying he was ""disappointed"" by the billionaire's public opposition to the sweeping tax-cut and spending bill that is at the heart of Trump's agenda.

""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""He said the most beautiful things about me, and he hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm, I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.""

Trump also asserted that Musk's days of blistering attacks on the bill were motivated by the proposed elimination of consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Musk, the CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla, has said he opposes the bill because it will increase federal deficits.

Trump suggested that Musk, who received a praise-filled sendoff from Trump last week after overseeing his federal bureaucracy cost-cutting campaign, was upset because he missed working for Trump.

""He's not the first,"" Trump said. ""People leave my administration ... then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile.""

As Trump was speaking, Musk wrote on X, ""Slim Beautiful Bill for the win,"" a reference to the bill's official title, the ""Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

Musk followed that up with another post, saying he was fine with the cuts to electric vehicle credits as long as Republicans removed what he called a ""mountain of disgusting pork"" in wasteful spending from the bill.

Places the U.S. Government Warns Not to Travel Right Now

Musk came into the government with brash plans to cut $2 trillion out of the federal budget. He left last week having achieved far less than that, having cut about half of 1% of total spending.

Musk has been a powerful Trump ally, spending nearly $300 billion to boost Republicans in the 2024 election and then overseeing Trump's Department of Government Efficiency.

His work eliminating thousands of federal jobs and cutting billions of dollars in foreign aid and other programs caused disruption across federal agencies while prompting widespread protests at Tesla outlets in the U.S. and Europe.

Shares of Tesla extended losses after Trump's criticism of Musk. The stock was lately down nearly 6%; it was off by 3% before Trump spoke.

Global energy investment is forecast to reach US$3.3tn, 2% higher in real terms than in 2024, with clean technologies continuing to dominate the landscape.

However, the report also warns of persistent structural imbalances, especially in grid capacity and support for developing economies.

Clean energy overtakes fossil fuels

The report states that clean energy will attract US$2.2tn in 2025, twice the projected US$1.1tn for fossil fuels.

This includes spending on renewables, nuclear, electricity grids, battery storage, energy efficiency, low-emissions fuels and electrification.

“Amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that are clouding the outlook for the energy world, we see energy security coming through as a key driver of the growth in global investment this year to a record US$3.3tn as countries and companies seek to insulate themselves from a wide range of risks,” explains Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director.

“The fast-evolving economic and trade picture means that some investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to new energy project approvals, but in most areas we have yet to see significant implications for existing projects.”

The share of clean energy in total investment has grown steadily over the past five years, driven not only by climate goals, but by economic recovery efforts, industrial policy and national energy security agendas.

Electric mobility, particularly EVs, has become a significant area of investment.

Many EV models are now cost competitive with internal combustion engines in markets such as China, highlighting the rapid commercialisation of electrified transport.

Which regions and sectors are driving investment in renewable energy?

Crucially, 70% of this growth has come from net fossil fuel importers such as China, Europe and India.

In the United States, increased spending is being shaped by strategic competition with China in clean technology supply chains.

Investment in the electricity sector is expected to reach US$1.5tn in 2025, now 50% more than total fossil fuel supply spending.

“It’s encouraging to see growing global investment in the energy transition. We’re getting closer to the US$3.5 trillion annual capital needed between now and 2050 to achieve net zero, but there’s still more to be done,” says Frederic Godemel, EVP Energy Management, Schneider Electric.

“We cannot let geopolitical uncertainty or economic headwinds derail our progress, after all the climate crisis doesn’t abide by our political or economic cycles.

“We must move beyond cautious optimism.

“With many clean energy projects still stalling, we need to double down on demand-side solutions, which are half of the solution to net zero.

“We have the technologies to decarbonise today, now it’s about scaling Electricity 4.0– the combination of electric and digital- to drive immediate progress.”

A decade ago, fossil fuel investment outpaced electricity-focused investment by 30%, a complete reversal.

Today, the main drivers of electricity demand growth include electrified transport, industry, cooling, data centres and artificial intelligence.

Solar power for the win

Low emissions power generation spending has nearly doubled over the past five years.

Solar PV remains the dominant force, with projected investment reaching US$450bn in 2025, making it the single largest energy investment category globally.

Storage infrastructure is growing in parallel, with US$66bn earmarked for batteries supporting power sector flexibility.

China is also increasing its influence in solar exports to the developing world.

In 2024, Pakistan alone imported 19 GW of solar modules, equivalent to nearly half its grid-connected capacity.

The rise of nuclear and coal power

Nuclear power investment will exceed US$70bn in 2025, representing a 50% increase over five years.

Interest in small modular reactors is rising and new gas-fired capacity is being pursued in the US and the Middle East.

However, the fossil fuel landscape remains complex.

While upstream oil investment is forecast to fall by 6% in 2025, the largest drop since 2016, coal supply and approvals are increasing, particularly in Asia.

China and India alone approved nearly 115 GW of new coal capacity in 2024, the highest since 2015.

By contrast, no new coal-fired steam turbines were ordered in advanced economies in 2024, an unprecedented development.

“When the IEA published the first ever edition of its World Energy Investment report nearly ten years ago, it showed energy investment in China in 2015 just edging ahead of that of the United States,” says Fatih.

“Today, China is by far the largest energy investor globally, spending twice as much on energy as the European Union and almost as much as the EU and United States combined.”

Grids and infrastructure lag behind

Annual investment in electricity grids stands at around US$400bn, compared to US$1tn for generation assets.

Grid investment is failing to keep pace with the rollout of renewables.

Barriers include protracted permitting processes, transformer and cable shortages, and weak utility balance sheets, especially in developing markets.

The IEA’s 2025 forecast confirms that clean energy is now the main destination for global energy investment, backed by falling technology costs, growing policy support and rising electricity demand.

However, coal expansion in Asia, insufficient grid upgrades and weak support for developing nations continue to challenge global climate ambitions.

Investment in mature clean technologies is not always driven by emissions goals but often by economics, security and industrial strategy.

For the global transition to succeed, investment must not only increase, but flow more equitably.

The next phase of progress hinges on stronger infrastructure, better financing mechanisms and a more inclusive approach to energy development.

Trump said that Musk — who until recently was one of his top advisors — opposes the budget package because the Tesla CEO is ""upset"" about the elimination of electric vehicle credits in the bill, and the Republican president nixing his pick to run NASA.

""I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,"" Trump told reporters at the White House, where less than a week ago he lauded Musk's work on the DOGE project to cut federal spending and employee headcount.

""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,"" Trump said.

Musk quickly and dismissively fired back at Trump in a post on his social media site X.

""Whatever,"" wrote Musk, who has criticized bill because it will increase federal deficits.

""Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful.""

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election,"" Musk soon after tweeted.

""Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,"" added Musk, who was the biggest financial backer of Trump's 2024 campaign, spending more than $250 million on that effort.

""Such ingratitude,"" he wrote.

Musk launched a poll on X, asking users, ""Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?""

Tesla shares slid by more than 8% as the feud erupted between the EV-maker's CEO and the Republican president.

Trump's analysis of Musk's motivation came after days of the billionaire condemning what Trump calls his ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" over concerns it will blow out federal deficits.

Musk on Tuesday called the bill, which is being considered by the Senate, a ""disgusting abomination.""

""Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate, and you know, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,"" Trump said. ""And you know, they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles, and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy.""

""Elon knew this from the beginning,"" Trump said, referring to the elimination of the tax credits in the bill for electric vehicles. ""He knew it ... a long time ago.""

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it.""

""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair,"" Trump said.

The president also said, referring to Isaacman, ""I'm sure [Musk] respected him, but to run NASA ... I didn't think it was appropriate.""

""You happen to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,"" Trump said of Isaacman. "" And I say, you know, look, we won. We get certain privileges. And one of the privileges we don't have to appoint a Democrat. NASA is very important.""

Trump suggested Musk's pivot to becoming a critic is part of a pattern he has seen with others who previously served his administration.

""People leave my administration, and they love us. And then at some point they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is,"" Trump said.

"" It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it. But we have it with others too.

""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday.
""Such ingratitude,"" wrote Musk, who spent nearly $300 million to elect Trump and other Republicans last year.
In the Oval Office, Trump also said that Musk was lashing out because he ""missed"" being in the White House.
I think he got out there and all of a sudden, he wasn't in this beautiful Oval Office,"" Trump said.","President Donald Trump is finally responding to Elon Musk's criticism of his ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""I don't know if we will anymore.""

Trump told reporters that Musk's criticism of the bill likely stemmed primarily from the phase-out of the electric vehicle tax credit, which would likely impact his company, Tesla.

""You know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate… which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,"" Trump said. ""And they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles.""

""Elon knew this from the beginning,"" Trump added.

Musk fired back minutes later, saying that while he thought the EV phase-out was unfair, he was more concerned about the ""MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.""

He later wrote on X that without him, Trump would have lost the election, Democrats would have gained control of the House, and Republicans would've had a smaller majority in the Senate.

""Such ingratitude,"" wrote Musk, who spent nearly $300 million to elect Trump and other Republicans last year.

In the Oval Office, Trump also said that Musk was lashing out because he ""missed"" being in the White House.

""I'll be honest, I think he misses the place. I think he got out there and all of a sudden, he wasn't in this beautiful Oval Office,"" Trump said. ""I'll tell you, he's not the first. People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point, they miss it so badly, and some of them embrace it, and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.""

The tech titan first unleashed on the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which is set to serve as the centerpiece of Trump's legislative agenda, on Tuesday. He's kept up his criticism ever since.

""I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore,"" Musk wrote on X on Tuesday. ""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.""

Musk main criticism has been of the bill's projected impact on the federal deficit. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that in its current form, the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, while the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has said that number would be $2.5 trillion.

Musk previously said that the bill undermined the work of DOGE, which has sought to cut billions of dollars in federal spending.",https://i.insider.com/684078409d73a0031e8ddb71?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-06-05 14:21:35.617088
