AES plans to file the plan on Oct. 31 to get approval from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

AES Indiana is planning what kind of energy sources it will add over roughly the next 15 years, and the Indianapolis utility company has a backup plan in case large-load data centers move into its coverage area.

Without data center development, AES would lean on battery storage and gas reciprocating engines to fuel energy demand until 2040. But if data centers build in the utility's densely-populated swath of Central Indiana, AES would add gas plants to the plan — a move environmentalists say backtracks on the utility's previous strides toward using clean energy.

Every three years, Indiana utilities are required to submit a resource plan to address from where they will source energy over the next several years and how much energy they will add to capacity. AES plans to file the company's Integrated Resource Plan to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on Oct. 31, company spokesperson Mallory Duncan said.

With more than 520,000 customers, AES mostly serves energy users in Marion County, as well some residential and business customers in two narrow slivers of land, one extending from Indianapolis northwest into Boone County and another winding southwest through Morgan County, according to an Indiana Energy Association service map.

AES ran 16 models to map out energy needs, costs and possible constraints in Central Indiana, including scenarios ranging from no data centers to a high data center load. AES then ran seven additional models, including three designed to analyze the so-far-unknown effects data centers could have on energy demands in the area.

Following nearly a year of stakeholder meetings and feedback, AES landed on two preferred energy blueprints: one if no data centers enter their territory and another to fall back on if a large data center gets built and signs a contract with AES.

What AES preferred plans look like

AES's initial Integrated Resourced Plan assumes there will be no data centers.

Under the plan, AES would add 100 MW in battery storage capacity and 108 MW from gas reciprocating engines by 2040, pending any future plans that would necessitate different energy generation decisions.

If data centers enter the picture, the plan looks wildly different. AES would still look to add 108 MW in gas engines, but the company would then install 860 MW of battery storage power to power the campuses, more than eight times the capacity without data centers. This assumes the utility sees a demand of about 1,500 MW to supply data centers.

AES would also look to add two gas plants, each supplying at least 700 MW of power.

The possibility of more gas plants concerns environmental advocates.

Megan Anderson, senior campaign representative at the Sierra Club, criticized AES' reliance on natural gas plants to power data centers instead of renewable options like wind or solar. Gas plants produce greenhouse gas emissions that are known to contribute to climate change.

""Instead of prioritizing clean energy sources that will cut costs for customers, these plans grossly fail to address climate and the urgency for us to meet our energy needs in a reliable, affordable way,"" Anderson's statement said in part. ""We don’t want our utility building a massive gas plant to power Big Tech’s data centers, and we certainly don’t want to pay for it.""

AES officials said they do not want plans to rest on the possibility of data centers. If the utility plans for large customers that do not materialize, energy rates would be more expensive than if AES Indiana simply did nothing to plan for data centers, said Patrick McGuire, senior director of commercial and resource planning, in an Oct. 22 session with stakeholders.

Power resources have long been a sticking point for data center opponents and consumer advocates who argue the massive structures will sap energy and lead to higher electric bills for residential consumers. Currently, no data center operators have signed an agreement with AES for power, and any future data center would need to go through a future regulatory process, several AES executives stressed during the multi-hour session.

However, AES announced a request for proposals in May seeking contractors to build two gas plants in its service area.

Data center builders eyeing Central Indiana

Even though no data centers have signed binding contracts to request power in or near Indianapolis, some see it as only a matter of time. State leaders have welcomed data center operators with open arms. Would-be data center developers in Indiana find abundant land, cheaper energy and hefty tax incentives to help jumpstart projects.

An IndyStar investigation published in June found that anticipated energy needs for just nine data centers accounted for more than half of Indiana utilities’ electricity capacity in 2023, based on public information, including data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration and Citizen's Action Coalition.

At least one major name is exploring data center sites in the AES coverage area.

On Oct. 21, the day before AES' final stakeholders meeting for its resource plan, Google revealed itself to be the tech titan behind a sprawling data center development that recently received rezoning approval in Morgan County. AES would service the 390-acre Morgan County project near the small town of Monrovia.

As AES charts its future, reports indicate the utility could soon undergo a sale to Blackrock, a private equity company. AES said it does not comment on market rumors.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/22/PIND/83781473007-jim-irsay-05212025-gh-002.jpg?crop=3989,2245,x0,y239&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-23 05:58:24.496956

Clean Energy Tours The Westbrooks typically run tours once a year for the American Solar Energy Society’s National Solar Home Tour.
While Texas has become the nation’s leader in utility-scale solar in recent years, it’s fourth in rooftop solar.
The percentage of Texas homes powered with rooftop solar is less than 4 percent, according to a September report from the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The leader in home solar is California, where more than 20 percent of homes have installed rooftop solar panels.","Some 30 years ago, Paul and Elena Westbrook considered the earth’s rotations around the sun to make a big life choice: where to build a home.

Tracking where the solar noon would land on their property throughout the year proved clever. The sun warms their home, dwindles their energy bills to nothing and offers them a sense, each day, of their belonging among nature.

The Westbrooks’ two-story home in Fairview, Texas, has become a pilgrimage of sorts for those contemplating solar design and power in this oil-rich state that also leads the nation in renewable energy.

More than 2,500 people have shown up at the Westbrook home over the years for tours and advice. Living in accordance with the sun is incredibly logical, Elena said, and allows for a deep connection with the land.

“Our attitude toward the plants out here, and the life, has been one of respectful interdependence,” Elena said on the eve of the autumnal equinox.

In 1993, the Westbrooks, married for three years then, bought the land to construct what they call a radically efficient home. Both were around 30 years old and working technical jobs. Elena conducted site assessments for an environmental consulting firm. Paul was a project engineer at Texas Instruments, the global semiconductor company headquartered in Dallas.

Their land search involved a lengthy list of requirements. “Paul was Mr. Efficiency from the beginning,” Elena said. Paul is enthusiastic and frugal by nature. He drives a 2007 Prius, which gets more than 50 miles to the gallon. “Why would I junk a perfectly functional car to get the latest and greatest,” he said.

The Westbrooks decided the house would have to face north or south, and be surrounded by evergreen trees at least on the north and west walls. They wanted a home that, on winter solstice, would be flushed with sun on its south wall.

And soil was important. Elena had a soil map for Collin County, where they were looking to build, at her office. They wanted to avoid clay, which permeated much of the area. They pinpointed a lot with eddy gravelly loam, a chalky limestone soil, that would keep the foundation of the house secure, unlike the surrounding clay.

Their screening process took three years. The day the couple signed the paperwork for a 2.2 acre lot, Elena found out she was pregnant with their daughter.

The 2,713 square-foot house was completed in September 1996 and continues to evolve and prove its value. The design used passive solar orientation and structural methods and equipment to reduce the environmental impact and energy demands of the house. The home was built with insulated panels and a reflective metal roof. There is also a geothermal heat pump, an energy recovery ventilator and a solar water heater.

The Westbrooks estimate they spent about $13,000 more on efficiency measures than if they were to build a conventional home. As Texas’ utility rates have increased, so have their monthly savings. Paul calculates that the home’s efficiency has saved them $44,000 over the last 29 years and uses 75 percent less energy than other homes its size.

Shade and Sun

Forested red oaks and red bud trees shade their home from the strong Texas sun and offer them colorful scenery throughout the year as the leaves turn. Instead of paintings on the wall, they opted for large windows showcasing the foliage.

“Nature becomes the canvas,” Paul said. “The design is to draw your eye toward nature, not toward some human choice inside.”

They trim the native trees when needed but allow for leaf litter and fallen branches to draw coyotes, armadillos and road runners to their wooded property.

The Westbrooks were precise. They placed the walls, windows and roof overhangs to eliminate direct sunlight in the summer while still capturing a considerable amount of heat from the sun in the winter.

They used structural insulated panels to create the air-tight walls and roof of the house, instead of traditional “stick” framing, pieces of wood held together by studs. Each panel, manufactured in 24 x 80 foot slabs, has a foam core with wood panels glued to each side, looking a bit like an oversized ice cream sandwich. Paul sent the specifications of the house to the now-defunct Arlington manufacturer Korwall Industries, which pre-cut the windows, door openings, light switches and outlets in the panels.

The Westbrooks chose a galvalume steel roof. It cost twice as much as an asphalt one but is rated as class 4 hail resistant, the strongest on the market. As a result, the Westbrook’s homeowner’s insurance was discounted by 25 percent. Over the years, the insurance savings have paid for the roof, which will likely outlive him, Paul said.

The couple calculated that the house cost $85 per square foot. Their efficiency tailoring added $90 a month to their mortgage payment in the 1990s but it also cut their utility bill. In their first month in the home, their energy costs were $140 less than homes of a similar size, according to Paul.

Instead of a standard heat pump that relies on outside air as a heat sink or source, the Westbrooks engineered a ground source heat pump. It relies on four 220-foot underground shafts that circulate fluid, in a closed loop, heated or cooled by the temperature of the earth.

The shafts are made up of three-quarter-inch polybutylene tubes that were slid beneath the foundation of the house and snaked into a field on their property. The tubes were treated with bentonite clay, a natural, absorbent clay, commonly used to seal ponds. The geothermal pump has worked without a hitch and there’s still 26 years left in the system’s 55-year warranty, Paul said.

“We stay in great comfort here,” Paul said to a September tour group. “Since heating and cooling is the biggest expense in all of your energy bills, that leads to needing a very small solar system.”

In December 2012, the Westbrooks added a 3.3 kilowatt solar array to the roof and in 2014 installed two additional solar panels, giving them a total capacity of 3.7 kilowatts. They connected their solar system to the electric grid using a net-metering agreement with Grayson Collin Electric Cooperative and they pay just the monthly base connecting fee, which in recent years has jumped from $25 to $40, Paul said.

The Westbrook’s system is smaller than most rooftop solar systems because the home’s efficiency measures reduce their energy use. The Westbrooks also added a 10.1 kilowatt hour battery system some months after they, like millions of Texans, lost power in Winter Storm Uri in 2021. Despite the family’s solar panels producing energy for the grid once the sun came back out, they still had no electricity in their house. It pushed Paul to invest in a battery and high-speed transfer switch. It allowed the Westbrooks to set up a microgrid to switch to in milliseconds in case the power goes out.

Clean Energy Tours

The Westbrooks typically run tours once a year for the American Solar Energy Society’s National Solar Home Tour. This year, the couple also opened the doors to 45 people for Sun Day, a day meant to celebrate clean energy. Visitors asked about getting rooftop solar ahead of the federal tax credits expiring in December. In anticipation of these questions, Paul said, he had already phoned a few local install companies, who were largely booked through the end of the year.

The Westbrooks handed visitors a printed timeline of the impending deadlines entitled: “Tax credits and procrastination don’t mix (but even if you do miss them, these upgrades more than pay for themselves over time, saving you money and a more sustainable and healthier future)!”

Families like the Westbrooks have been part of a pioneering group in Texas, looking to offset their electricity consumption with solar energy. While Texas has become the nation’s leader in utility-scale solar in recent years, it’s fourth in rooftop solar. The percentage of Texas homes powered with rooftop solar is less than 4 percent, according to a September report from the Solar Energy Industries Association. The leader in home solar is California, where more than 20 percent of homes have installed rooftop solar panels.

When there are a few cloudy days in a row, the Westbrooks turn on their water heater. Otherwise, a majority of their hot water comes from a pair of flat plate collectors, a device on their roof that harvests heat from the sun, and a closed loop heat exchanger. A mix of synthetic liquid and water circulates in the loop to the collectors on the roof. The 85-gallon storage tank can reach up to 160 degrees at the end of the sunny day and can stay that hot for a few days.

Because of the insulation, the Westbrook’s home can go two months every spring and fall without turning on heating or cooling. The first full year the couple lived in the house in 1997, they didn’t turn either on for three months. When Memorial Day weekend came, they decided to turn on their air conditioning and found the heat pump frozen from lack of use. It was replaced under warranty but a technician advised them to run the system for 15 minutes a few times a month to keep the seals lubricated.

“We were so efficient that we killed our pump before it was a year old,” Paul said to a tour group of a half dozen people.

Cascading Effect

Over the years, some of Paul’s former colleagues at Texas Instruments have toured the house, including a firm’s vice president, he said. She asked if these kinds of savings could be applied at a semiconductor facility the company planned to build. And if so, how much? After a few months of work, Paul had an answer.

“I’m pretty sure we get 30 percent savings with no capital cost addition, just using the integrative design,” he told the vice president.

“I suspected as much,” he remembers she said.

The vice president then encouraged a senior vice president of manufacturing to tour the Westbrook home. After an hour and a half tour, Paul remembers, the senior vice president asked what needed to happen to make this a possibility at Texas Instruments.

Money, support from management and a charette, a meeting akin to a high-powered hack-a-thon but focused on engineering and design, Paul told him. That meeting happened in 2003 at the company’s headquarters in Dallas with more than 30 employees and a dozen experts. “It was the three most fun days of my entire 33 years of TI,” Paul said. “The energy, the excitement in that room—the sense of possibilities.”

One month later, the company announced it was building a new, more efficient manufacturing facility in Richardson. When it opened in 2009, it was the first LEED Gold semiconductor factory in the world and Paul said it operated 42 percent more efficiently than any factory the company had built before.

“This house has saved way more energy than just this house has saved,” Paul said. “That kind of cascading effect—it’s pretty exciting.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6727-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 05:19:29.138277

More Energy Storage For Wind & Solar Power In a press statement, Sizable Energy board member Bruce Leak drew the connection between pumped storage and renewable energy.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

This year’s sharp U-turn in federal energy policy is a head-scratcher for any number of reasons. Wind and solar are out, but other renewables are in. For example, hydropower made the list of favored resources, which means that pumped hydropower systems are on the table, too. On the down side, traditional pumped hydro systems are massive, expensive pieces of infrastructure with limited opportunities for siting. However, solutions are emerging….

In The US, Pumped Hydropower Is The Hero Of Energy Storage

Pumped hydropower means just what it says. Water is pumped from a low-lying river or reservoir, into a reservoir located at a higher elevation. When electricity is needed, gravity does all the the heavy lifting. The water flows downhill to a generating station, where it runs turbines to produce electricity.

Pumped storage systems predate the renewable energy transition, but they are an ideal match for today’s utility-scale wind and solar farms. For all the improvements in battery-type energy storage systems and new long-duration storage systems, pumped hydro still accounts for about 95% of the bulk-quantity, long-duration energy storage capacity in the US.

During periods when electricity demand is low but the sun is shining and/or the wind is blowing, the excess capacity from wind turbines and solar panels can be put to work at a pumped hydropower facility. If electricity is needed at night-time or during periods of slack wind, the pumped hydro system can be called into play.

A New Model For Pumped Hydro Energy Storage

The US does offer some opportunities for constructing new pumped hydro facilities, but then the cost factor kicks in. The long construction timeline is another inhibiting factor.

Alternative pathways are beginning to emerge. A Texas startup, for example, is repurposing old oil wells for pumped storage. Other solutions involve deploying water pressure in the ocean.

The latest example to cross the CleanTechnica radar comes from the Italian startup Sizable Energy. “Sizable Energy’s patented offshore pumped hydro system stores energy by pumping saturated sea salt brine (heavier than seawater) from the seabed to a surface reservoir, leveraging the depth of the ocean for efficient energy storage,” Sizable explains.

The company’s website is a little thin on detail, except to note that the system is fairly straightforward and can be assembled through local supply chains. The lower reservoir is fixed to the ocean floor and the upper reservoir floats on the surface, with a connecting pipe in between. Reversible pumps move the saturated brine from one reservoir to another.

Sizable has already passed the system through tank tests, followed by trials at sea. The next step is a pilot-scale facility, already underway off the coast of Reggio Calabria, Italy. “This pilot will validate all key floating components, demonstrate the full-scale assembly and deployment process, setting the stage for a multi-MWh demonstration plant in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Italy,” Sizable notes.

The company does not intend to let the grass grow beneath its feet. “With this milestone approaching, the company is preparing for commercial project development in 2026 across multiple global sites, in partnership with local manufacturers, governments, and energy providers,” the company added.

More Energy Storage For Wind & Solar Power

In a press statement, Sizable Energy board member Bruce Leak drew the connection between pumped storage and renewable energy. “As a society, we’ve proven that wind and solar can deliver the cheapest electrons. Now we urgently need a long duration energy storage solution that can be economically deployed at massive scale,” said Leak, who is also a partner in the California-based energy transition investment firm Playground Global.

“Ocean depth is a practically unlimited resource, and Sizable Energy is leveraging it to deliver long-duration energy storage at a fraction of the cost of batteries,” Leak added. “Their gravity-based approach is the clear path to enabling energy abundance.”

Heads Explode As Pumped Storage Meets Marine Energy

Leak’s firm was the lead investor in a new $8 million funding round aimed at taking the Sizable Energy solution to market. Energy-thirsty coastal cities would be a good place to start. Utility-scale solar farms are difficult to wedge into crowded coastal regions, but, the booming global offshore wind industry provides an alternative source of clean kilowatts.

Except, of course, here in the US. Upon taking office earlier this year, US President Donald Trump made good on his oft-repeated promise to dismantle the US offshore wind industry. Though not a complete setback, the war against offshore wind has put a crimp in the renewable energy aspirations of coastal communities.

Still, a new Wood Mackenzie report indicates that the domestic offshore wind industry has enough wind in its sails, so to speak, to sustain itself for several years. By then perhaps federal energy policy will take another tack, smoothing the way for offshore energy storage solutions to pair up with the copious offshore wind resources of the US.

Another offshore angle to consider is the emerging marine energy industry, meaning devices that harvest kinetic energy from waves, tides, and currents. The technology challenges are formidable and scale-up is years away, so marine energy is not necessarily a near term solution. In an interesting twist, though, marine energy falls into the category of renewable energy resources protected by the “American Energy Dominance” policy, alongside biomass and geothermal energy as well as hydropower.

Marine energy was not specifically named by the White House when the new policy launched in January. However, since then the Energy Department has indicated that marine energy fits the reliable, 24/7 power generation standard described by “American Energy Dominance.”

As for why the new policy doesn’t recognize that modern battery systems and advanced grid management tools that provide wind and solar with the same level of reliability as other renewables, that’s a good question. By way of explanation, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has suggested that energy storage is not even a thing that exists.

BOEM held six auctions that carved out over 30 offshore wind lease areas amounting to millions of acres of seafloor.
Wilson, the Dartmouth professor, said the effort to launch U.S. offshore wind provides lessons about the country’s ability to build huge, modern infrastructure of any kind.","Each year, the Sweeney Center for Public Policy at Rowan University in New Jersey hosts a conference on the state’s current and future energy landscape. In 2023 and 2024, the gatherings focused heavily on the rapidly accelerating development of offshore wind, which state officials then predicted would power some 2.5 million homes — about two-thirds of the state’s total housing units — by 2030. At this year’s event, however, the industry was barely mentioned, and when it was, its one-time advocates were subdued and almost eulogistic.

Tim Sullivan, the head of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which had been closely involved with the state’s efforts to develop offshore wind, sounded wistful. “I remain optimistic and confident that it gets done sometime in our lifetime,” he told the conference.

Optimism about the future of U.S. offshore wind has collapsed since President Trump, a vehement critic of the industry, returned to office in January. In the ensuing nine months, his administration has accelerated the end of federal tax credits for wind development, imposed tariffs on turbines and other needed parts, and eliminated funds for building onshore port facilities for servicing wind farms.

Analysts say the administration’s policies will lead to $114 billion in offshore wind investments being canceled or delayed.

This has had a devastating effect on offshore wind, especially on the East Coast, where just two years ago some 30 utility-scale wind farm lease areas, spread across the continental shelf waters from Maine to South Carolina, were in the permitting and planning stages of development. According to a July 2024 report by the American Clean Power Association, investment in U.S. offshore wind projects was predicted to hit $65 billion by 2030. By 2050, the report said, the country could be generating 86,000 megawatts of offshore-wind-generated electricity, enough to power roughly 40 million homes.

But in an April report, the market research firm BloombergNEF forecast a 56 percent decrease in offshore wind development by 2035 compared to its prediction the previous year. This reduction will delay or cancel some $114 billion in offshore wind investments, according to the report.

What remains of American offshore wind activity today are just seven farms off the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coasts. The country’s first wind farm to be finished was a small, five-turbine array off Rhode Island’s Block Island, which became fully operational in 2016. The U.S.’s first utility-scale farm, South Fork, came online just two years ago; it is located off Long Island, New York, and consists of 12 turbines capable of powering up to 70,000 homes.

The remaining five farms are still under construction. Massachusetts’ Vineyard Wind, located about 15 miles off the coast off Martha’s Vineyard, is the furthest along; about half of the project’s planned 62 turbines have been installed and are sending power to the grid. Connecticut and Rhode Island’s shared farm, Revolution Wind, has installed about 70 percent of its planned 65 turbines. New York’s Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind, located off western and eastern Long Island, respectively, have begun preparing the seabed for turbine and transmission cable installation. Further south, the 176-turbine Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, located about 25 miles outside the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, is expected to begin sending power to the state’s grid early next year.

Together, and running at full capacity, these seven farms should be able to power 2.59 million homes. That’s a substantial achievement for a country that had no offshore wind a decade ago. But it is a far cry from the Biden Administration’s goal of 10 million homes by 2030.

Opposing wind power of all kinds has been a cornerstone of President Trump’s domestic energy policy. On the first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order temporarily withdrawing “all areas on the outer continental shelf from offshore wind leasing.” The order also required a review of the federal government’s leasing and permitting processes for wind projects.

The Trump administration has imposed a 50 percent tariff on wind turbine parts, most of which are made in Europe and China.

Following Trump’s order, the myriad federal agencies with a hand in regulating offshore wind moved quickly. In March, the EPA revoked the air quality permit for Atlantic Shores, a partnership between the oil giant Shell and the renewable energy company EDF Group, which was planning a project off the southern New Jersey coast that could have had up to 200 turbines. The EPA’s action was enough for Atlantic Shores to pull the plug on the whole endeavor. In a statement to E&E News following the project’s cancellation, a spokesperson for Shell said the company “will not lead new offshore wind developments.” And, just this week, another major oil company, BP, and its partner Jera Nex announced that they were pausing its only planned U.S. wind farm, Beacon, located off the Massachusetts coast.

In April, the Interior Department had issued a stop-work order to Empire Wind, the 54-turbine project in the early stages of development off Long Island, New York. Other than an almost entirely redacted 36-page draft analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, presumably about Empire Wind’s impact on fisheries, no other information on the cause of the order was provided. Another stop order came in August, this time to Revolution Wind, the nearly completed 65-turbine farm located off the coasts of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. This time, the issuing agency was the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which cited concerns about Revolution’s impact on national security. Other than the two-page order itself, BOEM provided no documentation justifying the decision.

After direct negotiations between New York’s governor and top Trump administration officials, Empire Wind was allowed to resume construction in May. Revolution Wind was able to restart in September following an injunction issued by a federal judge. But significant economic damage was done. According to Kris Ohleth, director of the research group Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, the stop-work orders led to “several hundred people a day who are no longer working” and weekly losses for the companies that amounted to $20-30 million. Offshore wind developers right now “are essentially riding it out by laying off staff and going back to skeleton crews,” she said.

Under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the budget package passed by Congress in July, Biden-era federal tax credits for wind and solar developers, which would have expired no earlier than 2032, will now end in July 2026.This drastically shortened deadline spelled the end for the dozens of proposed offshore wind projects that were still in the planning stages, because, without the tax credits, they would be too expensive to build and maintain. To further jack up costs, the administration imposed a 50 percent tariff on wind turbine parts and components, most of which are produced in Europe and China.

Offshore wind development had already faced intense opposition from coastal communities and the fishing industry.

In addition to tax credits, the Biden Administration had made a massive investment in the onshore infrastructure to service the wind farms. Thirteen port projects were being built on both U.S. coasts, most of which were in the Northeast. The facilities would have served as marshalling grounds for the turbines’ massive towers, blades, and engines before being loaded onto specially built transport ships. Other sites would have manufactured some of the parts needed to construct and service the turbines, transmission stations, and electrical cables.

But, in August, Sean Duffy, the secretary of the Department of Transportation, canceled $679 million in funding for offshore wind, $177 million of which was designated for port development. The money would instead be redirected to ship building. “Wasteful, wind projects are using resources that could otherwise go towards revitalizing America’s maritime industry,” Duffy said.

No onshore location is at more risk than New Bedford, Massachusetts, where the largest commercial fishing port in the U.S. has been steadily transforming over the past decade into an offshore wind marshalling and manufacturing hub. Expansion plans for New Bedford have been scrapped or are on hold. “This was going to be a place that provided a substantial amount of jobs for a part of New England that is economically challenged,” said Elizabeth Wilson, a professor at Dartmouth College who studies the evolution of U.S. offshore wind energy. “You have all of these manufacturing facilities that were planned but aren’t happening, so all of those jobs no longer exist.”

To be sure, the U.S. offshore wind industry was already facing mounting challenges before Trump returned to office this year.

During the Biden years, offshore wind development was pushed along at breakneck speed. BOEM held six auctions that carved out over 30 offshore wind lease areas amounting to millions of acres of seafloor. In turn, states courted the streams of developers who had purchased the leases and needed to connect their farms to onshore transmission stations. In the case of some projects, seabed surveying — which uses sonar that could be loud enough to harm marine species, especially whales and dolphins — was conducted before environmental impact statements were done.

This ignited intense opposition from coastal communities and the fishing industry. Commercial fishermen argued that large swaths of their lucrative grounds would become off-limits due to habitat destruction and the risk of fishing gear being lost or damaged from snagging on transmission cables or other infrastructure. Some scientists and environmentalists, who otherwise supported clean energy, raised concerns about the cumulative impacts of thousands of huge, noisy turbines operating in the middle of the migration routes of critical marine and avian species.

“Demand for electricity is growing nationally, driven by data centers that power the digital economy,” says a grid operator.

Most critically, though, the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine splintered the global supply chain, hiking the prices of many of the components needed for offshore wind development. The manufacturers were the first to back out of the U.S. market — in 2023, Siemens Gamesa scrapped plans to build turbine blades in Virginia, while turbine engine manufacturer Vestas failed to establish a facility at a New Jersey port that would have assembled nacelles — engines — for turbines. And, in January, the Italy-based cable manufacturer Prysmian informed Massachusetts that it wouldn’t be moving forward with plans to repurpose a plant that once housed a coal-fired power generator into an offshore wind transmission cable factory.

The most significant blow came in New Jersey in 2023, when the Danish developer Ørsted canceled two massive projects off the state’s southern coast. Rather than endure the increasingly turbulent market conditions and a relentless campaign from opposition groups, Ørsted wrote off $4 billion in losses and focused on its smaller New York projects, Revolution and Sunrise Winds. After Atlantic Shores pulled the plug on its farm earlier this year, New Jersey’s offshore wind portfolio was reduced to zero.

The sinking fate of the U.S. offshore wind industry comes at an inflection point for energy producers and providers on the East Coast and elsewhere in the country.

At the Rowan University conference, Asim Haque, a senior vice president at PJM Interconnected, the Northeast U.S.’s grid operator and the largest in the country, noted that, after years of procuring energy supply far above projected demand, PJM just barely managed to secure the capacity it predicts it will need for 2026-27.

This, Haque said, is due to a confluence of factors. “Demand for electricity is growing nationally, driven by data centers that power the digital economy and the development of artificial intelligence,” he said in an interview. At the same time, Haque added, plants that generated power from fossil fuels or nuclear closed because they had either reached the end of the life cycle or were prematurely shuttered by state governments pushing to transition to renewable sources.

Many of the states in PJM’s footprint are a part of a regional power sharing agreement, which has allowed certain ones, like New Jersey, long unable to produce enough of the electricity it needs on its own, to buy cheap power from neighboring states with energy surpluses. (In 2024, the state imported more than 35 percent of its power.) Those days appear over. With the huge surge in demand, Haque said, states are keeping much more of their energy for themselves. High demand and limited supply, of course, equal rate hikes.

“Our current level of political and regulatory volatility does not support large projects that take a long time to build,” an expert says.

Ultimately, Haque’s message, as well as those of the other speakers at the Rowan conference, emphasized the need for an all-of-the-above approach to energy — a point that would have been anathema in previous years, when expectations for offshore wind and other renewable sources were high . “These policy swings over the last four or five years, for a grid operator that has to actually make sure that an electron is generated and delivered in real-time across a many-million-mile transmission system [that’s] trying to serve 67 million consumers — it’s very tough,” he said.

Wilson, the Dartmouth professor, said the effort to launch U.S. offshore wind provides lessons about the country’s ability to build huge, modern infrastructure of any kind.

“Our current level of political and regulatory volatility does not support large projects that take a long time to build and cost billions of dollars,” Wilson said. “Having a policy system that changes day-to-day doesn’t allow you to develop and invest in something that takes a decade to build.”

In the meantime, zero carbon energy advocates are facing a tough reality. “PJM doesn’t pick and choose its resource mix,” Haque said of his company. “We operate the grid based on what we’ve got.”",https://yale-threesixty.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/South-Fork-Wind_Getty-HEADER.jpg?w=1200&q=60&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1761202052&s=7ebf90f18bed3f4c675b5690f52dcd67,N,,2025-10-23 05:19:37.185079

USC announced the collaboration in a September press release that said the joint venture provides access to rental vehicles for students, faculty and staff – without having to leave campus.

Zipcar, a subsidiary of car rental agency Avis Budget Group, allows users to reserve an electric or a hybrid vehicle, which are a combination of electric and gas-engine vehicles.

And, unlike with most other car rentals, the driver only has to be 18 years old, not 21. But drivers aged 18 to 24 must pay a “young drivers fee” of 75-cents an hour or $6 per day.

Users also must pay a monthly or annual membership fee along with the rental fees – which are charged by the minute, hour and day – as well as a general reservation fee. Gas, maintenance, parking and insurance options are included in reservations, Zipcar said on its website. USC is waiving the annual or monthly fee for the first year for USC users.

The rental company said its service helps combat climate change, citing multiple sources on its website to provide statistical data.

Additional data was collected in a Zipcar 2024 survey of 5,922 respondents.

Zipcar’s survey says the service has reduced 15 billion pounds of its carbon footprint since 2016. It also shows that 76% of its members have reduced car usage.

Zipcar’s current options at each of its stations at USC include only hybrid vehicles, which are believed to be environment-friendly compared to traditional cars.

The university also is focused on the accessibility of Zipcar vehicles for use on and around campus.

Dennessee Daring, transportation manager for USC Parking and Transportation Services, said the nature of Zipcar makes it an attractive service for the university.

“I think what definitely sets (Zipcar) apart is the convenience,” Daring said. “… You’re just able to go see the vehicle, sign up and go ahead and ride it.”

Daring said Zipcar data showed a good rate of use for the vehicles at the university as the service debuts on campus.

There are currently five Zipcar stations at USC: the Russell House University Union, the 650 Lincoln building, the Capstone House, Campus Village and the Pendleton Street Garage. There are 10 cars in total.

Daring said the university and Zipcar already are planning to expand the service.

“Our goal is definitely to bring as many cars as we can,” Daring said. “What would definitely drive that is how the vehicles are being utilized, and how it is being maximized.”

The Zipcar proposal was brought to the university by USC Student Government.

“Students without personal vehicles on campus will now have convenient access to destinations across the city for shopping, dining, internships and other needs,” USC student body president Courtney Tkacs told university officials.",https://carolinanewsandreporter.cic.sc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-CNlogo2017-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-23 02:58:04.309686

Adjusted earnings were 50 cents a share in the period, down 31% from a year earlier, the company said Wednesday in a statement.

Analysts had expected 54 cents on average in estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue of $28.1 billion beat expectations.

The results show that the electric-vehicle manufacturer isn’t immune to the rising costs that have buffeted the nation’s auto industry all year as President Trump radically overhauls policy. Tesla’s operating expenses soared 50% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, while the company expects about $400 million in U.S. tariff repercussions.

Chief Executive Elon Musk is promising a future built around artificial intelligence, humanoid robots and self-driving technology — points he underlined on Tesla’s conference call with investors. Investors have largely bought into Musk’s vision, driving the shares up 8.7% this year through Wednesday’s close.

But there’s uncertainty about the timeline to develop these businesses and the costs associated with building them out. Tesla’s central business of selling vehicles is also facing renewed scrutiny as competition intensifies and U.S. fiscal incentives are phased out.

“We’re entering a time where there’s a lot of questions around near-term and intermediate-term earnings growth trajectory for Tesla,” said Garrett Nelson, senior equity research analyst at CFRA.

Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja acknowledged that competition and tariffs represent obstacles for the company.

The shares dropped 4.1% in extended trading in New York. The stock extended declines after Musk concluded his introductory remarks on Tesla’s conference call, signaling investors’ disappointment that the company offered only limited details.

“The market’s realizing Tesla trades like an AI platform, but reports like a carmaker,” said Haris Khurshid, chief investment officer at Karobaar Capital. Dec Mullarkey, a managing director at SLC Management, said “there is not much here to inspire investors.”

Tesla reiterated language from the previous quarter that it’s “difficult to measure” how shifting global trade and fiscal policies would affect its businesses and operations. The company sees results hinging on the broader economic environment as well as its speed in accelerating autonomy efforts and ramping up production for key products.

Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect Tesla to report a second straight year of declining vehicle deliveries.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported record third-quarter sales as customers rushed to take advantage of a $7,500 U.S. tax credit for EV purchases that expired Sept. 30, delivering a temporary boost to the company’s core automotive business.

On Wednesday, Tesla reported $417 million in revenue from regulatory credits it receives from other automakers that exceed emissions standards — only slightly below the previous quarter’s amount. Policy changes under the Trump administration have reduced demand for the credits. Tesla has said it anticipated a decline in that business.

Musk expects Tesla’s robotaxi business, which launched in Austin, Texas, in June, to expand to as many as 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year if the company receives the necessary approvals. He also said the company would remove most human safety operators from robotaxis in Austin later this year. It’s unclear how many of the vehicles are currently operating there after the EV maker launched with about 10 to 20 vehicles.

Tesla also operates a ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area that is not fully autonomous and is more akin to Uber. It has test permits for Arizona and Nevada.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) rival BYD Co(HK: ) fell 0.9% in Hong Kong trade, while NIO Inc (HK: ), Li Auto Inc (HK: ), Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology Co Ltd (HK: ) and Xpeng Inc (HK: ) fell between 0.9% and 2.5%.

Local stocks tracked a near 4% aftermarket decline in Tesla, after the company’s Q3 profit missed expectations despite it logging record-high revenue.

Tesla’s bumper revenue– which came on the back of record vehicle deliveries– was largely offset by increased spending on trade tariffs and artificial intelligence development.

Tesla also flagged much higher capital expenditures in 2026, as it attempts to pivot away from its lagging EV business and further into AI and robotics.

While Tesla’s vehicle deliveries surged in Q3, this was largely due to the quarter coinciding with the end of U.S. EV tax credits, which pulled a large number of sales into Q3 as consumers rushed to take advantage of the incentive.

The company is grappling with slowing sales outside the U.S., especially in Europe and Asia, where it faces stiff competition from Chinese EV makers.

But increased competition and sluggish sales could elicit more price cuts and cheaper models from Tesla– a development that could bode poorly for Chinese EV companies. The company had earlier in October released cheaper versions of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles.

China’s EV market is still embroiled in a bitter price war, as several EV makers, and new entrants such as Xiaomi Corp (HK: ), rush to capture a bigger share of the world’s biggest EV market.

IRVING, TEXAS — Caterpillar Inc. announced that Indiana will be among the first states to receive funding from its five-year, $100 million workforce pledge, and has committed up to $5 million to training and upskilling efforts across the state.

The pledge, announced as part of the company’s Centennial celebration, aims to grow interest in advanced manufacturing careers and prepare U.S workers for the future, unlocking quality jobs and industry-wide innovation.

“The future workforce will need skills for what comes next,” said Caterpillar Chief Human Resources Officer Christy Pambianchi. “We have our experts working on innovative training and resources to help skill and inform the next generation on how to navigate the worksite of tomorrow, and we’re excited to be starting here in Indiana to enable U.S. workers to enter high-quality jobs in the American manufacturing industry.”

Caterpillar will announce future workforce pledges in other states soon.

“Indiana is proud to be among the first states selected for Caterpillar’s workforce investment, which is a testament to our pro-growth policies, world-class workforce, and reputation as one of the best states in America to start and grow a business,” said Gov. Mike Braun. “Caterpillar’s continued commitment to Indiana demonstrates the strength of our business climate and our shared vision for the future of American manufacturing. We look forward to working together to prepare more Hoosiers for the high-quality careers of tomorrow.”

Caterpillar made the future workforce announcement at the company’s large engine facility in Lafayette, which recently announced a $725 million capital expansion – one of the largest single manufacturing investments in the company’s global history – to greatly increase engine production and help meet the nation’s growing power needs.

“The demand for energy is increasing like never before,” said Caterpillar Energy & Transportation Group President Jason Kaiser. “Many of the engines manufactured here in Lafayette will support power generation customers by providing reliable power – keeping operations running during outages and helping meet the growing energy needs driven by AI, data centers and other critical infrastructure across America and around the world.”

One of America’s oldest manufacturers, Caterpillar is a part of the country’s infrastructure, with more than 65 primary locations across 25 states and independent dealers from coast to coast. As a net exporter, Caterpillar workers in the United States build products that are shipped around the world, growing U.S. exports by 75% since 2016.

U.S. District Court Judge Marsha Pechman of the Western District of Washington granted a preliminary injunction blocking the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from terminating the funding and impeding Washington’s access to the awards.

“Allowing a change in an administration to upend multi-year grants would cause unnecessary chaos across the vast world of government-supported endeavors undertaken by states, universities, non-profits, and others,” Pechman wrote in her order.

Congress has repeatedly recognized the importance of climate resilience, frequently directing funds to federal agencies like NOAA to help states and other entities prepare for the effects of climate change.

In 2022 and 2023, NOAA announced two climate resilience-focused funding opportunities that emphasized equity, inclusion, and engagement with historically underrepresented communities that are disproportionately exposed to and affected by the effects of climate change. Washington was awarded funding through both programs. But on May 5, NOAA abruptly terminated both awards, saying the programs were inconsistent with the president’s new priorities.

The judge said the state made compelling arguments that the agency’s action was likely unlawful.

“Washingtonians are already contending with the devastating effects of climate change – including the deadly heatwave in 2021,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said. “We’re grateful for this win in court protecting congressionally authorized funds that will help communities on the frontlines of climate change.”

The funding terminations targeted the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges Tribal Steward Program, which was awarded approximately $9.3 million last year by NOAA to educate at least 2,130 post-secondary students in environmental science and natural resources degree programs in climate resilience. The other program targeted by the cuts was a $250,000 project led by the Department of Ecology aimed at reducing environmental and health disparities by supporting local efforts to address coastal hazards.

Profit fell 37 per cent to US$1.4 billion (S$1.8 billion) from a year earlier, below analysts’ forecast, even as revenue rose 12 per cent to US$28.1 billion.

The results show the EV manufacturer is not immune to the rising costs that have buffeted the nation’s auto industry all year as President Donald Trump radically overhauls policy.

Tesla’s operating expenses soared 50 per cent to US$3.4 billion in the quarter, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and other research and development projects.

Tesla expects about US$400 million of impact from US tariffs.

Chief executive officer Elon Musk is promising a future built around AI, humanoid robots and self-driving technology – points he underlined in Tesla’s conference call with investors. Investors have largely bought into his vision, driving the shares up 8.7 per cent so far in 2025 through their close in regular trading on Oct 22.

But the shares dropped 4.1 per cent in extended trading after the results’ announcement and Tesla’s conference call, signalling investors’ disappointment that the company offered only limited details on its outlook.

“The market’s realising Tesla trades like an AI platform but reports like a carmaker,” said Karobaar Capital chief investment officer Haris Khurshid. Mr Dec Mullarkey, a managing director at SLC Management, said “there is not much here to inspire investors”.

Tesla reiterated language from the previous quarter that it is “difficult to measure” how shifting global trade and fiscal policies would impact its businesses and operations.

It sees results hinging on the broader economic environment as well as its speed in accelerating autonomy efforts and ramping up production for key products.

Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect Tesla to report a second year in a row of declining vehicle deliveries.

Earlier in October, Tesla reported record third-quarter sales as customers rushed to take advantage of a US$7,500 US tax credit for EV purchases that expired on Sept 30, delivering a temporary boost to its core automotive business.

On Oct 22, Tesla reported US$417 million in revenue from regulatory credits it receives from other automakers that exceed emissions standards – only slightly below the previous quarter’s amount. Policy changes under the Trump administration have reduced demand for the credits. Tesla has said it anticipated a decline in that business.

Mr Musk expects Tesla’s robotaxi business, which launched in Austin in June, to expand to as many as 10 metropolitan areas by the end of the year if it receives approvals.

He also said the company would remove most human safety operators from robotaxis in Austin later in 2025.

(Reuters) -Tesla reported record third-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, driven by the highest quarterly sales of its electric vehicles as U.S. buyers rushed to lock in a key tax credit ahead of its expiry last month.

However, Tesla's profit failed to live up to analysts' expectations, in part due to tariff and research costs, as well as a drop in income from regulatory credits that are expected to continue to fade away with recent legislation passed by the Trump administration.

Tesla's $1.45 trillion valuation largely reflects investor bets on CEO Elon Musk's pivot to robotics and AI, but vehicle sales remain key to the financial stability of the company while those products are being developed. Shares of the Austin, Texas-based company were down 4% in extended trading.

Demand for Tesla's vehicles and those of its rivals is also expected to drop through the rest of the year without the tax credits that have been a key driver of EV sales. Tesla did not provide a full-year forecast.

""While we face near-term uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy, we are focused on long-term growth and value creation,"" the company said on Wednesday.

Apart from the removal of tax credits and the waning sales of regulatory credits that traditional automakers bought to make up for their polluting vehicles, Tesla is also grappling with tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on auto-parts imports, which Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said cost Tesla more than $400 million in the quarter.

The EV maker flagged rising expenses in multiple areas, also including a 50% rise in operating expenses driven by AI and other research and development projects, and an increase in stock-based compensation. On an earnings conference call, Taneja said capital expenditures would rise substantially in 2026.

""Tesla dished out just the right amount of good and bad news to both appease its fans while also providing enough evidence for its critics,"" Camelthorn Investments adviser Shawn Campbell told Reuters. ""This earnings report isn't going to change anyone's mind on Tesla.""

To combat a demand drop, Tesla introduced lower-cost ""Standard"" variants of Model Y and Model 3 vehicles earlier this month, stripping out a myriad of premium and basic features and lowering prices by about $5,000 to $5,500.

While Tesla hopes the cheaper variants will drive higher volumes, analysts warn the move will squeeze margins as thousands of dollars of cost cuts per vehicle may not fully compensate for lower selling prices.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/d8ef2c052e671899c5f36dacd4780f28,N,,2025-10-22 21:58:19.920255

She said that Georgia Power should be held accountable for its “immoral” actions.
A perceived lack of transparency in the PSC’s dealings with Georgia Power has been scrutinized more intensely recently after the commission approved six energy bill increases over two years.","Patty Durand, a former Democratic candidate for the Georgia Public Service Commission and a clean energy advocate, was arrested Tuesday for the alleged theft of a Georgia Power document containing trade secrets during a commission meeting earlier that day.

Georgia Capitol Police arrested Durand, who is a frequent critic of the PSC, on Tuesday before transferring her to Fulton County Jail. According to the arrest warrant, Durand “intentionally (took) a booklet containing confidential information owned by Georgia Power Company without permission.” Durand’s arrest was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Durand did not yet have an attorney listed as of Wednesday, according to the Fulton County Clerk’s Office. Attempts to reach Durand for a comment Wednesday were unsuccessful.

The arrest warrant alleges that Durand was captured on a video recording re-entering the PSC meeting room during a lunch break and walking past a desk containing a booklet labeled “Georgia Power Trade Secrets.”

Durand initially picked up the booklet and put it back. She then walked past a second desk, picked up a similar booklet, “flipped through the booklet briefly before placing the booklet into her purse and left the meeting room without returning,” according to the warrant.

This week’s PSC proceedings were held to consider a request from Georgia Power to add nearly 10,000 megawatts to the state’s power grid. About 60% of the energy requested would come from expanding or building new gas plants, while 40% would come from renewable energy.

Durand, who this year founded Georgians for Affordable Energy, a watchdog organization, claimed in her comments during a public hearing earlier Tuesday that Georgia Power is prioritizing profits for its five affiliated gas companies in building natural gas power plants instead of focusing more on solar panels and battery storage. She said that Georgia Power should be held accountable for its “immoral” actions.

“There is no court in the land that would allow that kind of corruption to go on, and I have no idea why the state of Georgia does,” Durand said.

She also criticized Georgia Power in a Sunday email newsletter for seeking approval for a plan that she estimates could cost customers over three times as much as the Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion project. Durand wrote that while Georgia Power’s filing shows about $15.7 billion for certified projects, a project cost summary table is “fully redacted.” Durand claimed that energy experts estimate those redacted costs to be “about $5-6 billion dollars, a huge number.”

Durand alleged the costs are redacted because the company doesn’t want the public to know “these costs are required to be paid by customers throughout construction.”

Jennifer Whitfield, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said in a statement that “the stakes are really high for Georgians right now and people feel desperate,” but denounced Durand’s alleged theft.

“While we do have serious concerns about Georgia Power’s use of trade secret, those concerns must be addressed through the proper, legal channels,” Whitfield said.

Sarah Brewerton-Palmer, a First Amendment and business law attorney and president of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, said in a phone interview that the incident underscores the need for the PSC and other governmental agencies to balance allowing companies to shield sensitive business information with ensuring adequate government transparency.

“Whenever information in the hands of the government is kept from the public, it raises a specter of suspicion, and this lack of transparency lets conspiracy theories fester and tends to feed a public perception of unfairness and background deals and all that sort of stuff, which is why we have transparency laws in the first place,” Brewerton-Palmer said.

A perceived lack of transparency in the PSC’s dealings with Georgia Power has been scrutinized more intensely recently after the commission approved six energy bill increases over two years. Groups like SELC and other organizations filed a motion seeking access to some data on cost and power generation from the public, according to a July report from the AJC. However, the PSC denied the motion, stating that it might reconsider the issue in the future.

Matthew Kent, a spokesperson for Georgia Power, said in a statement that confidential data is meant to protect customers’ interests and “ensure we deliver the best value to all customers.”

“Unauthorized disclosure risks harming both our company, the vendors and contractors with whom we do business, and the customers we serve,” he said.

The Georgia Republican Party quickly pounced on Durand’s arrest. Early voting is underway for a pair of commission seats that are on the ballot, and Georgia Republicans have been openly concerned that Democratic candidates Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson could flip two PSC seats in this year’s unique off-year election, where experts say that municipal elections could favor Democratic mobilization.

Josh McKoon, who chairs the state GOP, said in a statement that “there’s no leftist activist more involved in pushing the candidacies of the two Democrat candidates for PSC than Patty Durand” and that she built “her brand” by attacking the PSC.

“Georgia voters should take note of these illegal actions,” McKoon said in a statement. “The rhetoric of Patty Durand telegraphs the Democrats’ extreme plans for the PSC – plans that will lower our power supply and reliability and that will lead to higher prices for Georgia families.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-81/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/durand-at-psc-1021251761176822.jpg?h=974402e3&itok=O8A7rm6t,N,,2025-10-22 20:19:05.168496

This fall, Raleigh will become the first city in North Carolina – and one of only a few cities in the nation – to power its bus fleet with renewable natural gas created from its own wastewater.

Every day, 50 million gallons of wastewater are treated at the Neuse River Resource Recovery Facility. Thanks to new technology, that waste is now turned into renewable natural gas (RNG). It’s no small feat: this process generates enough RNG to power over 70 GoRaleigh buses every day. This process also cuts the City’s biosolids in half and produces a high-quality soil conditioner.

""This project proves that we don’t have to choose between protecting our planet and operating efficiently,” said Raleigh Water Director Whit Wheeler. “We’re taking something that used to be waste and turning it into clean energy that will fuel our city for years to come.”

The Bioenergy Recovery Project is a major step towards Raleigh’s goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. It also reflects more than a decade of collaboration between Raleigh Water, GoRaleigh, and the Office of Sustainability. It is a testament to how long-term collaboration can turn ambitious ideas into real progress.

Passenger cars and small trucks account for about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.","Artificial intelligence has caused concern for its tremendous consumption of water and power. But scientists are also experimenting with ways that AI can help people and businesses use energy more efficiently and pollute less.

Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world’s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities’ energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.

But when AI’s computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.

Experts say that if uses like these continue to grow, they could help offset the energy consumed by AI.

“I am pretty optimistic that while more and more AI use is going to continue to increase,” said Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia University Climate School, “we’re going to see our ability to process be much more efficient and as a result, the energy consumption won’t go up as much as some are predicting.”

Building efficiency: Maintenance, cooling

AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.

Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers’ arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker’s instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it’s not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.

For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.

AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.

Combined, these automations can reduce a building’s energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.

“That’s literally a super low-hanging fruit,” said Zoltan Nagy, professor of building services at Eindhoven University of Technology.

Finding energy- and cost-efficient times for EV charging

AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.

This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it’s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.

“Let’s say it’s a peak period when everybody’s got their air conditioning on, and I walk in my house and I plug in my car and I have it set up such that my car doesn’t start charging right away because it’s peak period time,” Abramson said.

In California, a pilot program shifted charging to times where there was more renewable energy available, and saved customers money.

AI can also help optimize how homeowners with solar panels store excess energy in batteries.

Reducing methane flaring from oil and gas operations

Boston-based Geminus AI uses deep learning and advanced reasoning to help oil and gas companies reduce methane flaring and venting, and reduce the amount of energy they use in extracting and refining.

Reducing methane emissions is among the fastest pathways to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

When pressure in oil and gas pipes builds up, some of the gas is released and burned to relieve the pressure, harming the planet and wasting money.

Geminus CEO Greg Fallon said they can monitor the network of wells and pipes and use AI-driven simulations to suggest changes to compressor and pump settings that eliminate the need for venting and flaring. Geminus does this in seconds. Traditionally it takes engineers about 36 hours to run simulations that make similar recommendations, Fallon added.

“As we scale this across the industry, there’s a massive opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Fallon said.

Finding geothermal hot spots

Salt Lake City-based geothermal energy startup Zanskar has built AI models to understand the Earth’s subsurface. It’s using that modeling to find overlooked geothermal hot spots and target drilling.

Geothermal creates electricity cleanly by making steam from the Earth’s natural heat and using it to spin a turbine. It’s one renewable energy the Trump administration favors.

Zanskar co-founders Carl Hoiland and Joel Edwards say they simulate and assess a huge number of possible subsurface scenarios to estimate where there are pockets of very hot water. From this, they pick optimal locations and drilling directions.

“AI is becoming the solution to its own energy problem,” Hoiland, the CEO, said. “It’s showing us a way to unlock resources that weren’t possible without it.”

Last year, Zanskar purchased an underperforming geothermal power plant in New Mexico. Their AI modeling successfully indicated there was an untapped geothermal reservoir that could repower the facility.

Next, Hoiland and Edwards focused on another site in Nevada, despite industry experts telling them it was too cold to support a utility-scale power plant. They drilled and announced their second geothermal discovery in September at that site.

Reducing traffic emissions

Google is using artificial intelligence and Google Maps data to identify traffic light adjustments that can reduce stop-and-go traffic to lower pollution. Passenger cars and small trucks account for about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.

Launched in 2023, Project Green Light is now in 20 cities on four continents. The most recent is Boston, which has notoriously bad traffic.

Each city gets AI-generated recommendations. City engineers determine which to implement. Google says Project Green Light can reduce stop-and-go traffic by up to 30%, which cuts emissions by 10% and improves air quality.

“We’re just scratching the surface of what AI can do,” said Juliet Rothenberg, Google’s product director of Earth and resilience AI.

— Jules Albert III

SLIDELL, LA, UNITED STATES, October 22, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Louisiana’s coastal environment presents unique challenges for roofing systems. High winds, tropical storms, and frequent hail events place constant stress on residential and commercial roofs across the state. The choice of roofing materials can determine how well a structure withstands these conditions. Advances in construction technology have produced materials specifically designed to resist wind uplift, impact damage, and long-term weathering common in Gulf Coast climates.

According to Jules Albert III, owner of Jaymar Construction LLC in Slidell, Louisiana, selecting roofing materials capable of withstanding Louisiana’s volatile weather requires careful consideration of both structure and environment.

“Wind and hail are two of the most destructive forces affecting roofs in this region,” Albert explained. “A properly engineered roofing system can reduce damage, lower maintenance costs, and extend service life.”

Understanding the Regional Risk

Louisiana’s location along the Gulf of Mexico places it in the path of annual tropical systems that bring high-speed winds and flying debris. Inland areas face additional hazards from hailstorms that can strike with little warning. These forces create repeated stress on roofing materials, fasteners, and underlying structures.

Wind-related damage typically occurs when uplift forces exceed the attachment strength between roofing materials and the deck. Once wind penetrates beneath the surface, sections can peel away rapidly. Hail damage, meanwhile, often goes unnoticed until leaks or structural weaknesses appear months later. Impact-resistant materials mitigate this risk by absorbing or deflecting force without fracturing.

Asphalt Shingles: Reinforced for Resilience

Asphalt shingles remain one of the most widely used roofing options across Louisiana. Modern manufacturing techniques have produced shingles capable of withstanding winds of 130 mph or higher, provided they are properly installed. Impact-resistant versions feature reinforced fiberglass mats and polymer-modified asphalt that provide greater flexibility and resistance to cracking under hail impact.

Sealant strips and enhanced nailing zones improve adhesion and hold strength, preventing wind uplift. Proper underlayment installation further enhances performance by creating a secondary moisture barrier. For cost-effective durability, Class 4 impact-rated shingles have become a preferred choice in areas prone to severe weather.

Metal Roofing Systems: Strength in Design

Metal roofing has gained popularity for its longevity and structural integrity. Interlocking panels provide a continuous surface that resists wind penetration. Standing seam designs, which conceal fasteners beneath raised seams, reduce opportunities for water intrusion and uplift.

Most metal roofing materials—whether steel, aluminum, or zinc-coated alloys—are engineered to meet or exceed wind-resistance standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Proper fastening patterns and edge details are critical to ensuring performance in high-wind zones.

When paired with impact-resistant coatings, metal roofs can withstand hail up to two inches in diameter without significant deformation. Their ability to shed rain quickly also minimizes the risk of water accumulation during heavy storms.

Tile and Slate Options: Weight and Wind Resistance

Clay, concrete, and slate tiles offer another layer of resilience through weight and density. Heavier roofing materials naturally resist uplift forces, but installation techniques are key to long-term performance. Mechanical fasteners, foam adhesives, and reinforced battens secure each tile against shifting or detachment.

While hail can chip or crack tiles under extreme impact, modern composites and synthetic alternatives provide the same aesthetic appeal with greater flexibility and fracture resistance. For coastal regions, tile roofing systems must also incorporate corrosion-resistant fasteners to withstand salt exposure.

Synthetic and Composite Roofing Materials

The roofing industry has seen significant innovation in composite materials that mimic traditional aesthetics while delivering enhanced durability. Polymer-based shingles, synthetic slate, and rubberized roofing systems combine flexibility with impact resistance. These products often carry high ratings for both wind and hail performance.

Their lightweight nature reduces structural load, while interlocking edges and adhesive bonding improve uplift resistance. For Louisiana’s fluctuating temperatures and humidity, composite roofing materials offer dimensional stability—resisting warping, cracking, or expansion that can occur in extreme climates.

Installation Standards and Fastening Systems

Material quality alone does not determine a roof’s ability to survive severe weather. Proper installation remains the most critical factor in wind and hail resistance. Nailing patterns, fastening systems, and underlayment integrity all contribute to overall structural strength.

Roofs in coastal parishes often require additional fasteners per square foot and specialized clips or straps that tie the roof deck to supporting trusses. Adherence to the International Building Code (IBC) and Louisiana State Uniform Construction Code ensures compliance with regional wind-speed requirements.

In addition, impact-resistant underlayment materials can prevent moisture intrusion if outer layers sustain damage. Sealants around penetrations such as vents, skylights, and chimneys reduce the likelihood of uplift and water infiltration.

Routine Inspection and Maintenance

Periodic inspection plays a critical role in maintaining roof performance. Even the most resilient materials can fail if minor issues go unaddressed. Checking for lifted edges, cracked sealant, or dented panels after major storms prevents long-term damage.

Regular maintenance also ensures that debris does not accumulate in valleys, gutters, or drainage paths, where trapped water can accelerate deterioration. Addressing small repairs promptly can significantly extend the service life of any roofing system.

Insurance and Long-Term Value

Wind- and hail-resistant roofing materials often qualify for insurance discounts due to their proven performance under extreme weather conditions. Many insurers recognize the reduced risk of claims associated with Class 4 impact-rated materials or high-wind certifications.

Although initial installation costs may vary, the long-term value lies in reduced repair frequency, lower insurance premiums, and increased property resilience. In Louisiana, where storm activity is a near-annual occurrence, that durability can make a measurable difference over time.

Building for the Gulf Coast Environment

Designing a roof for Louisiana’s climate means balancing strength, weight, and maintenance. Material selection should reflect both environmental conditions and building type. A combination of reinforced materials, precision installation, and consistent inspection creates a system capable of enduring decades of weather exposure.

Jules Albert III emphasized that the success of any roofing system depends on alignment between design, material, and execution. “Each roof must perform under the specific conditions it faces,” he said. “Building for the Gulf Coast means building for resilience.”

The lawsuit targets an executive action from July that gave 50 plants a two-year exemption from a Biden-era U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule that tightened restrictions on cancer-causing air toxics like ethylene oxide and chloroprene. After years of fierce grassroots advocacy from communities harmed by chemical plants, the EPA enacted the 2024 HON rule—Hazardous Organic NESHAP (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants)—and projected that it would reduce air pollution-related risks for communities living near these facilities by about 96 percent while cutting the industry’s emissions by more than 6,200 tons annually.

The plaintiffs—which include Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Concerned Citizens of St. John and RISE St. James—say President Donald Trump’s exemption is unlawful and will increase health risks for communities in Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Illinois and other states.

“For him to bring it back two more years, that means two more years of toxic pollution, two more years of us getting sick,” said Sharon Lavigne, founder and CEO of the grassroots Louisiana group RISE St. James and a leading environmental justice activist.

The goal of the lawsuit is both to protect the pollution restrictions in the HON rule and to show the Trump administration that it can’t make unilateral decisions to overturn progress won through the democratic process, said NRDC senior attorney Sarah Buckley.

“This exemption is standing in the way of really crucial health protections for 50 communities across the country,” Buckley said. “We can’t just let this abuse of power, to sweep these protections away with the stroke of a pen, go unchecked.”

The EPA declined to comment on ongoing litigation.

The proclamation gave exemptions to 50 out of 217 total facilities, most of them in the Gulf South: 17 out of the 78 such facilities in Texas and 18 of the 40 in Louisiana, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.

“The President used his lawful authority to grant these exemptions, which simply give facilities more time to abide by environmental standards,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in an emailed statement. “Contrary to the lies peddled by far-left, Climate activists, the facts remain: US air quality is among the best of industrialized countries and our framework for environmental protection remains the gold standard across the world.”

Nearly half of Americans are stuck with unhealthy levels of air pollution, and the trend is getting worse, according to the American Lung Association, especially in communities of color. The Trump administration is rapidly reversing environmental protections, particularly those focused on addressing the disproportionate burden faced by people of color and low-income communities.

Residents of Cancer Alley—an 85-mile stretch of Louisiana where the fossil fuel and petrochemical industry is heavily concentrated in Black and low-income neighborhoods—have been dealing with hazardous pollutants and high cancer rates for years.

Ethylene oxide, one of those pollutants, has been linked to brain and lung tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer, neurological disorders, miscarriages and reproductive and developmental harm. Chloroprene can increase risk of liver cancer, depress the central nervous system and damage kidneys and lungs.

Last year, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found levels of ethylene oxide more than 1,000 times higher than what’s considered safe across Cancer Alley.

Robert Taylor lives in Reserve, Louisiana, near two chemical facilities on the exemption list, in a predominantly Black community with high levels of both ethylene oxide and chloroprene pollution and with a cancer risk in the 99th percentile for the country, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.

Taylor—co-founder of Concerned Citizens of St. John—fought for the HON rule to protect frontline communities like his across the country. He hopes the lawsuit will reverse the Trump administration’s exemptions.

“It is outrageous that here now in the 21st century we live this horribly,” Taylor said. “We call this a free country, but these people can come here in our community, sit these horrible plants right in the middle of our communities, and poison and kill us.”

Trump’s proclamation hinged on a provision in the Clean Air Act that plaintiffs say was never used before this administration that allows the president to exempt a source from a pollution standard in the interest of national security or if the technology needed to implement the standard isn’t available.

The proclamation did not include any facility-specific analysis explaining how either of those prerequisites applied and the lawsuit argues that the requirements have not been met, given that air pollution control technology is widely available in the chemical manufacturing industry, and that in many cases, the 2024 rule would simply require facilities to increase use of technologies they were already using. The lawsuit argues that the proclamation “exceeds the President’s lawful authority.”

Typically, the government would have 60 days to respond to the complaint. But the government shutdown might lengthen the process, Buckley said.

For Lavigne, who has lost family and friends to cancer, this fight is personal.

“We have so many people being diagnosed with cancer, so many people that are dying of cancer, we have funerals just about every week because of the pollution,” Lavigne said.

She said she hopes the lawsuit will give her community respite.

“It’s heartbreaking to see my community die,” Lavigne said. “And it don’t have to be, if these politicians will stop bowing down to industry, … if people that we vote in office would think about our best interest and not their pockets.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1234853042-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 20:04:07.559360

The pilot will feature Last Energy’s PWR-5 reactor, which is a scaled down version of its commercial PWR-20 design.

In November 2024, the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents notified the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) that it had potential sites available at Texas A&M-RELLIS in Bryan for multiple companies to test and construct the next generation of nuclear reactors. In August, Last Energy’s 20 MWe PWR-20 was one of 11 projects selected for the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Reactor Pilot Program.

The 5-megawatt reactor will be built to initially demonstrate safe, low-power criticality and, then in later phases, the ability to generate electricity for the grid. Last Energy has secured a land lease at Texas A&M-RELLIS, procured a full core load of low-enriched uranium fuel, signed an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with the DOE and begun formal submissions.

Last Energy aims for its Texas A&M project to go critical, meaning the nuclear reactor will be a stable operation, by mid-2026, according to Last Energy’s Vice President, Commercial Development Adam Lenarz. This is a very ambitious target but it matches the Energy Department’s goal to have at least three projects in its pilot program achieving criticality by 4 July 2026. It is in line with the Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy Executive Order signed by President Donald Trump in May.

“This is exactly the kind of project we had in mind when we built Texas A&M-RELLIS. It’s bold, it’s forward-looking, and it brings together private innovation and public research to solve today’s energy challenges,” said Chancellor Glenn Hegar of The Texas A&M University System.

RE: EPA–HQ–OAR–2025–0186, Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (40 CFR Part 98)

FROM: Mariam Al-Shamma, Director, Bipartisan Policy Center

The Bipartisan Policy Center appreciates the opportunity to respond to EPA–HQ–OAR–2025–0186 regarding the Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). With over two decades of experience advancing pragmatic, bipartisan solutions, BPC offers recommendations grounded in its expertise across different sectors including energy and infrastructure policy. As a trusted convener of diverse stakeholders, BPC is committed to fostering informed dialogue and effective policy design.

The EPA’s GHGRP is a critical piece of emissions tracking infrastructure that boosts data transparency and supports U.S. competitiveness and trade objectives. Repealing large swathes of the program—and suspending reporting by segments of the oil and natural gas industry subject to the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) until 2034—threatens to undercut the business case for U.S. exporters of energy and other products and to impose higher costs for the domestic carbon capture and hydrogen industries.

The United States government has a strong interest in promoting American industrial competitiveness and trade interests. In the face of growing efforts by important global trade partners to enact emissions-based border measures, scaling back the GHGRP risks raising costs for U.S. exporters and impeding their efforts to send energy and other products to foreign markets.

For U.S. companies seeking to demonstrate the carbon intensity of their products abroad, the GHGRP provides both a rigorous, standardized reporting structure and federal stamp of credibility for facility-level emissions. U.S. companies and industries can use that data in calculating product-level emissions intensity, an increasingly important source of U.S. competitive advantage. Emissions tracking and reporting is a key component of Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAMs) currently being operationalized in the European Union and the United Kingdom and under consideration in other countries like Australia, Japan, and India.

U.S. exporters of liquified natural gas (LNG) in particular are facing new requirements to disclose verified emissions data to buyers in key markets. U.S. LNG producers exporting into the growing EU market will need to comply with the EU Methane Regulation starting in 2027. In Japan and South Korea, buyers launched the CLEAN Initiative in 2023. Both the EU regulation and the CLEAN Initiative elevate new emissions data requirements for LNG with the aim of reducing emissions intensity over time.

Because natural gas can vary significantly in composition and quality, reporting by all natural gas industry segments (i.e., production, processing, compression, transportation, storage, distribution, and export) is needed to determine the overall GHG profile and intensity of natural gas delivered to end users. Facilities representing these segments currently report their GHG emissions under the GHGRP’s subpart W. Those data—and U.S. government sign-off on the data—are a critical asset for U.S. LNG exports, without which they could be at a competitive disadvantage compared to global peers.

Effective repeal of the GHGRP would also inject new uncertainty into U.S. tax policy. American carbon capture and removal companies filing for the carbon sequestration tax credit (45Q) and certain companies filing for the clean hydrogen production tax credit (45V) rely on GHGRP reporting to verify the amount of CO2 sequestered by their projects to qualify for the tax credits. If the GHGRP stops covering CO2 emissions sites, companies would likely rely on their own monitoring, reporting, and verification plans to self-report emissions impacts to the IRS. But without EPA sign-off through GHGRP, companies could face elevated audit and financial risks.

If the GHGRP is rolled back, state governments, industry groups, and/or nonprofit entities would likely seek to fill the vacuum by establishing new reporting programs. For companies that are either required to report emissions under state or international requirements or choose to do so to demonstrate their competitive advantage, adapting to a new reporting program or programs would almost certainly come with higher costs. As a result, finalization of EPA’s proposed rule would likely raise costs for U.S. exporters of energy products and manufactured goods and, by extension, undermine U.S. competitiveness.",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2151725701.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 23:59:26.966867

These are some of the findings in a new report titled Clean Transportation Works: An Analysis of U.S. Investments, released by the Coalition Helping America Rebuild and Go Electric (CHARGE), which advocates for continuing some of the landmark federal programs begun by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and companion legislation known as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Both sets of legislation were passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden, with a focus on rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure to shepherd cleaner transportation solutions like electric vehicles and upgrades to public transit, bike lanes, sidewalks and more.

The second Trump administration has taken a dimmer view of many of these programs, halting funding, changing guidelines, and rejecting provisions around delivering equity and environmental justice.

CHARGE officials mostly point to the benefits these projects and programs have secured. Their message is aimed, in part, at lawmakers at both the federal and state levels, urging them to not abandon these initiatives as they consider funding authorizations next year.

“These investments have made real impacts in folks’ lives. They have built infrastructure. They have provided jobs,” said Bridget Sanderson, the CHARGE campaign manager. “And a lot of communities really want these programs.”

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program has been the centerpiece of a strategy to develop EV charging infrastructure. However, as of today, goals such as a network of 500,000 EV fast chargers has not yet been reached, with only 370 NEVI-funded fast chargers now open and in operation at 84 locations across the country, according to data collected by the EV States Clearinghouse. Of the $5 billion allocated to NEVI by the IIJA, only $526 million has been obligated, with a mere $44 million actually spent, according to the CHARGE report.

This means much of the build-out of NEVI-funded charging stations remains. The CHARGE report points out that if all funding allocated to NEVI and another program to advance lower-speed community charging were spent, this translates to about 11,200 jobs. Similarly, the publicly funded charging programs have a way of advancing private investment, said industry watchers. As of June of this year, the private sector had announced some $426 million in investment for the EV charging market in the United States, according to the report.

These are the kind of data points CHARGE and its members hope to impress upon federal policymakers and members of Congress as they urge continued momentum for NEVI and similar programs.

“The stability in these programs is really what will continue to push further private investments going forward, will ensure stability in the economy, making sure that our infrastructure is up to date,” Sanderson said.

The researchers take a forward-looking approach to electrified transportation and its ability to transform the economy with new investment. Fully implementing the clean transportation future imagined by the IIJA and IRA could have an economic development impact reaching some $4.6 billion in domestic manufacturing investments, contributing to more than 14,400 jobs, the report’s authors write.

Rachel Reolfi, a senior policy analyst for Atlas Public Policy, a research firm focusing on clean transportation and energy that conducted much of the research in the CHARGE report, was careful to note that this amount is not necessarily a direct reflection of projects funded via the federal program, but reflects some of the trickle-out effects of the federal spending.

“As demand for these clean transportation technologies grows, partially due to this federal funding, the demand for U.S.-based manufacturing is growing, and so we’re seeing that expand,” Reolfi said.

“If federal funding continues to flow, the deployment of these technologies picks up, we actually expect that those numbers could get even larger,” she added. “Or, on the flip side, could be at risk if there are challenges to that funding.”

Challenges to funding are not difficult to miss. Some $2.7 billion in funding from the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant Program was rescinded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, according to the report, citing the Climate Program Portal, which tracks obligated and outlaid funding.

“I’m a very hopeful and optimistic person,” Sanderson reflected. “I think that there are people in communities across the country who are seeing benefits that the IIJA and the IRA provided, that can also play a role in reaching out to members of Congress and the administration.”

EGLE’s research on on plastic pollution and microplastics throughout the Great Lakes is funded by a $2 million grant.
“We have slowly gotten more and more research showing that microplastics are everywhere, across all the Great Lakes that are sampled,” he said.
Johnston said microplastics and their effects need to be better understood in order to grasp how they are affecting the health of Michiganders.
According to Johnston, 10,000 metric tons of plastic enter the Great Lakes every year.","The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy is hosting a Great Lakes Microplastics Summit this week to share its latest findings. The summit takes place during Microplastics Awareness Week, newly designated by Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

EGLE’s research on on plastic pollution and microplastics throughout the Great Lakes is funded by a $2 million grant. Jeff Johnston, a spokesperson with EGLE, said that money extends through 2029.

“It enabled us to hire two additional staff people to work on this,” he said.

EGLE is also working on a five-year surface-water sampling plan to get benchmark data researchers can use to measure future progress.

Eddie Kostelnik, an environmental quality analyst at EGLE, said they found that the microplastic presence in the Great Lakes is changing, and not for the better. “We have slowly gotten more and more research showing that microplastics are everywhere, across all the Great Lakes that are sampled,” he said. “We use the word 'ubiquitous.'""

Kostelnik said sources of microplastics include synthetic clothing, vehicle tires, fishing nets, and ""nurdles,"" or small plastic pellets, used in industrial processes.

Johnston said microplastics and their effects need to be better understood in order to grasp how they are affecting the health of Michiganders. Recent studies have found the potential for ""adverse health effects,"" but research remains limited.

Population densities and industry manufacturing are hotspots that academics have been researching, Kostelnik added. He said urban centers with higher amounts of litter are seeing more microplastics.

Johnston said it's important to raise public awareness on microplastics because they appear not only in our water, but on land and in the air as well. Kostelnik added that EGLE's research has found Michiganders are inhaling and ingesting microplastics regularly.

“A lot of environmental hotspots or challenges kind of creep up on us,” Johnston said. “And I think we’re at a point now where people have come to understand fairly recently just how extensive the problem of plastics in our environment is.”

Kostelnik said EGLE's work has discovered that microplastics bio-accumulate in the Great Lakes through the food chain as animals ingest them. That means they become more concentrated in animals higher up the food chain, because when those animals consume their prey, they also ingest the microplastics that those prey animals had eaten.

According to Johnston, 10,000 metric tons of plastic enter the Great Lakes every year.

EGLE’s goal is to understand the scope of the microplastics problem. “It comes down to being aware of just how much plastic we interact with in our daily lives,” Johnston said. “When you understand the damage these products can do in the long term to our environment, that should be a motivator to a lot of people to be mindful when to choose plastics and when to look for alternatives.”

“Unless we start to find ways to reduce that amount and remove some material, we’re heading for bigger problems down the road,” Johnston concluded.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be95f5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1300x683+0+93/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2Fb9%2Fc8a8e4fc417db67d6adf6763fec0%2Font-greatlakes-contaminants-ckl-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 19:00:43.388736

(Musk in July said losing the incentives could result in “a few rough quarters” for his company.)
“Our intent is to expand as quickly as we can,” Musk said.
The company also can produce about 125,000 cybercabs in Texas and Musk said increasing production of that model will be one of his team’s 2026 priorities.
Asked if the production plans imply that Tesla is willing to give up some of its profitability to grow its market share, Musk was clear.","Higher costs ate into Tesla Inc.’s third-quarter margins but CEO Elon Musk told investors and analysts he is now confident enough in the company’s self-driving technology to have the electric-vehicle market leader “expand as fast as we reasonably can.” Executives also plan to “substantially” increase capital spending in 2026.

Austin-based Tesla produced a net profit of $1.37 billion on $28.1 billion of total revenues in the three months that ended Sept. 30, during which it delivered more than 497,000 vehicles. That last figure was up 7% from the same period of 2024 and helped by consumers stepping up to buy cars ahead of the Sept. 30 expiration of $7,500 tax credits. The company’s operating margin for the quarter was 5.8%, which was five points lower than in 2024’s Q3 but up from 4.1% in this year’s second quarter.

Profits were down 37% from a year earlier due to operating expenses popped 50%, which CFO Vaibhav Taneja attributed in part to work on artificial intelligence chips, legal costs and spending on the company’s shareholder meeting, which will decide the $1 trillion long-term pay plan Tesla’s board has proposed for Musk.

Taneja said that Tesla’s capital spending is on pace to total $9 billion this year but will rise “substantially” next year as executives eye the company’s next phase of automotive growth as well as initiatives in AI, including the Optimus robot. But officials also said that tariffs and product mix also hurt the profitability of their car operation.

That goal and Musk’s comment about ramping up production suggests costs will climb further in coming quarters—even as the end of tax credits has left the EV market in limbo. (Musk in July said losing the incentives could result in “a few rough quarters” for his company.) General Motors Corp. CFO Paul Jacobson said earlier this week that his team expects sales, which already have fallen off this month, to maybe find their natural levels in early 2026.

“Our intent is to expand as quickly as we can,” Musk said. “I was reticent to do that until we had clarity on achieving unsupervised full self-driving. But at this point, I feel like we’ve got clarity and it makes sense to expand production as fast as we can.”

Today, Tesla has the capacity at its factories in California, Texas, Berlin and Shanghai to make more than 2.2 million of its 3, S and Y cars. The company also can produce about 125,000 cybercabs in Texas and Musk said increasing production of that model will be one of his team’s 2026 priorities.

Asked if the production plans imply that Tesla is willing to give up some of its profitability to grow its market share, Musk was clear.

So data centers raise an immediate issue… “It's going to take more generation.
“With his abundant source of natural gas, that's what's going to power our data centers.""
He argues that Arizona Public Service is trying to serve too many new data centers.
” Including the data centers.","The largest utility in Arizona has a problem. It needs more energy.

“It’s hard in the world we live in today to live without electricity.”

Johnny Penrod works for Arizona Public Service. And the buzzing sound from this power plant in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe is relatively quiet. But if the power turbines were on, we wouldn’t be able to talk.

“Basically like a 737 jet engine is what it is.”

Demand for power in Arizona is expected to keep rising. And meeting that demand can mean life or death in the desert, where temperatures stay above 110 degrees in the summer.

“Here, we can do something to make sure we keep the lights on for our customers.”

And to keep the air conditioners running.

So, the utility has turned to a pipeline company to bring in more natural gas from Texas.

The state’s rising population is driving the need for more power, but data centers, including the ones AI relies on, need more power, too.

“I think natural gas is going to play that part.”

Kevin Thompson is chair of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities. Renewables, including solar, are a part of the utility's portfolio, but not as reliable at all times. So data centers raise an immediate issue…

“It's going to take more generation. It's going to take dispatchable, reliable generation that can be dispatched at night time.”

The Department of Energy estimates the demand from data centers could nearly triple in the next three years. Nationally, they could use 12-percent of all energy.

The Trump administration’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, spoke about meeting that skyrocketing demand recently with the Council on Foreign Relations.

“With his abundant source of natural gas, that's what's going to power our data centers.""

The national renewable energy laboratory tracks data centers, and their map shows some of the major hot spots in the Mountain West – from Wyoming to Colorado, Utah to Nevada… and, of course, Arizona, where driverless taxis are an increasingly common sight.

Tom Maples pages through notes at the DPR Construction office.

He’s a project manager with the company, which builds data centers. One of his latest projects was for Meta - in another Phoenix suburb.

“It's really growing very fast in Arizona and around the country, more so in the last two years.”

Maples says building energy efficient data centers is just good business. But many will still contend with high utility bills.

“As AI has come on…there’s a lot more electricity being consumed.”

Amid this unprecedented demand, some major utilities have slowed their transitions to renewables.

Arizona Public Service is among them. It ended its goal to be carbon neutral by 20-50.

Some are concerned the demand is pushing residential bills up, like Abhay Padgoankar, a consumer advocate. He argues that Arizona Public Service is trying to serve too many new data centers.

“They don't have the capacity for it.”

The utility says it’s more complicated than that though. Still residential bills jumped about 8 percent last year.

“We as residential customers are doing the right things by conserving energy…by installing solar, by buying energy efficient appliances. We’re doing all the right things. ”

As data centers grow, so will the demands for more power from the utility, which helps explain why it is moving ahead with the natural gas pipeline.

Johnny Penrod says the utility aims to produce enough power for everyone.

“Basically to keep people safe. Keeping the lights on is so important for everybody. ”

According to a filing with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, they will take place in Pikeville, Hazard and Ashland, respectively.

The company is seeking a 14.9% increase in residential rates and a 13.8% increase in commercial rates. The average residential customer would pay $27.30 more a month, if the commission approves the request.

Kentucky Power is also seeking a separate certificate of public convenience and necessity to upgrade the Mitchell plant in West Virginia to keep it in operation past 2028.

If approved, that would cost residential customers an additional $3.68 a month.

Kentucky Power’s average customer bill of $181.74 a month is already the highest in the region. Approval in both cases would raise it to $212.72.

A company witness testified earlier this month that one of Mitchell’s concrete cooling towers is failing structurally and will need to be reinforced or replaced.

Kentucky Power says it will seek a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to help cover the cost of repair or replacement of the cooling tower.

Another company witness told the Kentucky commission that credit-ratings agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have expressed concerns about Kentucky Power’s reliance on coal.

Kentucky Power’s credit rating is the lowest investment-grade rating, and it is the lowest of the subsidiaries of American Electric Power, which include Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power.

The Trump administration has taken steps to support coal generation, including a $625 million program to help utilities extend the life of their coal generation assets.

It has also proposed to scrap U.S. Environmental Protection Agency emissions rules enacted during the Biden administration.

Located at NE 30th Ave. & NE Evergreen Rd, the initial data center (known as PDX-01) at Aligned’s Hillsboro campus is expected to offer 72MW of critical capacity.
Aligned is based in Texas and has data center campuses across the US, including Hillsboro, Oregon; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; Phoenix, Arizona; and Northern Virginia.","Under the terms of the agreement, Calibrant will deliver a 31MW/62MWh BESS system to the undisclosed data center campus. The system, which will be installed onsite, is planned for operations in 2026. According to the companies, the deployment will enable the facility to come online and scale operations much faster than would be possible through traditional utility upgrades.

“This project flips the script on how data centers access power,” said Phil Martin, CEO at Calibrant. “Instead of waiting years for substation and transmission line upgrades, fossil-based generators, or going off grid entirely, we’re working with leading data center providers like Aligned and engaged and forward-thinking utilities to use distributed energy solutions to meet their growth objectives.”

The partners claim that the deployment is the first instance of a BESS system being purpose-built to accelerate the interconnection of a large-scale data center. The BESS will be developed using Calibrant’s Path to Power solution. The solution enables the BESS to function as a grid-responsive asset, discharging during peak demand to bolster grid reliability and ensure uninterrupted service for the data center operators' customers.

The companies have partnered with an undisclosed regional utility within the Pacific Northwest to support the deployment and explore flexibility as a means to increase and accelerate interconnection.

Aligned has a data center campus in development outside Portland, Oregon, in Hillsboro, which the company's website says will include a BESS deployment.

Aligned first announced plans for a 27-acre, 108MW Oregon campus in January 2023. The company broke ground on the site the same year and topped out the first building last year. Located at NE 30th Ave. & NE Evergreen Rd, the initial data center (known as PDX-01) at Aligned’s Hillsboro campus is expected to offer 72MW of critical capacity. The second building (PDX-02) is currently planned for 36MW.

“This strategic project redefines how we grow in power-constrained markets,” said Andrew Schaap, CEO at Aligned. “With this BESS, we’re converting our load from a potential grid liability into a dynamic grid asset, providing the regional utility with the tools needed to accelerate our ramp. And we’re doing it responsibly, without impacting ratepayers.”

The partners have indicated that they are considering similar projects across other markets.

Backed by Macquarie Asset Management, Calibrant is one of the most prominent players within the US energy storage industry. According to its website, it has approximately 600MW/1,100MWh of onsite solar and storage in operation, construction, or development across the US and Canada.

In August, the company energized three front-of-the-meter BESS in New York in collaboration with CoreSite. The BESS will provide 13.5MW, or 55.7MWh, of dispatchable capacity to the Con Edison grid in New York. It will be used by CoreSite and a leading hospital institution via Value of Distributed Energy Resources credits.

Aligned is based in Texas and has data center campuses across the US, including Hillsboro, Oregon; Chicago, Illinois; Dallas, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; Phoenix, Arizona; and Northern Virginia.

Third-quarter earnings at Tesla fell to $1.4 billion, or 39 cents a share, from $2.2 billion, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier. That marked the fourth quarter in a row that profit dropped. Excluding certain charges, earning were 50 cents per share, down from 72 cents per share a year ago and below the 56 cents forecast by Wall Street analysts.

Revenue rose to $28.1 billion from $25.2 billion in the June through September period, beating Wall Street’s forecast.

Tesla shares fell 1.8% to $431.23 in after-hours trading

Financial analysts have been upping their estimates of revenue since Musk announced earlier this month that sales of electric vehicles, one part of the multipronged business, rose 7% in the quarter after plunging for most of the year.

The sales were boosted by customers rushing to take advantage of a $7,500 federal tax credit for those EV purchases before it expired on Oct. 1, possibly stealing sales from the current quarter.

Tesla was also helped by surging sales from its separate battery storage and electric charging businesses, but the EVs still make up much of the overall revenue figures.

“It’s a positive that they are increasingly diversifying from the auto business, but our primary concern is demand for EVs,” said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research who has a “sell” rating on the stock. “There’s a lot of uncertainty.”

A much watched measure, gross margins, hit 18%, the highest for this year but still down from the third quarter a year ago. The figure, which shows how much money Tesla makes after paying staff, raw materials and other basic expenses, are also down from 25% four years ago as the company offers discounts and other incentives to fight back against rival EV makers that have been stealing market share.

Musk was predicting 20% to 30% sales growth for 2025 at this time last year, but it hasn’t turned out that way.

In addition to alienating potential customers with his embrace of right-wing politicians, sparking boycotts in key markets in the U.S. and abroad, he also has failed to shake up his vehicle lineup with a new, exciting model or introduce a substantially cheaper car to appeal to more buyers.

When he finally did reveal two cheaper offerings earlier this month - stripped down versions of the Model Y and Model X - investors were unimpressed because the discount didn’t seem deep enough. They both cost slightly less than $40,000, much higher than expected.

One Musk watcher on Wall Street was undeterred by the quarterly report.

“It’s nice to have revenue come back,” said Brian Mulberry, a senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “There is still strong demand for Teslas.”

Tesla just posted a quarter for the record books, with vehicle deliveries and revenue surging past analyst forecasts – but profit margins hit the brakes, with per-share earnings sliding from last year’s tally.

What does this mean?

Tesla’s booming delivery numbers and a hefty boost from its energy and storage business have investors taking notice. But profits didn’t keep pace, as adjusted earnings dropped to $0.50 per share, down from $0.72 last year. Strong demand in the US—boosted by buyers racing to claim a federal electric vehicle tax credit—helped, as did a rebound in China. Still, Tesla is facing fresh challenges: sales are sluggish in Europe, US tax credits have started to fade, and mounting competition is heating up the EV market. Meanwhile, the company’s big ambitions, ranging from Robotaxis and new energy products to the much-hyped Optimus robot, have investor attention—and a proposed $1 trillion compensation package for Elon Musk could reshape its leadership dynamic if approved.

Why should I care?

For markets: Growth looks strong but challenges are piling up.

Tesla’s standout delivery and revenue figures still set it apart from rivals, giving investors reasons to cheer. But profit margins are narrowing, and as government incentives cool off, market volatility could climb. The company’s drive into new ventures raises both excitement and uncertainty, especially as the broader EV field grows more crowded.

The bigger picture: Beyond cars, Tesla targets the future of tech.

Tesla’s expansion into robotics and advanced energy solutions highlights its ambition to lead in more than just vehicles. Diversifying revenue is a smart play, but pulling off these new projects will be no small feat. Regulatory shifts, evolving policies, and the pending Musk pay vote are wildcards that could shape not just Tesla’s path, but the future of smart tech innovation overall.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3482161_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=a530c33096e556f80069cc5dceebb1ee,N,,2025-10-22 18:19:08.840880

In a major win for environmental justice and coastal protection, a Louisiana state court has vacated the coastal use permit for the proposed Commonwealth LNG export terminal in Cameron Parish. The court found that the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) violated the state constitution by failing to consider how the project would impact low-income communities, communities of color, and the climate.

If built, Commonwealth LNG would have destroyed more than 75 acres of wetlands and altered hundreds more, adding to the loss already caused by nearby LNG facilities. The project’s greenhouse gas emissions would equal those of 14 coal-fired power plants.

Environmental and community groups hailed the ruling as a long-overdue check on unchecked industrial expansion along Louisiana’s coast. This is the second legal setback for Commonwealth LNG. In 2024, a federal appeals court also rejected the project’s federal permit, citing inadequate review of health and pollution impacts. Though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) later reauthorized construction, the state court’s decision now blocks progress until a new, lawful permit is issued.

Local residents and advocates emphasize that the ruling is about more than one project—it’s about the future of Louisiana’s coast. With multiple LNG export terminals already operating or proposed in the region, the court’s decision signals growing recognition of the cumulative toll these projects take on wetlands, fisheries, and frontline communities.",https://i0.wp.com/seaturtles.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Commonwealth-LNG-render-1024x576-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-22 19:01:08.309739

Key insights on the natural gas market provided by NGI's price and data analysts

Natural gas prices in Texas have seen considerable gains over the past two days amid pipeline work in the region that has curtailed flows. NGI’s Agua Dulce and Houston Ship Channel prices have jumped by 70.0 cents and 67.5 cents/MMBtu, respectively, since Monday (Oct. 20), NGI’s Daily Historical Data shows. This is slightly higher than their regional averages.

The price jump has come on the heels of increasing pipeline flow curtailments along the Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) Tejas Pipeline LLC (KM Tejas). KMI on Tuesday said capacity from south to north through the Station 2 Compressor Station would be limited by about 75% until further notice, requiring reductions to nominations. KMI has been performing emergency repairs at Station 2 since Oct. 15, though flow was initially restricted by only 12.5%, and prices appeared to soften at Agua Dulce and Houston Ship Channel in response.

Scheduled receipts on KM Tejas from interstate pipelines have averaged around 317,600 MMBtu/d since the start of the pipeline work, representing a cut of about 242,000 MMBtu/d compared to the past 30-day maximum of about 560,000 MMBtu/d, per Wood Mackenzie. The main impact has been on receipts from KMI’s Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. LLC. Similarly, KM Tejas deliveries to interstate pipelines have since averaged around 823,600 MMBtu/d, representing a cut of about 262,000 MMBtu/d versus the 30-day maximum.

There have been no significant dips in delivered feed gas to LNG facilities in Texas because of the KM Tejas pipeline constraints so far. The total day/day change in U.S. LNG feed gas deliveries was a reduction of 80,089 MMBtu from 16,899,016 MMBtu on Tuesday. Both Corpus Christi and Freeport LNG have multiple feed gas delivery pipelines in service now, each interconnecting with various interstate and Texas intrastate pipelines for daily supplies.

As such, neither terminal had meaningful reductions in daily feed gas deliveries. Once Golden Pass LNG’s export facility is online, it would also have a similar network of feed gas delivery pipelines to ensure supply availability during times of pipeline maintenance events.

The report found that local authorities have made strong progress in enforcing environmental regulations over the past three years.
However, it also points to the need for increased focus on water, air and noise enforcement to fully deliver on the National Enforcement Priorities.
Air & Noise Enforcement: Local authorities assigned a much lower level of resources to air and noise enforcement (10 per cent) than waste enforcement (56 per cent) and water enforcement (34 per cent) in 2024.","Local authorities improved their environmental enforcement performance by 20 per cent over the past three years, with 79 per cent of the National Enforcement Priority (NEP) assessments meeting the required standard in 2024.

In 2024, 630 staff across 31 local authorities:

23rd October 2025: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has today published its report on the environmental enforcement performance of local authorities in 2024. The report shows that the scale of environmental enforcement work carried out by local authorities in 2024 was extensive. Across the 31 local authorities, 630 staff:

conducted 227,400 environmental inspections,

regulated 10,700 licences, permits and certificates,

responded to 76,500 complaints,

carried out 18,050 enforcement actions and

initiated 414 prosecutions.

The report found that local authorities have made strong progress in enforcing environmental regulations over the past three years. The report highlights improvements in areas such as tackling illegal waste activities and the enforcement of construction and demolition waste. However, it also points to the need for increased focus on water, air and noise enforcement to fully deliver on the National Enforcement Priorities. The findings underscore both the achievements to date and the ongoing challenges in delivering consistent and effective enforcement action across the country.

The EPA’s performance review found that:

Six local authorities achieved high performance scores in 2024. These were Meath, Dublin City, South Dublin, Kildare, Fingal and Cork City Councils.

Three further local authorities consistently achieved good performance scores over the past three years: Monaghan, Carlow and Cork County Councils.

The five lowest performing local authorities were Leitrim, Galway City, Sligo, Clare and Donegal.

Commenting on the findings of the report, Dr Tom Ryan, Director of the EPA’s Office of Environmental Enforcement said:

“Strong enforcement of environmental laws is essential to detect pollution and ensure that those who break the rules are held responsible. Local authorities play a vital role in safeguarding our environment — especially when enforcement is prioritised and supported with the right resources. This report shows that most local authorities are responding to the challenge, but some such as Leitrim, Galway City, Sligo, Clare and Donegal are lagging behind and need to do better. Keeping up momentum is crucial to fully deliver on the National Enforcement Priorities and to protect our environment.”

Dr. Mick Henry, Senior Inspector in the EPA’s Office of Environmental Enforcement said:

“Local authorities are making solid progress in waste enforcement, especially in tackling illegal activities and managing construction and demolition waste. However, enforcement in water, air and noise is showing slower progress. Agricultural run-off, trade effluent, solid fuel burning and traffic noise continue to harm the environment and public health. We are urging local authorities to strengthen their efforts in these areas to ensure a cleaner, healthier environment for all.”

The Local Authority Environmental Enforcement Performance Report 2024 is available on the EPA website.

Notes to Editor:

EPA’s Local Authority Performance Framework:

The EPA has a supervisory role over local authorities and assesses their environmental inspection and enforcement performance under the EPA's Local Authority Performance Framework.

There are 19 National Enforcement Priorities (NEPs) which focus on delivering positive environmental outcomes for air quality, water quality, waste management and environmental noise. The NEPs are shown in the table below.

* European Parliament and Council Recommendation 2001/331/EC on the Recommended Minimum Criteria for Environmental Inspections in member states, known as “RMCEI”.

The report sets out results of the EPA’s assessment of the 19 NEPs for the 31 local authorities. Each NEP was scored according to a four-point scale; Excellent, Strong, Moderate or Limited. To achieve a Strong or Excellent score, local authorities must provide evidence of satisfactory risk-based selection of inspections and appropriate follow-up of issues, focused on improving compliance and environmental outcomes.

Waste Enforcement:

Ireland’s waste generation is too high and there has been no significant progress to reach the mandatory recycling targets that apply from 2025. Local authorities must target waste enforcement actions at household and commercial sites, to promote waste segregation and use of the three bin system.

Water Enforcement:

Agriculture continues to have a significant impact on water quality, resulting in excess levels of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment entering our waterways. Local authorities must carry out more farm inspections and follow-up enforcement to reach the National Agricultural Inspection Programme annual target of 4,500 farms, to drive compliance with the Good Agricultural Practice regulations and reduce the impact on water quality.

Local authorities must also prioritise the inspection and enforcement of Section 4 Discharge Licences (trade effluent), particularly those that are a significant pressure on receiving water quality.

Air & Noise Enforcement:

Local authorities assigned a much lower level of resources to air and noise enforcement (10 per cent) than waste enforcement (56 per cent) and water enforcement (34 per cent) in 2024. Whilst Ireland’s air quality met EU standards, it did not meet the stricter health guidelines from the World Health Organisation and there were concerning localised issues which led to poor air quality. Local authorities need to maintain the inspection campaign of solid fuel producers, retailers and distributors, to ensure only approved solid fuels are available for sale and to protect public health from harmful air pollutants.

Many local authorities made little progress on delivering the measures in their Noise Action Plans (NAPs) in 2024. Greater action is needed to reduce exposure to transport noise and the impact on people’s health and wellbeing. Local authorities, in collaboration with transport infrastructure bodies, need to focus implementation of NAPs on the priority areas identified using strategic noise mapping.

Peat Enforcement:

The unauthorised extraction of peat is a significant environmental issue in some local authority areas. In June 2025, the EPA published a report on Large Scale Illegal Peat Extraction which identified seven local authorities that must take enforcement action against illegal operators; Offaly, Westmeath, Tipperary, Roscommon, Longford, Kildare and Sligo. While peat extraction is not a National Enforcement Priority, it is relevant to at least the seven local authorities, whose enforcement activity has been evaluated separate to the Local Authority Performance Framework. Local authorities need to ensure that where peat extraction is taking place, that it is properly authorised and approved under Planning legislation.

“The future workforce will need skills for what comes next,” said Caterpillar Chief Human Resources Officer Christy Pambianchi. “We have our experts working on innovative training and resources to help skill and inform the next generation on how to navigate the worksite of tomorrow, and we’re excited to be starting here in Indiana to enable US workers to enter high-quality jobs in the American manufacturing industry.”

Caterpillar adds that it will announce future workforce pledges in other states soon.

“Indiana is proud to be among the first states selected for Caterpillar’s workforce investment, which is a testament to our pro-growth policies, world-class workforce, and reputation as one of the best states in America to start and grow a business,” said Governor Braun. “Caterpillar’s continued commitment to Indiana demonstrates the strength of our business climate and our shared vision for the future of American manufacturing. We look forward to working together to prepare more Hoosiers for the high-quality careers of tomorrow.”

Caterpillar made the future workforce announcement at the company’s large engine facility in Lafayette, Indiana, which recently announced a $725 million capital expansion – one of the largest single manufacturing investments in the company’s global history – to greatly increase engine production and help meet the nation’s growing power needs.

“The demand for energy is increasing like never before,” said Jason Kaiser, Caterpillar Energy & Transportation Group President. “Many of the engines manufactured here in Lafayette will support power generation customers by providing reliable power – keeping operations running during outages and helping meet the growing energy needs driven by AI, data centers and other critical infrastructure across America and around the world.”

The Colorado Automobile Dealers Association reported that an unprecedented 32.4% of new vehicle sales during this period were EVs. A significant milestone, this represents the highest single-quarter percentage any U.S. state has achieved, trumping Colorado's own previous record of 31.5% EV market share set in the 4th quarter of 2024.

Despite the federal government rolling back EV tax incentives on October 1st, Colorado has continued to champion the adoption of EVs. As part of its commitment, the state's Vehicle Exchange Colorado (VXC) rebates, coming November 3rd, are set to climb from $6,000 to $9,000 for new EV purchases and leases, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used EV purchases and leases. ""Coloradans and the free market are saying loud and clear that affordable, clean, and efficient electric vehicles are here to stay,"" Governor Jared Polis enthused about the state's EV market, as per the Colorado Governor's Office. While speaking in his announcement, the end of federal EV support did not deter the state's incentives for electric vehicle buyers.

Before these cutbacks were enacted by the Trump administration, the federal EV tax credits were offering up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new EV and up to $4,000 for a used one, with the expectation that these incentives would run until the end of 2032. Colorado, however, has supplemented the gap with its own tax credits, $3,500 for new EV purchases or leases, plus an additional $2,500 for EVs costing no more than $35,000. ""The transportation sector has long been the hardest to decarbonize so we are grateful that so many Coloradans are making the transition to EVs,"" said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor, as obtained by the Colorado Governor's Office.

The state's EV infrastructure receives a notable push from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program. Earlier in October, the Polis administration disclosed that Colorado secured the final $12 million of its $56.5 million slice from NEVI, as spoken by Governor Polis, intended for further development of the state's fast-charger network. To date, nearly $25.6 million of this NEVI funding has been put toward creating 246 fast-charging ports along crucial transport routes. With these advancements, Colorado's charging network now showcases more than 5,000 Level 2 ports and over 1,400 fast-charging ports, to the benefit of countless EV drivers and visitors throughout the state.

As EV registrations in Colorado exceed 210,000, the state is not just focused on facilitating EV adoption through rebates and tax credits, but also on ensuring that the necessary infrastructure is in place. Offering a variety of grants, like those under the Charge Ahead Colorado program and the Fleet Zero Emission Resource Opportunity (Fleet ZERO) program, Colorado is investing in a broad charging network accessible to all.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/10/colorado-leads-us-in-electric-vehicle-sales-sets-new-quarterly-record-despite-federal-incentive-rollbacks.webp,N,,2025-10-22 19:00:49.169108

Net income attributable to shareholders, however, plummeted to $1.3 billion, approximately a 57% drop from the nearly $3.1 billion reported in Q3 2024.","Dive Brief:

General Motors expects the electric vehicle market to be “pretty choppy” in the near future, in part due to the ending of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs in September. But once demand has normalized, the automaker anticipates that the “EV market is going to stabilize from a supply standpoint,” CFO Paul Jacobson said Tuesday.

“We had a number of competitors out there that really were selling EVs for whatever they could get for them because they really wanted to get the credits on the environmental side,” he said in response to analyst questions during the company’s third quarter earnings call. “So we do think it will be a more stable environment.”

GM has actively managed its EV inventory down by about 30% since the end of its second quarter, Jacobson said, according to a transcript. The Detroit-based automaker is also taking steps to navigate through the period of EV demand constriction it anticipates will continue into 2026; “throughout this period, you can be assured that we will build to demand and continue to focus on improving EV profitability, including through material cost reductions by leveraging larger module sizes and new battery chemistries,” he said.

Dive Insight:

EV sales hit an all-time high in Q3 as consumers raced to take advantage of the federal tax credit before it ended on Sept. 30, reaching 438,487 units sold, Cox Automotive said in an Oct. 10 press release, citing Kelley Blue Book estimates. EV sales represented a record 10.5% of total vehicle sales for the quarter, up from 8.6% in the prior year period, according to Cox.

Companies including Ford, Hyundai and Kia all reported record EV sales in September, with Ford reporting its best quarter for EVs, Cox said in an Oct. 2 release.

Major automakers, including GM, have already begun to prep for the impact of the credit’s end. In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley said he expected the close of the incentive to slash EV demand by roughly half, noting hybrid vehicles may be more acceptable to consumers, according to a report by CNBC.

Elon Musk-owned Tesla, meanwhile, has introduced new models with more affordable prices in a bid to increase overall sales, coming as the top seller of EVs in the U.S. faces questions over profitability and rising competition in the EV space prior to the release of its third quarter results, USA Today reported.

Prior to its Q3 earnings report, GM reported losses of $1.6 billion “on a planned strategic realignment of our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint to consumer demand” following U.S. policy changes — including the EV credit as well as changes in emission regulations, according to an Oct. 14 securities filing.

Following in the wake of several of its competitors, GM also reported record EV sales for its third quarter ended Sept. 30, with 67,000 deliveries and a 16.5% market share, Jacobson said Tuesday, solidifying its place as the second largest seller of EVs in the U.S. by volume after Tesla. However, the automaker has already seen a “significant pullback” in EV demand for October, Jacobson said, a trend it anticipates will continue through early next year before “we see what the natural demand is for EVs,” he said.

GM is also fielding the impact of ongoing economic headwinds, including tariffs. For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the company reported total adjusted EBIT of $3.4 billion, down $700 million YoY, Jacobson said — including a gross tariff impact of $1.1 billion.

However, the company’s gross tariff impact expectation for 2025 has improved from its original $4 billion to $5 billion range, to between $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, Jacobson said during the call, in part due to Friday adjustments made by the Trump administration to medium and heavy-duty vehicle imports.

Such adjustments will help to support GM’s “tariff mitigation in 2026 and beyond while we work to adjust our supply chains,” Jacobson said.

For its third quarter, GM reported revenue of $48.5 billion, compared to $48.7 billion for the prior year period, according to its earnings release. Net income attributable to shareholders, however, plummeted to $1.3 billion, approximately a 57% drop from the nearly $3.1 billion reported in Q3 2024.

A company witness testified earlier this month that one of Mitchell’s concrete cooling towers is failing structurally and will need to be reinforced or replaced.

Kentucky Power says it will seek a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to help cover the cost of repair or replacement of the cooling tower.

Another company witness told the Kentucky commission that credit-ratings agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have expressed concerns about Kentucky Power’s reliance on coal.

Kentucky Power’s credit rating is the lowest investment-grade rating, and it is the lowest of the subsidiaries of American Electric Power, which include Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power.

The Trump administration has taken steps to support coal generation, including a $625 million program to help utilities extend the life of their coal generation assets.

It has also proposed to scrap U.S. Environmental Protection Agency emissions rules enacted during the Biden administration.

Kentucky Power serves 162,000 customers in 20 eastern Kentucky counties. The region has lost jobs and population in the past few decades, reducing the number of residential and industrial electricity customers.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Mitchell-Plant-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 20:04:11.857063

“Reformers said they’ll wage war on clean energy,” Miliband said.
The idea of a just transition refers to a responsible and fair clean energy transition that doesn’t leave fossil fuel workers and their communities behind.
In the United States, jobs are being slashed at alarming degrees, from automaking to clean energy to government positions.
“They’re jobs, paychecks and opportunities in communities that were counting on these clean energy projects to drive economic growth.","Two drastically different trends in energy careers are taking place on either side of the Atlantic Ocean. While the Trump administration pulls back billions of dollars in clean energy funding and seeks to prop up coal careers, the United Kingdom is rolling out a plan to add 400,000 clean energy jobs to the national economy.

Just this week Edward Miliband, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change of the United Kingdom, announced a national plan to train hundreds of thousands of plumbers, electricians, carpenters, welders, HVAC installers, and more as part of a scheme to double the country’s clean energy workforce by 2030. Priority will go to individuals with heightened vocational needs, including those leaving the fossil fuel sector, school leavers, unemployed individuals, veterans and formerly incarcerated people.

More specifically, the plan designates 31 skilled trades for recruitment and training. The highest priority positions are in plumbing, heating and ventilation, as an additional 8,000 to 10,000 of these workers will be needed by 2030. This is followed by 4,000 to 8,500 each of carpenters, electricians, and welders.

The plan will likely come up against resistance from the Reform UK, the nation’s preeminent right-wing party. But Miliband is hedging his bets that the prospect of 400,000 high-quality jobs will be popular all along the political spectrum. “Reformers said they’ll wage war on clean energy,” Miliband said. “Well, that’s waging war on these jobs … It’s all part of their attempt at a culture war, but I actually think they’re out of tune with the British people because I think people recognise that we need, that we want the jobs from clean energy.”

Miliband went on to say that this new plan “answers a key question about where the good jobs of the future will come from”, marking a major step forward for a “just transition” away from fossil fuels. The idea of a just transition refers to a responsible and fair clean energy transition that doesn’t leave fossil fuel workers and their communities behind. The plan also addresses a critical skills gap that poses an existential threat to the country’s decarbonization goals.

Professor Dave Reay, who co-chairs Scotland’s Just Transition Commission, told Reuters that unless UK workers are appropriately trained and upskilled for green jobs, “talent has to come in from overseas, (as has already occurred) or it doesn't happen at the speed that's required.” Easing the transition into the sector is essential to retain a homegrown energy-sector workforce, Reay adds. “If folk can't easily make the switch or make the entry into the sector, then they won't do it. A lot of the oil and gas folk that we speak to are saying, ‘I kind of get it, but I can get work in the Middle East or Australia.”

Britain’s new clean jobs plan highlights a widening divide between energy-sector leadership in the United States and the United Kingdom, two nations that usually operate by relatively similar principles in line with their “special relationship”. But all that has changed as the nations diverge along climate lines. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has implemented the most ambitious climate target of any industrial economy, while President Trump has pulled out of the Paris agreement altogether. The United Kingdom closed its last coal plant in 2024, while Trump has promised to revitalize “beautiful, clean coal”.

In the United States, jobs are being slashed at alarming degrees, from automaking to clean energy to government positions. And while the Trump administration has attracted lots of investment dollars, critics argue that this won’t translate to long-term jobs. “Even if the US succeeds in reshaping supply chains, it doesn’t guarantee the creation of good jobs,” University of Sussex International Relations Professor Benjamin Selwyn recently wrote for the Conversation. “Despite Trump’s pro-labour rhetoric, his administration’s actions tell a different story.”

As of July, $22 billion in clean energy projects had been canceled, a number which has continued to balloon in past months, leading to the loss of many thousands of jobs. “These cancellations aren’t just numbers on a balance book,” said E2 spokesperson Michael Timberlake in a July statement. “They’re jobs, paychecks and opportunities in communities that were counting on these clean energy projects to drive economic growth. And now they’re gone.”

Weatherization can help with that.

Weatherization is the process of making a home more energy-efficient, safe, healthy and comfortable. Weatherization measures are chosen based on an initial energy audit of the home. The audit can identify simple upgrades like sealing air leaks, replacing inefficient lighting, adding insulation or repairing heating and cooling systems to reduce energy use and lower utility bills.

Weatherization is a cost-effective way to increase household energy efficiency, which is especially important for households with limited incomes and high energy burdens. A high energy burden means a household is spending a large percentage of their annual income on energy costs. In fact, weatherization can save households hundreds of dollars per year.

But it’s more than just saving money. Weatherization improves indoor air quality, reduces health risks, decreases greenhouse gas emissions, makes homes more resilient and strengthens communities by creating local jobs and supporting energy equity.

Weatherization Assistance Program

Since first signed into law in 1976, the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) has helped more than 7.2 million households across the country receive critical upgrades, at no cost to them. The North Carolina Weatherization Assistance Program at the DEQ State Energy Office weatherizes an average of 1,100 homes annually.

DEQ's weatherization program is available to NC renters or owners who have a gross income at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines or if they receive assistance payments under Work First or Supplemental Security. The program prioritizes assisting the elderly, individuals with disabilities, families with children, high energy users or households with a high energy burden. This program can serve single-family dwellings, mobile and manufactured homes and multi-family dwellings.

Potential eligible upgrades can include installing insulation, repairing or replacing water heaters, installing duct and heating pipe insulation and window repairs or replacement. North Carolinians can apply through their local service provider, which is based on the county they live in.

CEO Commentary

“I am proud of our team’s efforts in delivering solid overall results in the fourth quarter, especially given the challenging operating environment,” said Michael Happe, president and chief executive officer of Winnebago Industries. “We drove stronger revenue, improved profitability, gained share in key segments and delivered solid operating cash flow and an improved leverage position. Our performance clearly reflects the advantages of a diversified product portfolio, as strong momentum across our brands and product lines helped offset the operating margin pressure stemming from the ongoing turnaround of our Winnebago-branded businesses, which is proceeding positively.”

“While industry conditions continue to reflect higher competitive discounts and allowances, we remain disciplined in how we manage production schedules and inventory levels,” Happe said. “Our focus on aligning our shipments with retail demand has positioned us well to support our dealer partners, maintain inventory health and keep our brands strong in the eyes of consumers.”

“We were delighted with the enthusiasm at September’s RV Open House, where we debuted a range of exciting new products across our three RV brands. We also showcased the tremendous progress being made via the refreshed Winnebago-branded RV lineup and the ongoing rollout of our Grand Design motorized strategy. The positive feedback from our dealers and the interest in our newest models showcase the hard work our product teams are putting into innovating for today’s outdoor recreation customers.”

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results

Net revenues were $777.3 million, an increase of 7.8% compared to $720.9 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024, primarily due to favorable product mix and targeted price increases, partially offset by higher discounts and allowances.

Gross profit was $99.2 million, an increase of 5.2% compared to $94.2 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. Gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points in the quarter to 12.8%, primarily due to costs associated with the transformation of the Winnebago-branded businesses, partially offset by targeted price increases.

Operating expenses were $79.1 million, a decrease of 29.5% compared to $112.0 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024, primarily due to prior year goodwill impairment and cost reduction initiatives in Fiscal 2025, which more than offset Winnebago Industries’ investments in its Grand Design motorhome business. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 100 basis points to 9.5% in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 from 10.5% of net revenues in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024.

Operating income was $20.1 million compared to an operating loss of $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024, which included a previously disclosed $30.3 million goodwill impairment charge.

Net income was $13.7 million, compared to a net loss of $29.1 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. Reported net income per diluted share was $0.49, compared to a reported net loss per diluted share of $1.01 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.71, an increase of 153.6% compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.28 in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $38.2 million, an increase of 33.1%, compared to $28.7 million in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024.

Full Year Fiscal 2025 Results

Net revenues were $2.8 billion, a decrease of 5.9% compared to $3.0 billion in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to a reduction in average selling price per unit related to product mix and lower unit volume, partially offset by targeted price increases.

Gross profit was $365.1 million, a decrease of 15.8% compared to $433.5 million in Fiscal 2024. Gross profit margin decreased 160 basis points year over year to 13.0% primarily due to deleverage and slightly higher warranty experience.

Operating expenses were $307.9 million, compared to $333.3 million in Fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the prior year goodwill impairment and cost reduction initiatives in the current year, partially offset by investments to support the growth of the Grand Design motorhome and Barletta marine businesses.

Operating income was $57.2 million, a decrease of 42.9% compared to $100.2 million in Fiscal 2024.

Net income was $25.7 million, compared to net income of $13.0 million in Fiscal 2024.

RELATED: Decision looms on controversial wastewater plant for housing development

The plant, to be built in Grey Forest, will serve the proposed Guajalote Ranch development, a project that calls for roughly 2,900 homes in the area. The permit allows for the release of up to one million gallons of treated wastewater each day into the Helotes Creek watershed, a tributary that feeds directly into the Edwards Aquifer, a major source of drinking water for the region.

Opponents, including the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance, the City of Grey Forest, and nearby landowners, warned that the project threatens to pollute groundwater in a region known for its porous karst terrain. They also pointed out that TCEQ’s own Office of Public Interest Counsel had recommended rejecting the permit, citing scientific studies from the Southwest Research Institute that found any wastewater discharge in the area would “significantly degrade” the watershed.

Despite this, TCEQ Chair Brooke Paup said the evidence supported the application, stating, “In my evaluation, I find that the evidence and record supports the ALJ’s determination that the applicant met its burden to establish that the draft permit is protective and meets all applicable requirements.”

Environmental advocates expressed outrage. Randy Neumann, chair of the Scenic Loop–Helotes Creek Alliance, said, “We are of course extremely disappointed in the commissioners’ decision this decision does nothing to protect public health and natural resources.” He vowed to continue the fight, adding, “This is by no means the end of our fight and if the 2.5 million residents across Central Texas who depend on the Edwards Aquifer ultimately don’t get the remedy they deserve, our message will be, ‘See you in court.’”

State Rep. Mark Dorazio, who represents District 122, spoke against the project during Wednesday’s TCEQ meeting.

I have talked to city, state and county leaders. I have spoken to Republicans and Democrats. I have spoken to scientists, businessmen, and homeowners. I’ve met with Lennar and I have met with residents along Helotes Creek,” Dorazio said. “Through all of that, I keep coming up to the same conclusion: this wastewater treatment plan is unwise.

But others defended the proposal, including Helen Gilbert, who represented Municipal Operations LLC, the company behind the permit.

But this permit meets and exceeds applicable morals and statutes. It is not a serious risk, as you just heard,” Gilbert said. “With all due respect, the protestants and Representative Dorazio have not looked at the evidence.

critics accuse Lennar of choosing a cheaper and riskier wastewater solution rather than paying $20–40 million to tie into the San Antonio Water System. The proposed PID would shift costs to future homeowners through higher property taxes.

According to AEP estimates, its customers plan industrial expansions that will require an additional 24 gigawatts by 2030, driven by sectors such as data centers, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.

In addition to the technical impact, the measure will have direct economic consequences: AEP estimates a savings of US$275 million in financing costs, which will translate into more competitive tariffs for end users. It is also projected to create at least 1,100 jobs during the construction phases.

According to Bill Fehrman, president and CEO of AEP, this guarantee improves the reliability of the electric system and generates regional economic benefits. “This agreement reflects our commitment to connecting our communities with modern, affordable energy solutions,” he said.

The first 160 kilometers of modernized sections will bewill be located in Ohio and Oklahoma. After that, new projects will be progressively activated in the rest of the states involved.

The financial support comes from the Loan Programs Office(LPO), an extension of the Department of Energy designed to promote the nation’s critical infrastructure. It is also the first loan of its kind approved under the current administration, and represents a replicable model for other companies seeking to modernize their grids.

""We can see that it's been highly and usually successful,"" said Stefan Tongur, vice president for business development at Electreon, according to Crain's Detroit Business.

The system works through hidden coils under the street. Ford E-Transit vans tested the tech, which kept working despite winter storms, icy conditions, and street repairs. The results stunned skeptics.

Michigan's road planners want more. By spring 2026, they'll add charging strips on Michigan Avenue—a three-quarter-mile stretch between 17th Street and Brooklyn Avenue. Both directions will get the upgrade.

The tech isn't just in Detroit. Streets in Sweden buzz with power. Germany's roads light up with energy. Norway, Italy, France, and China have jumped on board. Utah State's ASPIRE lab started tests in September. UCLA got $20 million to wire up California's first electric road by 2028.

Cars need an Electreon part to tap the power. Some makers build it in at the factory. Others can buy kits to add it later. It's like giving your car a secret superpower.

The Michigan Avenue project will cost $70 million. The plan includes special zones for robot cars and raised paths for bikes. This fits into Detroit's big dream—a tech corridor from downtown to the highway.

Money talks tell a mixed story. Early 2025 brought in 2.3 million Israeli shekels—about $689,000. That's down from last year's 9 million shekels, or $2.7 million.

Delivery trucks could change everything. UPS and Xos Inc. signed up to try wireless power. Their trucks will juice up during stops on Michigan Avenue's new system.

More than 60 community members, Cambria Heights High School students, and local leaders attended the event to learn how solar energy projects like this one are helping state parks save money, reduce pollution, and move the Commonwealth closer to net-zero energy use.

Here’s what leaders are saying about this project at Prince Gallitzin State Park:

DCNR Secretary Dunn: “DCNR is committed to leading by example when it comes to sustainability and clean energy. As Pennsylvania’s largest public land manager, we have a responsibility to operate efficiently, reduce our carbon footprint, and show what’s possible when renewable energy and conservation go hand in hand. Projects like the Prince Gallitzin solar array demonstrate how we can save taxpayer dollars, support local clean energy jobs, and protect our natural resources for future generations. By incorporating solar and other energy innovations across state parks and forests, we’re building a cleaner, stronger, and more resilient Pennsylvania.”

DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley: “Clean, renewable energy like solar helps reduce air pollution, fights climate change, and helps meet our growing electricity needs. In May, the Commonwealth reached the momentous milestone of 2 gigawatts of installed solar energy, and in the months since an additional 160 megawatts have come online, enough capacity to power around 377,000 homes. Putting more solar power onto the grid is part of Governor Josh Shapiro’s Lightning Plan — an all of the above energy plan to create jobs, lower energy costs for consumers, and fight climate change.”

PennEnvironment Clean Energy Associate Carolena Bellini: “This solar array isn’t just a model for how public lands across PA and the nation can go solar. It is also a reminder that with creativity and drive, we can jumpstart local homegrown renewable solar projects on schools, churches, warehouses, homes, or other ingenious sites.”

Cambria County Commissioner Tom Chernisky: “The project reflects the best of Pennsylvania—innovation, stewardship, and teamwork. When we invest in renewable energy, we invest in clean air, healthier communities, and a brighter future for everyone who loves Prince Gallitzin State Park or any of our state parks. This project of solar panels and EV chargers is saving taxpayer dollars and reducing the carbon footprint. This is a win-win for taxpayers and the environment. This project will continue to help Prince Gallitzin State Park and Cambria County—a great place to live, work, invest, volunteer, and play.”

Cambria County Commissioner Keith Rager: “The sky is our future. If it means reducing taxpayer money, and it means less taxes on me and these young folk [coming from Cambria Heights High School], that's what I want to do.”

DCNR’s Solar and Clean Energy Efforts

DCNR installed the solar array at Prince Gallitzin State Park(opens in a new tab) in August 2024 — the agency’s largest to date — as part of a growing portfolio of 37 solar arrays across state parks and forests that offset energy use, lower carbon pollution, and save taxpayer dollars.

At Prince Gallitzin, the ground-mounted array reduces greenhouse gas pollution by about 700 tons annually and saves roughly $100,000 each year in electricity costs — savings that have been reinvested in park improvements such as new picnic tables and grills, roof repairs, and an electric bike for rangers. The array offsets most of the park’s electricity use, including the two public EV charging stations at the Marina Boathouse.

As Pennsylvania’s largest public landowner, DCNR manages 124 state parks and 2.2 million acres of state forests — which are free and open to the public — and incorporates climate adaptation and mitigation into everyday operations through renewable energy generation, energy efficiency, vehicle emissions reduction, and natural resource stewardship.

DCNR gets sustainability done(opens in a new tab) by prioritizing efficient operations to strengthen conservation and climate resilience for the Commonwealth. The agency’s commitment to responsible energy use includes:

37 solar installations(opens in a new tab) in operation, with 20 more in development

112 EV charging plugs at 50 locations

More than $30 million invested in energy-saving infrastructure that will pay for itself within 20 years

By 2035, DCNR aims to generate or procure all electricity from carbon-free sources

Beyond the technology and savings, DCNR’s work supports local jobs in clean energy, forest management, and recreation-based tourism, while educating and empowering Pennsylvanians to build a resilient, sustainable future.

DEP’s Solar and Clean Energy Efforts

Pennsylvania recently surpassed 2 gigawatts of installed solar capacity(opens in a new tab) — only 17 months after crossing the 1-gigawatt mark — reflecting the rapid growth of solar energy under the Shapiro Administration.

DEP is helping drive this progress through Governor Shapiro’s proposed Lightning Plan(opens in a new tab), which would create or protect more than 15,000 Pennsylvania jobs, save consumers over $660 million by 2040, and generate more than $11 billion in clean, reliable energy investments.

Updates proposed through the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS) would modernize the state’s clean energy requirements and incentivize more renewable generation as part of Pennsylvania’s electricity mix.

DEP is also advancing programs such as Community Energy projects, which would allow residents and local governments to invest in shared solar installations, and the proposed Pennsylvania Climate Emissions Reduction (PACER) program, which would establish a cap-and-invest system to limit carbon emissions and lower electricity costs. Under PACER, 70 percent of revenue generated would be returned directly to Pennsylvanians as rebates on their electric bills.

DEP remains committed to protecting Pennsylvania’s air, land, and water(opens in a new tab) — and to working with communities, businesses, and organizations to build a cleaner, more sustainable future for generations to come.

GOP districts lose $12.4 billion in investments, 15,000 jobs disappear

$542 million in new investments, 985 jobs announced in September

WASHINGTON –Businesses canceled, closed, and scaled back nearly $1.6 billion worth of large-scale factories and clean energy projects in September, bringing the total cost of projects cancelled in the private-sector to over $24 billion in 2025 alone, according to E2’s latest monthly analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker.

The latest wave of private-sector cancellations — affecting four battery, storage, and electric vehicle factories in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee — comes as the U.S. Department of Energy cancelled nearly $8 billion for over 200 projects across the U.S. that are not tracked in E2’s analysis of privately funded projects. Nearly 3,000 jobs were lost to the cancellations and scales backs E2 found in September, bringing the total number of jobs lost to abandoned projects in 2025 to nearly 21,000.

While Democratic congressional districts and states are losing the most from the administration cancelling clean energy funding, Republican districts are losing the most from private-sector cancellations. More than $12.4 billion in investments that would have created almost 15,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far in 2025. Over $7.5 billion and 5,000 jobs have been lost in Democratic districts.

Last month’s cancellations were led by major automakers scaling back electric vehicle production investments. General Motors downsized two electric vehicle production lines in Tennessee and Kansas that impact 1,600 workers. Additionally, sodium-ion battery startup Natron Energy is ending operations—closing a $40 million battery facility in Michigan that employed 150 workers and cancelling plans to open a future $1.4 billion factory in North Carolina that would have employed 1,000 workers

Following is a statement from MICHAEL TIMBERLAKE, E2 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:

“The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy—it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness. For every cancelled factory or downsized plant, behind the scenes many more projects are not being announced at all as more capital flees and businesses look overseas to invest instead. That means fewer paychecks, less local investment, and fewer opportunities for U.S. workers to lead in the industries of the future.

While other nations are racing ahead to capture the clean energy economy, these cancellations leave American communities falling further behind.”

Amid the cancellations and rising threats to the clean energy industry, businesses in September announced more $542 million in investments for new electric vehicle and solar parts manufacturing facilities, and critical grid infrastructure needed to support AI data center expansion. The projects are expected to create about 985 new permanent jobs.

Eos currently leases two facilities in Turtle Creek, where an initial phase of the project began in 2024 with the installation of a new state-of-the-art automated production line. As part of this expansion, the company will lease an existing 432,000-square-foot facility in Marshall Township in northern Allegheny County where additional production lines are planned for deployment.

Eos will also relocate its corporate headquarters from New Jersey to a 40,000-square-foot office space at Nova Place, located in Pittsburgh’s North Shore neighborhood in the latter half of 2026. This relocation will support Eos’s proprietary battery management system, software, controls, and analytics platform, DawnOS™, as well as its corporate operations. In alignment with its expanding software and engineering focus, Eos will strengthen its partnership with local universities, notably Carnegie Mellon University, to cultivate a highly skilled workforce proficient in robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and engineering.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology. I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Founded in 2008, Eos develops and manufactures American-made aqueous zinc batteries (Znyth™), currently targeting the utility, industrial and commercial sector for power storage. Designed for a decentralized, democratized, and decarbonized energy system, Eos solutions are helping to support sustainable clean energy systems and resilient power grids, while supporting American supply chains through their 91 percent domestic content.

“Eos Energy’s decision to expand its manufacturing operations in Allegheny County is a powerful testament to the value proposition this region offers at the nexus of energy, manufacturing, and innovation,” said Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development.

“Eos’ move will not only strengthen our region’s position as a hub for advanced energy storage, but it will also attract new suppliers, partners, and innovators to the Pittsburgh region. We’re especially proud that this growth comes with a continued commitment to the company’s partnerships with local universities and the United Steelworkers — ensuring that good, family-sustaining jobs remain at the center of this story. This expansion underscores what’s possible when business, labor, and community work together to build a more resilient and competitive regional economy,” continued Pashman.

The news adds to the growing momentum of energy and infrastructure investment in the area. Liberty Energy, a leading energy services provider, unveiled plans to build a cutting-edge power generation facility in the Pittsburgh region. This follows news of a $10 billion redevelopment project to transform a former coal-fired power plant into the nation's largest natural gas-powered AI data center.

In addition, Governor Shapiro’s office recently announced several major investments aimed at boosting advanced manufacturing and clean energy in the region. Mitsubishi Electric Power Products is receiving more than $6.7 million in state support toward a $92.7 million manufacturing and testing facility, while Mainspring Energy will receive $8.6 million to help fund a 300,000-square-foot clean-tech manufacturing plant.",https://www.ajot.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-22 19:24:44.918142

Key insights on the natural gas market provided by NGI's price and data analysts

Natural gas prices in Texas have seen considerable gains over the past two days amid pipeline work in the region that has curtailed flows. NGI’s Agua Dulce and Houston Ship Channel prices have jumped by 70.0 cents and 67.5 cents/MMBtu, respectively, since Monday (Oct. 20), NGI’s Daily Historical Data shows. This is slightly higher than their regional averages.

The price jump has come on the heels of increasing pipeline flow curtailments along the Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) Tejas Pipeline LLC (KM Tejas). KMI on Tuesday said capacity from south to north through the Station 2 Compressor Station would be limited by about 75% until further notice, requiring reductions to nominations. KMI has been performing emergency repairs at Station 2 since Oct. 15, though flow was initially restricted by only 12.5%, and prices appeared to soften at Agua Dulce and Houston Ship Channel in response.

Scheduled receipts on KM Tejas from interstate pipelines have averaged around 317,600 MMBtu/d since the start of the pipeline work, representing a cut of about 242,000 MMBtu/d compared to the past 30-day maximum of about 560,000 MMBtu/d, per Wood Mackenzie. The main impact has been on receipts from KMI’s Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. LLC. Similarly, KM Tejas deliveries to interstate pipelines have since averaged around 823,600 MMBtu/d, representing a cut of about 262,000 MMBtu/d versus the 30-day maximum.

There have been no significant dips in delivered feed gas to LNG facilities in Texas because of the KM Tejas pipeline constraints so far. The total day/day change in U.S. LNG feed gas deliveries was a reduction of 80,089 MMBtu from 16,899,016 MMBtu on Tuesday. Both Corpus Christi and Freeport LNG have multiple feed gas delivery pipelines in service now, each interconnecting with various interstate and Texas intrastate pipelines for daily supplies.

As such, neither terminal had meaningful reductions in daily feed gas deliveries. Once Golden Pass LNG’s export facility is online, it would also have a similar network of feed gas delivery pipelines to ensure supply availability during times of pipeline maintenance events.

Illinois Manufacturing—Summary For decades, Illinois has been a national manufacturing powerhouse, starting with steel, machinery, and agriculture, and growing into a hub for innovation, new techniques and products, and a fresh vision.","Illinois’ manufacturing sector is the backbone of its economic strength, adding more than $135 billion in value to its economy and accounting for 12.3% of the state’s GDP. It employs more than 574,700 people across over 13,000 manufacturing facilities, with a salary range averaging $106,763 annually—a figure well above non-farm incomes. In 2023 alone, Illinois exported $71.8 billion worth of goods to regions like Canada, Australia, and China.

A Brief History of Manufacturing in Illinois

Illinois’ manufacturing journey began in the late 19th century. The Union Stock Yards transformed Chicago into a national meatpacking powerhouse, which later paved the way for nationwide industrial innovation.

Additionally, the Hawthorne Works in Cicero—operating from 1905 to 1983—became one of the world’s largest telephone-equipment factories and gave its name to the famous “Hawthorne effect” in industrial psychology. Over time, the state evolved into a diversified manufacturing hub, with sectors spanning machinery, automotive, steel, electronics, food processing, and beyond.

Beyond these icons, Illinois was also the birthplace of John Deere, which was founded in 1837 in Grand Detour. Deere’s early accomplishments helped revolutionize agriculture and helped establish Illinois as a serious contender for farm machinery. Needless to say, this growth helped create more job opportunities for the state.

Throughout the 20th century, heavy industry also flourished, with Chicago’s South Works steel plant and the mills of Granite City supplying steel for skyscrapers, railroads, and military equipment. The Pullman Company had turned Chicago into the center of U.S. railcar manufacturing, with its luxury sleeping cars eventually becoming an American symbol.

During World War II, Illinois manufacturers had ramped up production to support the Allied effort, building tanks, aircraft engines, and munitions. Companies like Caterpillar and International Harvester retooled to meet wartime demand. In the decades that followed, the state transitioned into new industries.

Abbott and later AbbVie grew into global pharmaceutical leaders, and companies like Motorola were at the forefront of innovations in communications technology. This ability to adapt and diversify has kept Illinois manufacturing relevant from the 19th century to today’s advanced-tech era.

Manufacturing Companies in Illinois Today

Illinois remains one of the country’s leaders in manufacturing, as the figures outlined in this article’s opening prove. Backed by the Illinois Department of Commerce & Economic Opportunity, the state supports manufacturers with training opportunities and workforce education programs that prepare workers for high-demand jobs in advanced sectors like aerospace and life sciences.

Many of the benefits come from the state’s relatively central location. Illinois has the nation’s third-largest interstate system, the second-largest rail network, and direct access to both O’Hare International Airport in Chicago and the Mississippi River system. This makes Illinois an ideal location for suppliers, service providers, and even global exporters.

Another major export from Illinois is electric vehicles. This sector, along with clean energy, is a testament to how the state embraces innovation. One of the companies responsible for this growth is Rivian Automotive, which has transformed Normal, Illinois, into an EV production hub. At the same time, manufacturers like Medline and Lactalis continue to expand their operations in pharmaceuticals, food processing, and medical solutions.

Much of Illinois’ industry growth is due to various strategic development programs and public-private partnerships. For example, Wieland’s $500 million expansion in East Alton will preserve around 800 jobs while supporting U.S. clean energy production. Deals like this allow the state to attract more business and hire more employees, ultimately contributing to the local and national economies.

Largest Illinois Manufacturers

Rivian Automotive

Founded in 2009, Rivian is a world-renowned electric vehicle manufacturer with its flagship production facility in Normal, Illinois. The 3.3-million-square-foot plant hosts approximately 8,000 employees and produces the all-electric R1T pickup, R1S SUV, and custom electric delivery vans for Amazon. In 2024, its Illinois factory delivered 51,579 vehicles, generating nearly $5 billion in annual revenue.

Ford Motor Company — Chicago Assembly Plant

The Chicago Assembly Plant is Ford’s longest-running U.S. facility, with its business operations starting in 1924. The plant employs approximately 4,500 employees and manufactures SUVs like the Explorer and Aviator. While financial data for this particular plant isn’t publicly available, Ford reported a $184.9 billion revenue in 2024.

Medline Industries

Medline is the largest privately held U.S. medical supplies manufacturer, and is headquartered in Northfield. With about 5,000 Illinois-based employees, the company generated over $25.5 billion in net sales in 2024 and is currently preparing for a 2025 IPO that could potentially value it at near $50 billion.

Lactalis American Group

Lactalis is considered a global dairy powerhouse. The business employs over 1,600 people across its various office and plant locations, and is responsible for producing cheese and dairy brands like Président and Galbani. While Illinois-specific financial data isn’t available, research shows that Lactalis International reported over €30 billion globally, which indicates the scale and economic reach of its U.S. presence.

AbbVie

Based in North Chicago, AbbVie is a global biopharmaceutical leader with more than 11,000 Illinois-based employees. The business uses resources and tools to develop transformational medicines and products for various core therapeutic areas. In 2024, AbbVie reported $56.3 billion in annual revenue and continues to make advancements in research and development.

Illinois Manufacturing Clusters

Food Processing and Packaging

Illinois remains a national leader in food production, with Chicago often referred to as the “food capital of the world.” Huge organizations like Kraft Heinz and Conagra Brands operate major facilities in the state. This cluster supports tens of thousands of employees and is proving to be future-proof due to several new processes and sustainable packaging solutions.

Automotive and Electric Vehicles

As outlined in this article, Illinois is a major player in automotive and EV manufacturing. Several government initiatives and incentives support the state’s manufacturing cluster, which is contributing to one of the fastest-growing clusters in the state’s economy.

Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals

Northern Illinois is home to some of the biggest pharmaceutical and chemical companies. These manufacturers are constantly working on new drug development, industrial chemical production, and distribution around the world. These companies work around the clock, contributing to Illinois’ high productivity rates and growing economy.

Metals and Machinery

Illinois has a long history of steelmaking and machinery production, which remains a major part of its economy today. Despite a shift in heavy industry over the decades, Illinois manufacturers continue to supply steel, fabricated metals, and precision machinery to several other industries.

Medical Equipment and Healthcare Products

With manufacturers like Medline and Baxter leading the way, Illinois has built a strong cluster around healthcare and life sciences manufacturing. Manufacturers in these industries work hard to make medical devices, hospital supplies, and advanced surgical equipment.

Illinois Manufacturing—Summary

For decades, Illinois has been a national manufacturing powerhouse, starting with steel, machinery, and agriculture, and growing into a hub for innovation, new techniques and products, and a fresh vision. The state has a manufacturing output of over $135 billion annually, and the manufacturing sector remains one of the largest contributors to the state’s overall economy.

Looking ahead, Illinois has positioned itself as a leader in the future of clean energy and EVs, despite going strong with pre-established sectors like healthcare and food. It has an impressive track record of keeping up with new trends and interests, and there’s no doubt Illinois will continue to be a national leader in manufacturing.

It raises threats that the outbreak of conflict could leave the United States cut off from essential supply chains.
The first Trump administration, within its first year, assessed mineral production as a national security matter.
Rapid evolution of recycling technologies could also reduce the need for lithium production.","Major oil companies are drilling in East Texas again, but not for oil. This time, they're after lithium for batteries and other rare elements.

Chevron and Halliburton announced East Texas projects this summer. Exxon has acreage across the border in Arkansas. Smackover Lithium, a joint venture of a Norwegian oil giant and a Canadian miner, announced in late September the discovery of the most lithium-rich fluids ever reported in North America, measured deep beneath its Texas claims in a massive brine deposit called the Smackover Formation.

""It's ripe for development,"" said Jamie Liang, a former Wall Street banker and founder of Houston-based lithium startup TerraVolta, which is developing a lithium refinery on the Smackover with federal support. ""There's tremendous growth potential.""

Lithium mining is one of several mineral industries emerging in Texas as part of broad federal efforts to urgently establish American production of the materials required for advanced manufacturing, from batteries and solar cells to wind turbines, microchips and cruise missiles.

Competition with China looms over this effort. For much of this year, the world's two largest economies have been locked in trade tensions— and much of the ire is linked to minerals used in technology. This month, China announced new export controls on critical mineral products, including lithium battery components. President Trump, in social media posts, described China as ""very hostile"" and threatened to impose export controls on critical software and add 100 percent tariffs to Chinese imports.

Near Texarkana, the chase for lithium is backed with robust federal support. Liang's TerraVolta received $225 million from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2024 for its lithium refinery complex. This year the project was selected for fast-tracked permit review.

It will pump up the naturally metallic super-salty fluids from the Smackover, extract lithium and other minerals and then inject the leftover liquids back underground. At least two other lithium refineries are planned in the area and companies have leased tens of thousands of acres for drilling. More will likely follow as long as lithium prices stay strong.

""There's going to be a very large-scale infrastructure buildout,"" Liang said. ""You're going to be drilling wells. You're going to need those service companies. You'll need pipelines.""

Elsewhere in Texas, a mine is planned near El Paso for the rare metals used in magnets for electric motors. On the rural Gulf Coast, the Department of Defense has invested almost $300 million in a project that would process rare metals like samarium, used in jet engines, guided munitions and stealth technology. From Houston's petrochemical complex to the Permian Basin, a flurry of startups, oil majors and mining giants intend to recover minerals from industrial waste like coal ash, discarded electronics, mine tailings and oilfield wastewater in hopes of accelerating U.S. mineral supplies.

Presently, the United States produces a dribble of the raw materials. China broadly owns the global production lines, following decades of investment and securing a dominance that has raised national security concerns as well as financial risk.

The United States has just one operating lithium mine, in Nevada, where a second mine with government backing expects to begin production in 2027. Only one lithium refinery operates in the country, on the Gulf Coast of Texas.

""Our exposure to China is unacceptable,"" said Douglas Wicks, a former program director at the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Energy Department. It raises threats that the outbreak of conflict could leave the United States cut off from essential supply chains.

That's the biggest reason why federal agencies are pushing so hard to play catch-up and boost American mining, Wicks said. As geopolitical tensions squeeze the flow of globalized commerce, Washington hopes to challenge Beijing's monopolies in a battle of extraction.

""I think American industry can outproduce them,"" said Wicks, who retired this year. The United States has ""the deposits to do this.""

However, the United States has to contend with China's gargantuan economy where the state owns key industries and provides subsidies, preferential finance schemes and other market support. Still, Wicks said, the United States knows how to move quickly. Just consider the recent evolution of American oil and gas. Technical innovations and loosened environmental standards in the shale revolution turned the United States from the world's largest importers of oil and gas to a major exporter in barely over a decade. Wicks believes the United States can transform again.

In 2023, under the Biden administration, the Pentagon was ordered to establish mineral supply chains independent of China. Since then, billions of dollars have flowed to mining and processing projects across the country, spurring a rush of prospectors and entrepreneurs hoping to cash in on federal grants.

Wisk said, ""Now there's a big push in Texas to ask: 'Is there something else under the ground other than oil and gas?""

Tiny Concentrations, Big Mines

In the desert of far-west Texas, a company called Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (TMRC) had plans to dig for rare earth elements at a 950-acre Round Top Mountain site. The company won its first Defense Department contract in 2015. In January it reported a ""breakthrough,"" producing a sample of high-purity dysprosium, which is used in semiconductors and electric vehicle motors. .

These rare elements aren't actually hard to find. They're all over the world, but they exist in tiny concentrations that require a tremendous amount of effort to extract in significant volumes. The process also generates large waste streams.

TMRC had said it would crush up 20,000 tons of rock a day. The material then would soak for a month in pools of diluted acid and undergo a series of electromagnetic processes to separate and cull the much-desired minerals. According to TMRC, the rocks hold 15 rare earth elements and other metals including lithium, gallium, hafnium, zirconium and beryllium.

Some processed byproducts ""are expected to show hazardous waste characteristics,"" and ""the waste may contain naturally occurring radioactive material,"" according to a 2019 economic assessment by TMRC. It noted ""potential impacts to water quality resulting from mine operations and the storage of mine waste."" The operations are located in Hudspeth County, home to about 3,400 people, according to the latest census.

However, financial analysts have warned about TMRC's viability, amid reports of a growing deficit and lack of revenue. In July, according to analyst reports, TMRC had a ""severe liquidity crisis.""

The Round Top site is not an anomaly and, as TMRC struggles, other miners could step in, according to Brent Elliot, a geologist with the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, the state's official geological survey. There are ""many Round Top-like igneous rocks in west Texas to explore,"" he said, noting that a recent survey of the area ""has shown some hot targets that I'll go out and investigate.""

Holiday O'Bryan, a 22-year-old PhD student at the University of Texas, plans a career in mining. At a recent conference in Austin on mineral industries, she pointed out that most mining related to new technologies occurs in faraway countries, which often have lower environmental standards and enforcement. America's surging investment in extraction should be seen in context of the clean innovations it will support. Mining operations will change the landscape—particularly as the Trump administration cuts backs on regulations of federal land—and no one should be surprised by the compromises that the race for rare earths will demand, she said.

""You have to have extraction for these technologies to work,"" she said. ""In the age of the green energy transition that doesn't fly very well for someone who is trying to protect the environment.""

U.S. Mining Losses

Before 1990 the United States dominated the world's mineral markets. But domestic production dropped that decade, in part, because of rising environmental protections at home and enticing low-cost foreign production possibilities. New industries and products emerging in the mid-2010s—smartphones and Tesla cars among them—prompted a re-think of the American economy and future needs. Mining had become a lost opportunity.

""People started looking at what you actually need to be able to build things like electric vehicles,"" said Michelle Michot Foss, fellow in energy, minerals and materials at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""We started realizing, oh my gosh, we don't produce any of this stuff.""

In recent years, it became clear that China had invested in and developed a strategic market, she said. The first Trump administration, within its first year, assessed mineral production as a national security matter.

A federal mandate was laid out in a 2017 Trump executive order, ""A Federal Strategy To Ensure Secure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals."" In 2018, 35 minerals were designated ""critical"" for vulnerable supply chains and essential economic functions.

Federal funding for mineral industries expanded at pace during the Biden administration. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act injected billions of dollars into projects around the country. Notably, the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act ordered the military to remove and replace Chinese-processed minerals from its processes within four years, sparking a race to rebuild complex supply chains.

Amid escalating trade tensions in 2024, China banned exports of several key minerals to the United States.

The second Trump Administration so far has allocated billions more dollars toward mineral industries, opened federal lands to mining exploration, ordered expedited permitting for certain projects and imposed tariffs on imports from more than 90 countries. China responded with export controls on 17 minerals used in military manufacturing.

The Modern War Institute at West Point military academy has called that, ""a shot across the bow of the U.S. defense industrial base.""

Can America fill the gap? It won't be easy, said Foss of Rice University. As the U.S. mining sector faded, so did its talent, expertise and a workforce pipeline.

""Nobody knows anything about this,"" Foss said. ""Not even in the agencies themselves are there good metallurgists anymore… except for down in the bowels of USGS.""

The United States will have to develop more than mines to secure a position in global mineral markets. It needs midstream and downstream industries to process extractions—or the raw material will have to be shipped to China, which has a proficient processing capacity.

Rare earth elements are critical components of the advanced magnets used in electrical motors and generators. For every megawatt of generating capacity, a wind turbine requires 180 kilograms of neodymium, 17 kg of dysprosium and 7 kg of terbium, according to a 2023 report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at the Energy Department.

Notably, the first large-scale lithium refinery in the United States is owned by Tesla, the electric car manufacturer, and located near Corpus Christi, Texas.

Launched in December, Tesla's plant imports ore from Canada's only lithium mine for processing into battery-grade material. It will eventually use eight million gallons of water per day. That might be difficult given the water shortages there.

About 70 miles north of Tesla's refinery, another rare earths processing plant, a joint project between an Australian miner, Lynas, and the Defense Department, is also planned.

The Defense Department has invested $288 million since 2021 into Lynas Rare Earths Limited's plans for a processor near the tiny town of Seadrift, on the shore of San Antonio Bay. If completed, the mining company would oversee the country's first processor for elements such as samarium, used in ultra-high-temperature magnets for spacecraft, satellites, missile guidance systems, stealth aircraft and electronic warfare technologies.

But there's a hitch, again, tied to water issues. Lynas aims to discharge wastewater through an existing treatment system at a nearby Dow Chemical plant, according to a draft environmental impact statement dated November 2023. That same month, Texas' environmental regulators issued a draft wastewater permit amendment for Dow, which would increase daily discharge limits at one of its outfalls from 17 million to 42 million gallons.

The draft permit amendment did not mention Lynas or the reason for the sudden rise in daily discharges..

Diane Wilson, a 78-year-old environmental activist in Seadrift who has battled Dow for decades, filed a challenge to the permit amendment, questioning Dow's need. Dow's existing permit allows for about 80 harmful chemicals and metals in the wastewater.

To her surprise, Dow withdrew its application in February this year, shortly after state regulators recommended hearing Wilson's request.

""They obviously did not want us going to a hearing,"" Wilson said about Dow and the mining company. ""There is a real secret element here.""

Two months later, Lynas announced its project faced rising costs due to ""wastewater challenges,"" according to industry news reports. In August, its annual results statement noted ""there is significant uncertainty as to whether the construction of the heavy rare earth processing facility at Seadrift, Texas will proceed and, if so, in what form.""

That's when Wilson said she surmised the Lynas mining project was behind the permit request.

Lynas and Dow did not respond to a request for comment.

Minerals from Waste

In the heart of Houston's industrial complex, another Australian company, Metallium, announced in August that it had leased a fully permitted site for a first-of-a-kind facility to recover minerals from industrial and electronic waste.

Many critical minerals mined or refined in China ultimately end up in American landfills as discarded consumer electronics. Metallium aims to use flash heating technology developed at Rice University to haul in the abandoned material and extract an array of elements. The facility plans operations in 2026.

Other companies are exploring extraction of critical minerals from old industrial waste including coal ash, mine tailing and the red mud residues buried over decades at alumina processing sites along the coast. One pilot project in San Antonio is extracting the mineral graphite from methane gas.

A small landscape of startups has also cropped up around the tremendous volumes of mineral-rich–and toxic–wastewater that comes up from oil wells.

""We can basically turn an oil well into a mini-mine,"" said Jesse Evans, co-founder of a San Antonio-based startup, Maverick Metals.

This year, Maverick began producing a proprietary chemical that is pumped at high pressure into new oil wells during fracking to dissolve metal-bearing rocks that rise to the surface in the brown frothy brine known as ""produced water.""

Maverick has processes, equipment and chemicals to extract metals from that wastewater. Most startups in this space focus on lithium, Evans said. But oilfield wastewater also contains trace amounts of other metals like platinum, palladium and gold that are profitable business, he said.

""What makes the lithium space really difficult is competing with China,"" he said.

Some Chinese companies are vertically integrated from mine to factory, including Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited, the world's largest battery manufacturer. Chinese companies also face looser environmental restrictions, lower labor costs and little media scrutiny. Critically, China's state-run economy can swiftly orchestrate production surges to lower prices and crush competition—and its state-backed companies can operate at a loss for months if not years.

""We play by the rules of capitalism but a different set of rules applies to them,"" said Marek Locmelis, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin who organizes an annual conference on critical minerals.

Lithium Hopes

Beyond the need for vast water supplies, the lithium pursuit also faces environmental and technical challenges. In Texas, the methods that companies plan to mine lithium haven't yet been used commercially at scale anywhere in the world.

While traditional hardrock mines require stone crushing and grinding, the Smackover Formation contains a metal-rich brine that allows for quicker extraction.

""If you extract directly from a brine you basically skip the mineral processing step that is energy intensive,"" Locmelis said.

Existing lithium brine operations—including Silver Peak in Nevada, the country's only operating lithium mine—let fluids evaporate in ponds over 18 months to concentrate the minerals. But projects in Texas plan to use new methods that extract metals in several days.

These methods require much less freshwater than hardrock or evaporation mines but will still draw significant volumes from shallow aquifers. While water in East Texas may seem abundant, the area affected by lithium production lacks groundwater conservation districts to manage or track withdrawals, said Vanessa Puig-Williams, Texas water program director at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund.

""There is no entity that is managing the production of the fresh groundwater,"" she said. ""That's worrisome because there is no oversight.""

One Austin-based lithium startup, EnergyX, plans to use a process of ""proprietary lithium-selective adsorbents, membranes, and extractants"" which ""enables faster, cleaner, and cost-efficient lithium extraction,"" said founder Teague Egan.

The process uses about 6,600 gallons of freshwater per ton of lithium produced, Egan said, just a fraction of traditional evaporation methods.

In September, EnergyX announced a site in Texarkana for its demonstration plant, which it plans to operate early next year. The company, backed by automaker General Motors, owns 330 adjacent acres where it plans a commercial-scale refinery. Four units would come online by 2030 to achieve 50,000 tons per year of production.

""Texas—and specifically the Smackover Region—is quickly emerging as one of the central hubs for the U.S. lithium sector,"" Egan said. ""In 10 years, we believe the Smackover Region will be the largest source of domestically produced lithium.""

His vision hinges on high hopes for strong lithium prices although there is some uncertainty about that.

A trade war with China could crush the American sector. Technical advancements are making smaller batteries with less lithium and could dampen demand. Rapid evolution of recycling technologies could also reduce the need for lithium production. Scientists are developing new designs for energy storage that could eventually see lithium batteries join CD players and USB sticks in the land of obsolescence.

Egan is not dissuaded. He is betting on Northeast Texas ""evolving into a full-fledged lithium hub, with upstream brine production integrated directly into downstream refining.""

""The region has the potential to become a global benchmark,"" he said. ""Just as the oil and gas industry shaped the region's past, lithium can help define its future.""

People frequently point to the current methods of production of batteries as a reason to delay transitioning our transportation fleet away from fossil fuels. Often missing from the conversation is the widespread use of lithium batteries in the devices that power our lives and our responsibility to mitigate the impact of our consumer habits.

There are legitimate worries that the use of lithium batteries to replace fossil fuels for transportation comes with geopolitical, humanitarian and environmental baggage. Minerals are sourced all over the world including many places with less than ideal labor practices and or lax environmental regulations. The most widely discussed example is Cobalt which largely comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of the mineral refining and battery manufacturing takes place in China, although this is changing. All of these materials need to be shipped around the world using fossil fuel burning ships.

Fortunately, there are American companies pioneering the field of battery recycling who aspire to create a domestic, circular economy. Since the ingredients that go into batteries can be broken down to an elemental level, they can be recycled almost endlessly. As we improve our process of recycling battery material, we decrease the negative effects of battery production and our rechargeable devices and electric cars get greener and greener, not to mention more affordable.

While EV and hybrid batteries are almost always repurposed or recycled, we do not have such a great track record of recycling portable electronics. According to Redwood Materials (a battery recycler based in Nevada), we recycle less than 5% of the lithium containing electronics that we consume, and throw away over 150 million phones per year! We have an almost endless appetite for portable electronic devices, effectively importing battery minerals one device at a time. While the overall size of the battery in a smartphone (or any portable device) may be minuscule compared to those in electric vehicles, the percentage of cobalt is far higher and every bit helps.

If we can collectively commit to responsibly dispose of our own devices, we can have a real impact on the supply chain of battery minerals. Think for a moment about all of the rechargeable devices in your house. Headphones and bluetooth speakers, cell phones, kids toys, power tools, laptops and peripheral computer devices, even electric toothbrushes. If something is rechargeable, chances are there are valuable minerals that can be recycled at the end of its useful life. If those devices are not recycled and end up in the trash they can pose a fire risk, leach toxic material into the environment, or decompose and release greenhouse gasses.

I have committed to doing my part to bring a greener future to our children and I’m calling on all Marbleheaders to commit to the proper disposal of your own batteries. Conveniently, Staples in Vinnin Square has a consumer electronics recycling program. They will happily, and responsibly dispose of your devices; just delete any personal information and bring them in the front door to the register. If that feels like too big of an ask, please email me at marbleheadbatteryrecycler@gmail.com and I can come pick them up for you.

While fossil fuels are extracted and burned, never to be used again, there is a potential future where our cars are powered by renewables and we can nearly stop mining for battery minerals and endlessly recycle

the materials that go into the devices that we use every day. That future is a long way away, but the more obsolete devices that find their way to a recycler, the closer it becomes.

This is another important step in dismantling this unpopular effort to meddle with our home appliance choices.

The issue burst onto the scene in early 2023 when a Biden-appointed commissioner on the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced that gas stoves may need to be banned. This was followed soon afterwards by a proposed DOE energy efficiency standard that disproportionately targeted gas stoves in favor of electric versions. Only after a surprisingly strong public backlash did both agencies retreat. And now with the change in administrations, such anti-gas stove regulatory threats would appear to be over.

But the war on the blue flame runs deeper than direct regulation. For years, climate change activists have comprehensively pursued the goal of ending residential natural gas use entirely and making electricity the sole energy choice for homeowners.

To be sure, the idea that we need to switch from gas to electric stoves to save the planet is about as nutty as it gets, even by climate policy standards. Nonetheless, there are many well-funded environmental groups fanatically committed to the electrification cause. And they prevailed upon Congress to include several anti-gas provisions in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The IRA could not make substantive changes to current law – under which natural gas is perfectly legal – but it did include a number of federally funded carrots and sticks to discourage its residential use. For example, the statute provides generous rebates for the purchase of electric appliances – including up to $840 for a new electric stove – but nothing for the purchase of gas versions. It also provided cash incentives to builders of subsidized housing, but only for units that did not have a natural gas hookup – needless to say, you can’t use a gas stove if your residence doesn’t have access to natural gas. Other sections provided potentially billions of dollars to community activists and environmental groups to advance a “zero-emissions technologies” agenda, which precludes the use of natural gas. Fortunately, much of this spending was curtailed under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and pending legislation would repeal several such programs entirely.

But some such IRA spending could still slip through. This includes federal grants to state and local governments to change their building codes in ways that discourage or even preclude natural gas availability, especially in new construction. Though the grants are couched in terms of energy efficiency improvements, the intent is clear – especially in the context of the rest of the IRA – that any building code revisions should include new burdens on natural gas.

But now, DOE is rescinding several of these Biden-era grants along with others deemed not in the public interest. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright correctly questioned the merits of these federal outlays, saying their repeal would “protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy.”

The American people do not want to see tax dollars spent to take away our energy choices, especially when it comes to gas stoves, so for consumers these rescissions are good news twice over.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1164114810-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 16:05:18.788954

E2’s latest analysis shows more than $24B in U.S. clean energy projects have been cancelled or downsized in 2025 — including $1.6B in September — affecting nearly 21,000 jobs nationwide

Large battery, storage and EV manufacturing plans continued to unravel in September, according to monthly tracking from E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker. Companies cancelled or scaled back nearly $1.6 billion in planned clean energy factories last month — bringing the total value of shelved projects in 2025 to date to more than $24 billion. Nearly 3,000 jobs were affected in September alone, E2 found, and approximately 21,000 jobs have now been tied to cancelled or downsized projects this year.

The September wave included four factory cancellations or reductions across Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina and Tennessee. General Motors downsized two EV production lines in Tennessee and Kansas, affecting an estimated 1,600 workers. Sodium-ion startup Natron Energy is shutting down its $40 million Michigan plant and scrapping plans for a future $1.4 billion factory in North Carolina that would have employed roughly 1,000.

These private-sector cancellations come on the heels of a separate federal reversal: earlier this fall the U.S. Department of Energy cancelled nearly $8 billion in awards across more than 200 projects — not included in E2’s private-sector totals.

Republican districts shouldering majority of private cancellations

E2’s analysis shows private-sector cancellations in Republican-held congressional districts are disproportionately large:

$12.4B in investments and ~15,000 jobs lost in GOP districts

$7.5B in investments and ~5,000 jobs lost in Democratic districts

By contrast, the administration’s federal funding rollbacks (e.g., DOE cancellations, Solar for All claw-backs) have more heavily affected Democratic districts and states.

Some new investment is still materializing

Despite the cancellations, companies announced $542 million in new clean energy investments in September, primarily in EV, solar supply chain, and grid infrastructure tied to AI-driven load growth. Those new projects are expected to support nearly 1,000 permanent jobs.

Since federal tax credits were enacted in August 2022:

415 major projects have been announced across 42 states and Puerto Rico

$135B in planned private capital has been disclosed

125,000 permanent jobs have been tied to those announcements

Said Whitehouse: ""Unless these illegal acts stop and unless offshore wind is included, there will be no permitting deal.","A quiet hurricane season and jobsite arrival of Charybdis, the first U.S.-built and federally approved offshore wind turbine installation vessel, enabled crews building the $10.7 billion, 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project to complete work to install its 176 turbine foundations by the end of September, when pile-driving ended for the season to protect migrating North Atlantic right whales.

Installation continues of the project's 14-MW Siemens Gamesa turbines and the second of three offshore substations, a spokesman for owner Dominion Energy told ENR. ""We’ve completed installation of the deepwater offshore export cables, installed nearly 45% of near-shore export cables and also are installing inter-array cables that carry energy from turbines to offshore substations.""

He said first power is set to generate in quarter one of next year, will full project finish by late 2026.

The $715-million, 472-ft-long Charybdis, built at the Seatrium AMFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas, exceeded its original budget by about $65 million. But it has a 426-ft- crane that can lift up to 2,200 tonnes and install four turbines with each trip, says the spokesman.

The ontime execution has not been affected so far by Trump administration sector attacks, which have included orders at other East Coast sites to halt project work and stop permitting. But the US. Transportation Dept. in September canceled a nearly $40 million grant for the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics plant that was set to support the project.

""Our project has enjoyed bipartisan support from the beginning,” the spokesman said, noting the backing of leading state Republicans, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin and U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who called CVOW “important to Virginia,” as one of the largest U.S. data center hubs and military operations centers. According to Politico E&E News, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R), selayed Kiggans’ concerns directly to President Donald Trump. “I understand the priority for Virginians and we want to do right by them, so we’ll see,” Johnson said.

""The administration’s tactics against offshore wind have largely centered around trying to compel states to buy more natural gas,"" said sector analyst Philip Totaro, founder & CEO of IntelStor LLC. ""Dominion Energy already supplies natural gas to some customers in South Carolina and is pursuing a new gas-powered power plant in Chesterfield County, Va., as a backup to offshore wind.""

But all are watching the outcome of the Nov. 4 election, with new contenders vieing to succeed the term-limited Youngkin as governor, and former House of Representatives Democrat Abigail Spanberger showing a strong lead.

Her victory could result in new clean energy legislative moves in Virginia such as the 2020 state Clean Economy Act, which could focus Trump rancor on CVOW. “If Spanberger is elected to office and attempts to implement more actions similar to the [law], Virginia could become a target for the federal government, and CVOW might take the brunt of [its] fury,” Totaro said.

Meanwhile, the administration attacks on offshore wind and clean energy are set to complicate efforts for bipartisan permitting reform, said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), ranking member of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Oct.. 22,

""Why would we want to do bipartisan permitting reform during an administration that won’t faithfully execute that law, that can’t be trusted?, with unrelenting and often illegal assaults on clean energy projects,"" he said, claiming that Interior Dept. Secretary Doug Burgum ""declared that he had no interest"" in including offshore wind in a permitting reform proposal.

Said Whitehouse: ""Unless these illegal acts stop and unless offshore wind is included, there will be no permitting deal. End of story.""",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/10/21/CVOW.WEBSIZECHARYBDIS9-17-25_DSC07560-copy.jpeg?height=635&t=1761078378&width=1200,N,,2025-10-22 15:19:21.110365

The outdoor ebike charging product enables campuses to provide safe charging opportunities, which do not put buildings or people at risk from battery fires.
We’re excited to take the successes from our collaboration with Beam Global and share them with our peers across other Tribal communities.","NWIC, chartered by and located at the Lummi Nation in Northwest Washington State, is one of 35 Tribal colleges across the United States and the only accredited Tribal college serving Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Across NWIC’s main campus and five extended campus sites, the College’s students represent more than 90 different Tribal nations throughout North America. NWIC’s dedication to protecting the natural world and exploring innovative and cutting-edge technologies is evident in its programming and degree offerings, including being one of the only colleges in the world to offer a Bachelor of Science in Native Environmental Science.

As the first Tribal college to install both the BeamBike and EV ARC systems, NWIC advances its commitment to green energy, fleet electrification and tribal energy sovereignty. NWIC first deployed its initial EV ARC systems in fall 2024 at its main campus and has since installed three additional charging stations, which are used to charge the College’s electric vehicle (EV) fleet. The College also makes the charging stations available to students, staff and faculty, helping reduce transportation costs and encouraging a transition to EVs.

NWIC has further expanded its EV options by installing a BeamBike ebike charging station and will soon receive six BeamBike ebikes to be used at its main campus. The College plans to introduce ebikes for students, staff and faculty, enhancing access to clean transportation options for both community and recreation.

Beam Global’s BeamBike ensures that NWIC’s new ebike fleet is powered by clean, renewable energy with no environmental impact at the site. The project was funded by the US Departments of Energy and Education, with support from Senator Maria Cantwell’s (D-Wash.) office.

“NWIC is a visionary and influential Tribal college, showing the way forward towards sustainable, secure and independent energy and transportation infrastructure, and is protecting their environment and constituents with clean and accessible solutions” said Desmond Wheatley, CEO of Beam Global. “Beam Global is proud to be playing a role through providing our rapidly deployed, sustainable and secure products, which will assist in NWIC’s mission. We look forward to continuing to support their efforts and expanding the adoption of these solutions as they share their successes with other tribal communities in the United States.”

The BeamBike solar-powered ebike charging system generates and stores its own clean electricity, which is accessed through twelve integrated, weatherised connections, that support any ebike charger. The BeamBike charger’s onboard battery storage provides ebike charging and vital electrical outlets where there are no easily accessible utility connections and during grid outages – making it an emergency preparedness and energy resiliency asset. The outdoor ebike charging product enables campuses to provide safe charging opportunities, which do not put buildings or people at risk from battery fires.

“We’re proud to ‘drive and ride on sunshine’ and take another step toward a greener, more sustainable future” added Dr. Emma Norman, Native Environmental Science Department Chair at NWIC. “Environmental responsibility, health, and safety are core values for us. We’re excited to take the successes from our collaboration with Beam Global and share them with our peers across other Tribal communities. We also look forward to continuing our work with Beam as we explore new ways to advance clean energy and sustainability initiatives on our campuses and within the communities that we serve.”

According to Grand View Research, the global ebike market size was estimated at $61.89 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $113.64 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 10.3 percent from 2025 to 2030.

: A Pro-Worker, Green Industrial Policy for California.
From catastrophic wildfires, to dangerous heat waves, to chronic drought, California is already paying the price for climate change.
SB 787 prioritizes these industries as critical clean energy solutions for California.","Long-standing tensions between labor and climate movements have hamstrung the fight to phase out fossil fuels. Climate movements have historically overlooked the social and economic impacts of decarbonization while workers have been unwilling to give up union jobs in the oil and gas sectors with better wages and benefits than those in clean energy industries. A California labor group has a new proposal to bridge this divide and bypass a hostile federal funding landscape.

United Auto Workers (UAW) Region 6 recently released a report rallying state agencies and unions to advance clean energy projects across California, titled “Organize, Industrialize, Decarbonize!: A Pro-Worker, Green Industrial Policy for California. From catastrophic wildfires, to dangerous heat waves, to chronic drought, California is already paying the price for climate change. The UAW Region 6 report urges the state to decarbonize its infrastructure to address the worsening impacts of climate disasters.

Even though California has a $4.1 trillion economy and more clean energy capacity than most states, deep inequality means that climate adaptation and energy transitions are unlikely to reach all of its residents uniformly.

While just five Californians increased their wealth by $200 billion last year alone, most Californians are hurting, and climate change is only exacerbating their economic vulnerability. One in three workers earn less than $20 an hour, and low-wage jobs are projected to make up half of all jobs by 2030. Black and Latino workers will be hit hardest by this unstable and exploitative labor market. Yet, the costs of adapting to climate change are falling on the shoulders of working-class people. California’s largest utilities, like PG&E, are driving up consumer costs to offset spending on climate resilience projects. Since 2019, electricity bills have increased by 50 percent, and one in five customers are behind on payments. While the ultra-wealthy can absorb rising costs, poor and working-class people fall further behind.

As J. Mijin Cha, author of A Just Transition for All puts it in a recent Inequality.org Q&A, a clean energy transition is not inevitable, and even if one happens there’s no guarantee that it’ll be a just one. Unlike countries like Germany and Japan, where robust government social welfare protected workers during clean energy transitions, the U.S. ‘s already meager social safety net is being weakened even more. This summer, the Trump administration gutted programs like SNAP and Medicaid. Now, a government shutdown from partisan gridlock over the very social programs needed to help workers and communities weather a fossil fuel phaseout, signals that relying on our federal government to aid pro-worker and pro-climate policy is a dead end.

The UAW Region 6 report offers a blueprint for a new green industrial policy in California that empowers local and state-level organizing to ignite just energy transitions. The report calls for an industrial policy that deliberately shapes which goods and services the market produces, how they are produced, and how they are distributed. To put it simply, states should reclaim their power to push for clean energy over fossil fuels, enforce just and equitable labor conditions, and facilitate in-state supply chains. Yet California currently relies on its weakest policy tools, like subsidies, effectively ceding control of economic development to powerful corporations whose only metric of success is their bottom line. “Call it industrial policy by omission,” says UAW Region 6.

The result is energy markets driven by corporate profit, neglecting the long-term well-being of people, the environment, and the economy. But states have real power. The barriers to building a decarbonized future that lifts working-class living standards are largely self-imposed, argues UAW Region 6. Restrictive laws, limited technical and administrative capacity, political opposition from entrenched corporate interests, and lawmakers’ reluctance to mobilize the necessary resources to achieve their own policy goals all impede major green economic transformations.

This policy toolkit provides strategies for how the California state government can build institutional capacity to shift energy market power from private industry to public institutions, unions, and communities. This marks a stark departure from the Inflation Reduction Act’s reliance on subsidies for investors and consumers. Instead, it urges California to implement strong industrial policy reforms, such as public financing, public interest conditions, industry regulation, price management, public procurement, and public ownership and production of energy. But California still lacks a centralized authority to coordinate private market regulation or facilitate a pro-worker, green industrial strategy.

That’s where SB 787 comes in. Jointly developed by UAW Region 6 and Senator Jerry McNerney of Stockton, SB 787 would create the infrastructure necessary to oversee and implement in-state supply chains, decarbonization, and affordability in three key sectors: zero-emission vehicles and batteries, offshore wind, and heat pumps. This bill marks the first bold move for workers and the state to reclaim control from corporate interests dominating California’s industrial economy.

SB 787 prioritizes these industries as critical clean energy solutions for California. The state is home to robust renewable and clean energy resources, including enough lithium in the Salton Sea to produce 375 million EV batteries, and 200 GW of OSW potential. California also plans to install 23 million heat pumps to help decarbonize buildings, which generate a quarter of its emissions. SB 787 would establish state institutions to coordinate, invest in, and fund these projects, ensuring that community and labor voices are placed at the forefront. This includes holding companies accountable for environmental and community commitments, consulting Indigenous tribes, developing local supply chains, and expanding state-funded job training.

California can push forward bold industrial policies to give workers and frontline communities a seat at the table. But the first step, UAW insists, is building the state institutional power necessary to guide both the state and the private market toward a just and sustainable future. California has the resources. Now it needs the political capacity to build up economies that are mutually beneficial for workers, economic development, and our environment in the long-term.

“The oligarchs in Washington D.C. would have us believe it is impossible, that there’s no hope. In the labor movement, we’re used to the rich and powerful telling us what is and isn’t possible.

“It also means that solar producers don’t have to remove the vegetation that grows up between rows of solar panels, and that can reduce costs.” Turning the land cleared for a solar farm into arable land took work, and investment.

Kaylene Tomaganuk was driving home from berry picking when she saw the cars lined up near the solar farm.","In Alaska, land is easy to come by. But energy and food are not.

So when the largest solar farm in the state, which can power 1,400 homes, was built two years ago, researchers wanted to test whether food could be grown between the arrays. The rows of panels on the 45-acre site are set 50 feet apart, much wider than at lower latitudes, and they collect solar power on both front and back in order to capture the maximum amount of summer sunlight as the sun dances across the horizon all day and all night.

50 States, 50 Fixes is a series about local solutions to environmental problems. More to come this year.

This test case in Houston, Alaska, for combining food farms and solar farms, a practice called agrivoltaics, was designed as a model for other communities seeking energy and food security. Europe, which has ambitious climate goals and limited land, has been exploring high-latitude agrivoltaics in recent decades, but this is the first American project on an industrial-scale solar array.

“The purpose is to study how food and energy can be produced together, in a place where food and energy cost a lot of money,” said Glenna Gannon, an assistant professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who led the research. “Self-sufficiency is really important in Alaska.”

The experiment, funded by a $1.3 million grant from the Energy Department, was planned as a three-year project. The researchers received funds for one year of planning and one year of planting, but have not had a response from the federal government regarding money for next year. Similar federal research projects at state universities in Ohio, New Jersey and Arizona, have been paused. The Energy Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Even with only one season of data, the scientists were enthusiastic about what they could see in the rows of vegetables at harvest time.

The crops were planted in June and harvested in September. The research team set up a control plot away from the solar panels, as well as meteorological stations and monitors to track soil moisture and heat, leaf wetness and photosynthesis. Data from the solar cells included voltage, current and the temperature of panels near the crops. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the globe and the farming season in the north is extending in a way that scientists are just beginning to understand.

For these plants that grow well in shade, the solar panels offer protection from the sun during the long Alaska days.

The crops also provide economic benefits for the owners of the solar array, said Chris Pike, a former research engineer with the Alaska Center for Energy and Power, which is part of the university in Fairbanks. “It’s an income stream because farmers lease the land,” he said. “It also means that solar producers don’t have to remove the vegetation that grows up between rows of solar panels, and that can reduce costs.”

Turning the land cleared for a solar farm into arable land took work, and investment. It was originally part of a wide parcel of community land used for picking wild blueberries and lingonberries, and the land surrounding the solar farm still draws hundreds of locals, who freeze berries for the long Alaska winter.

The Energy Department grant made it possible to drill a well for irrigation, hire the local Knik Tribe to till the land, and bring in many tons of fertilizer.

The crops flourished. At the harvest in September, researchers weighed thousands of pounds of potatoes, kale and spinach, carefully logging each row and reserving specimens for study in the lab.

The bulk of the harvest went into boxes placed right outside of the gates of the solar farm. A note was posted on Facebook, inviting people in the community to help themselves.

Locals swapped kale soup recipes and loaded their cars with the free produce. Kaylene Tomaganuk was driving home from berry picking when she saw the cars lined up near the solar farm. She hopped out to get some free potatoes.

Back in the lab after the harvest, scientists carefully dried and weighed plant samples taken from the field to gauge the effects of proximity to solar panels. They cautioned that one year of data was not enough to draw conclusions. “There is a lot of year-to-year variability,” Ms. Gannon said. “Typically, you want an average of three years.”

Houston, about an hour’s drive from Anchorage, sits nestled between mountain ranges in the vast Matanuska-Susitna Valley, which has long been the agricultural center of Alaska. It was settled in the 1930s, when Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal policies gave land to farmers willing to bring agriculture to the glacial-rich soils of the valley.

Even today, the Mat-Su Valley, as it is commonly called, produces much of the food Alaskans eat that is not brought in from outside the state. But in the last decade as the area’s population has swelled, 11 percent of that farmland has been lost, sold to developers building homes for people who commute to Anchorage for work.

Bill Campbell, a retired scientist and potato specialist for the state of Alaska, said that farms were increasingly under pressure. “Farmland is shrinking, but there’s been a recent movement, in the last five or six years, to protect it and not lose Alaska’s ability to grow its food.”

Energy and agriculture have always been intertwined in Alaska. The Matanuska Electric Association, a cooperative that powers all the homes and businesses in the valley, was founded in the early 1940s by farmers, in part because dairy farmers needed to keep their milk cold.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/21/multimedia/21cli-50x50-ALASKA-stillpromo-vfqt/21cli-50x50-ALASKA-stillpromo-vfqt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:05:20.004967

ITAC delivers no-cost energy assessments to small and medium-sized manufacturers across Ohio, providing customized recommendations to reduce electricity, natural gas, and water consumption. In addition to identifying opportunities for energy savings, ITAC teams often suggest process improvements that enhance manufacturing efficiency. The program supports workforce development and innovation through engineer training and energy efficiency research.

Each ITAC director is invited to nominate one student for national recognition. Dr. Jun-Ki Choi selected Wiesemann as the University of Dayton’s nominee for 2024. From the number of submissions, representatives from the U.S. Department of Energy reviewed nominations and selected the student award recipients.

“Her combination of technical innovation and internal systems thinking has distinguished her as a creative leader within the UD-ITAC and a role model among her peers,” Dr. Choi writes in his nomination for Wiesemann.

Wiesemann’s selection reflects not only her individual contributions, but also the collective impact of the UD-ITAC team’s commitment to energy efficiency and sustainable innovation.

“This achievement means that hard work really can pay off. Hard work, not just from me, but from my team as well. Without the support of my team at the ITAC, I could have never gotten this award,” Wiesemann said. “This achievement also represents millions of dollars in recommended energy cost savings, hundreds of thousands of MMBtu energy consumption savings, and tonnes of carbon emissions saved across Ohio during my time in the program.”

Wiesemann first learned about ITAC during her junior year at UD through Dr. Andrew Chiasson, who recommended her to program director Dr. Choi. She joined the team in her senior year and began working on energy assessments.

“I knew I made the right choice to join ITAC during my first energy assessment when I realized just how involved you can get in a facility, the workers, and just how much I could learn about manufacturing and building systems,” Wiesemann said. “I truly felt that the program was a great place to learn and build experience.”

Wiesemann describes ITAC as a valuable hands-on experience that revealed the far-reaching impact of the energy sector and deepened her understanding of its role in everyday life.

“This program has given me a huge step up in understanding how intricate manufacturing facilities are,” Wiesemann said. “No two are ever the same, so having an understanding of how systems work and how to identify them is a great skill that cannot be taught in a class.”

Following her graduation in December, Wiesemann plans to work in energy consulting, attributing this passion to her time in ITAC.

“I like knowing that I can help people save money, energy, and time well after I leave the facility,” Wiesemann said. “I want to continue working in places where my work can leave a lasting, sustainable impact on a facility.”",,N,,2025-10-22 17:19:19.305848

EPA Says ""I Do"" to Biden-Era PFAS ""Forever Chemicals"" Rule (For Now)",Not Available,,,,,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/till-waste-do-us-part-epa-says-i-do-to-8427523/,"In May 2024, the EPA issued a final rule designating Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid (PFOS), two substances under the PFAS umbrella, as Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) hazardous substances.
CERCLA, however, does contain a regulatory requirement that releases into the environment of hazardous substances above an assigned threshold or ""reportable quantity"" be reported.
Chemicals listed as hazardous substances under CERCLA occur in two contexts.
There are over 800 substances listed in this manner as hazardous substances, including lead, epinephrine, chromium, and nitric acid.
EPA’s designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in May 2024 was the very first time EPA relied on this authority and designated hazardous substances through this second mechanism.","In May 2024, the EPA issued a final rule designating Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid (PFOS), two substances under the PFAS umbrella, as Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) hazardous substances.

EPA determined that PFOA and PFOS “may present substantial danger to public health or welfare or the environment” when released into the environment after considering the available scientific and technical information. For example, EPA considered that human exposure to PFOA and/or PFOS may be linked to various adverse health effects, including immune effects (e.g., antibody production and immunity), developmental effects to fetuses during pregnancy or to infants (e.g., low birth weight, accelerated puberty, skeletal variations), and liver effects (e.g., tissue damage). EPA also considered its prior toxicity risk assessment of PFOA and PFOS in the drinking water context, highlighting studies that concluded PFOA and/or PFOS may cause carcinogenic effects in humans and animals. Additionally, EPA noted that the potential health and environmental risks associated with PFOA and PFOS are compounded by the very nature of the substances—these ""forever chemicals"" are highly resistant to breaking down in the environment and can readily move through soil and water once released.

The designation of these chemicals as hazardous substances was ""on the rocks"" after President Trump's election, and many wondered if the Administration would ""divorce"" itself from the rulemaking given the President's executive orders emphasizing regulatory rollback and requiring agencies to consider costs associated with their regulations. Nevertheless, on September 17, 2025, EPA announced its intention to retain the rule.

In 1980, Congress established CERCLA (the ""Superfund"" statute) to ensure that contaminated property is remediated and that those remediation costs are efficiently allocated to responsible parties. In other words, CERCLA's end goal was to shift the cost of remediation from the public to polluters at ""fault"" for the contamination, reflecting a ""polluter pays"" public policy goal. CERCLA, however, is not ""regulatory"" or ""preventative"" in the same sense as other environmental statutes; rather, CERCLA is typically ""enforced"" retroactively (i.e., after contamination has already occurred), through the EPA’s authority to demand cleanup or undertake a cleanup. In the event EPA undertakes cleanup efforts, it also has the authority to demand reimbursement from responsible parties.

CERCLA, however, does contain a regulatory requirement that releases into the environment of hazardous substances above an assigned threshold or ""reportable quantity"" be reported. The purpose of this requirement is to inform the government of a release ""so that the need for response can be evaluated and any necessary response [is] undertaken in a timely fashion."" 48 Fed. Reg. 23552, 23553 (May 25, 1983). To that end, this reporting requirement alerts EPA of releases of hazardous substances that may threaten the environment or public health, and which may warrant immediate remedial action by the responsible party or the EPA. Additionally, many states have incorporated CERCLA's hazardous substances and reportable quantities into their state-level release reporting regulations, such as Louisiana (incorporating by reference CERCLA's reportable quantities), Florida (defining reportable quantity as the amount sets forth in CERCLA's implementing regulations), and Illinois (noting that the reportable quantity varies depending upon the substance involved and is determined under CERCLA's implementing regulations).

Chemicals listed as hazardous substances under CERCLA occur in two contexts. First, if a chemical is designated for regulation under a different environmental law—such as the Clean Air Act—then it is automatically defined as a hazardous substance. There are over 800 substances listed in this manner as hazardous substances, including lead, epinephrine, chromium, and nitric acid. Alternatively, CERCLA grants EPA the authority to ""promulgate and revise as may be appropriate, regulations designating as hazardous substances … such elements, compounds, mixtures, solutions, and substances which, when released into the environment may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 9602(a).

EPA’s designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in May 2024 was the very first time EPA relied on this authority and designated hazardous substances through this second mechanism.

Despite EPA's decision to retain the designation, the agency was also critical of the alleged ""failure"" of the previous administration to provide the ""rules of the road"" (i.e., the criteria for designating a substance as hazardous) prior to designating. To that end, EPA noted it intends to develop a CERCLA Framework Rule; this Framework Rule will provide a uniform approach to guide future hazardous substance designations, including how the agency will consider the costs of proposed designations.

Ultimately, while EPA has said ""I do"" to the rule for now, the agency appears to have left the door open for future changes, noting that it will continue to collect information on the rule’s costs and benefits. Moreover, EPA's response to this PFAS rule is consistent to the agency's overall approach to other Biden-ERA PFAS rules: signaling conditional support for the rules while scrutinizing the costs of compliance. For example, in May 2025, the agency announced it will keep the newly established National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) for PFOA and PFOS but will extend compliance deadlines and establish an exemption framework.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15384_3937.png,N,,2025-10-22 15:05:34.794825

EPA is required to review rules “with significant impacts on a substantial number of small entities” within ten years of promulgation pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA). In the Spring of 2025, the Trump Administration announced its deregulatory agenda with the announced aim to promote American energy and manufacturing. The fall 2025 agenda addresses many intensely watched regulatory topics such as PFAS, climate and energy, and environmental review of federal projects.

PFAS

EPA is on schedule to propose an amendment to TSCA’s PFAS reporting rules that would roll back the requirement that manufacturers of PFAS or PFAS-containing materials disclose their use, production, disposal, and exposures to the chemicals by October 13, 2026. The amendments would provide additional exemptions and narrow the rule’s scope.

As also recently indicated, EPA is deregulating certain PFAS and extending deadlines under the SDWA. Specifically, EPA is keeping the drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS but removing the standards for several short chain PFAS chemicals including PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS and GenX. EPA will propose a regulation this month to be finalized in April of 2026 that will provide additional time for public water systems to come into compliance with the maximum contaminant levels of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

EPA issued a proposed rule that will rescind the mandatory reporting rule for greenhouse gases (GHGs) and finalize the July 2025 proposed rule reconsidering the 2009 Endangerment Finding for GHGs under the CAA. These rules form the basis of regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle GHG emission standards under the CAA. Currently, there are almost fifty categories of facilities that are subject to the reporting rule, including those that indirectly emit GHGs such as suppliers of fossil fuels and hydrofluorocarbons and oil recovery CO2 injectors. The repeal will eliminate the reporting requirements for all but one source category: petroleum and natural gas systems (although they are proposing to eliminate the natural gas distributor systems and to give others regulated facilities until 2034 to report). A federal repeal will of course not benefit facilities who are subject to state GHG reporting requirements. Also, there have been lawsuits filed to challenge the rescission of the Endangerment Finding, among others.

NEPA

EPA is also revisiting the role of NEPA in protection of the nation’s natural environment. The current Semi-Annual Agenda touts EPA’s promise to reduce the requirements and speed up the process by which federal agencies assess environmental effects of proposed agency actions. This is to be done by the issuance of a final rule to remove existing implementing and procedural regulations for NEPA. This is a rebirth of the effort to revise the NEPA regulations under Trump’s first presidency to remove some of the burdens and delays imposed by the current NEPA review system and authorities.

Conclusion

The issues discussed in this article are just a few of the environmental regulations being reviewed by the Trump Administration and head of EPA. Others include the Exceptional Events Rule, Good Neighbor Plan and Risk Management Program under the CAA, National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Particulate Matter, and Oil and Gas Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Waters of the United States Definition under the Clean Water Act.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15384_3937.png,N,,2025-10-22 15:05:38.966715

Trevor Sandwith, IUCN, emphasised that EbA is not only a nature-based solution but also “a community-based imperative.” By rooting adaptation in local ecosystems and knowledge, EbA builds resilience while delivering co-benefits for biodiversity, livelihoods, and social cohesion.

Kathryn Goodwin, Global EbA Fund, shared an overview of the Fund’s work since its 2021 launch: supporting 54 projects across 36 countries, mobilising over USD 7.9 million, and influencing more than 50 policies to integrate EbA. “These projects are catalysts,” she said. “They demonstrate what works on the ground and help create enabling conditions for scale.”

Agroecology and Farmer Leadership in the Levant

Dr. Myrna Semaan, Friends of Nature Lebanon, shared insights from their regional project spanning Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, supporting farmers to adopt agroecological and EbA practices in a region severely impacted by prolonged drought.

“We need to understand farmers,” Myrna said. “They are among the most vulnerable, often left out of decision-making. EbA works for them because it builds on what they already know — their connection to the land, their cultural heritage, and their need for practical, low-cost solutions.”

She also highlighted linking local practice with policy. By engaging decision-makers and integrating agroforestry into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other frameworks, the project is creating pathways for scale. “Farmers should not be left alone in this battle,” she stressed, noting the importance of tailoring communication for different stakeholders and making experiences tangible rather than theoretical. “We need to speak the language of policymakers, financiers, and communities if we want to bridge the gaps.”

Trees4All: Financing Nature in Thailand

Peter Cutter, RECOFTC, introduced “Trees4All”, an agroforestry and financing initiative in Northern Thailand. The programme enables individuals to sponsor farmers to plant native trees for USD 4 per tree, with monitoring and verification through an online platform. It has mobilised over USD 124,000 and engaged 191 smallholder farmers.

“Financial incentives are just one part of the model,” Peter explained. “The key is building long-term adaptive capacity—through tenure security, diversified incomes, and community ownership.” He emphasised that demonstrating tangible outcomes to donors creates a powerful connection: “People want to see that a small contribution directly benefits a farmer and the landscape.”

Reflecting on lessons learnt, Peter highlighted the importance of connecting small-scale, ongoing adaptations to larger narratives: “It’s not the size of a single event that matters, but the accumulation of many small actions that build resilience. Collecting all these pieces and tying them together shows real change for individuals, families, and communities.”

Urban Adaptation Through Age-Inclusive Action

Hari Krishna Nibanupudi, HelpAge International, presented an urban adaptation perspective, integrating EbA into city spaces with a focus on elderly people. Their project in Bogotá (Colombia) and Mexico City (Mexico) develops age-friendly green spaces to help communities adapt to heatwaves and urban stress.

“The conversation around climate often focuses on youth,” Hari noted. “But by 2050, one in six people will be over 60. Older people bring unique knowledge and resilience. They are like grass—rooted and strong—and like eagles—with a long-term perspective.”

Through “transit walks” and participatory design sessions, older residents co-designed gardens and parks with municipal authorities, ensuring these spaces are hubs for community resilience and intergenerational knowledge exchange. Hari stressed that EbA must be communicated in ways that resonate with people’s lived experience: “When people see how it affects their lives and communities, they don’t need the technical language. Sustainability is about ensuring their ecosystem supports their livelihood for years to come.”

Scaling Local Action Through Policy, Knowledge, and Finance

Across all interventions, common threads emerged: the importance of policy integration, trust-building with communities, and flexible financing mechanisms. Myrna highlighted the need to adapt communication to each audience, Peter emphasised documenting small actions and data for storytelling, and Hari stressed rooted, community-driven approaches to build on existing local knowledge and an evidence base for greater ownership and sustainability.

Financial innovation, as seen in Trees4All, policy integration, as in the Levant project, and trust-building, as in the Latin America project, demonstrate how local EbA initiatives can influence governance, attract investment, and create lasting impact.

A proposed new corridor could open a vital connection between Midcontinent refineries and growing markets in Arizona and California.

Phillips 66 Pipeline and Kinder Morgan have announced the launch of a binding open season for transportation service on the Western Gateway Pipeline, a newly proposed refined products system.

This project aims to enhance energy reliability and address growing demand across the West.

Western Gateway is a joint industry solution that brings together two leading midstream operators to establish a new corridor for refined products from St. Louis to California.

“It’s a powerful example of how the industry can collaborate to strengthen energy reliability and meet growing demand across the West,” said Don Baldridge, Phillips 66 executive vice president of midstream and chemicals.

“The collaboration is also benefited by utilizing existing pipeline infrastructure to provide a comprehensive supply solution for the West that meets current demand and sets the foundation for future growth,” said Mike Garthwaite, Kinder Morgan president of products pipelines.

The project would combine new-build pipeline from Borger, Texas, to Phoenix, Arizona, with a reversal of Kinder Morgan’s existing Santa Fe Pacific Products (SFPP) West Line (which currently flows from Colton, California to Phoenix) to enable east-to-west flows into California. The Phillips 66 Gold Pipeline, which currently flows from Borger to St. Louis, will also be reversed to move Midcontinent barrels toward Borger and into the Western Gateway system.

The proposed Western Gateway project combines new and existing infrastructure to create an efficient and scalable corridor that addresses growing Arizona demand and anticipated California supply constraints.

“This project is about more than barrels — it’s about building resilience.

By connecting our midcontinent Refineries to Kinder Morgan’s Arizona and California terminals, we’re creating a corridor that’s not only efficient but scalable, with further optionality into Nevada.”

Michael Andrew – Managing director of midstream commercial and business development

“That optionality and scalability which allows barrels to move beyond the Phoenix market is what sets this project apart from other announced projects to Phoenix,” said Mike Garthwaite.

The pipeline will be capable of supplying up to 200,000 barrels per day of Midcontinent refined products into Arizona, replacing volumes currently sourced from California and increasing supply availability for in-state markets.

Phillips 66 will lead construction of the new pipeline and Kinder Morgan will have primary operating responsibility.

“Western Gateway will be built with the same rigor and care that reflect our core values — delivering safe, reliable fuel across the region,” said Bill Johnson, vice president of midstream operations. “Safety is where we begin, and it guides every decision we make.”

Kinder Morgan Products Pipelines Chief Operating Officer Josh Etzel added, “Our role in the Western Gateway Pipeline reflects our commitment to developing and operating reliable energy infrastructure with the highest standards of safety and performance.

Battery gigafactories, EV assembly plants, solar module factories, and advanced materials hubs are under construction from Michigan to Georgia, from Arizona to Ohio. These projects represent billions in investment and a retooling of America’s industrial base around cleaner, more resilient supply chains.

But there is a paradox behind the ribbon cuttings: The very facilities designed to accelerate a net-zero economy often generate staggering carbon emissions and waste during construction. Steel, concrete, and glass carry heavy embodied emissions. Jobsites routinely send tons of wood, drywall, plastics, and metals to landfills.

The question executives must ask is not only how to operate these plants sustainably once they’re online, but how to ensure construction doesn’t undercut the climate progress they’re meant to enable.

For corporate leaders and project sponsors, the mandate is clear: The path to net zero must start with how the factory itself is built.

THE SCALE OF THE BUILDOUT

Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, the government has announced more than$230 billion in new clean energy and manufacturing investments. While some federal programs have since been paused or rescinded under new policy directives, much of the investment momentum continues through private capital and state-level initiatives. A report from Advanced Energy United notes that at least 57 new EV supply chain facilities are already underway. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates U.S. solar manufacturing capacity will more than quadruple by 2030.

This wave rivals the mid-20th-century buildout of automotive and aerospace plants. Yet, unlike their predecessors, these factories are being constructed under the scrutiny of climate commitments, ESG benchmarks, and shareholder expectations.

THE BLIND SPOT

Construction can account for up to 50% of a facility’s lifetime carbon footprint. Heavy machinery, material transport, and embodied carbon in concrete and steel all add up. The U.S. construction industry generates more than 600 million tons of debris annually—twice the amount of municipal solid waste. While 50 % diversion is a common LEED benchmark, in practice meeting or surpassing that threshold can be challenging depending on project conditions.

For factories that will produce the building blocks of a clean energy economy, these numbers are unsustainable. A company cannot credibly market an EV plant as part of a net-zero future if its construction produces emissions and waste on par with the coal plants it aims to replace.

Forward-thinking executives are beginning to ask: How do we ensure supply chain facilities are net zero from day one? Several strategies are emerging:

1. Embed embodied carbon analysis into early design. By requiringlife cycle assessments (LCAs) during conceptual design, project sponsors can weigh options such as low-carbon concrete, recycled steel, or modular components before finalizing contracts.

2. Leverage renewable power during construction. Using on-site solar, battery storage, or renewable grid sources during construction to cut emissions from diesel generators and traditional grid power. Several projects have already piloted this, with contractors turning to hybrid power solutions.

3. Design for circularity in materials. Factories of the future must not only produce green products—they must be built from recyclable, remanufactured, or renewable materials. Sourcing from suppliers who provideEnvironmental Product Declarations (EPDs) helps ensure this.

4. Implement a zero-waste construction strategy. Setting diversion targets of 90% plus, requiring transparent waste reporting, and partnering with advanced recyclers keeps wood, metal, concrete, and plastics out of landfills. Innovative companies like DIRTT and others in the modular construction sector are demonstrating how near-zero waste goals can be achieved at scale.

WASTE AS A STRATEGIC LEVER

A zero-waste construction strategy is not just an environmental gesture; it is a financial and reputational imperative. Landfill tipping fees continue to rise, adding hidden costs. Regulators and stakeholders are demanding transparency about the ultimate destination of waste. And investors are scrutinizing ESG disclosures with greater rigor.

The solution lies in treating construction waste as a resource, not a liability. For example, manufacturers can turn clean wood waste can be into new products or convert it into renewable biomass. Scrap metals retain high value in secondary markets. Even concrete can be crushed and reused as aggregate. The technology and logistics exist—it is leadership that is often missing.

Executives should encourage contractors to adopt digital waste tracking platforms that track materials from the jobsite to their destination. They should require contracts that prioritize reuse and recycling over disposal. And they should view waste diversion metrics as KPIs reported alongside budget and schedule.

For executives overseeing the next generation of clean manufacturing and EV facilities, a few guiding principles stand out:

Set the tone early. Sustainability goals established during board approvals and RFP stages shape the entire project.

Align incentives. Contractors shift their focus to optimizing performance based on metrics used to measure them. optimize for what they’re measured on. When performance bonuses are linked to landfill diversion and carbon reduction, organizations will prioritize these goals.

Build coalitions. Achieving net zero construction requires collaboration among architects, engineers, contractors, suppliers, recyclers, and community partners.

Communicate the story. The narrative of a facility’s construction is as important as its operations. Companies that minimize emissions and eliminate waste during the build phase will gain credibility with customers, regulators, and investors alike.

A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, NOT A BURDEN

Some executives still perceive sustainable construction as a cost premium. Early adopters are finding the opposite. By reducing landfill fees, reusing valuable materials, and mitigating carbon liabilities, companies can lower costs. More importantly, they position themselves as leaders in an industry where reputational capital is linked to climate credibility.

In a competitive landscape where talent, investors, and customers weigh climate performance, demonstrating a net-zero construction strategy is a differentiator. It signals not just compliance, but commitment.

The clean factories rising across the country are not just production facilities, they are symbols of an industrial transition that will define the 21st century. But if they are built in ways that replicate the waste and emissions of the 20th, their promise will ring hollow.

Executives have a rare opportunity to ensure the infrastructure of a net-zero future is built to net-zero standards. By embedding carbon analysis into design, sourcing renewable power, prioritizing circular materials, and adopting a zero-waste strategy, they can align the act of building with the mission of the facility.

Those who lead on sustainable construction today will not only build greener factories—they will build stronger, more resilient companies for tomorrow.

A pragmatic, flexible, and technology-neutral approach is needed to accelerate the transformation and safeguard investments and jobs in the European Union.

The French-Spanish paper acknowledges that the automotive sector is facing a slower-than-expected growth in electric vehicle sales and recognises the need for flexibilities. Yet it refrains from applying full technology neutrality also beyond 2035. Additionally, ACEA recognises the need for a competitive and sustainable automotive value chain in Europe and is looking into this subject. The suggestion to link flexibilities strictly to production efforts in Europe ignores the complexity of supply chains, the time needed to ramp up battery manufacturing in the EU, and the need to bring affordable vehicles to European citizens already now.

When it comes to vans, apart from a five-year averaging mechanism, a change of the 2030 target is needed to prevent disproportionate costs of non-compliance, which would further undermine the van manufacturers’ ability to re-invest into the transformation. This vehicle segment is key to many small businesses who currently hesitate to transition to zero-emission vehicles due to higher costs of ownership, reduced payload of battery-electric vans, and lack of dense fast charging infrastructure.

Auto makers remain fully committed to the 2050 climate neutrality goal. They are heavily invested in electrification as the main pathway to decarbonising transport. Yet the reality on the ground is proving far more complex: the supporting ecosystem (infrastructure, incentives, battery value chain development) and consumer demand can’t follow the pace set by the zero-emission tailpipe target – even though the range of available and more affordable electric vehicles (EVs) is constantly growing.

What we call for is a more realistic and pragmatic recalibration of the post-2035 regime based on three pillars:

Doubling down on the enabling conditions for electrification: revising the CO2 Regulation alone will not decarbonise road transport. Stronger infrastructure targets, grid investments, regulatory reforms for vehicle-to-grid integration, and sustained demand incentives are critical to make electric vehicles both practical and economically attractive.

Link the decarbonisation targets for vehicles to two other critical dimensions – competitiveness and resilience. Adopt a tailored approach to vans, which operate under different conditions than passenger cars.

Technology neutrality: allow all drivetrain technologies (eg PHEV, range extenders, hydrogen fuel-cell, etc), which can play a viable role to reduce emissions on the roads. Additional emissions coming from a small share of non-BEV vehicles can be compensated through various levers, such as car parc renewal, a higher share of decarbonised fuel, or reducing emission in the supply chain (eg by using low-carbon steel or aluminum or higher share of recycled materials in auto manufacturing), carbon removals, etc.",https://www.acea.auto/files/ACEA-reiterates-need-for-realistic-reform-of-cars-and-vans-CO2-reduction-policy-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 14:04:47.528031

In a new update at its third quarter earnings call, the Detroit automaker said on Tuesday it is also stopping production of the BrightDrop electric delivery van.
Although BrightDrop promised lower maintenance costs on electric commercial vehicles, several recalls in 2024 and 2025 hurt confidence in the brand.
Approached by TechCrunch on Tuesday, General Motors said that that BrightDrop dealers will “continue to sell and service vehicles as we work through remaining inventory.” Last month, Amazon confirmed it was piloting General Motors’ BrightDrop electric delivery vans.
By then, Rivian committed to deploy 100,000 commercial vans to the retail giant by 2030.","General Motors said last week it incurred over $1.6 billion in costs due to a change in its EV strategy.

In a new update at its third quarter earnings call, the Detroit automaker said on Tuesday it is also stopping production of the BrightDrop electric delivery van.

Addressing the billion-dollar impairment, CEO Mary Barra guaranteed that GM’s “retail product lineup remains unchanged.”

The comments were made media reports suggesting that the company was halting production of several EV models in the US.

“However, we have decided to stop BrightDrop production at CAMI Assembly and assess the site for future opportunities,” the chief executive stated, adding that it was “not a decision we made lightly” due to the impact on employees.

Manufacturing operations in the Canadian assembly plant had already been suspended since May, with GM citing demand.

By then, 500 people were laid off.

BrightDrop was unveiled in 2021 as a start-up backed by General Motors. The launch took place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a global e-commerce surge.

Later, the startup was integrated into the Detroit automaker’s fleet business, GM Envolve.

According to Barra, the production shutdown announced on Tuesday is justified mostly by a sluggish market for commercial EVs.

“The commercial electric van market has been developing much slower than expected,” the CEO said, while “changes to the regulatory framework and fleet incentives have made the business even more challenging.”

The impact of the decision has not been reflected in the third quarter financial results, with the company stating that its “actions on BrightDrop and our ongoing work to reset our capacity will cause us to recognize a charge in the fourth quarter.”

Mary Barra said the automaker estimates EV losses to decrease starting from 2026.

“By acting swiftly and decisively to address overcapacity, we expect to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond, making us much better positioned as demand stabilizes,” the chief executive added.

Although BrightDrop promised lower maintenance costs on electric commercial vehicles, several recalls in 2024 and 2025 hurt confidence in the brand.

To rebuild trust, GM moved BrightDrop under Chevrolet’s commercial division, hoping to leverage Chevrolet’s reputation as a reliable brand.

Approached by TechCrunch on Tuesday, General Motors said that that BrightDrop dealers will “continue to sell and service vehicles as we work through remaining inventory.”

Last month, Amazon confirmed it was piloting General Motors’ BrightDrop electric delivery vans.

The pilot involved about a dozen vans, according to the company.

“We’re committed to having 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030, and we regularly test various vehicle options,” an Amazon spokesperson told Bloomberg back then.

The news caused Rivian shares to fall as concerns on the two companies’ exclusive partnership for EDV deployment rose.

Amazon, which is also Rivian‘s largest institutional shareholder, was one of the first backers of the Irvine-based EV maker in 2019.

By then, Rivian committed to deploy 100,000 commercial vans to the retail giant by 2030.

The company founded by Jeff Bezos introduced the custom-built vans in its fleet in mid-2022.

Amazon had more than 30,000 Rivian vans on US roads as of June 2025, having added 10,000 units in the first six months of the year.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/brightdrop1_converted_converted_converted.webp?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-22 15:05:52.709802

The latest wave of private-sector cancellations includes the cancellation of grid-scale battery storage and EV manufacturing facilities in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina and Tennessee, said E2.

Along with the private sector cancelations, federal funding is being yanked in staggering amounts. In October, the Department of Energy announced the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 energy projects, resulting in “savings of approximately $7.56 billion dollars for American taxpayers,” said the agency in a press release. The cancellations were exclusively in historically Democrat-led states.

The cancellations mark a reversal from an unprecedented run of clean energy investment since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Since the nation’s largest-ever climate and energy spending package was passed, nearly $135 billion in private investment has been announced.

For the solar industry, over $18 billion in investment announcements were made since the IRA’s passage, leading to an expected 32,803 jobs. Of that total, $2.8 billion of private investment has been cancelled, leading to the loss of 2,381 jobs.

“The loss of these projects isn’t just a setback for clean energy—it’s a setback for America’s workers and competitiveness,” said Michael Timberlake, communications director, E2. “For every cancelled factory or downsized plant, behind the scenes many more projects are not being announced at all as more capital flees and businesses look overseas to invest instead. That means fewer paychecks, less local investment, and fewer opportunities for U.S. workers to lead in the industries of the future.”

Despite the widespread cancellations, new investments were also made. Businesses in September announced more $542 million in investments for new electric vehicle and solar parts manufacturing facilities, and critical grid infrastructure needed to support AI data center expansion, said the report. The projects are expected to create about 985 new permanent jobs, said E2.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/President_Trump_Delivers_Remarks_and_Signs_an_Executive_Order_on_Energy__Infrastructure_47534098122-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 14:05:07.928868

Permitting Progress and Improvements

NAHB thanked the agencies for moving quickly to develop a new definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS), including existing interpretation of “continuous surface connection” in accordance with the Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA decision. NAHB also emphasized the importance of the Corps reissuing nationwide permits (NWPs) for impacts to federally regulated wetlands and streams. Nearly 90% of federal wetlands permits are issued under NWPs, and this essential permitting program will stop issuing permits on March 16, 2026, unless the Corps finalizes a rule to reauthorize it.

In addition to discussing the forthcoming WOTUS rule and reauthorization of the NWP program, NAHB offered recommendations to improve federal wetlands permitting and compensatory mitigation requirements.

Specifically, NAHB urged EPA and Corps leadership to:

Pursue additional regulatory reforms — such as increasing NWP acreage eligibility and raising the threshold for mandatory compensatory mitigation — to help fulfill President Trump’s permitting reform directives.

Expand the availability and lower the cost of mitigation credits.

Impact of Government Shutdown

With most rulemakings on hold amid the ongoing federal government shutdown, NAHB anticipates that Corps District Offices, which issue CWA Section 404 permits and jurisdictional determinations, will suspend permitting activities in early November due to a lapse in federal appropriations.

OPINION – Sept. 30 was the last day of the generous, sales-boosting federal subsidies for electric-vehicle purchases. It was also the final day that EVs could access carpool lanes with only the driver in the car.

For years, various low- and zero-emission automobiles have been the darlings of policymakers, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom, former Gov. Jerry Brown, a host of Sacramento lawmakers, activists and consumers who felt the need to show off their green bona fides. To the astonishment of no one, they became particularly popular in California. But now a curiosity arises: How will their popularity fare without special government treatment?

Up until Oct. 1, buyers were eligible for a federal $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and plug-in hybrids and up to $4,000 for used EVs and plug-ins. The subsidy was wiped out by the One Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. “Experts,” the media tell us, are warning that sales will “crater.”

Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press that after summer’s “rush to the dealership to take advantage of these incentives” that “there’ll be almost no buyers” in the next three to six months.

“The consumer is going to think, ‘I don’t get $7,500 off the car and it already is priced more than a gasoline vehicle … and it loses range in cold weather so, why am I buying this car?’ ” Brauer said.

A Cars.com survey taken in September found that 78% of “EV and plug-in hybrid shoppers” say the tax incentive “plays a major or contributing role in their decision.” Ford expects that demand for EVs will collapse by in half in October.

California had its own incentive structure. But it, too, has expired.

Maybe policymakers were a bit hasty in coercing Californians to adopt putatively “green,” or zero-emission, vehicles.

“We made a big mistake getting hung up on EVs,” says transportation analyst Randal O’Toole. “A thousand cars that get 40 to 60 miles to the gallon can do a lot more to protect the environment than a hundred EVs, especially since most of the electricity used to recharge those EVs comes from burning fossil fuels. If we were going to give people incentives, they should have been incentives to buy vehicles that use less fuel per mile of driving, not incentives to buy a particular technology.”

But then that’s “if we need to do anything at all,” which O’Toole isn’t “convinced that we to do.”

Making EVs and other “clean” cars even less attractive to buyers is the wrap-up of California’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal Program that allowed them to use the carpool lanes. In its early days, it “incited an EV boom, and a slew of societal changes,” says the San Francisco Chronicle.

More than 1 million decals have been issued since California’s program started in 1999. But Congress declined to reauthorize a provision in federal law that has allowed these cars to drive in high-occupancy vehicle lanes for decades. At least two members of California’s congressional delegation are part of an effort to extend the rule to 2031, but so far they’ve been unsuccessful.

Opinions differed when the program was new. Some were convinced that California’s air would be cleaner due to the consumer incentive to buy cars that produced fewer emissions.

But that didn’t happen, says Steve Milloy of Junkscience.com. Increased EV usage might have reduced levels of ozone or particulate matter, “but that is a distinction without any meaning since the air was clean and safe everywhere 20 years ago.”

Others were uneasy that the carpool lanes would eventually jam up with hybrids and EVs – which was a concern from the beginning – and the environmental benefits would never materialize. O’Toole would be among the latter. He says there’s been “no evidence that the air is cleaner because EVs have been free to tie up fast-lane traffic.”

Baruch Feigenbaum, a Reason Foundation transportation analyst, says “there was never a transportation justification for EVs to use HOV lanes,” anyway. “HOV lanes should be about encouraging carpooling, vanpooling, and bus transit usage.”

So again we have public policy intended to manipulate private behavior and hand politically chosen technology an unearned advantage in the marketplace. The lesson that should be learned is that government meddling produces outcomes, some foreseen, some not, that have consequences.

Bradford is expected to see a big boost in green energy jobs in the coming years, with a new hydrogen production facility planned for Bowling Back Lane.

The Government announcement includes a pledge to create five new Technical Excellence Colleges to help train young people into essential roles, work to “harness the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans” and programmes to train up ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed to work in the clean energy sector.

Making the announcement, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call, and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

“Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union, agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, Leader of Bradford Council said: “I welcome the Government’s support for clean energy jobs which will help build on our collaborations with businesses, communities and partner organisations to accelerate green jobs and growth in the district.

“Bradford is setting the pace for clean energy innovation, with construction soon beginning on the UK’s largest low-carbon hydrogen production facility at Bowling Back Lane.

“Once operational, it will produce 12.5 tonnes of hydrogen daily, support 125 skilled jobs, and inject £120 million into the local economy.

“We recognise our role in building a cleaner, greener, healthier and more prosperous future. We’re actively pursuing funding and partnerships that unlock long-term employment opportunities for clean energy workers.

“This is about building a cleaner, fairer, and more prosperous future that is powered by green jobs for everyone in the Bradford district.”

The permits will allow ExxonMobil to convert three state-approved test wells into full-scale injection wells capable of storing up to 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Over a 13-year period, the company could sequester as much as 53 million metric tons, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 11 million cars.

Here are 5 ways how",The Associated Press,,,,,https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2025/10/22/ai-energy-efficiency-emissions-reduction/,"But scientists are also experimenting with ways that AI can help people and businesses use energy more efficiently and pollute less.
Experts say that if uses like these continue to grow, they could help offset the energy consumed by AI.
Combined, these automations can reduce a building’s energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.
Finding geothermal hot spots Salt Lake City-based geothermal energy startup Zanskar has built AI models to understand the Earth’s subsurface.
Passenger cars and small trucks account for about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.","Artificial intelligence has caused concern for its tremendous consumption of water and power. But scientists are also experimenting with ways that AI can help people and businesses use energy more efficiently and pollute less.

Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world’s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities’ energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.

But when AI’s computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.

Experts say that if uses like these continue to grow, they could help offset the energy consumed by AI.

“I am pretty optimistic that while more and more AI use is going to continue to increase,” said Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia University Climate School, “we’re going to see our ability to process be much more efficient and as a result, the energy consumption won’t go up as much as some are predicting.”

Building efficiency: Maintenance, cooling

AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.

Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers’ arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker’s instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it’s not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.

For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.

AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.

Combined, these automations can reduce a building’s energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.

“That’s literally a super low-hanging fruit,” said Zoltan Nagy, professor of building services at Eindhoven University of Technology.

Finding energy- and cost-efficient times for EV charging

AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.

This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it’s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.

“Let’s say it’s a peak period when everybody’s got their air conditioning on, and I walk in my house and I plug in my car and I have it set up such that my car doesn’t start charging right away because it’s peak period time,” Abramson said.

In California, a pilot program shifted charging to times where there was more renewable energy available, and saved customers money.

AI can also help optimize how homeowners with solar panels store excess energy in batteries.

Reducing methane flaring from oil and gas operations

Boston-based Geminus AI uses deep learning and advanced reasoning to help oil and gas companies reduce methane flaring and venting, and reduce the amount of energy they use in extracting and refining.

Reducing methane emissions is among the fastest pathways to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

When pressure in oil and gas pipes builds up, some of the gas is released and burned to relieve the pressure, harming the planet and wasting money.

Geminus CEO Greg Fallon said they can monitor the network of wells and pipes and use AI-driven simulations to suggest changes to compressor and pump settings that eliminate the need for venting and flaring. Geminus does this in seconds. Traditionally it takes engineers about 36 hours to run simulations that make similar recommendations, Fallon added.

“As we scale this across the industry, there’s a massive opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Fallon said.

Finding geothermal hot spots

Salt Lake City-based geothermal energy startup Zanskar has built AI models to understand the Earth’s subsurface. It’s using that modeling to find overlooked geothermal hot spots and target drilling.

Geothermal creates electricity cleanly by making steam from the Earth’s natural heat and using it to spin a turbine. It’s one renewable energy the Trump administration favors.

Zanskar co-founders Carl Hoiland and Joel Edwards say they simulate and assess a huge number of possible subsurface scenarios to estimate where there are pockets of very hot water. From this, they pick optimal locations and drilling directions.

“AI is becoming the solution to its own energy problem,” Hoiland, the CEO, said. “It’s showing us a way to unlock resources that weren’t possible without it.”

Last year, Zanskar purchased an underperforming geothermal power plant in New Mexico. Their AI modeling successfully indicated there was an untapped geothermal reservoir that could repower the facility.

Next, Hoiland and Edwards focused on another site in Nevada, despite industry experts telling them it was too cold to support a utility-scale power plant. They drilled and announced their second geothermal discovery in September at that site.

Reducing traffic emissions

Google is using artificial intelligence and Google Maps data to identify traffic light adjustments that can reduce stop-and-go traffic to lower pollution. Passenger cars and small trucks account for about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.

Launched in 2023, Project Green Light is now in 20 cities on four continents. The most recent is Boston, which has notoriously bad traffic.

Each city gets AI-generated recommendations. City engineers determine which to implement. Google says Project Green Light can reduce stop-and-go traffic by up to 30%, which cuts emissions by 10% and improves air quality.

“We’re just scratching the surface of what AI can do,” said Juliet Rothenberg, Google’s product director of Earth and resilience AI.

SB 711 continues nonconformity to interest expense limitations under IRC § 163(j).","After nearly a decade of lagging behind federal tax updates, California has finally hit “refresh.” Signed into law on October 1, 2025, Senate Bill (SB) 711 delivers the most sweeping overhaul of California’s tax conformity rules since 2015.

The legislation advances the state’s conformity to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2025, for taxable years beginning on or after that date, thereby bringing California into line with hundreds of federal tax changes made over the past decade. This alignment is designed to simplify compliance and reduce costly inconsistencies between federal and state returns. But conformity also comes with caveats, and taxpayers will need to understand where California continues to chart its own course.

The major changes introduced by SB 711

Updating California’s IRC “conformity date” to January 1, 2025, the bill incorporates several federal amendments enacted during the last decade. For example, one major innovation in SB 711 is the overhaul of California’s research credit. Starting in 2025, taxpayers may use the Alternative Simplified Credit method under IRC § 41(c)(4), which was adjusted with lower state percentages for qualified research expenses (3% and 1.3% instead of 14% and 6%). Other notable modifications include conformity to federal limitations on IRC § 1031 exchanges to real property and the elimination of the deferral for exchanges of certain non-real property.

Of course, many instances of nonconformity to recent federal enactments remain, including:

Corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). SB 711 continues to exclude the new federal CAMT, created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), from conformity.

Renewable energy credits. SB 711 does not adopt the clean energy credits added under the IRA.

Net operating loss rules. California continues to diverge from federal carryback and carryforward limits.

IRC 163(j). SB 711 continues nonconformity to interest expense limitations under IRC § 163(j).

One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) (P.L. 119-21). Because SB 711 conforms to the IRC as of January 1, 2025, it does not include changes made under the OBBBA, which was signed by US President Donald Trump earlier this year.

Preparing for the transition

SB 711 applies to both the personal income tax and corporation tax regimes for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. Taxpayers should begin modeling how the new conformity affects their liabilities and planning strategies. Key steps include:

Reviewing federal provisions now incorporated into state law.

Identifying exceptions and modified rules applicable to your business or filing type.

Consulting tax professionals to evaluate the impact on research and development incentives, loss carryovers, and credit eligibility, among others.

Monitoring California Franchise Tax Board guidance as the agency clarifies implementation details over the coming months.

Bottom line

SB 711 represents California’s latest move to more closely synchronize its tax code with the modern federal landscape. The reform promises greater clarity, fewer compliance headaches, and a more innovation-friendly framework. Yet, with selective decoupling and transitional complexities, taxpayers will need to remain vigilant. In short, California may finally be closer to being in sync – but understanding the fine print remains essential.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.5223_4824.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 13:02:07.050826

“The commercial electric van market has been developing much slower than expected and changes to the regulatory framework and fleet incentives have made the business even more challenging,” said CEO Mary Barra.
In May, GM paused production of the BrightDrop 400 and 600 models, and laid off 500 workers.
Now the company has abandoned it less than 36 months after the first electric van rolled off the line.
Rivian sold 6,809 of its electric vans through Q3, and Ford sold 4,174 units of its E-Transit in the first half of the year.","General Motors has ended production of BrightDrop electric delivery vans at its CAMI Assembly plant in Ontario, bringing an end to the automaker’s commercial EV program. The company announced the news alongside its third-quarter earnings.

“The commercial electric van market has been developing much slower than expected and changes to the regulatory framework and fleet incentives have made the business even more challenging,” said CEO Mary Barra.

The move wasn’t unexpected. In May, GM paused production of the BrightDrop 400 and 600 models, and laid off 500 workers. The company said it planned to reopen the factory in July, but that didn’t happen. As InsideEVs reports, “BrightDrop vans have been piling up in lots on either side of the Canadian border for months.”

The end of federal EV incentives is hitting the commercial segment hard—buyers of commercial EVs could previously claim an incentive of up to $40,000 per vehicle. Pro-EV policies at the state level have also been rolled back.

However, governments have been alternately blowing hot and cold on electrification for decades, and one would think automakers might have learned to deal with this reality by now. Some experienced GM-watchers see the reversal as part of a pattern of inconsistency and indecisiveness that dates back to the days of the EV1. “Standard procedure from GM. Come up with a good idea, invest in it and then drop it like a rock before it can get going,” commented one of Electrek’s readers.

GM invested plenty to retool CAMI as a “full-scale EV manufacturing plant,”—and so did Canadian taxpayers, to the tune of $500 million. Now the company has abandoned it less than 36 months after the first electric van rolled off the line.

Urban delivery vans are an excellent use case for EVs, and everyone who doesn’t have gasoline running in their veins expects the market to grow. Rivian sold 6,809 of its electric vans through Q3, and Ford sold 4,174 units of its E-Transit in the first half of the year.

Electrek reports that BrightDrop was on track to sell around 4,000 units this year.

The Unifor auto union, which represents the 1,200 workers expected to be laid off in Ontario, is also displeased with the decision, which it blamed on the “dangerous and destabilizing auto policies” of the current US administration.

As automakers always do when they announce the cancellation of EV programs, Ms. Barra insisted that GM remains committed to electrification, adding that the end of BrightDrop is part of a strategy to “right-size” the company’s EV strategy.

As Motor Trend reports, “Barra thinks the market will shake out as competitors who were selling EVs at discount for regulatory compliance will be weeded out.”

Some of us fear that GM itself will be one of those weeded out—or perhaps confined to a small patch of weeds in the global garden—as low-priced Chinese EVs complete their conquest of non-US markets around the world.

Barra and her team, however, are betting that the market for ICE vehicles in the US will continue to grow. GM announced net income of $1.3 billion for the quarter, notwithstanding a write-off of $1.6 billion for the company’s mounting EV-related missteps. The company raised its guidance for the year and now expects adjusted earnings of $12-13 billion.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2025-chevrolet-brightdrop600-.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 13:02:02.560677

The Bad Lauchstädt Energy Park shows the economic viability of the hydrogen sector in Europe","The international community is fast-tracking the deployment of hydrogen projects across several nations. In that vein, Germany’s renewable energy sector has been boosted by the news that the Bad Lauchstädt hydrogen project has moved passed the planning, towards the assembly phase. Germany is among the European nations that have embraced the renewable energy sector with open arms. More than half of 2024’s energy consumption in Germany came from the renewable energy sector.

Germany has become the cornerstone of the renewable energy sector in Europe

While the inevitable transition away from fossil fuels has led many nations to search for viable alternatives to meet energy demand, Germany has taken a significant step toward becoming the regional leader in the practical deployment of hydrogen projects.

For any project, navigating through the planning phase towards the assembly phase is a crucial milestone. Germany is universally renowned for its exceedingly efficient engineering prowess and attention to detail. So it should come as no surprise that the nation has passed the planning phase of the hydrogen facility at the Bad Lauchstädt energy hub in central Germany.

Germany’s government reported that the first electrolyzer stacks have arrived at the Bad Lauchstädt Energy Park, marking a major step towards the commissioning of the hydrogen plant. This delivery marks the beginning of assembly for what will become one of Europe’s largest hydrogen pilot facilities.

The delivery of the electrolyzer stacks follows years of planning by the consortia, which is made up of VNG Handel & Vertrieb GmbH and Uniper. The electrolyzer was built by Sunfire in Dresden and features advanced alkaline electrolysis technology. The project forms part of a broader initiative being developed by the German government to increase the standing and reputation of the renewable energy sector.

“The technology used works and is suitable for practical use. The energy transition and industry belong together. Climate targets can only be achieved through industrial implementation.” – Bad Lauchstädt hydrogen project leader

The milestone highlights not just technical progress, but growing investor and political confidence in hydrogen

Hydrogen has been lurking in the shadows of the international energy sector for a very long time, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to overtake solar power as the go-to renewable energy source. However, several nations have stagnated in their approach to the hydrogen sector, citing increased operating costs and a lack of investment.

Once the assembly of the electrolyzer stacks is complete, the technical commissioning of the 30 MW electrolysis plant will begin and is due to be completed by the end of the year.

The pressurized alkaline electrolyzer consists of three modules, each with an output of 10 MW. The milestone assembly of these electrolyzers marks a significant shift in Germany’s energy sector as it aims to increase its reliance on the renewable energy sector. As the largest energy countries in the world invest billions of dollars in hydrogen, Germany has taken a step towards becoming the cornerstone of the European hydrogen sector.

The limiting factor for AI isn't talent, computing power, or algorithms. It's power. And that's not a distant problem. It's happening now.

These aren't quiet tech facilities anymore. They're the energy equivalent of manufacturing plants.

McKinsey estimates data centers will account for over 14% of US power demand by 2030, triple their current share.

While governments debate long-term projects and contend with permitting gridlock stretching 7-10 years, private capital is solving the immediate problem through pragmatic infrastructure redesign.

American Electric Power's $1.6 billion DOE loan to reconductor 5,000 miles of existing transmission rights-of-way is instructive. Reconductoring within existing corridors adds meaningful capacity on a faster, lower-risk timeline, avoiding delays. It's not glamorous, but it's bankable, repeatable, and aligned with AI's timeline.

When centralized infrastructure can't move power where needed, companies internalize the solution. Brookfield's $5 billion commitment to Bloom Energy's solid-oxide fuel cells reflects this—on-site generation that sidesteps grid limitations. That's baseline infrastructure design now.

Clean energy VC hit $12.5 billion in 2024, an all-time high. The pattern is unmistakable: solar plus gas plus storage. What’s needed now isn’t ideological purity. It’s deployed infrastructure that works today. It’s solar for scale, gas for baseload, storage for flexibility and on-site generation where grids can't deliver.

Utility-scale solar deploys in 24 months. Conventional gas requires years of permitting and construction. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are entering the discussion as the high-density nuclear solution for future AI scale. Amazon announced plans to deploy over 5 gigawatts of X-energy's SMR technology by 2039.

Meanwhile, securing critical minerals, embedded in advanced semiconductors and grid infrastructure, is as strategic as locking in power supply itself. China's control over rare earth and battery materials means energy and materials sovereignty are now inseparable. China’s grip on rare earths isn’t just about mining. They also hold sway over refining and processing. At the same time, recent export controls from Beijing have tightened the flow of key materials like neodymium and dysprosium, forcing Western manufacturers to scramble for alternative sources and rethink supply chain resilience.

While governments debate moonshots like fusion, private equity, sovereigns, and strategics are funding near-term, deployable megawatts. Infrastructure vehicles blending equity and long-tenor debt are acquiring land, interconnection rights, and scalable generation platforms because the winner in AI isn't the one who writes the best model card; it's the one who locks power early and close to load.

If you're developing energy infrastructure, AI demand is creating immediate, bankable opportunities around transmission modernization, on-site generation, and storage. Projects that move fastest capture outsized value.

And if you're operating AI infrastructure, Energy strategy is now a core competitive lever. Location, power sourcing, and supply chain resilience shape your margin and risk.

The operators asking ""where do we build and how do we power it?"" are already winning against those still asking ""what do we build?""

For energy lawyers and deal advisors: These aren't traditional utility transactions. They're capital-intensive, multi-jurisdictional projects moving at unprecedented speed. The firms that navigate regulatory complexity while keeping projects on timeline will drive significant value.

The race for AI leadership is being decided in the energy deals being closed right now. The question is whether your organization is building the infrastructure to win it or waiting to see who does.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16337_2239.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 13:19:29.931647

A UN panel has approved the first methodology under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement. This marks the start of a new era in international carbon trading. The system will help countries and companies offset emissions under one global standard.

A New Chapter for Global Carbon Markets

Article 6.4, also known as the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM), aims to build a global market where countries can trade verified emission reductions. It replaces the old Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) from the Kyoto Protocol, which registered more than 7,800 projects between 2006 and 2020. This new system makes sure carbon credits come from real and measurable emission cuts.

The UNFCCC Supervisory Body met in mid-October 2025 to review new market methods. Their approval of the first one marks a major step for climate finance projects around the world.

The first approved method supports renewable energy projects, especially small wind and solar developments in developing countries. These projects are key to reducing emissions and expanding access to clean energy.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) says renewable energy in developing economies must triple by 2030 to reach global net-zero goals.

What Article 6.4 Means

Article 6.4 is part of the Paris Agreement’s cooperation plan. It lets one country fund emission reduction projects in another country and count those reductions toward its own climate goals. The system aims to:

Stop double-counting of emission reductions.

Improve transparency through strict monitoring.

Build trust between developing and developed nations.

This system will help countries meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) faster. The World Bank estimates that NDC cooperation could cut up to 5 billion tonnes of emissions annually by 2030. It could also unlock around $250 billion in climate finance each year, giving investors a clear way to support credible carbon projects.

At COP29 in Baku, world governments agreed on a new global climate finance goal for after 2025. They pledged to scale up funding for developing countries to at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 from public and private sources.

Developed nations will lead by mobilizing $300 billion annually, expanding on the earlier $100 billion target. The agreement allows developing countries to count their own contributions voluntarily. It also includes all multilateral development bank (MDB) climate finance. This aligns with expert estimates that developing nations need $3.1–3.5 trillion yearly by 2035 to meet climate investment and adaptation goals.

From Rules to Real Markets

Until now, discussions around Article 6.4 have focused mainly on rules and design. The panel’s decision moves the system from theory to action. It shows that global carbon trading is ready to begin.

Experts predict global demand for carbon credits could reach 2 billion tonnes by 2030, and as high as 13 billion tonnes by 2050. The UN wants to make sure only verified, high-quality credits enter this fast-growing market.

Developing nations stand to benefit the most. Many have strong potential for renewable energy, reforestation, and methane reduction projects. Africa alone could supply up to 30% of the world’s high-quality carbon credits by 2030. These projects could create billions in new revenue for clean growth.

The new methodology allows these projects to earn credits that can be sold internationally, helping communities build clean energy and adapt to climate change.

Ensuring Integrity and Transparency

Old carbon markets faced criticism for weak integrity and unclear reporting. Article 6.4 aims to fix that. Every project must pass strict checks by independent auditors before earning credits. Credits will only be issued if real emission cuts are proven.

The Supervisory Body’s framework includes steps for:

Setting clear baselines for emissions.

Measuring reductions over time.

Monitoring performance using standard tools.

This process will help rebuild trust and attract new investors. Each credit will have a digital record, allowing buyers to trace where it came from and what impact it had.

Countries and companies with net-zero targets will finally have a credible tool to meet their goals. Over 160 nations now have net-zero pledges. Around 60% of global companies already use or plan to use carbon credits to reach their climate goals.

How Business and Finance Are Responding

The approval of the first methodology will draw major interest from the energy and finance sectors. Many firms have been waiting for a reliable, UN-backed system.

The voluntary carbon market was worth about $2 billion in 2023, according to McKinsey. It could grow to more than $100 billion by 2030 as Article 6.4 trading begins. The new system will also pressure companies to buy only verified and transparent credits, cutting down on “greenwashing.”

Regional exchanges and carbon registries are preparing to include Article 6.4 credits once the market launches. Exchanges in Asia, Europe, and Latin America are already aligning with UN rules. This will help stabilize global carbon prices, which currently range from under $5 per tonne in voluntary markets to more than $90 per tonne in the EU system.

More stable prices could encourage long-term investments in clean energy and climate projects. Experts expect Article 6.4 credits to trade at a premium once investors recognize their higher quality.

ESG and Environmental Impact

The new UN system supports Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals worldwide. Companies that buy Article 6.4 credits can cut their carbon footprint while funding sustainable projects in vulnerable regions.

Renewable energy projects such as solar and wind farms in Africa and Asia create jobs, cleaner air, and better access to power. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that renewable energy jobs reached 13.7 million in 2024, with strong growth expected in developing countries. These social benefits align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for clean energy and climate action.

With stronger oversight, the UN aims to stop misuse and deliver real results. As carbon markets expand, credit integrity will define success. A 2024 study found that up to 40% of older offset credits lacked verifiable emission savings. Article 6.4 aims to close that gap.

Toward a Fair, Transparent, and Unified Carbon Future

Challenges remain before the new system reaches full scale. The next step is to approve more methods for areas like forestry, agriculture, and industry. These sectors are complex and need careful rules to avoid overstating emission cuts.

Negotiations between countries will also continue. Some worry that carbon trading may let others delay domestic cuts. Others believe it will open new funding for clean energy and climate adaptation.

The UN says developing countries will need about $4.3 trillion each year by 2030 to meet climate and energy goals. Article 6.4 could help fill that funding gap.

The Supervisory Body will meet again before COP30 in Belém, Brazil, where it may approve more methodologies. Governments and investors are watching closely as the system expands.

The UN system promises a fair and transparent market for everyone. As carbon prices become more consistent, the focus will shift to ensuring projects deliver real benefits for people and the planet.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2489099395.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 12:09:48.652837

“There has been growth in charging infrastructure, public charging infrastructure in the US over the last several years.
In-home charging: A positive trend Despite the challenges with public charging, Lee pointed to a positive trend in in-home charging installations.
Public charging ports: Slower growth Lee also discussed the slower growth of public charging ports.
Lee’s presentation highlighted the urgent need to address the mismatch between EV sales growth and charging infrastructure investment.","The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is transforming the automotive industry, promising a cleaner and more sustainable future. However, the lack of adequate charging infrastructure continues to cast a shadow over this progress. While EV battery costs have dropped significantly, battery technologies have improved greatly, and EV sales have increased in recent years, the growth of public charging networks has fallen behind. This gap poses a major obstacle, especially for long-distance travel, and fuels ongoing concerns like range anxiety. Solving this issue is crucial for unlocking the full potential of EVs and encouraging widespread adoption.

At The Battery Show North America, Bob Lee, President of North America at LG Energy Solution, delivered a presentation titled “LG’s Commitment to Battery Innovation and U.S. Manufacturing Leadership.” Among the many topics he covered, Lee emphasized the critical issue of charging infrastructure and its inability to keep pace with the rapid growth of EV sales. His insights shed light on the challenges and opportunities facing the EV industry as it strives to overcome barriers to widespread adoption.

Growth mismatch: EV sales outpacing charging infrastructure

Lee highlighted a significant growth mismatch between EV sales and public charging infrastructure investment. Over the past few years, EV sales have skyrocketed, growing from 100,000 vehicles per quarter in 2021 to an impressive 400,000 vehicles per quarter in 2024. However, the expansion of public charging infrastructure has lagged behind, creating a critical gap that could hinder the industry’s progress.

“There has been growth in charging infrastructure, public charging infrastructure in the US over the last several years. But this growth is not nearly as fast as the vehicle growth,” Lee explained. He emphasized that while EV adoption is accelerating, the infrastructure needed to support these vehicles, particularly for long-distance travel, has not kept pace, contributing to range anxiety among consumers.

In-home charging: A positive trend

Despite the challenges with public charging, Lee pointed to a positive trend in in-home charging installations. Lee shared data from his presentation, which included a chart showing the cumulative growth of in-home chargers. As more consumers purchase EVs, they are increasingly installing chargers in their garages, providing a convenient solution for daily commuting and short-distance travel.

“People are putting chargers in their garages when they buy an EV. So that number is going up nicely,” Lee noted. This growth in in-home charging is helping to alleviate some of the concerns around charging availability, particularly for everyday use.

Public charging ports: Slower growth

Lee also discussed the slower growth of public charging ports. While new public charging stations are being added each year, the rate of growth is not sufficient to match the rapid increase in EV sales. This disparity is particularly problematic for long-distance driving, where public charging infrastructure is essential.

“Remember, I showed you the vehicle graphs that sold from, 100,000 a quarter in 2021 to 400,000 a quarter in 2024? That level of growth is not being supported by the level of investment in infrastructure right now,” Lee said. He emphasized that the industry must prioritize the expansion of public charging networks to support the growing number of EVs on the road.

Long-distance driving and range anxiety

One of the most significant challenges associated with the lack of charging infrastructure is range anxiety, particularly for long-distance driving. While Lee acknowledged that modern EVs equipped with LG batteries offer ranges of around 300 miles, sufficient for most daily commuting needs, he admitted that long-distance travel remains a concern.

“For everyday usage commuting, the products are already pretty sufficient for fulfilling consumer needs. But I think we have to acknowledge that for long-distance driving, this is still a concern, an issue,” Lee said. He shared his personal experience as an EV driver, noting that long trips require more planning and consideration compared to driving an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle.

Future Outlook: Federal funding and industry collaboration

Looking ahead, Lee expressed optimism about the future of charging infrastructure, citing recent federal funding initiatives as a promising step forward. He specifically mentioned the release of Department of Energy (DOE) funds, which are expected to accelerate investment in public charging networks and help close the infrastructure gap.

“I know that the NEVI funds have been released recently, and we’re expecting more investment. But I think this is clearly an area that we need to work on together in order to reduce that range anxiety for long distances,” Lee said. He called for collaboration across the industry to address this critical issue and ensure that charging infrastructure can support the rapid growth of EV adoption.

Lee’s presentation highlighted the urgent need to address the mismatch between EV sales growth and charging infrastructure investment. While in-home charging is expanding steadily, the slower growth of public charging ports remains a significant challenge, particularly for long-distance driving. Lee’s insights underscore the importance of industry collaboration and increased investment to overcome these obstacles and unlock the full potential of the EV market.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt745ad8abfb5e3292/68f8f6ea485642ecaa68f2c5/Bob_Lee.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-22 12:09:43.889132

In the third quarter, Tesla posted record global deliveries, helped in no small part by Americans who rushed to grab the tax credit before its cancellation on Sept. 30. Now, though, most of Tesla’s models are effectively $7,500 more expensive than last month, and experts believe that all electric car manufacturers will see a dip in U.S. sales in the last quarter.

The most affordable model to lease right now is the Tesla Model 3 Premium Rear-Wheel Drive, at $329/month, down from $429. That’s for a 36-month contract with a $3,000 down payment and 10,000 miles per year. The Model 3 Premium All-Wheel Drive lease price was reduced from $549 to $429, while the Model 3 Performance can be had for $699 per month, down from $759. The newly introduced Model 3 Standard is not available through leasing.

In the Model Y’s case, the lease prices have been reduced from $529 to $449 for the Premium Rear-Wheel Drive variant, and from $599 to $519 for the Premium All-Wheel Drive trim. The base Standard and the top-spec Performance versions cannot be leased.

Then, there’s the Cybertruck All-Wheel Drive, which can be leased for $699 per month, down from $749. Compared to the Model 3 and Model Y, the down payment is $5,000, while the 36-month term and 10,000-mile yearly allowance remain the same. There’s also the tri-motor Cyberbeast version, which can be leased for $1,730 per month.

Interestingly, Tesla’s website doesn’t say that the lease prices for the Cybertruck will increase in November.

Richard Ellenbogen on recent NYISO reliability concerns

Pragmatic Environmentalist of New York/Roger Caiazza

Richard Ellenbogen addresses the New York Independent System Operator’s (NYISO) report, which found a reliability margin deficit for New York City starting in summer 2026. Ellenbogen has warned since 2019 that the state’s energy policy is an “unattainable fantasy.” He proposes a viable solution requiring a sea change on natural gas: retooling three older Long Island power plants into modern, combined-cycle facilities. This retrofit would increase efficiency from about 30% to over 60%, reducing both carbon emissions and gas usage by nearly half. He also suggests replacing older MTA subway cars with regenerative models to cut the downstate peak load by about 500 Megawatts. Ellenbogen asserts these practical steps will ensure supply and greatly reduce emissions, unlike the current unworkable plan. [MDN: Ellenbogen is an engineer and a graduate of Cornell University. He began his career with IBM Watson Laboratories and Bell Telephone Laboratories in their Power Systems Laboratory, before joining Allied Converters, a plastic food packaging manufacturer in New Rochelle, N.Y. As president of Allied Converters, Ellenbogen has overseen the company’s transformation into a “green” manufacturer with 100% waste recycling/repurposing, a 65 KW CHP System, and a 50-kilowatt solar array. He knows what he’s talking about. He says NY’s current energy plan is unworkable. But will the Democrats listen? Doubtful.]

Still more Gulf Coast natural gas storage capacity is on the way

RBN Energy/Housley Carr

The Gulf Coast natural gas storage sector is experiencing a significant boom, fueled by increased production, volatile demand (linked to renewables), extreme weather, and new LNG capacity. Midstream companies are developing numerous brownfield and greenfield projects to capitalize on this. Enstor Gas is notably expanding its Mississippi Hub by 33.5 Bcf and acquiring Black Bear Transmission. Trinity Gas Storage launched the 24 Bcf first phase of its greenfield Bethel, TX, project, with a 13 Bcf Phase II planned. Other major developments include Caliche’s Golden Triangle and Spindletop expansions, Black Bayou Energy Hub’s 34.7 Bcf facility, Energy Transfer’s 6 Bcf expansion, and NeuVentus’s planned TRU Hub, collectively set to dramatically increase the region’s storage capacity starting in the next few years.

LNG buildout leaves room for both Permian, Haynesville

Argus Media/Tray Swanson

Growth in natural gas from the Permian and Haynesville basins is crucial to meet rising US Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) export demand, especially since Appalachia has limited takeaway capacity. Industry experts predict this increased feedgas demand will raise prices, incentivizing drilling in both regions. The US has 17.5 Bcf/d of liquefaction capacity, with an additional 15 Bcf/d under construction. While the Permian is forecasted to increase production, bottlenecks at the Waha and Katy hubs limit the amount of gas reaching Louisiana LNG terminals, necessitating higher output from the Haynesville. Midstream companies are planning new pipelines, like WhiteWater’s Blackfin and DT Midstream’s LEAP, to add over 10 Bcf/d of capacity from the Permian to the Texas-Louisiana border and from the Haynesville to the Gillis hub by 2026-2030, easing constraints and ensuring supply. [MDN: If there’s less oil drilling due to low prices, the Permian isn’t going to need a lot of new gas pipelines. Just sayin’.]

U.S. natural gas price adds to weather-driven gains

Wall Street Journal

U.S. natural gas futures add to the previous day’s hefty gains as cooler weather forecasts for the end of October and beginning of November point to closer to normal demand for the early heating season. “The weekend cold push is helping the market to turn the page onto more supportive footing,” Eli Rubin of EBW Analytics says in a note. Cooler weather lessens the chances of an early-November supply glut, he adds. “Additional cold weather shifts for November could provide further fuel to the nascent rally.” Natural gas for November delivery rises 2.3% to $3.474/mmBtu. December through February contracts pick up from early weakness and settle higher. [MDN: Hey, not only are we above $3, we are well above it! Heading for $3.50. Love it!]

Natural gas is on the move – why brokers should pay attention

Finance Magnates

Natural gas is experiencing a significant price rally, driven by market fundamentals as the colder season approaches, boosting heating demand. The upward movement is further supported by smaller-than-five-year-average storage injections and increased Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports to Europe and Asia. The price has seen an impressive gain of over 46% in the past year. The article advises brokers to spotlight this less crowded, high-volatility asset to traders for diversification, especially as traditional markets like gold and Nasdaq feel uncertain. While offering strong momentum, brokers must also caution traders about the risk of large price swings and thin liquidity during non-core hours. [MDN: This article is aimed at brokers, to encourage them to “sell” traders on the concept of buying/selling natural gas futures. It makes the case that natgas prices are moving higher, rapidly.]

U.S. LNG feedgas demand rises above last year’s winter numbers

RBN Energy/Lisa Shidler

U.S. LNG feedgas demand is rapidly increasing, with last week’s average at 16.3 Bcf/d, already surpassing last winter’s average and nearing the all-time record set in April. The surge is driven by Cove Point returning to peak operation and continued commissioning at Plaquemines LNG. Although Corpus Christi and Calcasieu Pass saw lower volumes, most other U.S. terminals operate near full capacity. The total demand is expected to shatter previous records soon as winter operations ramp up and new projects, including Plaquemines, Corpus Christi Stage III, and Golden Pass, advance commissioning. [MDN: More demand from these LNG export facilities will push prices a bit higher, hopefully keeping the price above $3.]

Balderson introduces bill to unleash American energy, guarantee U.S. energy security

Congressman Troy Balderson

Congressman Troy Balderson (OH-12) introduced the Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act to promote American energy dominance and independence, moving away from “green new deal” ideologies with an “all-of-the-above” approach. The bill aims to ensure affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the U.S. by restoring regulatory sanity and defining three key energy terms for federal regulators, which are currently open to interpretation. Upon enactment, it would require agencies like the Department of Energy, Interior, and EPA to review and align their policies with the bill’s definitions, guaranteeing that reliable and affordable sources, including nuclear and natural gas, remain part of the national energy mix to lower costs and combat a rising risk of power outages. [MDN: A good move on the part of Congressman Balderson. He’s a champion for fossil fuels and wants to ensure future presidents can’t redefine what is and is not an acceptable form of energy for Americans to use. The left loves to redefine things.]

Natural gas may save US producers as oil falls

Forbes/Matt Randolph

Despite falling national gas and oil prices, the natural gas market is volatile, recently spiking 13% due to cold weather and showing signs of long-term increases. The tightness is fueled by permanent market factors, including an anticipated 5% rise in U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) export capacity by 2026. Production is challenged by low forecasted oil prices ($48/barrel), which make drilling in key regions like the Permian Basin unprofitable, as it needs $60/barrel to break even. This, combined with limited pipeline capacity in Appalachia and growing demand from U.S. data centers, is projected to push natural gas prices and utility bills higher, potentially hitting $4.00 by 2026. The irony is that low oil prices could cause higher natural gas prices, though natural gas profits may offset oil company losses, securing jobs and future supply readiness. [MDN: The article makes a good point. When there is less oil drilling, particularly in the Permian, there is less associated natural gas production, meaning more opportunity for M-U molecules to be sold at a higher price. With less production and the same (or increasing) demand, the price goes up. Low oil prices lead to higher natgas prices.]

Oil price rises on U.S. reserve refill

Bloomberg/Mia Gindis, Jack Wittels

Oil prices eked out a small gain, with West Texas Intermediate settling near $58 a barrel, after the US announced plans to buy 1 million barrels for the national stockpile. However, this minor support was insufficient to reverse the dominant bearish sentiment, which has driven prices down over 10% since late September on expectations of a looming global surplus. Signs of this surplus include record crude held on tankers at sea and signals of ample supply in time spreads. The International Energy Agency anticipates world oil inventories will significantly exceed demand next year as producers, including OPEC+, ramp up output. Experts warn of a “near-term glut,” while commodity trading advisers’ maximum-short positions could accelerate further price drops. [MDN: WTI for November delivery, which expires on Tuesday, gained 0.5% to settle at $57.82 a barrel in New York. The more-active WTI December contract settled at $57.24 a barrel.

Passenger cars and small trucks account for about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.","Artificial intelligence has caused concern for its tremendous consumption of water and power. But scientists are also experimenting with ways that AI can help people and businesses use energy more efficiently and pollute less.

Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world’s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities’ energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.

But when AI’s computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.

Experts say that if uses like these continue to grow, they could help offset the energy consumed by AI.

“I am pretty optimistic that while more and more AI use is going to continue to increase,” said Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia University Climate School, “we’re going to see our ability to process be much more efficient and as a result, the energy consumption won’t go up as much as some are predicting.”

Building efficiency: Maintenance, cooling

AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.

Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers’ arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker’s instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it’s not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.

For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.

AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.

Combined, these automations can reduce a building’s energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.

“That’s literally a super low-hanging fruit,” said Zoltan Nagy, professor of building services at Eindhoven University of Technology.

Finding energy- and cost-efficient times for EV charging

AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.

This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it’s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.

“Let’s say it’s a peak period when everybody’s got their air conditioning on, and I walk in my house and I plug in my car and I have it set up such that my car doesn’t start charging right away because it’s peak period time,” Abramson said.

In California, a pilot program shifted charging to times where there was more renewable energy available, and saved customers money.

AI can also help optimize how homeowners with solar panels store excess energy in batteries.

Reducing methane flaring from oil and gas operations

Boston-based Geminus AI uses deep learning and advanced reasoning to help oil and gas companies reduce methane flaring and venting, and reduce the amount of energy they use in extracting and refining.

Reducing methane emissions is among the fastest pathways to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

When pressure in oil and gas pipes builds up, some of the gas is released and burned to relieve the pressure, harming the planet and wasting money.

Geminus CEO Greg Fallon said they can monitor the network of wells and pipes and use AI-driven simulations to suggest changes to compressor and pump settings that eliminate the need for venting and flaring. Geminus does this in seconds. Traditionally it takes engineers about 36 hours to run simulations that make similar recommendations, Fallon added.

“As we scale this across the industry, there’s a massive opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Fallon said.

Finding geothermal hot spots

Salt Lake City-based geothermal energy startup Zanskar has built AI models to understand the Earth’s subsurface. It’s using that modeling to find overlooked geothermal hot spots and target drilling.

Geothermal creates electricity cleanly by making steam from the Earth’s natural heat and using it to spin a turbine. It’s one renewable energy the Trump administration favors.

Zanskar co-founders Carl Hoiland and Joel Edwards say they simulate and assess a huge number of possible subsurface scenarios to estimate where there are pockets of very hot water. From this, they pick optimal locations and drilling directions.

“AI is becoming the solution to its own energy problem,” Hoiland, the CEO, said. “It’s showing us a way to unlock resources that weren’t possible without it.”

Last year, Zanskar purchased an underperforming geothermal power plant in New Mexico. Their AI modeling successfully indicated there was an untapped geothermal reservoir that could repower the facility.

Next, Hoiland and Edwards focused on another site in Nevada, despite industry experts telling them it was too cold to support a utility-scale power plant. They drilled and announced their second geothermal discovery in September at that site.

Reducing traffic emissions

Google is using artificial intelligence and Google Maps data to identify traffic light adjustments that can reduce stop-and-go traffic to lower pollution. Passenger cars and small trucks account for about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.

Launched in 2023, Project Green Light is now in 20 cities on four continents. The most recent is Boston, which has notoriously bad traffic.

Each city gets AI-generated recommendations. City engineers determine which to implement. Google says Project Green Light can reduce stop-and-go traffic by up to 30%, which cuts emissions by 10% and improves air quality.

“We’re just scratching the surface of what AI can do,” said Juliet Rothenberg, Google’s product director of Earth and resilience AI.

Many North Carolinians are already anxious about climate impacts after seeing neighbors blindsided by Helene, some without flood insurance, and are now trying to navigate conflicting information about their own risks.
“We’ve had clients who see their home rated at higher flood risk on Zillow, while FEMA shows they’re not in a floodplain,” she said.
That kind of extra effort has become more common in a state where climate patterns and real estate trends are changing together.","When floodwaters from Hurricane Helene tore through western North Carolina last year, the damage extended far beyond washed-out roads and broken homes. It also changed how many people think about where they live and what their homes are really worth.

Now, climate risk is emerging as a new force in the state’s housing market, influencing everything from insurance premiums to buyer confidence. Real estate agents say the conversation has shifted, with stormwater maps and flood histories becoming nearly as relevant as square footage and school districts.

Ashley Rummage, a Raleigh-area Realtor who grew up in Boone, said Helene was a wake-up call.

“We really have an ethical duty to our clients to be more informed about sustainability and the built environment,” she said. “We need to be educated on how to advise people when it comes to where to look for floodplain information.”

Traditional FEMA maps, long used to determine flood risk, are now being supplemented and sometimes contradicted by new predictive tools. One example is the First Street Foundation database, which is integrated into Zillow listings through a “climate check” feature that estimates a property’s future vulnerability to flooding or wildfires.

Rummage said that data has helped buyers become more informed but also more uncertain. Many North Carolinians are already anxious about climate impacts after seeing neighbors blindsided by Helene, some without flood insurance, and are now trying to navigate conflicting information about their own risks.

“We’ve had clients who see their home rated at higher flood risk on Zillow, while FEMA shows they’re not in a floodplain,” she said. “It’s confusing for consumers. They need someone they trust to help make sense of it.”

To bridge that gap, Rummage often calls the City of Raleigh’s stormwater division directly for parcel-by-parcel information. “They’ll send the details I need so my clients can make informed decisions,” she said.

That kind of extra effort has become more common in a state where climate patterns and real estate trends are changing together. Sharon Gupton, president of the Raleigh Regional Association of Realtors, said awareness has grown dramatically among both buyers and builders since she started selling homes in the 1980s.

“Every homeowner and home seller is more inclined now to understand that weather affects so much of our properties,” Gupton said. “As agents, we talk through that with them. The public is just much more knowledgeable about how the environment affects our homes.”

Still, Gupton said few buyers make insurance costs or flood risk their top concern at first. “People are motivated by price and location,” she said. “Those other factors come up later, often when lenders go over the costs.”

Even so, those costs are getting harder to overlook. Insurance premiums have climbed sharply in North Carolina and across the country, driven by mounting claims from extreme weather. Some major insurers have already scaled back coverage in high-risk areas, and agents are beginning to see the effects in buyer hesitation.

Craig Foley, chief sustainability officer for LAER Realty Partners and a member of the National Association of Realtors’ executive committee, calls climate change “an existential threat to the industry.”

“We’re seeing insurance costs skyrocket in Florida, Louisiana and California, and that’s creeping north,” Foley said. “It’s not just coastal flooding. It’s wind, hail, extreme heat. The insurance industry knows it.”

Foley, who trains agents nationwide on sustainable building and climate resilience, believes climate risk is already playing a role in the national housing slowdown, particularly among younger buyers.

“Interest rates are part of it, but they’re not the only factor,” he said. “There’s enough data now for young people, especially first-time homebuyers, to wonder if this investment makes sense. They’re seeing these disasters unfold and questioning the long-term risk.”

In North Carolina, those questions are colliding with the realities of rapid urban growth. Cities such as Raleigh and Wilmington are rewriting long-term development plans that integrate stormwater design, tree canopy protection and denser, more efficient housing.

“We’re seeing places flood that have never flooded before,” Gupton said. “So municipalities are rethinking zoning, in some cases going higher instead of wider.”

That shift toward building up rather than out is part of what Raleigh’s new 20-year comprehensive plan aims to achieve, as city planners weigh housing demand against aging infrastructure and a changing climate.

Rummage said there are signs of progress in how buyers and developers approach risk.

“There’s more interest in resilience,” she said. “People are starting to pay attention. It’s unfortunate that it takes a disaster to make that happen, but if that means we make more resilient choices for future North Carolinians, that’s something to build on.”",https://images.wral.com/9e219b55-bd33-4981-bc7c-bb3fe8bb1daf?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-10-22 12:10:07.872006

By Akash Sriram and Abhirup Roy

Oct 22 (Reuters) – Tesla TSLA.O is expected to post a surge in third-quarter results later on Wednesday, thanks to U.S. buyers rushing to take advantage of an expiring $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit.

But investors and analysts may be more focused on Chief Executive Elon Musk’s outlook, including whether new, cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y Tesla can keep U.S. customers buying and attract new ones in Europe and Asia.

The new trims – called Standard – are $5,000 to $5,500 cheaper than their predecessors as Tesla shrank the battery, switched to a less-powerful motor and stripped out myriad features – from rear touchscreens to seat-back pockets. The company also temporarily has slashed lease prices on the higher-priced Premium versions.

The cheaper Standard variants as well as Tesla’s offers and discounts to stave off competition globally throughout the year have pressured the company’s once-enviable margins, worrying investors.

Sales of Tesla’s aging lineup declined for the first time last year and analysts expect an 8.5% fall this year, in part because of Musk’s far-right political rhetoric.

ROBOTAXIS ROLLOUT UPDATE

Musk also will be expected to update on robotaxis, the project that he sees as the key to Tesla’s next stage of growth. Musk has said Tesla’s robotaxis will serve half the population of the U.S. by year-end.

“What are the relevant metrics – fleet size, cumulative miles, and territories – you expect in Q4 and 2026?” was the top question for the CEO in a note by analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald on Tuesday.

While Musk has pivoted Tesla’s focus to robotics and artificial intelligence and much of the company’s $1.4 trillion valuation hangs on that bet, most of its current revenue and profit comes from vehicle sales.

Tesla shares, which were down 1.6% on Wednesday, have risen nearly 10% this year, propelled by a record-breaking $1 trillion pay package for Musk that the board proposed last month. The stock is still largely among the laggards in the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of mega-cap stocks.

Analysts expect Tesla to report a revenue of $26.24 billion in the quarter ended September, up 4.2% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by LSEG. Tesla also will report on whether regulatory credits that it sold to makers of gasoline-powered cars to satisfy pollution standards have faded away after policy changes by the Trump administration.",https://bilyonaryo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tesla-4.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 16:18:56.028337

For the city, the braiding of FAA funds with city revenue made advancing regional air capacity possible without burdening residents.
The combined revenue funding streams allowed for small improvements to pave formerly dirt pathways, making them more walkable for Alaskans.
Managing Compliance for Braided Funding One caveat cities come across with braided funding is that it introduces complexity in municipal financial reporting.
For Wasilla, braided funding isn’t a strategy to be only used for large projects, but a standard practice that helps their small community thrive.","The Alaskan city of Wasilla may have a population of just under 10,000 residents, but its influence extends far beyond its city limits. Surrounded by rural communities, Wasilla serves as a hub for more than 150,000 people from the region who rely on the city for essential supplies, entertainment and transportation.

Recently, Wasilla recognized the need for critical infrastructure updates and faced the challenge of funding both large- and small-scale projects required to sustain the region. With its small population, relying solely on the general revenue budget was not enough. The solution for Wasilla came in the form of braided funding.

In municipal finance, braided funding means taking various forms of funding and weaving them together one source of revenue with another for the same project. This allows a city to use various revenue streams to stretch their budget and make costly projects feasible. Each source of funding has its own compliance and reporting requirements, which are monitored separately with stakeholders aware of how the funds are being used.

Incorporating Federal Funding into Large-Scale Updates

Speaking to Wasilla Councilmember Ian Crafton about the municipalities braided funding efforts, Crafton gave several examples of projects that gave the community a refresh and welcomed neighboring commuters. The first was Wasilla’s wastewater system, which began operating at full capacity in 2017 and required an expensive update. Initial cost estimates for fixing the treatment plant came in close to $30 million, which could have put the city’s finances in a precarious position without braided funding.

At the time, Wasilla’s annual general revenues sat at $60 million, making this upgrade half of all funds for the community. Over the years, the city built this nest egg through a 2.5 percent sales tax, which was capped at $12.50 per transaction. This meant that sales tax only brought in a limited amount per transaction and wouldn’t have been sustainable if not for the funds coming from residents and visitors alike. This helped maintain essential services, such as the wastewater treatment plant, without raising local taxes. These funds would need to be used by the city for its portion of braided funding expenses but could not be spent in full.

When it came to the upgrade, Wasilla secured federal aid from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with support from Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski. This made it so the city could allocate a manageable $5.7 million of its own general revenue to fund the design phase of the plant upgrade, examining options from retrofitting the existing facility to building a new one. By combining federal grant monies with a small local match, the municipality was able to move forward without committing to a project it could not financially sustain.

Another example of braided federal funding can be seen in Wasilla’s airport expansion project. The city prioritized the airport not only for the benefit of its own residents, but also because it serves as the only regional airport within a nearly 50-mile radius — acting as a vital avenue for getting supplies into the community. Recently, the municipality accepted funding of up to $12 million from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This grant will go towards lengthening the airport runway, adding a new apron and building a taxiway. The FAA’s aid was able to cover 95 percent of the cost, which leaves the city responsible for just 5 percent of the airport upgrade.

Further, Wasilla encouraged competitive bidding to push project costs down from an initial estimate of $16 million and further negotiated a lower cost for taxpayers. For the city, the braiding of FAA funds with city revenue made advancing regional air capacity possible without burdening residents. As Councilmember Crafton explains, “This other entity is going to give us some money, and we’re not going to have to spend the tax dollars that they’re giving us.”

Regional Partnerships for Braiding Small Projects

Smaller projects, like Wasilla’s parks, have benefited from a braided approach as well. The city partnered with their encompassing Matanuska-Susitna Borough and the State of Alaska for a $40,000 project on trail improvements at Lake Lucille Park. The combined revenue funding streams allowed for small improvements to pave formerly dirt pathways, making them more walkable for Alaskans.

Additional capital for this project allowed for further updates. The National Association of Realtors provided a $7,500 pass through grant from their local board. This helped to fund accessibility upgrades for the park. While the park was a modest project, the partnership shows how small-scale braided funding could be utilized to improve quality of life services for residents’ daily use.

Managing Compliance for Braided Funding

One caveat cities come across with braided funding is that it introduces complexity in municipal financial reporting. Each funding source will have its own reporting timelines, eligibility rules and compliance requirements that city finance teams must adhere to, which can be challenging for a small municipality with limited staff.

According to Crafton, Wasilla approaches this by providing additional, as needed, support for their staff. The city will contract professional grant writers and lean on the resources provided by the Alaska Municipal League’s staff to obtain and comply with braided funding expectations. Meanwhile the city’s finance staff work to maintain oversight of tracking and reporting, which has proven effective for the municipality. Meeting national audit requirements, like the city did with CARES Act funding, allows the city to avoid any costly repayment fines or unexpected stressors.

Key Insights for Small Cities

Councilmember Crafton had several insights to share for small municipalities interested in utilizing braided funding for local projects:

Start by Funding the Project’s Design: Use a smaller pool of money for early planning phases. Then refine cost estimates to reinforce applications on larger awards.

Match Funders to the Right Project: Choosing the right funding partner for a project lowers the cost of how much the locality will have to contribute. Airports, wastewater systems and parks each align with different federal, state, or philanthropic programs.

Utilize Small Grants: Modest contributions, like the $7,500 Wasilla received from the Alaska Association of Realtors, go a long way towards quick and usable improvements for residents when braided with other funding sources.

Approach Reimbursements with Caution: If a municipality’s financial reserves are healthy, paying upfront with the promise of a reimbursement will allow projects to move faster. But reimbursement opportunities should always be vetted with caution before moving forward.

Plan for Operations Cost: When considering a new project, it’s important to be future thinking. Long term costs for operations after the project is completed will likely be sustained by the city. Consider the financial sustainability of the project before accepting aid.

Communicate with Residents: Community members respond to clear explanations, timelines and tangible results for how braiding lowers reliance on local tax revenue to avoid extra cost burden being put on them.

For Wasilla, braided funding isn’t a strategy to be only used for large projects, but a standard practice that helps their small community thrive. By combining funding opportunities, the city has been able to move forward projects ranging from wastewater planning to airport expansion while maintaining its financial stability. Similar small cities might not share Wasilla’s geographic considerations, but the key lesson is that creating long-term benefits for residents is possible when multiple streams are woven together, each carrying a piece of the load.",https://www.nlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1431662879.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:05:41.842812

Renewable energy is no longer a fringe idea; it’s a booming, unstoppable force in the global economy. In the U.S. alone, electricity from solar, wind, and hydropower provided over 22% of total electricity generation in 2024, and globally the generation from renewables just surpassed that of coal for the first time the same year. These renewable energy sources are not some pipe dream, they’re here and growing.

Jobs? The clean energy industry employs more than 3.56 million Americans; for every million dollars invested in renewable energy, solar alone provides 2.7 times the number of jobs than fossil fuels. Over the next decade, wind turbine technicians and solar photovoltaic installers are projected to be among the fastest-growing occupations in the U.S. economy, offering competitive pay and improved safety compared to many other jobs.

And these benefits don’t even factor in how renewable energy significantly reduces air pollution, which in turn will help to lower the estimated $820 billion spent in annual health costs, caused by fossil fuel use (as of 2021). From a financial standpoint alone, adopting renewables is a no-brainer.

But instead of leaning into the prospect of the U.S. becoming a world leader in this new energy technology, the Trump administration is digging in its heels, and doing everything it can to sabotage this progress and back 19th century fossil fuels. Not just with incorrect statements that influence public perception (like Trump’s claim that wind turbine noise causes cancer), but with actual policy that blocks and delays clean energy projects.

Given that Great Britain invented the steam engine – the key to the Industrial Revolution, the locomotive, the World Wide Web, the telephone, television, the concept of vaccinations, the jet engine, the Hovercraft, antibiotics, discovered the structure of DNA, and invented radar – amongst many other things – we can be pretty assured that Britain is a ‘smart county’. And what is this smart country doing now? Rapidly embracing renewables, which accounts for 50%of its electricity generation.

Here are five ways the Trump administration is trying to kill renewable energy and set the United States backwards in the energy industry:

1. The One Big Beautiful Bill – Spending Billions to Fall Behind

Subsidizing fossil fuels in 2025 is like investing in Blockbuster while Netflix takes off…but that’s exactly what this administration is doing.

The 2025 “One Big Beautiful Bill” significantly increased federal subsidies for fossil fuels. According to a report by Oil Change International, the bill added nearly $40 billion in new subsidies over the next decade, raising the annual total to at least $34.8 billion. This includes $4 billion in additional subsidies each year, marking the largest single-year increase in fossil fuel subsidies in recent years.

At the state level, fossil fuels rack up more public money. Texas handed out approximately $1.4 billion in 2023 alone. In Wyoming, taxpayers could be on the hook for up to $900 million to clean up abandoned oil and gas wells, because fossil fuel companies aren’t required to set aside nearly enough money to cover the cost of plugging them. In Jefferson City, Wyoming alone, taxpayers are looking at a $35,000 clean up. A report from Public Citizen estimates that cleaning up over 89,000 wells on federal lands could cost between $2.9 billion and $17.7 billion, with the highest costs concentrated in states like New Mexico and Wyoming. Across the board, the public is footing the bill so that wealthy oil companies can keep drilling.

What are we getting for all this public spending? Not energy security. Not price stability. While subsidies could be justified politically as tools for energy affordability and security, they are failing on both fronts. The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) notes that fossil fuel subsidies distort markets and undermine energy diversification, leaving countries more vulnerable to global supply shocks.

Recent global oil and gas volatility, compounded by geopolitical tensions around the world, shows that fossil fuel price swings persist even when producers receive large publicly funded subsidies. In other words, subsidies stabilize corporate margins, not consumer prices we all pay. One of the reasons U.S. oil and gas production is still considered profitable is because of these vast subsidies. Over 60% percent of fossil fuel companies are still dependent on government support that we all pay for. That’s not a healthy market.

Renewables are the answer to our energy independence and have historically received less federal support than fossil fuels. We have still seen renewable energy projects and generation capacity increasing exponentially. Imagine how much progress we could make if even a fraction spent on fossil fuel subsidies were redirected to renewables; lower electricity cost, creation of tens of thousands of new jobs, and true energy independence.

2. Trying to Kick Wind and Solar Off Public Lands

In August 2025, the Department of the Interior (DOI) issued Secretarial Order No. 3438, instructing agencies to reevaluate whether federal lands should be used for solar and wind projects. The new criteria prioritize “capacity density”, or how much energy you can get per area.

It sounds logical to want to limit our use of resources, until you realize it’s a smokescreen. According to a 2017 report, wind and solar need more space per megawatt, but they come with no risk of oil spills and virtually no risk of other pollutants.

Fossil fuel drilling, on the other hand, leaves behind polluted air, poisoned water, and soil erosion. Because of this once the fossil fuel companies leave the land they leave behind is often left unusable for decades or even centuries. In contrast, renewable energy projects stay confined to the same pieces of land decades without depleting or contaminating it.

3. They’re Undermining Offshore Wind

On August 8, 2025, the Trump administration launched a full review of all offshore wind regulations, including projects already underway. Officials claim they want to ensure compliance with Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and eliminate “preferential treatment” for offshore wind.

Offshore wind is a massive opportunity for the U.S. It could generate more than 2,000 GW of power by 2050, nearly double the current U.S. electricity demand. And it’s not some distant dream. As of 2024, there was an increase of over 27 GW of offshore wind projects in the pipeline, representing tens of thousands of jobs and billions in investment.

Killing these projects doesn’t just waste potential, it hands the future to other countries. The UK, Germany, and China are all aggressively expanding offshore wind projects, while the U.S. stalls. In fact, China already leads the world in installed offshore wind capacity. If we keep dragging our feet, we lose our shot at global leadership and homegrown clean energy jobs.

4. They Eliminated the Renewable Leasing Schedule, So Developers Are Left Guessing

On August 5, 2025, the Department of the Interior (DOI) axed a rule that required the government to publish a 5-year renewable energy leasing schedule. This schedule kept things clear and predictable for companies investing money into clean energy projects on federal land – information that is essential to any investor.

Renewable energy projects have a lot of moving parts and so take time and dedication to plan, finance, and build. Without a leasing schedule, developers face costly delays and regulatory uncertainty that can derail entire projects.

For perspective, the permitting process for building a large solar project on federal land usually takes about 3 to 5 years; that includes picking a location, environmental reviews, and hooking it up to the power grid. But without a clear and predictable process, a lot of that time gets wasted just waiting for approvals or decisions that might never happen.

5. They’re Burying Every Wind and Solar Project in Red Tape

In July 2025, DOI leadership mandated that all wind and solar decisions be subjected to multi-agency review, including sign-off by the Secretary of the Interior. Again they claim it’s about ending “preferential treatment” for renewables while fossil fuels still get faster reviews and much larger subsidies.

This new red tape seems designed to specifically delay clean energy development, while fossil fuel projects continue to sail through the system, under Trump’s “energy dominance” policy. Meanwhile, the world is heating up and energy prices for U.S consumers are rising fast.

An Unstoppable Movement

Despite renewable energy’s numerous benefits, the Trump administration is doing everything it can to put the brakes on progress; rigging the rules, rewriting policies, and pushing red tape, all in the name of protecting outdated, polluting industries.This isn’t just short-sighted. It’s dangerous.

The fossil fuel industry has poured $96 million in donations, lobbying and advertisements that directly supported Trump’s re-election campaign and affiliated PACs. Some administration officials even hold personal financial stakes in fossil fuel operations, like Interior Secretary Doug Burgum (whose approval is needed for all wind and solar projects), and profits from oil leases on his own land.

But here’s the good news: we don’t have to accept it.

The system is expensive to maintain and operate. It exists within an electricity market that has seen some of the fastest data center growth in the country. And it has struggled to bring on new supply quickly.

A lot of this comes down to the electricity market the state is in — PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest grid operator. Over the past two years, the cost of guaranteeing that the grid will be able to meet peak demand has skyrocketed to $16.1 billion, from just $2.2 billion in 2023.

These prices are set at auction, in which generators tell the market how much they’d need to be paid to be around in times when the grid is most in need. “PJM’s capacity market — its primary means of incenting investment in new power plants — has not worked as designed since 2018,”, Silverman testified before the New Jersey legislature in March. (The auctions are supposed to be held annually, but were delayed several times toward the end of the last decade as PJM and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission reviewed proposed rule changes.)

In February, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities said that its own auction to procure services from PJM, which follows the prices set in the PJM auction, would result in roughly 20% increases in retail electricity bills. “PJM’s recent capacity auction results are the main driver of these increases,” Christine Guhl-Sadovy, the board’s president said in a statement. In practical terms, that’s about a $20 increase per residential electricity bill on average, according to the non-profit urban planning group the Regional Plan Association.

When Silverman analyzed the components of New Jersey’s electricity price increases, he identified an 8.5% increase in energy prices paid through PJM from 2023 to 2024, a five-fold increase in capacity prices, and transmission costs that had doubled over the previous decade, including a 9% increase in just the previous year.

As for what’s behind those skyrocketing capacity price increases, I’ll give you one guess.

“Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices,” PJM’s independent market monitor said in a report on the 2024 capacity auction, attributing over $9 billion of the increase to the demands on the grid due to data centers.

While much of that data center demand has been in other PJM states like Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, within the service territory for New Jersey’s largest utility, Public Service Electric & Gas, “interconnection inquiries from data centers and other large customers have increased dramatically, from 400 megawatts a year ago to 4,700 megawatts today,” PJM official Jason Stanek said in testimony before the New Jersey State Senate in March. He also referred to “a shrinking supply of energy and capacity,” which was a polite way of saying that PJM has failed to get new resources through its interconnection queue at a pace that matches planned retirements of older, fossil fuel-fired resources. That, “combined with increasing demand, will result in upward pressure on wholesale and retail prices,” Stanek said.

For years, PJM’s auctions, when they happened, were arguably delivering prices that were too low, leaving the market short of capacity as data center construction and interconnection requests boomed, leading prices to shoot up dramatically, shouldering retail ratepayers with rising bills but not quickly resolving the system’s potential reliability issues.

Still, New Jersey is one of 13 states in PJM, but it has seen some of the sharpest electricity increases among that group. In neighboring Pennsylvania, for instance, electricity prices are about a fifth lower and have only risen around 12%.

A major study of recent electricity price increases by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Brattle Group identified New Jersey as an especially severe case — the worst, in fact — even within the dramatic price increases throughout PJM. “New Jersey is experiencing some of the highest price increases of all PJM states in summer of 2025,” the study found.

New Jersey is also exceptionally exposed to natural gas prices. About 60% of its electricity generation comes from natural gas — although that explains more of the price increases in the years immediately following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and less of the recent price hikes, according to the Lawrence Berkeley and Brattle Group researchers.

New Jersey is the nation’s most population-dense state, but it is also at the mercy of national markets and other states for its power, explained Kyle Mason, an associate planner at the Regional Plan Association.

“A major New Jersey factor is that it’s a net importer,” Mason told me, meaning that the state can’t always satisfy its own demands with home-grown power. “So in times of peak demand, they have to import energy from other states within PJM, and that makes them more reliant on PJM markets, particularly their capacity market,” Mason said.

New Jersey has been working to maintain and expand its existing clean energy generation, including subsidizing nuclear power plants when prices were low and investing in distributed solar power.

But it could do more. Silverman pointed to this in his testimony when he said that “a number of New Jersey-based storage projects have already survived the interconnection gauntlet and could be deployed quickly with the right incentives” — that is, they’ve been approved by PJM but have yet to be built.

New Jersey's offshore wind efforts — which would have provided large amounts of in-state clean generation — have been stymied by a combination of supply chain challenges and Donald Trump. Ciattarelli, the Republican candidate for governor, has said he would ban offshore wind, while both he and Sherrill support more nuclear power.

But even the governor of New Jersey can only do so much. “They are at the mercy of the federal government and the larger PJM body,” Mason said.

Blame chaos. Automakers crave the boring and the predictable. It can take years to tweak the looks or the specs of an existing vehicle, to say nothing of the half-decade or more required to design and build a new car from scratch. With so much time and money on the line, car companies want to know what kind of world will greet their new creations.

But because of the shifting political winds in America, predictability has been hard to come by. Automakers planned and publicized big pushes into electric cars on the assumption that federal policy would continue to move the nation in that direction. They started to move manufacturing into the U.S. to satisfy Biden-era rules for tax credit eligibility. Then they were jerked in the opposite direction by a Trump administration that killed those federal incentives, slapped on haphazard new tariffs that penalize EVs, and got rid of the pollution penalties that nudged carmakers toward a cleaner future.

GM says its newly gloomy outlook is based partly on a decrease in predicted demand. In the absence of federal tax credits that made it more affordable for drivers to choose EVs (gone as of October 1), GM revised down the number of electric cars it expected Americans to buy. As the car market abruptly changes direction — again — GM must change plans to keep up, which means retooling factories to produce fewer EVs and more still-profitable ICE vehicles.

As GM says in its official investor release: “Following recent U.S. government policy changes, including the termination of certain consumer tax incentives for EV purchases and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, we expect the adoption rate of EVs to slow. These charges include non-cash impairment and other charges of $1.2 billion as a result of adjustments to our EV capacity.” Another $400 million in estimated losses come from “contract cancellation fees and commercial settlements associated with EV-related investments,” which is how they arrive at the total of $1.6 billion.

The conglomerate says that this bit of bad news won’t affect its current lineups. But its predicament is emblematic of how the car giants find themselves stuck between the past and the future. In China and other nations around the world, EV adoption continues apace, but the established big automakers simply can’t compete there with the rock-bottom prices of Chinese-made EVs. In the West, meanwhile, the new wave of EV antagonism is pushing the industry back toward the fossil fuels that provided their profits in the past — despite the billions they’ve already invested in electrification.

GM is not alone in this, of course. Ford has gone through several rounds of whiplash during its electrification process — first losing billions on its early EVs, then slowing its EV development plans to retreat toward the easy profitability of combustion, before recently unveiling a different vision to make its EVs scalable and affordable. Companies like Hyundai, which tried to win the EV race, find themselves penalized for trying to qualify for the now-dead Biden tax incentives. Those that dragged their feet, like Toyota, are well-positioned to keep making money in this weird moment.

The end result is that for the sake of survival, companies like GM find themselves talking out of both sides of their mouth. At the end of the previous decade, when it looked as though the 2020s would be the era of EVs, GM pledged itself to a zero-emissions future. And while GM has been an EV success story of late, the Detroit giant also has spent enormous amounts to lobby the federal government against clean air regulations whose disappearance would make its combustion sector more profitable.

If there’s a positive sign from GM’s sour note, it is the statement from James Cain, executive director for finance and sales communications, that, regarding its stable of current EVs, “we will build them to demand.” In other words, it’s not as though GM is throwing in the towel — if Americans keep buying electric Cadillacs and Chevys despite the mess of a market, it’ll keep making them. Even if that means changing plans and retooling factories again.

Just because the U.S. is pulling back support for the production of batteries doesn’t mean there aren’t plenty of purchasers. On Monday, BloombergNEF estimated that global energy storage additions are set to reach 92 gigawatts this year, up 23% from last year, according to the consultancy’s market forecast for the second half of 2025. Utility-scale projects made up 84% of the annual growth, and the U.S. market kept expanding despite federal funding cuts. BloombergNEF also said U.S. buyers were looking for more domestic manufacturers to weather rising tariffs, which might be tricky given recent trends in the space.

2. Interior Department slashes staff in charge of energy permitting

Despite the Trump administration’s promises to speed up permitting for energy projects, the Department of the Interior plans to fire more than 200 workers in state offices that manage federal licensing in key regions for fossil fuel, geothermal, and mining development. In a court filing Monday, the agency said it would cut as much as 12% of the staff at its Bureau of Land Management office in Utah, 9% in the California outpost, and 6% in Colorado. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s regional office for the Gulf of Mexico, meanwhile, was set to lose 5% of its employees. And those are just the local offices I found in the 35-page document that explicitly handled energy permitting. The cuts are part of a plan to “imminently” axe at least 2,000 jobs from the Interior Department overall, including — as NOTUS first reported — hundreds of National Park Service employees.

The administration’s tightened grip over the BLM office in Utah has already caused some headaches for next-generation geothermal companies, according to industry sources I spoke to earlier this year, as local officials who once had the autonomy to greenlight incremental permits for drilling exploration suddenly needed to report back to political officials in Washington. The Interior Department ultimately eased the issue, but the example illustrates what’s at stake when a state office that’s tasked with doing more as new projects proliferate has fewer people and resources.

3. Despite chaotic immigration raid, Hyundai is still betting on the U.S.

A month after federal officers raided Hyundai Motor Group’s $26 billion factory in Ellabell, Georgia, shackling more than 300 South Korean workers the Trump administration accused of violating visa rules, the carmaker remains focused on expanding its U.S. production. Facing growing competition from Chinese cars in other markets, the Korean auto giant still sees the U.S. as its best market for growth, The New York Times reported Monday. “My top three priorities are U-S-A,” José Muñoz, chief executive of Hyundai Motor Company, the car-making subsidiary, said at the company’s annual investor gathering, reportedly pausing for effect after each letter. “If we do well here, it’s very good for Korea. It’s very good for the company.”

The chance to reap the fruits of what Heatmap contributor Andrew Moseman called Hyundai’s “incredible timing” may be too tempting to pass up, even as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid sparked a diplomatic crisis involving South Korea’s foreign minister. The company spent three years working on the 2,900-acre campus near Savannah, and sought to make a public statement about its support for President Donald Trump’s re-industrialization plans by naming the facility Metaplant America. With tariffs now coming into force, Andrew argued, Hyundai is better positioned than most to supply the domestic market.

4. Palisades nuclear plant takes another big step toward restarting

The Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan received fresh nuclear fuel on Monday in what the facility’s owner called “a major milestone on the path to restarting” a permanently shuttered atomic station for the first time in the U.S. As I reported in this newsletter at the time, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Holtec International the green light to restart the facility in July, setting a new precedent for reauthorizing operations at a plant that was already slated for decommissioning. The project faced some local opposition from not-in-my-backyard types backed by the anti-nuclear group Beyond Nuclear. But the Trump administration stood behind the project. The $1.5 billion loan granted by the Biden-era Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office to Holtec to fund the reopening was the only financing deal the agency maintained without any interruption through the change in leadership.

Aside from the 68 fuel assemblies arriving, Holtec said “major equipment restoration work is progressing,” including the reassembly of the main turbine generator and the chemical cleaning of the steam generators. Once complete, the work will remake Holtec — until now primarily a manufacturer of casks to store nuclear waste and a decommissioning company — into an operator of an active power plant. In a press release, Holtec CEO Kris Singh called the “esprit de corps of our tirelessly toiling worker force” a “testament to the national consensus and our collective will to harness nuclear energy to meet the galloping demand for power in our country.”

5. World’s top private carbon registry expands into superpollutants

Isometric bills itself as the world’s leading carbon registry, providing what it calls “scientifically rigorous carbon removal credits so companies can reliably meet their climate commitments.” Now the British company is expanding its operations to cover two climate superpollutants: landfill methane and hydrofluorocarbons. The startup plans to develop protocols for eliminating emissions of both superheating gases with its in-house science team and network of more than 300 outside researchers. Among its partners will be Recoolit, a company that collects and destroys refrigerants and previously partnered with Google to destroy the carbon dioxide equivalent of 250,000 metric tons of superpollutants. Another is Cool Effect, a California-based nonprofit that sells carbon credits for landfill gas collection projects. It worked with Google earlier this year to support the installation of methane destruction equipment at a landfill in Cuiabá, Brazil. “Superpollutants are responsible for nearly half of global warming,” Eamon Jubbawy, Isometric’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Isometric is entering this market to bring the scientific rigour needed to help this crucial climate solution scale, using the same transparent approach that is building the trust needed to scale the carbon removal market.”

THE KICKER

Call the paradox of shrinking sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. Overall, it’s a disaster. But the mass melting is fueling the engine of Arctic food chains: algae. A new study led by the University of Copenhagen suggests there will be more food for future marine life than previously thought. That will also improve the ocean’s carbon dioxide uptake, which the researchers said was “likely good news” for the climate. “But biological systems are very complex, so it is hard to make firm predictions, because other mechanisms may pull in the opposite direction,” Lasse Riemann, professor at the Department of Biology and senior author of the study, said in a press release. “We do not yet know whether the net effect will be beneficial for the climate.”

Newcleo and its partners are ready to add value to the transatlantic cooperation in providing clean, safe and secure energy. The agreement proves that the US and Europe can lead in this sector,” said Stefano Buono, founder and CEO of newcleo.

“By channeling large-scale transatlantic investments into the American advanced nuclear industry, the partnership exemplifies newcleo’s and Blykalla’s interest in the US market and supports the domestic expansion of Oklo’s fuel and fast-reactor technologies. Partnerships like this show how allied collaboration can strengthen energy innovation, leadership, and dominance in the United States,” says the press release announcing the partnership.

“This agreement to implement newcleo’s advanced fuel expertise into Oklo’s powerhouses and invest $2 billion into American infrastructure and advanced fuel solutions is yet another win for President Donald J Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda,” said Secretary of the Interior and Chairman of the US National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. “This administration is committed to enhancing energy security, creating more American jobs, and ensuring that the United States remains at the forefront of global energy production and innovation, and I’m honoured to support today’s announcement to advance these goals.”

Oklo is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale, establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes, and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the Department of Energy (DOE) for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel from Idaho National Laboratory (INL), and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with DOE and National Laboratories.

Newcleo is working to design, build, and operate Gen-IV Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs) that are cooled by liquid lead and fuelled by reprocessed nuclear waste. With over 100 partnerships and collaborations across the nuclear industry, the growth of the newcleo group is supported through targeted acquisition of key companies.

Blykalla is the Swedish developer of advanced SMRs, commercialising lead-cooled fast reactors for industrial use. The SEALER technology is a compact 55 MWe unit designed to offer a safe, efficient, and scalable power solution.

Oklo says it is on track to bring its first plant online at INL before the end of the decade. Blykalla plans to achieve criticality for its first SEALER reactor by 2030 and begin serial production in the 2030s. According to newcleo’s delivery roadmap, its first lead-cooled fast reactor is expected to be operational in France by the end of 2031.

These targets may prove to be over ambitious. Currently, the only operating liquid metal-cooled fast reactors are in Russia, using sodium as the coolant. Russia is also constructing the world’s first ever lead-cooled SMR (Brest-OD-300). This reactor is based on decades of complex research and development supported by the entire Russian nuclear industry. It is due to begin operation in 2029. By contrast, the fast reactor technologies of Oklo, newcleo and Blykalla are still in the design stage.",https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/10/Oklo-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:05:30.356329

The measure takes the same common-sense approach: prioritizing American-made energy, reducing reliance on adversarial nations, and ensuring that “green” energy policy reflects economic and scientific reality.

Governor Landry had urged exactly this kind of action from Washington. When he signed Act 462, he called on Congress to adopt a national energy security strategy built around America’s abundant hydrocarbons – particularly natural gas and nuclear. His argument was simple: energy security is national security, and no country should be dependent on supply chains that run through Beijing, Moscow, or child-labor camps in the Congo.

The new federal bill answers that call.

A Return to Reality in Energy Policy

For too long, federal energy policy has been guided by slogans rather than science and economics. Policymakers in Washington have subsidized unreliable energy sources, ignored full life-cycle costs, and allowed critical infrastructure to depend on foreign materials produced under appalling labor and environmental standards.

Louisiana broke that mold. Act 462 directed state agencies to consider affordability, reliability, and domestic sourcing when evaluating energy projects. It mandated a new method to calculate the cost of energy that includes the hidden expenses of foreign supply chains – like child labor, environmental destruction, and geopolitical vulnerability. And it treated hydrocarbons such as natural gas not as an enemy of the environment, but as an ally of prosperity and innovation.

The federal legislation now mirrors those principles. It redefines “green” and “clean” energy to include not just intermittent renewables but also natural gas and nuclear power – resources that provide stable, dispatchable power without the economic and moral costs of dependence on foreign critical minerals.

An Abundance Waiting to Be Used

America’s natural gas reserves are among the largest in the world, yet federal policy has often treated them as a liability. Governor Landry challenged that mindset, arguing that America’s abundant hydrocarbons are a strategic advantage to be leveraged, not a problem to be managed.

By unlocking domestic production, the U.S. can achieve three vital goals: lower costs for consumers, greater resilience for the electric grid, and stronger national security. Every cubic foot of gas produced in Louisiana, Texas, or Ohio displaces energy that would otherwise come from countries that do not share our values. Every pipeline and LNG terminal built here strengthens our economy and weakens our adversaries.

The Louisiana model recognizes this interconnected truth. The federal version now before Congress brings that logic to the national stage.

Leading by Example

Louisiana’s success story demonstrates what happens when energy policy is grounded in reality. Since passing Act 462, the state has attracted new manufacturing investments, expanded LNG exports, and secured thousands of high-paying energy jobs. Businesses value predictability and affordability – two qualities that hydrocarbon energy delivers.

Governor Landry’s message to Congress was clear: Build energy policy around American resources, American workers, and American values. Representative Balderson’s introduction of this new federal legislation proves that message was heard.

A New Energy Consensus

The debate over energy is no longer between “green” and “dirty.” It’s between the real and the imaginary. The real path to clean, affordable, reliable energy lies in embracing the resources beneath our feet – using innovation, not ideology, to reduce emissions and expand opportunity.

By adopting a new framework, Congress is taking a crucial step toward restoring balance, security, and common sense to national energy policy. The era of energy dependence and self-inflicted scarcity can end – if Washington has the will.

Louisiana showed the way. Now it’s time for Congress to finish the job.

.

The Upper Sioux Community has asked the

to allow it to purchase electricity for its

in rural Granite Falls from Xcel Energy in place of the power it now buys from the rural cooperative operating in west central Minnesota.

The formal request asks the PUC to place Prairie's Edge in the service territory of

of Minneapolis.

The PUC will decide at its

whether to investigate the request. It is expected to look favorably on it. PUC member John Tuma had raised the possibility of re-assigning the service territory during a July 24 hearing on the tribal community's complaint with the cooperative.

At the hearing, commission members chastised the cooperative for its threat to turn off electrical service to Prairie's Edge if the Upper Sioux Community activated a 2.5-megawatt solar array and battery system.

The Upper Sioux Community has constructed a system to provide renewable energy, partially offsetting the electricity purchased for its commercial operations. The behind-meter solar system will not connect to the Minnesota Valley Cooperative Light and Power Association's distribution system, which currently provides power to Prairie's Edge. Prairie's Edge Casino Resort operations require roughly 18 megawatts of power on an average day, according to documents filed with the PUC.

In filings with the PUC, Minnesota Valley challenged the Upper Sioux Community's request to change the service territory.

Minnesota Valley charges in its filing that the PUC lacks jurisdiction or authority to consider the transfer under Minnesota law, as the Upper Sioux Community is not an electric utility. The cooperative also stated that it has embedded costs based on projected future electrical use by the Upper Sioux Community and other cooperative members.

""To allow Upper Sioux to be served by another electric utility provider would be at a cost to all other members of Minnesota Valley and (would) be inconsistent"" with a Minnesota statute, according to the filing by Matthew Haugen, attorney with Nelson Oyen Torvik, representing the cooperative.

Based in Montevideo, the cooperative serves roughly 5,200 rural customers in eight counties.

Xcel Energy indicated it is open to serving the tribal operations. It stated it has met with tribal leadership about the possibility of serving Prairie's Edge Casino Resort.

The private utility is determining the feasibility and costs of extending its distribution lines to Prairie's Edge Casino Resort. A portion of that cost would be charged to the Upper Sioux Community, according to a filing with the PUC by Nicholas Martin, director of strategic outreach and advocacy with Xcel Energy.

The Upper Sioux Community stated in its filings that Xcel Energy has an adequate power supply to serve Prairie's Edge, and that no significant or duplicative infrastructure investment would be needed. Xcel has a distribution network in the vicinity of the location.

The Upper Sioux Community prefers to transfer to the service territory of Xcel Energy. The threat to discontinue electrical service by Minnesota Valley if the solar system is activated jeopardizes the community's access to adequate, reliable power, according to its filing with the PUC.

""Without adequate and reliable power, the Community's ability to fund its essential government functions will be at risk,"" stated Joshua Peerson, with the law firm of Faegre Drinker, representing the Upper Sioux Community in the filing with the PUC.

Peerson also referenced the ""contentious"" relationship between the tribal entity and the power cooperative in his filing.

The Upper Sioux Community filed its initial complaint with the PUC over the threat to discontinue service by Minnesota Valley if the solar system was activated.

Minnesota Valley charges that the solar system violates the cooperative's policies. The system would reduce revenues to the cooperative, which would increase the cost of power for all of the cooperative's members, the cooperative's attorney told the PUC at the July hearing.

The Minnesota Department of Commerce and Minnesota Attorney General's Office filed a motion with the PUC asking that the complaint between the Upper Sioux Community and Minnesota Valley be stayed while the request for a change in service territory is considered. It pointed out that if the service territory change is enacted, the complaint would become moot.",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-10-22 14:06:09.117977

BNamericas: The Mexican power market is dominated by natural gas.","Momentum is building behind renewed private sector investment in power generation in Mexico under the administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum.

BNamericas spoke to Laura Picardo, senior associate at Oxford-based analytics firm Aurora Energy Research, which recently launched services in Mexico, about the outlook for the Mexican power market amid increased regulatory clarity and growing political support for private investors.

BNamericas: Why is now the right time for Aurora to enter the Mexican market?

Picardo: Mexico represents one of the largest and most dynamic energy markets in Latin America, with rapidly growing electricity demand and a pressing need for new investments in generation and transmission. The fundamentals are clear: population growth, industrial expansion, and electrification trends are driving long-term demand, and the country will need significant infrastructure development to meet these needs sustainably.

At Aurora, we focus on markets where private investment can play a meaningful role in supporting energy transitions. While Mexico’s regulatory framework is still evolving, we are seeing signs of greater clarity and momentum toward market development. For this reason, our clients are increasingly interested in Mexico, and many are preparing to invest once the regulatory direction becomes more defined. We believe that development will accelerate in the coming years.

BNamericas: How does your forecasting model for Mexico reflect ongoing changes to regulations?

Picardo: One of Aurora’s key strengths is that we own and operate our own proprietary power market model. This gives us full flexibility to adapt not only to changes in regulatory parameters, but also to shifts in market paradigms. For example, if the government mandates the deployment of 1GW of batteries annually, we can incorporate that directly into the model and assess its impact on system dynamics and pricing.

But our flexibility goes beyond simple inputs. We can simulate structural changes such as the introduction of ancillary services, evolving dispatch rules, or the growing role of storage technologies to explore how these developments reshape the wholesale market.

BNamericas: Mexico has a nodal electricity market. How do you model that?

Picardo: In a nodal market, prices vary depending on the location of each substation and the amount of supply and demand at that specific substation. It is very important for generators to have highly specific price forecasts to help them close project financing and make the right investments. Small differences in prices can make a major difference to the size of a loan.

We forecast prices at a nodal level across the US and other Latin American markets and have the capability to do this in Mexico. However, we also believe it is important to understand the evolution of trends at a slightly more macro level, so we cluster nodes in hubs that represent areas of similar dynamics and persistent congestion.

BNamericas: Are your clients mainly developers?

Picardo: Developers are an important part of our client base, but certainly not the only one. We also work with utilities, investment funds, banks, government agencies, regulators, and large energy consumers. Our clients range from those deeply involved in market design and system operations to those focused on financing and long-term contracting. Our ability to produce bankable price curves makes us a trusted partner for project finance and investment decisions.

BNamericas: As well as electricity prices, what other inputs influence investment decisions in Mexico?

Picardo: Electricity prices are a key input, but investors also need to understand broader market dynamics, in terms of both regulation and operation. For example, curtailment risk is becoming increasingly relevant as more renewables are added to the grid. Knowing when and where generation might be constrained helps assess the true value of a project.

The capacity market also plays an important role. It is designed to incentivize firm capacity, traditionally thermal plants, and increasingly batteries. In Mexico, batteries are currently recognized as firm capacity under specific conditions, but these rules may evolve as the energy mix changes. The government has proposed that batteries be co-located with intermittent renewables, with a minimum of 30% of the renewable capacity, though final details are still pending.

Ancillary services are another area to watch. The regulatory framework for battery participation in ancillary services is still under development, but it will be a key factor in future investment decisions.

In general, we help clients evaluate these risks and opportunities through scenario-based modeling, whether it’s changes in dispatch rules, market design, or technology costs. This allows investors to make informed decisions in a market that is evolving quickly.

BNamericas: How does your model reflect the risk of curtailments and congestion?

Picardo: This is one of the key outputs of our model. In nodal markets like Mexico, we model power flows, so we provide forecasts of curtailment for every node or regional hub that we model.

BNamericas: The Mexican power market is dominated by natural gas. What challenges does that present to investors in renewables and batteries?

Picardo: The role of gas in Mexico will depend on how the system evolves, but its current dominance does shape market behavior and investment signals.

For battery developers, lower volatility and limited solar penetration mean energy arbitrage revenues may be lower than in markets where daytime prices regularly fall to zero. In Mexico, this makes other revenue streams like capacity payments and ancillary services especially important to support investment. As the market evolves, these mechanisms will play a key role in enabling the build-out of flexible technologies.

At the same time, if renewable penetration grows as it has in other countries, then intraday pricing dynamics will help drive further growth in flexible technologies like batteries, particularly if gas continues to be price-setting during evening hours.

BNamericas: Based on your discussions with the industry, what is the mood in the Mexican power sector after one year of the new administration?

Picardo: Sentiment is cautiously optimistic. There is a clear recognition across the industry that Mexico needs significant investment in new capacity to meet growing demand and support its energy transition. President Sheinbaum is seen as more open to renewables than her predecessor, which is encouraging, though her administration is also reinforcing the role of [state-owned utility] CFE, which adds complexity and uncertainty.

While many expect the market to open further and private investment to be incentivized over the long term, short-term uncertainty remains. Key regulatory and operational details are still being defined, even after the latest publications in early October. Until there’s more clarity, especially around how private participation will be structured, investors are likely to remain cautious. But the fundamentals point to a strong need for development, and we expect momentum to build as the regulatory framework becomes clearer.

We need to own the moment.” The politics of AI data centers start local The fraught and politically chaotic debate is unfolding this way because data centers are largely a bottom-up issue, said Megan Mullin, a professor of public policy at UCLA.
In New Jersey, for example, residents have already seen a sudden sharp rise in energy prices caused by the data centers.
“And now they’re demanding that lawmakers do something about it.” Many residents are also questioning whether building AI data centers aligns with New Jersey’s broader land-use goals.
One consistent thing that makes no sense is: Where are our data centers?” Whether seen as a generational economic opportunity or a looming crisis, AI data centers are no longer quiet background infrastructure.","Those debates are coming to a head this fall in Virginia and New Jersey—the only states holding gubernatorial elections this year. The two races offer early test cases for how the politics of AI infrastructure could shape campaigns nationwide in 2026 and beyond. At issue are tax incentives and infrastructure costs states are offering to attract hyperscale AI data centers; mounting concerns about electricity and water use; the limited local jobs such projects deliver compared with their enormous resource demands; and growing scrutiny of Big Tech’s political influence—all against the backdrop of a two-party scramble to control the pace and terms of the AI buildout.

In Virginia, Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger, who is polling as the frontrunner, has made data centers’ outsize energy demands a central issue, calling for tech companies to pay a “fair share” for the grid infrastructure their AI operations require. Her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, supports continued data center growth while blaming Virginia’s Democratic leaders for pushing clean energy mandates too quickly, arguing that it’s their policies that threaten grid reliability and drive up costs.

Similar tensions are playing out in New Jersey, where Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill backs legislation that would require data centers to help fund grid modernization, while Republican Jack Ciattarelli is focused on attracting more facilities to “supercharge economic growth” and wants to bring new natural gas plants online to meet the soaring demand.

But the political calculus is more complicated than a simple left-versus-right divide. As electricity bills climb, candidates are turning their fire on data centers in a rare populist backlash that cuts across party lines. For instance, in Virginia, dueling candidates for a local board of supervisors seat in Prince William County—Republican Patrick Harders and Democrat George Stewart—have both called for a ban on new facilities. “I think we should, personally, block all future data centers,” Harders said. Stewart agreed, decrying “the crushing and overwhelming weight of data centers” and accusing “massive companies” of forcing residents to “pay for their energy.”

Even within the GOP, divisions are surfacing. Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley publicly clashed this week with his own party’s state senate president pro tempore, Cindy O’Laughlin, after she wrote a letter urging him to stop raising questions about data centers and rising electricity rates. “Not a chance,” Hawley fired back on X. “These data centers are massive electricity hogs. That’s why Silicon Valley wants more transmission lines, solar farms, and windmills. Somebody has to pay for it all—and don’t believe any politician who says it won’t ultimately be you.”

But both parties are also leaning into the data center boom. Some of those who subscribe to the center-left “abundance” agenda (first articulated by journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson) have framed these facilities as essential building blocks of a progressive future built on universal broadband, advanced AI, and a decarbonized grid. The pro-business right, meanwhile, celebrates every new project as proof it can attract investment and fuel economic growth.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made winning the AI race with China a central priority, and is pushing an AI Action Plan that aims to speed up data center approvals and bolster the grid to meet soaring demand. In an era where investment in AI infrastructure contributes a large and increasing portion of the nation’s economic growth, segments of both parties are competing to be the ones showing they can get things built, and quickly—and to appease the deep-pocketed tech companies that require ever more computing power.

This has led to some strange bedfellows. In Pennsylvania, for example, Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro took the stage at an AI summit at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon spearheaded by the state’s Republican senator, Dave McCormick, and attended by President Donald Trump. The event came on the heels of Amazon announcing it would invest $20 billion to build data center campuses in Luzerne and Bucks counties.

“I can imagine a world where it would be easy for [Shapiro] to just stay neutral,” said Joanna Doven, creator of Pennsylvania’s AI Strike Team, which aims to make Pittsburgh a global hub for AI innovation and jobs. “But our state hasn’t been a high-growth state — he inherited that — so we’ve got to turn the economy back on.” AI is here to stay, she emphasized. “And it needs power, it needs data centers. We have all the resources to meet that demand. We need to own the moment.”

The politics of AI data centers start local

The fraught and politically chaotic debate is unfolding this way because data centers are largely a bottom-up issue, said Megan Mullin, a professor of public policy at UCLA. “Communities across the U.S. vary widely in their ability to absorb new projects, new development, and new construction—and in their receptivity to it,” she told Fortune. “Like with housing development, there are places where it’s embraced and others where it’s viewed as a threat.”

When it comes to economic development, AI data centers operate differently from, say, auto plants: For one thing, data centers aren’t major long-term job engines once construction ends. The build-out phase can deliver a construction boom—in Abilene, Texas, for example, several thousand people are working on OpenAI’s flagship “Stargate” complex—but the permanent workforce is expected to be only around 1,700, and it’s unclear how many of those jobs will be full-time. At other AI data centers the numbers are even smaller: Meta’s $10 billion, 4-million-square-foot facility on a former farm site in Northeast Louisiana, expects to offer only 300-500 permanent jobs after construction.

This has raised questions about whether the huge tax incentives and infrastructure investments these sites demand from state and municipal governments (such as power stations, transmission lines, water supply upgrades, and roads) will pay off for local communities.

The electricity question in particular has struck a nerve. Grid operators are warning of steep increases in electricity demand for the first time in decades, leading utilities to race to expand capacity by reviving plans for natural-gas plants or building new ones, and, in some regions, even extending the life of deteriorating coal facilities. (The wind and solar industries that had been expected to grow and absorb some of this demand took a heavy blow in the accelerated phase-out of federal tax credits for renewable energy projects in this summer’s Republican-backed spending bill.)

In Georgia—one of only about ten states where utility regulators are elected—two seats on the Public Service Commission (PSC) are on the ballot in November. Democrats Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard are challenging incumbent Republicans, and Hubbard has made data centers a campaign issue. “Those data centers are being offered a sweetheart deal of five cents a kilowatt-hour, while you and I, residential customers, pay 21 cents,” he said at a recent local forum. “That’s why they’re coming to Georgia—because we give them sweetheart deals and tax abatements and other perks. That’s costing you. That’s why we have to fight at the PSC.” If Democrats win, it would break the commission’s all-Republican control for the first time in nearly two decades—and potentially reshape how Georgia regulates power for AI facilities.

The politics of data centers are now also weaving into broader campaign strategies, Mullin told Fortune, and the building ambitions of deep-pocketed tech companies are becoming an inevitable factor on both sides of the political aisle. “Candidates are lining up the coalition that they want to bring them into office,” she said. That may mean thinking about a cross-partisan challenger down the road, she explained, but right now they are thinking about their primary challenger and how they are going to win their party’s nomination. “That’s where this becomes really important,” she said.

In California, for example, Governor Gavin Newsom recently vetoed a bill that would have required data centers to report their projected and annual water usage, saying he was reluctant to impose what he called “rigid reporting requirements” without fully understanding the impact on businesses and consumers. The move was consistent with the anti-red-tape aspects of the “abundance” agenda that Newsom has embraced, but Mullin noted that it may be as much about politics as policy: It also is likely to please California’s powerful tech industry.

“It’s about lining up the endorsers and funders who will put him in a position of strength for whatever he pursues next,” she explained. “He is taking steps that make it seem like he’s building a coalition, and some segment of tech leaders would be a really critical part of that coalition.”

A populist flashpoint

Those pressures on the leaders of both parties have been evident since President Trump was elected and began to welcome a parade of tech leaders visiting the White House and Mar a Lago to make the case for AI infrastructure needs—from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

However, those pressures are also being met by another powerful force in some states: growing populist anger from residents—and voters—over rising utility bills.

In New Jersey, for example, residents have already seen a sudden sharp rise in energy prices caused by the data centers. New Jerseyans’ electricity rates rose roughly 20% at the start of June as a result of price-setting capacity auctions—the market where power producers are paid to guarantee future supply. Power prices soared to new highs on the expectation of data centers’ ballooning electricity needs, and are expected to rise again next June.

Combined with an intense summer heat wave, the surge caught many residents off guard, said Alex Ambrose, a transportation and climate policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective. “People were not expecting that kind of increase,” Ambrose said. “And now they’re demanding that lawmakers do something about it.”

Many residents are also questioning whether building AI data centers aligns with New Jersey’s broader land-use goals. One proposed facility in central New Jersey, for example, would be built on farmland, sparking opposition from locals who value the region’s green open spaces. The debate echoes the warehouse boom that swept the state during the pandemic, when developers sought to build on preserved land—but residents say data centers are worse because they create few long-term jobs. And even when these facilities aren’t in their backyard, New Jerseyans still feel their impact. Because the state is part of a regional power grid, electricity demand from data centers in neighboring states can drive up utility bills at home.

One thing seems inevitable to many: The data centers will be built somewhere, as American tech companies race against each other and China for AI supremacy and the elusive goal of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)—AI systems as capable as, or more capable than, humans.

State-level proponents say this is the moment to profit from the gold rush. “If we wait for a perfect scenario, the jobs are going to keep getting shipped off to Ohio,” said Doven, of Pennsylvania’s AI Strike Team. “And I can tell you, sitting here in Pittsburgh—the Steel City, and the city where we have the world’s number one AI school, Carnegie Mellon—there is something big happening here. One consistent thing that makes no sense is: Where are our data centers?”

Whether seen as a generational economic opportunity or a looming crisis, AI data centers are no longer quiet background infrastructure. They’re shaping elections, rewiring energy policy, and testing how far communities—and politicians—are willing to go to power the next era of technology.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22626159/GettyImages-2217034105-e1761085110930.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 18:07:10.483273

“We want a sustainable fleet,” says Sean McBride, executive director of Kalamazoo Metro Transit, “not just an environmentally sustainable fleet but a financially sustainable fleet that we can maintain efficiently.
If Metro Transit receives the funding it needs, he says, “We’ll do a slow transition over time” to more energy-efficient vehicles.
On some local routes, Metro Transit buses typically travel about 300 miles in a day.
Use public transit for some of your day-to-day activities instead of taking out your individual car every time.”","KALAMAZOO, MI — Kalamazoo’s public transit system is soon hoping to know if it has the federal support to add more hybrid electric buses to its fleet.

In July, Metro Transit submitted a bid for funding that would allow it to acquire up to eight new diesel/electric hybrid buses. It is working through the Michigan Department of Transportation to land a competitive No-Low Grant, a reference to no-emissions or low-emissions. Metro has made funding requests during each of the past two years, but they have not yet been approved. The competitive grants, which are provided by the Federal Transit Administration, would help as the public transit system looks to replenish its 45-bus fleet. It looks to replace two to three buses each year.

“We want a sustainable fleet,” says Sean McBride, executive director of Kalamazoo Metro Transit, “not just an environmentally sustainable fleet but a financially sustainable fleet that we can maintain efficiently. And with emerging technologies like battery electric and hydrogen fusion, that adds to the complexity and the cost. So all those things have to be taken into account to determine what’s about to happen.”

About $4 million of Metro Transit’s $27.5 million annual budget is federal funding that it uses for vehicles, facilities, and operations. New diesel buses presently cost about $775,000 each. Diesel/electric hybrid buses cost about $1.2 million each, he says. And all-electric buses cost about $1.6 million each.

If Metro Transit receives the funding it needs, he says, “We’ll do a slow transition over time” to more energy-efficient vehicles. If it is not successful this year, it will continue to apply for federal grants to get the necessary funding, McBride says.

What would be necessary for the system to go to all-electric buses?

“Going to a pure electric vehicle bus fleet — what would that require?” McBride asked himself. “No. 1 is that we’d need the charging facilities to do that, and that’s a pretty heavy tax on the (electric power) grid.”

Metro would have to work closely with Consumers Energy to rework the power grid at the Kalamazoo Transit Center on 450 N. Burdick St. in order to supply enough recharging power. He says he does not know what it would cost to retrofit the facility for a large fleet of all-electric vehicles. But he says using all-electric vehicles is very unlikely to happen until there is an improvement in battery technology.

He estimated that present technology allows an all-electric bus to travel about 150 miles before it needs to be recharged. On some local routes, Metro Transit buses typically travel about 300 miles in a day. So, all-electric buses do not yet provide the travel range Metro needs now.

“We want a sustainable fleet, not just an environmentally sustainable fleet but a financially sustainable fleet that we can maintain efficiently. And with emerging technologies like battery electric and hydrogen fusion, that adds to the complexity and the cost.” — Sean McBride, executive director of Kalamazoo Metro Transit

Speaking of the technological advancements, he says, “It is moving in that direction for sure. But we need to see it work and get to that 250- or 300-mile range before we’re safe for a full transition.”

Metro Transit currently has nine diesel/electric hybrid buses. They have battery packs on top, and they supply power automatically, as needed.

“They run on batteries when they’re basically in flat conditions (and) in a controlled speed of say 30 to 50 mph speed,” McBride says. “When they are accelerating to get up a hill, they’ll use the diesel fuel, or when they exceed a certain rate of speed, they’ll use diesel fuel.”

While hybrid buses reduce carbon emissions, they would not provide a great improvement in terms of fuel consumption. Hybrids get about 4 miles per gallon of fuel, versus 3 miles per gallon with straight diesel fuel.

McBride says the public transit system, which provides area residents with 175 million rides per year, is also doing a facilities assessment to determine the need at its Kalamazoo Transportation Center at 459 N. Burdick St. and its administration building.

What will the upcoming millage support?

McBride says he continues to speak to community groups and others about the upcoming Nov. 5 election and Metro’s request for a millage increase to help maintain the core bus system and to grow Metro Link, an on-demand transit service it launched last year.

It is requesting a millage increase to 1.1 mills for five years (up from 0.9 mills currently). Starting in the fall of 2026, the new levy is expected to provide about 36 percent of the $27.5 million Metro Transit will need to provide services next year. The increase will cost the owner of a $200,000 house in Kalamazoo County about $110 annually.

What is the long-range goal for the system?

McBride says the biggest contributor to land pollution and air emissions pollution is traffic in general — the number of cars on the road. If we can make public transportation a greater choice for people, it can have a positive effect on the quality of life here.

“I think the bigger goal is to make public transit a choice for your mobility around town,” McBride says. “Use public transit for getting to work. Use public transit for some of your day-to-day activities instead of taking out your individual car every time.”",https://d1773um9yf4e9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/22103246/DSC_1362.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 11:25:13.591808

Smith, who has now revived this work at Climate Central, said the latest dataset was compiled using the same methodology as Noaa.
“Climate Central is trying to step into the void of information to recover some of the lost expertise and tools that society needs access to.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has slashed staff numbers, with Trump demanding states, rather than the federal government, shoulder the fallout from major disasters.
We are basically sitting ducks for when the next major disaster hits.”","The first half of 2025 was the costliest on record for major disasters in the US, driven by huge wildfires in Los Angeles and storms that battered much of the rest of the country, according to a climate non-profit that has resurrected work axed by Donald Trump’s administration that tracked the biggest disasters.

In the first six months of this year, 14 separate weather-related disasters that each caused at least $1bn in damage hit the US, the Climate Central group has calculated. In total, these events cost $101bn in damages – lost homes, businesses, highways and other infrastructure – a toll higher than any other first half of a year since records on this began in 1980.

The bulk of this toll was caused by the ferocious wildfires that razed parts of Los Angeles in January, a disaster that destroyed about 16,000 buildings and resulted in the indirect deaths of around 400 people. At $61bn in damages, the LA fires are one of the most expensive climate-related disasters on record in the US, and the only top 10 event that is not a hurricane.

The mounting cost of fires, storms, hurricanes, drought and floods – all worsened by the human-caused climate crisis – was charted over the previous 45 years by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), until the Trump administration “retired” the dataset in May, citing “evolving priorities, statutory mandates and staffing changes”.

Information on billion-dollar disasters until the end of 2024 is still available, frozen, on Noaa’s website, but Climate Central has sought to extend this work, citing its importance as a barometer of the climate crisis as well as a planning resource for cities and states facing increasing dangers from extreme weather impacts.

Over the past four decades, such disasters have become far more savage. The cost of all disasters between 1985 and 1995 was $299bn, a figure dwarfed by the damages of the past decade – with $1.4tn in losses between 2014 and last year.

“This dataset is simply too important to not be updated, we were getting requests from the private sector, local communities and academia for this information,” said Adam Smith, who headed the billion-dollar disaster project at Noaa, before ending his 20-year spell at the agency in May amid a purge of the federal workforce by Trump.

Smith, who has now revived this work at Climate Central, said the latest dataset was compiled using the same methodology as Noaa. “We are certainly seeing more of these big, costly events, since 2017 it’s been on an entirely different level,” he said. “Climate change is supercharging the intensity and frequency of these extremes.

“Climate Central is trying to step into the void of information to recover some of the lost expertise and tools that society needs access to. We are in a sort of triage situation where we are trying to save and continue as much as we can. We are doing the best we can to do this.”

The initial Climate Central update ends in June, meaning it doesn’t capture July’s deadly floods in Texas, which killed more than 130 people, including young girls camping beside a river that burst its banks.

Also, so far this year the US has not been hit by a major, destructive hurricane, meaning that 2025 is currently not on track to be among the most costly on record by year’s end. The lack of hurricanes making landfall is fortunate, experts have said, particularly as the Trump administration has sought to dismantle the disaster response that Americans have come to take for granted.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has slashed staff numbers, with Trump demanding states, rather than the federal government, shoulder the fallout from major disasters.

The agency has faced criticism over its leadership, its sluggish response times to disasters and for the politically motivated withholding of its funds – last week, a federal judge ruled that Fema could not halt grants to Democratic-run states due to differences over immigration policies.

This is a “tremendous concern” given the growing threat from disasters that are being worsened by the climate crisis, as well as population shifts to risky areas such as Florida and the failure to update infrastructure to cope with a warming world, according to Samantha Montano, an expert in emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

“No part of the country is being left unscathed, but unfortunately Fema has backslid to becoming a dysfunctional and ineffectual agency,” Montano said. Improvements made to Fema since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 have been wiped out under Trump, Montano added, leaving local and state agencies unsure of how to cope when disasters strike.

“Fema has fired people who have unique expertise who can’t just be hired back at five hours’ notice, so even if the administration wanted to respond effectively to a disaster I’m not sure it’s possible for them to do so,” she said.

“We’ve got extremely lucky we’ve not had any bigger disasters than we’ve already had this year. We are basically sitting ducks for when the next major disaster hits.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e044269b7f3589012f970cbc7ffe331c343446d9/0_0_1500_1200/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=216bf8a78ab3091630d3cc037cc908a1",N,,2025-10-22 12:10:12.029560

Anning Corporation

Clean energy company Anning Corporation is working to develop geologic hydrogen, a natural carbon-free fuel, using its proprietary stimulation approaches and advanced exploration modeling. The company said that geologic hydrogen has the potential to be the lowest-cost source of reliable baseload electricity in the U.S.

The company was founded by CEO Sophie Broun in 2024 and is a member of Greentown Labs. Last month, it also announced that it was chosen to participate in Breakthrough Energy’s prestigious Fellows Program. Anning raised a pre-seed round this year and is currently raising a $6 million seed round.

Capwell Services

Houston-based methane capture company Capwell Services works to eliminate vented oil and gas emissions economically for operators. According to the company, methane emissions are vented from most oil and gas facilities due to safety protocols, and operators are not able to capture the gas cost-effectively, leading operators to emit more than 14 million metric tons of methane per year in the U.S. and Canada. Founded in 2022, Capwell specializes in low and intermittent flow vents for methane capture.

The company began as a University of Pennsylvania senior design project led by current CEO Andrew Lane. It has since participated in programs with Greentown Labs and Rice Clean Energy Accelerator. The company moved to Houston in 2023 and raised a pre-seed round. It has also received federal funding from the DOE. Capwell is currently piloting its commercial unit with oil and gas operators.

Deep Anchor Solutions

Offshore energy consulting and design company Deep Anchor Solutions aims to help expedite the adoption of floating offshore energy infrastructure with its deeply embedded ring anchor (DERA) technology. According to the company, its patented DERA system can be installed quietly without heavy-lift vessels, reducing anchor-related costs by up to 75 percent and lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent.

The company was founded in 2023 by current CEO Junho Lee and CTO Charles Aubeny. Lee earned his Ph.D. in geotechnical engineering from Texas A&M University, where Aubeny is a professor of civil and environmental engineering. The company has participated in numerous accelerators and incubators, including Greentown Labs, MassChallenge, EnergyTech Nexus LiftOff, and others. Lee is an Activate 2025 fellow.

Eclipse Energy

Previously known as Gold H2, Eclipse Energy converts end-of-life oil fields into low-cost, sustainable hydrogen sources. It completed its first field trial this summer, which demonstrated subsurface bio-stimulated hydrogen production. According to the company, its technology could yield up to 250 billion kilograms of low-carbon hydrogen, which is estimated to provide enough clean power to Los Angeles for over 50 years and avoid roughly 1 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

Eclipse is a spinoff of Houston biotech company Cemvita. It was founded in 2022 by Moji Karimi (CEO and chairman of Cemvita), Prabhdeep Sekhon (CEO of Eclipse), Tara Karimi, and Rayyan Islam. The company closed an $8 million series A this year and has plans to raise another round in 2026.

Loop Bioproducts

Agricultural chemical manufacturing company Loop Bioproducts leverages the physiology of prickly pear cactus grown in Texas to produce bioenergy, food, and remediate industrial wastewater streams. The company uses its remote sensing technology, proprietary image-based machine learning model, and R&D innovation to capture raw biogas from the cactuses and is focused on scaling cactuses as an industrial crop on land.

Rhiannon Parker founded Loop Bioproducts in 2023.

Mars Materials

Clean chemical manufacturing business Mars Materials is working to convert captured carbon into resources, such as carbon fiber and wastewater treatment chemicals. The company develops and produces its drop-in chemical products in Houston and uses an in-licensed process for the National Renewable Energy Lab to produce acrylonitrile, which is used to produce plastics, synthetic fibers, and rubbers. The company reports that it plans to open its first commercial plant in the next 18 months.

Founded in 2019 by CEO Aaron Fitzgerald, CTO Kristian Gubsch, and lead engineer Trey Sheridan, the company has raised just under $1 million in capital and is backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, Shell, Black & Veatch, and other organizations.

Solidec

Chemical manufacturing company Solidec has developed autonomous generators that extract molecules from water and air and converts them into pure chemicals and fuels that are free of carbon emissions onsite, eliminating the need for transport, storage, and permitting. The company was founded around innovations developed by Rice University associate professor Haotian Wang.

The company was selected for the Chevron Technology Ventures’ catalyst program, Greentown Labs, NSF I-Corps and was part of the first cohort of the Activate Houston program. It won first place at the 2024 startup pitch competition at CERAWeek. Solidec was founded in 2023 by Wang, who serves as chief scientist, CEO Ryan DuChanois, and CTO Yang Xia.

There are two main project types: storage-only projects and co-located projects. Storage-only projects are stand-alone battery systems that store electricity from the grid when it’s cheap or abundant, then deliver it during times of high demand. Co-located projects combine a renewable energy source with batteries at the same site, allowing them to store extra power and sell it later at better prices.

Both models face regulatory hurdles. In many areas, rules for how storage participates in electricity markets are still evolving. For example, FERC’s Order No. 841 requires grid operators to let storage access wholesale markets, but implementation details vary by region[1]. Co-located projects may qualify for ITC credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, but developers must meet specific requirements to receive these benefits[2]. Because of this regulatory complexity, lenders often prefer projects in more tried-and-true markets, such as solar and wind.

A major challenge for storage-only projects is merchant risk; in other words, the uncertainty of relying on shifting market prices for most of their revenue as the catalyst to sell energy. To reduce this risk, developers may seek long-term contracts or diversify income through services like capacity support and frequency regulation[3]. Co-located projects can lower merchant risk because they combine steady renewable generation sales with battery services, leading to more predictable income streams.

From the lender’s point of view, financing depends on confidence in the project’s revenue model, compliance with regulations, and proven technology performance. Stand-alone storage often faces more scrutiny and might require higher developer equity. Co-located projects may seem more attractive due to their combined revenue sources, but they also require careful operations to maximize both generation and storage potential. As policies and markets mature, lenders are expected to grow more comfortable with both models, especially those backed by stable contracts and clear regulatory approval[4].

“Eos Energy’s expansion in Allegheny County is a testament to our region’s collaborative spirit and commitment to shared prosperity.”

“With this expansion, Eos is strengthening two of the key industries at the center of our Economic Development Strategy — energy and manufacturing.”

Governor Josh Shapiro and his Administration have competed for and won nearly $26 billion in private sector investments since taking office, creating more than 13,200 new jobs, and driving economic growth across Pennsylvania.

Harrisburg, PA – Today, Governor Josh Shapiro announced a $352.9 million investment by Eos Energy Enterprises (Eos) — the nation’s leading manufacturer of American-made zinc-based battery storage systems — to relocate its headquarters from New Jersey to Pittsburgh and expand manufacturing operations in Allegheny County, creating and retaining 1,000 total jobs, including 735 new positions.

The Commonwealth is investing $22 million in the project through grants and capital funding to support the relocation and expansion — a move that cements Pennsylvania’s status as a national hub for clean energy manufacturing and innovation.

Under Governor Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is the only state in the Northeast with a growing economy — attracting nearly $26 billion in private-sector investments and creating more than 13,200 new jobs since he took office.

Eos’s new Pittsburgh headquarters will open in 2026 at Nova Place on the North Shore, while its expanded 432,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Marshall Township will drive large-scale battery production and strengthen partnerships with Carnegie Mellon University and other local institutions to develop advanced energy technologies.

Also today, Eos and Talen Energy Corporation have announced a strategic collaboration to develop energy storage projects across Pennsylvania to meet growing electricity demand and support AI and cloud computing infrastructure. The partnership will leverage Eos’ American-made Z3 zinc-based batteries and Talen’s existing generation assets, including operating and retired fossil fuel plants, to create multiple gigawatt-hours (GWh) of storage capacity. The goal is to enhance grid reliability, maximize existing infrastructure, and accelerate Pennsylvania’s clean energy transition.

What people are saying about Governor Shapiro’s latest energy and manufacturing win for Pennsylvania:

Joe Mastrangelo, Chief Executive Officer of Eos Energy: “In today’s competitive environment, and in what we’re working to achieve in powering the nation’s future, you need not only natural resources and technology innovations, but also a strong public-private partnership. What we are announcing today is built upon a strong industrial history, combined with a world class university ecosystem. Pennsylvania is positioning itself at the forefront of America’s energy transition — enabling us to bring America’s battery to scale.”

DCED Secretary Rick Siger: “With this expansion, Eos is strengthening two of the key industries at the center of our Economic Development Strategy — energy and manufacturing. We are committed to positioning Pennsylvania as both an energy leader and an economic powerhouse and bold investments like this one will help us get there. This project will create and sustain 1,000 jobs while expanding opportunity for people across Western Pennsylvania.”

Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato: “Eos Energy’s expansion in Allegheny County is a testament to our region’s collaborative spirit and commitment to shared prosperity. This significant expansion ― made possible with critical support from the US Department of Energy, Governor Josh Shapiro, and a commitment of $2 million from Allegheny County — highlights the power of partnership in driving economic growth. Together, we are not only creating hundreds of jobs in Allegheny County but also laying the groundwork for a sustainable future in clean tech-led manufacturing and clean energy.”

Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development: “Eos Energy’s decision to expand its manufacturing operations in Allegheny County is a powerful testament to the value proposition this region offers at the nexus of energy, manufacturing, and innovation. Eos’ move will not only strengthen our region’s position as a hub for advanced energy storage, but it will also attract new suppliers, partners, and innovators to the Pittsburgh region. We’re especially proud that this growth comes with a continued commitment to the company’s partnerships with local universities and the United Steelworkers—ensuring that good, family-sustaining jobs remain at the center of this story. This expansion underscores what’s possible when business, labor, and community work together to build a more resilient and competitive regional economy.”

Bernie Hall, USW District 10 Director: “From day one, when we met with Joe and the Eos team, they talked about building an American-made company, doing right by the community, and providing good, family-sustaining jobs. We hear that from many employers, but Eos truly lives it — it’s part of their culture and DNA. We’re proud to stand with them for this exciting announcement and see them grow and create these opportunities. Pennsylvania is the only Northeast state with a growing economy, and with the rise of data centers nationwide, energy demand is surging. At the heart of this, union workers are helping build a more affordable, sustainable energy sector here in Pennsylvania. Last year, the workers at Eos Energy voted to join our union — a pivotal moment for workers — and we’re eager to be part of this expanding and vital part of Pennsylvania’s economy.”

Matt Smith, Chief Growth Officer of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development: “This is the living embodiment of the value proposition of Pittsburgh sitting at the nexus of energy, innovation and manufacturing. Companies from EOS to Google and Meta are sending their toughest problems to Pittsburgh to fix. This is a region that can host manufacturing in each and every county. We continue to be able to make things here.”

Our changing climate not only impacts our physical and mental health, but also has an economic cost in terms of increased health care expenses, lost productivity due to days out of work and school and recovery costs due to a rising number of natural disasters.

The next phase of CCHE aims to strengthen a unified movement for climate justice and health equity by advancing community-driven solutions and supporting national movement building through a network of community-based organizations, health institutions, public health departments and health practitioners.

With an expanded focus on Kresge’s priority cities – Detroit, Fresno, Memphis and New Orleans – the current initiative also seeks to elevate cultural and creative strategies as key tools in advancing community-driven solutions.

“The human health impacts of climate change are profound, and while climate change affects us all, it hits some communities harder than others. The pollution that creates dangerous heat waves and severe storms causes the most harm in communities already experiencing persistent health inequities, like lack of access to safe housing and quality health care, as well as chronic illnesses and respiratory disease, said Shamar Bibbins, Kresge Environment Program managing director. “Equitable solutions must be driven by the communities most affected, and doing so in partnership with trusted health practitioners and institutions can amplify local innovations and build broader momentum for change.”

“Long-term change in cities requires strong and sustained cross-sector partnerships. Working together, we ensure that all of us, no matter who we are or where we live, have the opportunity to be healthy and to thrive. Climate action is fundamentally a public health imperative—offering transformative opportunities to reduce mental health burdens, chronic diseases, and infectious disease spread while advancing health equity for all,” said Monica Valdes Lupi, Kresge Health Program managing director.

Mark Kirby, a two-time Cedarville University graduate, is pioneering affordable innovations that could reshape how the shipping industry measures and manages its environmental impact. As a product engineer for Louisiana Cat, a regional dealer for Caterpillar Inc., Kirby is helping clients reduce emissions without overhauling their operations or budgets.

Kirby earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in 2003 and completed an MBA in innovation and entrepreneurship in 2023 — both from Cedarville. At Louisiana Cat, he helps meet customer needs with Caterpillar’s industrial equipment, including construction and marine machinery.

When the International Maritime Organization announced its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or around 2050, the pressure on shipping companies intensified. With vessels typically lasting about 20 years, emissions reductions must be incorporated into ships being designed today.

“Companies have to be very careful with what they choose to do right now,” said Kirby.

Traditionally, emissions are tracked using onboard sensors retrofitted to vessels. However, those systems can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and provide readings for only a few polluting gases.

Kirby’s prior work in sustainability reporting helped him identify a better approach. “I found that companies didn’t really need hyper accuracy — they needed a number that was reproducible,” he said.

By leveraging Caterpillar’s existing fuel consumption data and accepted regulatory models, Kirby developed a system that calculates emissions for more than 20 polluting gases — at a fraction of the cost of traditional sensors. While the method doesn’t reduce emissions directly, it provides companies with a benchmark for improvement.

“You have to know where you are to plan on where you’re going. From there, you look at what tweaks you can make to your operations.”

- Mark Kirby

“You have to know where you are to plan on where you’re going,” said Kirby. “From there, you look at what tweaks you can make to your operations.”

But Kirby’s contributions don’t stop at emissions tracking. He’s also helping marine transport companies overcome horsepower-based emissions regulations that limit how many barges a vessel can push. Higher engine power requires more emissions control equipment, increasing both costs and the physical space needed on board.

Using hybrid propulsion technology, Kirby found a way to add power to a vessel’s propeller without increasing emissions-related costs. “The hybrid solution adds a motor and a power intake on the gear box to add power to the propeller without adding power to the engine and requiring additional emissions equipment,” explained Kirby.

Kirby credits Cedarville University for preparing him to solve real-world problems. “Mechanical engineering gave me the foundation — the understanding of physics,” said Kirby. “The innovation and entrepreneurship degree helped me understand and anticipate the needs of my customers.”

That program also emphasized value innovation — designing solutions that shed expensive features while increasing effectiveness. In Kirby’s work, that meant eliminating costly emissions equipment and using smarter, data-driven alternatives. Looking ahead, Kirby sees a wave of changes coming to the energy and logistics sectors.

“Realistically, there’s going to be a traditional means for storing energy, but I think that there will be a lot of efficiencies gained through the new technologies,” said Kirby. “I think that a lot of traditional technologies will be replaced.”

But Kirby’s motivation isn’t just to create or sell products.

“The most important thing is to realize it’s not about me. What I do is about other people, meeting their needs and solving their problems. That’s what’s most important.”

In his letter, Krishnamoorthi warned that the PRC’s dominance in critical minerals, manufacturing, and agriculture has created “economic chokepoints” that could be weaponized to coerce the United States. He urged the Administration to adopt a coordinated federal strategy to identify and mitigate such vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

“The PRC’s dominance in the production and processing of critical minerals is a prime example of how economic dependence can quickly evolve into strategic leverage,” Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi writes in the letter. “The PRC currently controls roughly 70 percent of global rare earth mining and more than 90 percent of the world’s magnet manufacturing capacity, granting Beijing considerable influence over the supply chains underpinning advanced manufacturing, clean energy technologies, and national defense.”

The letter requests that the National Economic Council provide Congress with details on any ongoing efforts to assess and “de-risk” U.S. dependencies on Chinese-controlled supply chains. It also calls for greater transparency and public reporting on how the Administration is working to safeguard critical sectors, including pharmaceuticals, industrial machinery, and clean energy technologies.

Furthermore, the letter asks whether the National Economic Council is coordinating with the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Treasury, and the U.S. Trade Representative to conduct a comprehensive mapping of supply chain vulnerabilities, and requests updates on contingency measures, scenario planning, and international cooperation aimed at reinforcing resilient supply chains.

“Absent decisive action, the United States will continue to learn about CCP chokepoints only after they have been weaponized against us,” Krishnamoorthi writes. “As our strategic competition deepens, we cannot afford to remain reactive. A forward-leaning national strategy, one that identifies and mitigates chokepoints before they are exploited, is essential to preserving America’s economic sovereignty and industrial security.”

Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world’s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities’ energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.

But when AI’s computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.

Experts say that if uses like these continue to grow, they could help offset the energy consumed by AI.

“I am pretty optimistic that while more and more AI use is going to continue to increase,” said Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia University Climate School, “we’re going to see our ability to process be much more efficient and as a result, the energy consumption won’t go up as much as some are predicting.”

Building efficiency: Maintenance, cooling

AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.

Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers’ arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker’s instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it’s not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.

For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.

AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.

Combined, these automations can reduce a building’s energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.

“That’s literally a super low-hanging fruit,” said Zoltan Nagy, professor of building services at Eindhoven University of Technology.

Finding energy- and cost-efficient times for EV charging

AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.

This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it’s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.

“Let’s say it’s a peak period when everybody’s got their air conditioning on, and I walk in my house and I plug in my car and I have it set up such that my car doesn’t start charging right away because it’s peak period time,” Abramson said.

In California, a pilot program shifted charging to times where there was more renewable energy available, and saved customers money.

AI can also help optimize how homeowners with solar panels store excess energy in batteries.

Reducing methane flaring from oil and gas operations

Boston-based Geminus AI uses deep learning and advanced reasoning to help oil and gas companies reduce methane flaring and venting, and reduce the amount of energy they use in extracting and refining.

Reducing methane emissions is among the fastest pathways to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about 30% of today’s global warming.

When pressure in oil and gas pipes builds up, some of the gas is released and burned to relieve the pressure, harming the planet and wasting money.

Geminus CEO Greg Fallon said they can monitor the network of wells and pipes and use AI-driven simulations to suggest changes to compressor and pump settings that eliminate the need for venting and flaring. Geminus does this in seconds. Traditionally it takes engineers about 36 hours to run simulations that make similar recommendations, Fallon added.

“As we scale this across the industry, there’s a massive opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Fallon said.

Finding geothermal hot spots

Salt Lake City-based geothermal energy startup Zanskar has built AI models to understand the Earth’s subsurface. It’s using that modeling to find overlooked geothermal hot spots and target drilling.

Geothermal creates electricity cleanly by making steam from the Earth’s natural heat and using it to spin a turbine. It’s one renewable energy the Trump administration favors.

Zanskar co-founders Carl Hoiland and Joel Edwards say they simulate and assess a huge number of possible subsurface scenarios to estimate where there are pockets of very hot water. From this, they pick optimal locations and drilling directions.

“AI is becoming the solution to its own energy problem,” Hoiland, the CEO, said. “It’s showing us a way to unlock resources that weren’t possible without it.”

Last year, Zanskar purchased an underperforming geothermal power plant in New Mexico. Their AI modeling successfully indicated there was an untapped geothermal reservoir that could repower the facility.

Next, Hoiland and Edwards focused on another site in Nevada, despite industry experts telling them it was too cold to support a utility-scale power plant. They drilled and announced their second geothermal discovery in September at that site.

Reducing traffic emissions

Google is using artificial intelligence and Google Maps data to identify traffic light adjustments that can reduce stop-and-go traffic to lower pollution. Passenger cars and small trucks account for about 16% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency data.

Launched in 2023, Project Green Light is now in 20 cities on four continents. The most recent is Boston, which has notoriously bad traffic.

Each city gets AI-generated recommendations. City engineers determine which to implement. Google says Project Green Light can reduce stop-and-go traffic by up to 30%, which cuts emissions by 10% and improves air quality.

“We’re just scratching the surface of what AI can do,” said Juliet Rothenberg, Google’s product director of Earth and resilience AI.

With the framework of the COP30 Action Agenda guiding the process, clean energy tops the list as the first of six thematic axes, setting the course for implementation. The call is clear: the global community must triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 to stay within reach of the Paris goals.

Denmark stands ready to support this ambition.

A long-standing commitment to clean energy

Denmark’s commitment to clean energy dates back to the oil crisis of the 1970s. Since then, the country has built a robust clean energy sector based on close collaboration between policymakers, industry leaders, academia and civil society. This public-private partnership model has enabled Denmark to consistently push the boundaries of innovation – from pioneering onshore wind turbines to deploying the world’s first offshore wind farm in 1991.

Today, wind remains the backbone of Denmark’s green power supply, supported by solar, bioenergy and emerging technologies such as Power-to-X. In 2024, 64 percent of Denmark’s electricity consumption was covered by wind and solar power.

Scaling up solutions – from wind to Power-to-X

While wind power remains a cornerstone, Denmark’s clean energy leadership goes beyond wind. In 2025, Denmark opened the world’s first large-scale e-methanol facility in Kassø. This Power-to-X project produces e-methanol using only renewable electricity and biogenic CO₂ – providing a fossil-free alternative for the shipping industry and other hard-to-abate sectors.

This development is the latest in a series of clean energy milestones driven by Danish innovation. From solar and bioenergy to green fuels and sector coupling, Denmark’s experience shows that a just and efficient energy transition is possible – and already happening.",https://stateofgreen.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/COP30-Clean-energy-web-header-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 12:09:56.269101

Dr Adam Read MBE, Chair of CIWM’s Skills for the Future Expert Group, said the Clean Energy Jobs Plan will offer the sector ‘spun-off benefits’ but also seems like a ‘missed opportunity’.

“The Clean Energy Jobs Plan effectively ignores the ‘circularity’ part of the green economy and the waste and recycling sector’s role as enablers for that circularity,” Adam Read said.

“The recent Skills Strategy launched by Energy and Utility Skills, and endorsed by CIWM, clearly identifies the growth potential of the resources and waste sector.”

“There remain clear opportunities for Skills England and government to incentivise and enable skills development, including apprenticeship reform, in our sector.”

The Energy Secretary announced plans to double the number of people employed in clean industries to 860,000 by 2030, through tailored training schemes for former fossil fuel workers, young people, the unemployed, veterans, and ex-offenders.

The plan identifies 31 priority occupations, such as plumbers, electricians, and welders, as those that will be in particularly high demand. However, jobs in the resource and waste sector have not been included on the priority list.

Among the plans is funding for five new clean energy Technical Excellence Colleges to train the next generation of workers. The government has also committed to investing £2.5 million in skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire.

Katie Cockburn, Senior Director of Policy & Education at CIWM, said CIWM welcomes the Clean Energy Jobs Plan and its ambition to support critical skills development.

“Although our sector is not designated as a ‘priority’ under the Jobs Plan, our members know their vital role and that we’ll continue to contribute to the UK’s ambitions for clean energy, carbon reduction and a circular economy.”

“The resources and waste sector already makes a strong contribution to clean energy generation, with good renewable power being generated from green waste and biogenic waste at anaerobic digestion and energy recovery facilities across the UK.”

As the UK transitions to a resource-efficient and zero-waste economy, Cockburn said there are ‘clear opportunities’ for the resources and waste sector’s contribution to clean energy to grow, and for ‘thousands of new and upskilled jobs to deliver on this’.

The government’s plans were broadly backed by trade unions, including Unite and GMB.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham welcomed the Energy Secretary’s announcement as ‘initial steps’, saying: “Well-paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition.”

Commenting on the plan, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.”

FOFA, the Fix Our Forests Act, Contains Provisions Applauded by the Federation of American Scientists

Washington, D.C. – October 22, 2025 – Yesterday, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry favorably reported the Fix Our Forests Act (S. 1462) out of Committee. This important milestone means that the bill can now be considered for final passage by the full chamber. FAS applauds the strong bipartisan effort behind this bill under the leadership of Senators Curtis (R-UT), Hickenlooper (D-CO), Sheehy (R-MT), Padilla (D-CA), and many important champions in Congress.

The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) is a non-partisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to the use of science in the public interest. Our wildfire program aims to build a more fire-resilient nation through policy development and analysis, capacity building, and issue education.

“FAS is very pleased to see the Fix Our Forests Act, S. 1426, advance out of Committee. We urge the Senate to act quickly to pass this legislation and to ensure that federal agencies have the capacity and resourcing they need to carry out its provisions,” says Hannah Safford, Associate Director of Climate and Environment at FAS.

FAS has been a strong champion of the Fix Our Forests Act and endorsed S. 1462 in April 2025. “Science tells us that the wildfire crisis is becoming more and more urgent. FAS has been working to ensure that this bill includes essential, evidence-based reforms to protect people, property, and ecosystems. FAS particularly supports Sec. 102, which would create the Wildfire Intelligence Center- a decision support hub that would further our core priority of improving the use of science, data, and technology for wildfire resilience” said Jessica Blackband, Senior Manager the Federation of American Scientists.

For more details on why FAS supports the bill, including 10 key provisions, view our policy statement here. In January 2025, the House of Representatives passed the Fix our Forests Act with bipartisan support by a vote of 279-141. The legislation was introduced by House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Congressman Scott Peters (D-CA).

FAS is proud to be part of a broad, bipartisan coalition that supports the Fix Our Forests Act and looks forward to continuing to work with partners and decisionmakers to support a comprehensive and effective federal wildfire ecosystem.

It’s official: just months after adopting a new scientific integrity policy, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has quietly erased that policy from the agency’s website. This is a historic collapse that will have serious consequences for scientists and researchers in years to come.

The removal of the 2025 policy comes at a time of serious turmoil for American science, which now faces serious funding cuts, mass firings, and growing censorship of scientific expertise. The loss of the policy—which had been updated in January of this year—is no less critical. Its removal not only eliminates important protections for scientists today, but risks exposing science to severe political interference in the future. This reversal could not have happened at a worse time, with the Trump administration actively rolling back scientific protections, and aiming to redefine how science is done.

The updated 2025 EPA policy presented more than just a simple update on the Obama-era 2012 policy. Building on the 2023 Federal Framework for Scientific Integrity Policy and Practice, the 2025 policy included:

A standardized federal definition of scientific integrity

Provisions to explicitly protect scientists’ ability to communicate their work publicly

A thorough process for EPA staff to submit differing scientific opinions

A reaffirmation of the role of science and evidence to inform government policy outcomes

The 2025 policy was carefully developed over many years of soliciting input and feedback, including an interagency working group, public feedback, and consultation with Tribal governments, EPA staff, and other stakeholders—an example of public engagement that is becoming far less frequent under the Trump administration.

Earlier in May, President Trump issued an executive order calling for a complete rebranding of science, using the terms “transparency” and “peer review” to present a positive framing while installing political appointees to oversee scientific integrity. The subsequent new guidelines created by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) have since laid the groundwork for how federal agencies can rescind previous scientific integrity policies adopted after January 19, 2021—clearly a politically motivated attempt at reversing Biden-era protections. These new guidelines have raised serious red flags: there is no mention of the role of science in informing federal policy, how science will maintain its independence, or who will hold political interference to account, and there are no directives to protect federal scientists from censorship or retaliation.

Ultimately, the EPA’s removal of its 2025 policy is more than just compliance with President Trump’s “Gold Standard” executive order. It is a strong signal of complicity with the Trump administration’s attempts to broadly roll back scientific integrity protections. This is bad news for an agency whose credibility hangs on protecting science from political interference.

Why this matters

At Evidence for Democracy, we recently completed our latest review of scientific integrity in the United States, which revealed a number of concerning trends.

1. Protections for scientists are being eliminated

Recent policy announcements, especially the “Gold Standard” executive order, have rapidly accelerated the erosion of legal and institutional protections for federal scientists. By installing and empowering political appointees across agencies, the Trump administration has made it easier to override peer-reviewed research, initiate mass layoffs, and eliminate whistleblower protections. For example, under Section 7 of the “Gold Standard” executive order, political appointees now have the power to determine when scientific findings should be “corrected,” seriously undermining the original intention of scientific integrity policies to safeguard science from political interference. The EPA’s 2025 update contained careful provisions to explicitly address issues including the unreasonable delay of scientific information, while also strengthening guardrails against political interference. Falling back on old policies now reopens the possibility of significant interference in science at the EPA.

2. Transparency is eroding

Transparency in American scientific practice has also shown a steep decline. The “Gold Standard” executive order’s use of certain key words, such as “reproducibility,” effectively functions as a tool to exclude research studies for lacking perfect transparency or to disqualify politically inconvenient fields such as climate science. The administration’s removal of public datasets and federal databases, especially those relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion, public health, and environmental fields of study, has created new barriers to public scrutiny and accessibility to findings. The elimination of the 2025 policy’s clearly codified rights for scientists to engage with the press and the American public now make it easier for the Trump administration to place tighter control over scientists’ communications. Overall, we found the overall score for Transparency to be a D- grade, as nominal transparency frameworks have now been weaponized by the administration as tools of suppression, rather than supporting public accountability or scientific transparency.

3. Uncertain transparency and accountability processes

For many years, federal scientific accountability systems have been structured around clear misconduct definitions, strong frameworks, clear reporting policies, and agency-level enforcement. Over the past year, these systems have been fundamentally undermined by severe political interference. Under the “Gold Standard” executive order, political appointees are now empowered to reclassify politically inconvenient research as “misconduct,” decide what qualifies as a violation of scientific integrity, and decide what level of enforcement, if any, a federal agency should have. Nine agencies and departments have since launched implementation plans to either rescind or change their scientific integrity policies, including the NIH and EPA. The loss of the EPA’s 2025 policy, which contained strong reporting procedures and dedicated roles for investigating violations, now raises serious concerns about how the complaint process will be handled, further reducing both transparency and accountability within the agency. These rollbacks – combined with weakened internal oversight, and suppressed public records of scientific corrections and retractions – now suggest that scientific integrity violations are now much less likely to be addressed and recorded across federal bodies. Our assessment found these systems score a D grade in Accountability, reflecting how quickly enforcement and oversight for scientific integrity has fallen to political interference.

4. Symbolic and structural loss

The combined impact of these measures is a substantial symbolic and structural loss for scientific integrity in the United States. High-profile attacks on science, suppression of politically inconvenient research findings, and termination of billions of dollars in research funding show that integrity frameworks are not only being severely weakened, they are being completely remodeled to align science directly with political priorities. Our review found that the U.S. earns a C- grade for Commitment, given the narrow centralization of authority through politically-appointed officials and attempts to rebrand science as ideology, signalling an intentional and deliberate erosion of scientists’ independence and their role in informing government decision-making.

What we can do

Scientific integrity now faces an existential threat in America. Concerted efforts by the Trump administration to eliminate scientific expertise, suppress evidence, and undermine critical scientific integrity protections not only undermines the work of thousands of scientists, but risks compromising the independence and mission of science altogether.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Copy-of-Blog-Lead-Image-Template211.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 10:19:11.918952

Their infrastructure also frequently crosses public lands, subjecting them to oversight by multiple federal agencies and the permitting delays that result.
As FERC considers potential wildfire mitigation standards, Lange said such standards must be workable for electric co-ops, including maintaining an “opt-in” approach that gives co-ops flexibility on their mitigation plans.
That opt-in model has been included in many Western states’ legislation to set wildfire mitigation standards, often in exchange for caps on state-level wildfire liabilities.
“Any sort of wildfire mitigation requirements at the federal level should be optional and flexible,” Lange concluded.","The federal government must speed up and streamline permitting of wildfire mitigation projects and make sure any requirements to reduce wildfire risk are flexible and cost-effective for electric cooperatives, a co-op leader told federal energy regulators Tuesday.

South Texas Electric Cooperative General Manager Clif Lange testified on behalf of NRECA at a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission technical conference on cutting wildfire risk for the bulk power sector.

Electric co-ops, which often serve rural and remote areas, are particularly vulnerable to the threat of wildfires, Lange explained. Their infrastructure also frequently crosses public lands, subjecting them to oversight by multiple federal agencies and the permitting delays that result.

As not-for-profit entities, any increases in regulatory compliance or operations costs tied to wildfires are passed directly to consumer-members through increased electricity rates, Lange said.

“The vast physical scope of electric cooperative systems across the American landscape means that we are perhaps the most vulnerable of all types of electric utilities to the existential threat of wildfire,” he said in his prepared remarks. “Our unique business model means that we also are the most susceptible to rate increases and financial distress that wildfires can cause.”

Although co-ops work hard to safeguard their systems and invest in infrastructure upgrades, cumbersome permitting requirements and inconsistent land management policies between regions and agencies have slowed co-op efforts to combat wildfires, the co-op leader said.

“My colleagues out West especially have waited months or even years to obtain permission from federal land management agencies to remove even a single hazardous tree or to replace a wooden pole with a metal pole or to underground a line,” Lange told FERC members.

To address these challenges, he called on the federal government to expedite, simplify and streamline utility wildfire mitigation permitting processes and improve consistency among agencies and regions. The government must also improve land and forest health to reduce wildfire risk in places where co-ops operate.

Some of these issues could be addressed by legislation that NRECA is backing in Congress to make it easier for co-ops to strengthen their systems against wildfires and remove trees and brush that fuel blazes.

As FERC considers potential wildfire mitigation standards, Lange said such standards must be workable for electric co-ops, including maintaining an “opt-in” approach that gives co-ops flexibility on their mitigation plans.

That opt-in model has been included in many Western states’ legislation to set wildfire mitigation standards, often in exchange for caps on state-level wildfire liabilities.

“Any sort of wildfire mitigation requirements at the federal level should be optional and flexible,” Lange concluded. “Such requirements also should be cost-effective, particularly given the impact that increases in regulatory compliance costs, technologies, and wildfire mitigation projects have on electricity rates for rural Americans.”

Many oil and gas companies call the city their home, including ConocoPhillips (COP +0.79%), which has its corporate headquarters in the Texas metropolis.

The global oil and gas giant has a very bright future, fueled in part by its operations in the Lone Star State. That's why it's one of my top picks among energy stocks.

Drilling deep in the heart of Texas

ConocoPhillips has built one of the deepest, most durable, and diverse portfolios in the oil and gas sector through a series of acquisitions, including its $22.5 billion acquistion of Marathon, which closed late last year. It now holds a treasure trove of oil and gas resources with supply costs below $40 a barrel. That gives the oil company decades of inventory to maintain and grow its production base.

Its leading position in Texas is crucial to its current operations and future growth. ConocoPhillips owns 792,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin side of the Permian Basin in west Texas and southeast New Mexico, making it the largest Tier 1 inventory holder in that region -- land with the highest estimated recoverable oil per drillable foot. It also ranks as the leading Tier 1 acreage holder in the Eagle Ford Shale in southern Texas with 484,000 net acres. Meanwhile, in the Midland portion of the Permian in central Texas, it holds 265,000 net acres, ranking it as the No. 3 Tier 1 acreage holder there. ConocoPhillips holds more top-tier inventory than any other producer in the lower 48 states, when adding in its Bakken acreage in North Dakota. These assets will drive continued production and free-cash-flow growth in the coming years, aided by the expected $1 billion of additional cost savings from its Marathon deal that it anticipates capturing by the end of next year.

Another notable growth driver for the company is its 30% interest in Phase 1 of Port Arthur LNG. The company and its partner Sempra Energy are building the 13.5 million-ton-per-day liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Port Arthur, Texas, which should come online in 2027. ConocoPhillips also recently agreed to purchase additional LNG from the upcoming Phase 2 of the project. This LNG export terminal will enable ConocoPhillips to sell more of the natural gas it produces in Texas to higher priced global markets.

Texas is only part of the growth story

While Texas is a big part of ConocoPhillips' portfolio and growth story, it's not the only region fueling the company's bright future. The energy giant is expanding its global LNG business to capitalize on growing demand for the cleaner-burning fuel. Energy market forecasters expect demand for LNG to double by 2040, growing from 400 million tons per year to as much as 800 million tons over the next 15 years.

In addition to Port Arthur LNG, ConocoPhillips is also investing in two LNG projects in Qatar. The North Field East and North Field South expansions should start coming online next year. The company has also signed several deals to sell LNG to customers in Asia and Europe. Its investments in LNG will provide it with $2 billion of incremental annual free cash flow in the coming years once all three new projects are operational.

Meanwhile, the company is also investing heavily in Alaska. The biggest project is its Willow hub, which will allow it to tap into a 600 million-barrel resource of low-cost oil supply. The company expects the $7 billion project will come online in 2029. This new hub could generate over $4 billion in annual free cash flow starting that year.

The coming free-cash-flow gusher

ConocoPhillips' Texas-heavy operations currently generate about $7 billion in free cash flow. That number could double by 2029 as its investments to grow its global LNG business and new oil hub in Alaska come online. That robust growth profile makes it one of my top picks in the energy sector.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/838372/sprawling-houston-texas-skyline.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 11:25:00.451060

You can also watch his presentation to the Jefferson Educational Society on YouTube, entitled ""Working Towards a Binational Great Lakes Waterfront Trail.""
""Wouldn't it be great if the eight states could create the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail as one of the celebration points of our birthday?""","Dr. Jack Hartig lives and breathes the beauty, serenity, and majesty of the Great Lakes.

He also researches, teaches, writes books, and blogs about the science and ecology of the Great Lakes. He is a champion for strong stewardship of the Great Lakes, the largest freshwater system in the world.

Currently a visiting scholar at the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research in Windsor, Ontario, he's also working with the Midwestern Office of the Council of State Governments, the National Park Service, and Pennsylvania officials on an ambitious yet feasible plan to create the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail in the United States.

The U.S. trail will link to an existing trail, more than 3,600 kilometers long, in Canada. In the eight Great Lakes states, the aim is to increase tourism, boost local economies and promote cross-border travel and common cause with our northern neighbors.

Picture the joys of walking, hiking, or bicycling on these trails, to explore lakes and tributaries, support local coffee shops, restaurants, and bike liveries, visit open-air markets, soak up history and heritage, and strike up conversations with others who treasure the Great Lakes, including members of First Nations.

""That kind of thing is big business,"" Hartig said in a recent phone interview.

Just as importantly, linking the two Great Lakes trails is a tangible way to build support to protect the Great Lakes ecosystem.

""What a great opportunity to connect people to the Great Lakes,"" said Hartig. ""In general, most of society has lost their connection to nature, and that holds true for the Great Lakes,"" he said.

""If you don't have any personal relationship with it, you don't have a sense of stewardship with it.""

Erie County's shoreline is integral to the trail. That's why five students from the University of Michigan's School for Environment and Sustainability, who are studying environmental policy and landscape architecture, are working to engage local people to identify, map, and build the Erie links.

About 28 percent of the work on Erie's shoreline – approximately 68 miles – has been completed. ""So, we have some work to do,"" Hartig said.

""It's really important at the early stages to raise awareness and build excitement,"" said Hartig, who gave an Aug. 5 talk at the Jefferson Educational Society, ""Working Towards a Binational Great Lakes Waterfront Trail.""

Hartig is familiar with Erie. He has lectured at the JES previously and is leading a project with the International Association for Great Lakes Research to discover what has been learned and achieved by restoring Areas of Concern. That would include Presque Isle Bay, which the federal government designated as an Area of Concern in 1991 and delisted in 2013.

Born in Vancouver, Washington, Hartig's family moved to Michigan when he was a kid. ""My family loved the outdoors. We grew up in a suburb of Detroit, 10 minutes [away], and we would go down and have picnics at Belle Island on the Detroit River. We would fish along the shoreline; we couldn't afford a boat.""

He recalled that in the 1960s, the Detroit River was so polluted that the rocks on shore were coated with oil. ""I would ask my dad, 'Why are we allowing this to go on?'""

Hartig pointed out that on Oct. 9, 1969, the Rouge River, which empties into the Detroit River, caught fire. For many Erie residents, a similar galvanizing incident about the horrors of water pollution had already occurred, when the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire on June 22, 1969.

Hartig learned early on that bodies of water need not be despoiled like those two rivers when his family ventured beyond the Detroit area for adventures at other rivers and smaller lakes in the Great Lakes region. ""We would hike, fish, swim, and canoe,"" he said. ""They were all beautiful, high-quality rivers and lakes, and the contrast between the Detroit River and Rouge River was night and day. I couldn't understand that. It didn't make sense to me.""

Majoring in biology and chemistry at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti as an undergrad, Hartig went on to earn his master's in aquatic biology at Eastern Michigan in 1977. He received his Ph.D. in limnology (the study of bodies of freshwater) from the University of Windsor in Ontario in 1985.

Concentrating on aquatic biology and then limnology was a no-brainer. ""I already had the bug. Not only did I want to learn about these lakes and the ecology and the limnology, I wanted to make a difference and get involved in the cleanup and stewardship.""

His honors and accolades include being named a Fulbright Scholar at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Waterloo, Ontario.

This graphic shows the outline of the proposed Great Lakes Waterfront Trail in the U.S.

The partnerships to develop the Erie County portion of the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail include the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Pennsylvania Coastal Resources Management Program, and the Erie County Department of Planning and Community Development.

Christine Sit, a master's degree candidate at the University of Michigan studying environmental planning and policy, said she and the other four student team members could choose among many topics for their capstone graduation project. They decided to work on the Erie portion of the Great Lakes Trail.

""What drew us all to this project was our collective interest in ecological/environmental design and the importance of multi-use trails to their local communities,"" she said in an email. ""Our studies in landscape architecture and environmental policy and planning and our varying experiences from fine art, ecological research, to real estate, have really come together to shape our work.""

When their project is completed by April 2026, they will have developed ""a starting point, tools and resources for other Great Lake communities as they work on further developing their trail designs,"" she said.

How realistic is the full development of the trail in this era of tight budgets and polarized politics? Hartig is optimistic. The Indiana portion of the trail, the 60-mile Marquette Greenway, has been completed. Work in Illinois is done, too. Pennsylvania and Minnesota have been mapped, and Wisconsin, Ohio, and New York are started. Michigan will be done last.

""Maybe the light bulb will go on,"" Hartig said. ""Trails and outdoor conservation is non-partisan. People love it. People love to vacation on and near water. They want to make memories there with their families,"" he said.

Hartig talked about success stories, including the expected opening this fall or in early 2026 of the new Gordie Howe International Bridge connecting Detroit and Windsor. ""We lobbied for six years to get a pedestrian and bicycle lane on it. We won that,"" he said.

He then sketched out potential itineraries for the completed trail. For example, start on a bicycle at Point Pelee National Park in Ontario, then take a ferry to Pelee Island in Lake Erie, then another ferry to Put-in-Bay. Move on to Toledo with its ""amazing greenways,"" then head north again to the Detroit Riverwalk.

A sweeping U.S.-EU trade and energy deal has linked tariffs, investment and energy security in a single political and economic package.

This report is part of a GIS series on the U.S.-EU trade deal.

In July, the United States and the European Union announced a trade deal that de-escalated growing tensions over tariffs and reinforced transatlantic economic ties. Under the deal, the U.S. agreed to reduce its proposed tariff on EU imports from 30 percent to 15 percent – a single, all-inclusive ceiling on nearly all EU exports currently subject to reciprocal tariffs. In return, the EU committed to significantly deepen its economic engagement with the U.S., including $600 billion in new investments by 2028, in addition to the more than $100 billion that European companies already invest in America every year. The EU will also lift major trade barriers, including eliminating all tariffs on U.S. industrial exports.

Energy emerged as a central pillar of the deal: The EU will notably expand its purchases of U.S. oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), nuclear fuel and related services, increasing annual imports from around $90-100 billion in 2024 to $250 billion annually over the next three years. This brings the total value of EU energy imports from the U.S. to a projected $750 billion by 2028 – the end of President Donald Trump’s current term in office.

Both sides have framed the agreement as a political and economic landmark. For Washington, it promises to generate tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue and reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Europe, allowing American businesses to increase their exports to the EU and expand business opportunities there. For Brussels, it offers stability and predictability, shielding European businesses and consumers from a full-blown trade war.

Energy lies at the core of the deal’s strategic purpose, reducing Europe’s dependence on “adversarial suppliers,” to quote the White House, and reinforcing energy security. The EU made that intention explicit, stating that the agreement will help replace Russian energy in European markets.

The agreement has not been universally welcomed. Critics have argued that the import targets are “unrealistic” and “delusional,” and that they exceed U.S. export capacity and clash with the EU’s declining gas demand and climate change agenda. Others caution that Europe may be replacing one dependency for another, shifting from overreliance on Russian energy to reliance on the U.S.

These concerns are legitimate. The long-term sustainability of the agreement remains uncertain, particularly if a future U.S. administration reverses course, as the Biden administration previously did by pausing new LNG export approvals. Nonetheless, overall, the deal provides a degree of certainty and stability that benefits both sides, even though its terms are not set in stone and the final outcome will be dictated by market trends.

For European consumers, it provides access to large energy supplies that are less prone to geopolitical coercion – a sharp contrast to past exposure to Russian energy. For American producers, it improves demand visibility, which is important to support long-term investment.

Most importantly, the deal sends a strategic message that goes well beyond the numbers. Transatlantic trade and energy policy are increasingly aligned in countering Russian influence and promoting supply diversification, and the U.S. has firmly positioned itself as Russia’s main energy rival in Europe.

U.S. impact on European gas trade

America has long been one of the EU’s most important economic partners; its top export destination and second-largest source of imports after China. The 2008 shale revolution transformed the U.S. from a major importer into one of the world’s leading oil and gas producers and exporters. This shift had far-reaching effects on global energy markets, particularly in Europe, even before U.S. LNG exports began.

Prior to the shale boom, the U.S. and EU competed for global gas supplies, but Europe relied heavily on Russian energy. As U.S. domestic production surged, its demand for imports declined. LNG cargoes originally destined for North America were diverted to Europe, increasing global supply and exerting downward pressure on gas prices.

This influx of spot-market LNG highlighted the price gap between flexible contracts and Europe’s oil-indexed, long-term agreements with Russia. European utilities bound by long-term Russian contracts faced higher costs as oil prices stayed elevated, prompting pressure on Gazprom to renegotiate terms. To defend its market share, Gazprom began offering more flexible pricing, including spot-linked sales. The episode marked a turning point in Europe’s gas pricing structure and further strained its energy relationship with Moscow. In 2021, Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized Europe’s shift away from long-term contracts in favor of the spot market, calling it a “mistake.”

By the time U.S. LNG exports began, the market had already felt the disruptive impact of the shale revolution. In 2022, the U.S. became the world’s top LNG exporter, overtaking Qatar and Australia – a position it is expected to maintain as new export capacity comes online by 2028. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, U.S. LNG quickly filled the gap left by Russian supply, driven by soaring prices.

Unforeseen increase in U.S. energy exports

Long before the Ukraine crisis, Washington had been laying the institutional and commercial foundations for deepening its energy ties with Europe. The July U.S.-EU trade deal amplifies a strategy that has been steadily evolving for nearly a decade.

A key turning point came in July 2018, when President Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker launched a new phase of U.S.-EU strategic energy cooperation. The goal was clear: to boost LNG imports from the U.S. to enhance Europe’s energy security and reduce its reliance on Russian gas. “They will be a massive buyer, and they will be able to diversify their energy supply. … The EU will build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas from the U.S. This is also a message for others,” President Trump said then. He also openly criticized Germany’s support for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, warning it would deepen Russia’s dominance over European gas markets.

At the time, U.S. LNG exports to the EU stood at just 4 billion cubic meters (bcm), with modest expectations that volumes would double to 8 bcm by 2022. What followed exceeded all projections: by 2022, LNG exports from America to the EU reached 55 bcm, or 72 bcm if the United Kingdom and Turkiye are included.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 accelerated the trend. The following month, then President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launched a Joint Task Force on Energy Security to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels. As part of the agreement, the U.S. pledged to “strive to ensure” at least 15 bcm of additional LNG deliveries to the EU in 2022, with further increases expected in subsequent years. In parallel, the commission committed to working with member states to ensure demand for up to 50 bcm per year of additional U.S. LNG through 2030, potentially pushing total U.S. LNG volumes to Europe above 120 bcm per year by the end of the decade.

These initiatives have been pivotal in supporting the EU’s ambition to eliminate Russian energy imports entirely by 2027.

Questionable numbers underlying targets

According to the European Commission, the projected $250 billion per year over the next three years reflects the estimated average value of EU energy imports from the U.S. The commission says the figure is based on robust assessments that considered several factors: current import volumes, expected increases in oil, gas, and nuclear fuel imports as part of the shift away from Russian energy, and major U.S. energy technology investments, services and exports to the EU – especially in the nuclear sector, including conventional and small modular reactors (SMRs).

Many have questioned the credibility of the figures. When viewed against current market prices, critics argue that meeting this target would require the EU to import up to 930 bcm of LNG, more than three times its total gas consumption in 2024, which stood just below 300 bcm. While the EU is an important market for gas, the import needs stem from a decline in domestic production, and not because demand is growing rapidly, as is the case in Asia. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europe’s natural gas market showed limited growth. EU gas demand had peaked in 2010 and by 2022 was 19 percent lower.

Meanwhile, remaining Russian gas imports (both pipeline gas and LNG) to the EU for this year are expected to average around 23 bcm. This does not create sufficient demand to absorb the additional planned imports from the U.S.

Observers have also questioned the reliability of the supply. The physical export capacity of the U.S. is currently around 117 million metric tons per year, equivalent to around 150 bcm of gas. While this may expand to 212 million tons per year (roughly 272 bcm) by 2028, that projection depends on the rapid completion of several projects that are still awaiting final investment decisions.

In short, the math does not add up, leading some analysts to conclude that the EU’s energy spending pledge is unlikely to materialize.

To complicate matters further, commercial, not political, decisions determine market needs. A mix of private and state-owned companies import gas in the EU. The European Commission can aggregate demand for LNG to negotiate better terms through its joint purchasing of gas initiative, which it established in 2022 to improve the EU’s purchase position vis-a-vis non-Russian pipeline gas and LNG imports. However, the commission cannot force companies to buy the fuel.

Then comes the question of sustaining demand for, and purchases of, fossil fuels while upholding the EU’s climate commitments. The European Environmental Bureau (EEB), the continent’s largest network of environmental NGOs, warns that the centerpiece of the deal is fundamentally incompatible with the EU’s 2030 climate targets. The EU has rejected the accusation, stating that it still aims to reach climate neutrality by 2050.

Import dependency concerns

The EU is likely to remain reliant on energy imports to meet a significant share of its domestic needs over the coming decade – a vulnerability with both economic and security implications, as highlighted by a study from the U.S. Federal Reserve. In that context, securing supplies from a trusted ally such as the U.S. can be seen as an important pillar of Europe’s energy security. That strategy has already proven effective: Although gas prices spiked in 2022, the crisis was relatively short-lived as LNG, particularly from the U.S., helped fill the gap.

U.S. oil production: A peak in sight

However, if the EU is to meet its spending commitments under the July trade deal with the U.S., it could risk undermining the very diversification efforts it has worked hard to achieve. Import dependency reached its highest level since 1990 in 2022. Since then, the EU has taken steps to lessen its reliance on external suppliers. In its energy security strategy, the commission states: “A key part of ensuring secure and affordable supplies of energy to Europeans involves diversifying supply routes. This includes identifying and building new routes that decrease the dependence of EU countries on a single supplier of natural gas and other energy resources.”

The current deal, however, risks making the EU overly reliant on a single supplier, even one as reliable as the U.S. Political dynamics can shift quickly. The same caution applies to the U.S. If it were to deliver the full volume of supplies committed under the deal, it would increase its exposure to the European market and its evolving policies, particularly those tied to climate change and decarbonization.

To address such concerns, the European Commission has proposed a dedicated framework – AggregateEU – to collect demand from EU buyers and match it with competitive U.S. LNG supplies for the period 2025 to 2050. The mechanism aims to balance strategic alignment with market flexibility, ensuring that energy cooperation remains resilient in the face of political and economic shifts.

Scenarios

The deal should be viewed in context rather than through headline figures alone. Many details are still unclear, and the $750 billion target by 2028 includes a mix of energy imports – not just LNG. Moreover, converting spending targets into actual volumes depends heavily on price assumptions, and market conditions could change significantly over the coming years.

As the European Commission has clarified, while indicative projections exist, the final breakdown between oil, LNG and nuclear fuel will be contingent on several variables, including commodity prices, exchange rates and investment decisions by private companies. Ultimately, outcomes will be shaped by commercial transactions, not political commitments.

Importantly, the deal is non-binding and imposes no legal obligations on either side. Even if the targets are not met, the current tariff framework will expire with President Trump’s term in 2028, leaving Washington without leverage to retaliate.

The July U.S.-EU trade deal is best viewed not as a rigid contract, but as a political signal – one that builds on more than a decade of increasingly intertwined energy and trade interests. While the numbers may raise eyebrows, the message is clear: the U.S. and Europe are strategically aligned in countering Russia’s influence, at least in energy trade. What happens next will hinge on both market fundamentals and political continuity.

Most likely: Strategic alignment holds

Despite doubts over the numbers, this scenario reflects what is already underway: U.S. LNG capacity is expanding, EU demand for reliable non-Russian energy remains and commercial relationships are driving long-term contracts. The deal amplifies a natural, market-supported shift already in motion. Even if targets fall short, all signs point to closer cooperation, reinforced by shared strategic goals and a decade of institutional groundwork.

Less likely: Political or market disruptions derail progress

In this less likely, but still plausible, scenario, political changes in the U.S. or accelerated EU decarbonization efforts undermine the deal. U.S. export policies could tighten, or European buyers may not follow through due to falling gas demand. Trust could erode, and the momentum built since 2018 may stall.",https://www.gisreportsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-2240276588-1140x758.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 08:58:25.824721

The company isn’t disclosing exactly how much it’s setting aside for the program, but said it expects the fund will “help thousands of drivers make the switch.”

The timing of the program could help spur EV demand in the year’s final quarter, when it’s expected to weaken after peaking in the third quarter as buyers rushed to get the federal rebate. Still, the new program seems less bullish than the $800 million push Uber announced in 2020, which was intended to help the ridehail platform operate with a zero-emission fleet by 2040. At the time, it also added the Uber Green option in the app to let customers book rides in an EV or hybrid.

Uber Electric rides are now booked only for EVs. To promote the service Uber is temporarily offering customers who opt to use it a 20% discount worth up to $8 per ride. The company said it currently has over 200,000 EVs on its platform globally and estimates that its drivers are adopting them at five times the rate of the general driving public in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Uber said its EV grant and TrueCar discount, worth $5,000 combined, can also be used with state-level incentive programs offered in California, Colorado and Massachusetts to cut thousands of additional dollars off the purchase price.

Investment and Partnership Expansion Successful partnerships like Pensana-VAC will likely catalyse additional investment and collaboration across the mine-to-magnet supply chain.","The mine-to-magnet supply chain represents a comprehensive industrial ecosystem that transforms raw rare earth minerals into finished permanent magnets essential for modern technology. This integrated process encompasses every stage from initial extraction through final manufacturing, creating a critical foundation for electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and advanced defence technologies.

Understanding this complete production cycle becomes increasingly important as Western nations recognise their vulnerability to supply disruptions. Recent partnership agreements, such as the collaboration between Pensana and Vacuumschmelze, demonstrate the urgent need to establish domestic capabilities that can support national security requirements and technological advancement.

Understanding the Complete Production Cycle

The mine-to-magnet framework involves multiple distinct phases that require specialised expertise and advanced equipment. Each stage demands precise quality control to produce high-performance neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) and samarium-cobalt magnets that power today's technological revolution.

Furthermore, the Pensana-VAC partnership exemplifies this integrated approach, connecting raw material extraction from the Longonjo project in Angola with advanced magnet manufacturing at the eVAC Magnetics facility in South Carolina. Their agreement targets production scaling from 2,000 tonnes per year initially to 12,000 tonnes annually by 2029, demonstrating the substantial capacity expansion required to meet growing demand.

Key production components include clean mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) as the critical intermediate product that bridges mining operations with final magnet manufacturing. Consequently, this material requires sophisticated processing to achieve the purity levels necessary for defence and commercial applications.

How Does Geopolitical Concentration Create Supply Chain Vulnerabilities?

Current global production remains heavily concentrated in China, creating significant strategic risks for nations dependent on these materials for critical infrastructure, defence systems, and clean energy transitions. However, the Trump critical minerals order and 2027 defence restrictions on rare-earth imports from China have established a hard deadline for developing alternative supply sources.

This concentration creates multiple vulnerabilities that extend beyond simple supply security. For instance, price manipulation, export restrictions, and quality control issues can severely impact industries dependent on high-performance magnets. The semiconductor shortage of recent years provides a stark reminder of how supply chain vulnerabilities can cascade through entire economic sectors.

China's Market Dominance and Strategic Implications

Chinese companies have invested decades building integrated facilities that combine mining operations with downstream processing capabilities. This vertical integration provides cost advantages and operational efficiency that competing nations struggle to match, particularly given the complex chemistry and substantial capital requirements involved in rare earth processing.

Moreover, the technical expertise accumulated over decades of industrial development creates barriers to entry that extend far beyond simple capital investment. Rare earth separation requires sophisticated solvent extraction techniques, precise temperature control, and multiple purification stages that demand specialised knowledge and equipment.

Western Response to Supply Chain Risks

The United States and allied nations have launched comprehensive initiatives to establish domestic mine-to-magnet capabilities. In addition, these efforts involve substantial government investment, private sector partnerships, and strategic procurement programmes designed to reduce foreign dependency.

Government support has proven essential for establishing competitive operations. The Trump Administration and the US International Development Finance Corporation have provided crucial backing for partnerships like the Pensana-VAC collaboration, recognising these materials as critical for national security applications, including establishing a critical minerals reserve.

What Are the Key Technical Challenges in Building Domestic Supply Chains?

Establishing mine-to-magnet operations requires overcoming significant technical and economic barriers that extend far beyond simple mineral extraction. The complex metallurgy involved in rare earth separation and magnet production demands specialised knowledge accumulated over decades of industrial development.

Chemical Processing Complexity

Rare earth elements occur together in mineral deposits and share similar chemical properties, making separation extremely challenging. Consequently, the process requires sophisticated separation techniques that must achieve exceptional purity levels for high-performance applications.

Temperature control, chemical reagent management, and multi-stage purification systems represent just the beginning of technical challenges. Furthermore, each rare earth element requires specific processing parameters, and maintaining consistent quality across different elements demands extensive process control capabilities.

Accelerated Development Timelines

The urgency of establishing domestic supply chains has compressed traditional development timelines. For instance, Pensana's Longonjo mine, originally scheduled for production in early 2027, is being evaluated for acceleration to late 2026 to meet critical defence deadlines.

This acceleration requires careful balance between speed and operational readiness. However, the mine is currently financed and under construction, providing a foundation for timeline compression that many greenfield projects cannot achieve.

Timeline Challenges:

Mining permit approvals: 3-5 years typically

Equipment procurement and installation: 2-3 years

Process optimisation and startup: 1-2 years

Workforce training and certification: 6-12 months

How Are Companies Establishing Integrated Supply Chains in North America?

Several strategic partnerships have emerged to create vertically integrated mine-to-magnet operations across North America, combining mining expertise with advanced manufacturing capabilities. These collaborations leverage government support programmes while addressing the technical challenges of rare earth processing.

The Pensana-VAC Strategic Alliance

The memorandum of understanding between Pensana and Vacuumschmelze represents a significant advancement in establishing Western supply chain independence. This partnership connects one of the world's largest undeveloped rare earth deposits with global leadership in permanent magnet manufacturing.

Furthermore, this collaboration aligns with broader industry innovation trends that emphasise vertical integration and strategic partnerships.

Partnership Specifications:

Component Details Initial Production 2,000 t/y rare earth magnets Target Capacity (2029) 12,000 t/y rare earth magnets Contract Duration Initial 5-year term with extensions Feedstock Clean mixed rare earth carbonate (MREC) Source Location Longonjo project, Angola Processing Facility eVAC Magnetics, Sumter, South Carolina

The agreement establishes strategic cooperation to strengthen the global rare earth value chain while exploring additional joint opportunities beyond the initial production targets. In addition, this approach creates flexibility for capacity expansion as market demand evolves.

Geographic Supply Diversification

The partnership demonstrates geographic diversification strategies that reduce concentration risk while leveraging comparative advantages. For example, Angola's mineral resources combine with American processing capabilities and German technical expertise to create a resilient supply network.

This geographic distribution provides multiple benefits:

Resource Security: Access to world-class mineral deposits

Processing Excellence: Advanced manufacturing capabilities

Market Access: Direct supply to defence and commercial customers

Political Stability: Reduced dependency on single-country sources

Expansion Planning and Resource Development

Pensana has committed to major exploration programmes designed to expand resource inventory beyond current reserves. This forward-looking approach targets growing demand from electric vehicles, automation systems, and emerging applications like humanoid robotics.

Consequently, the exploration strategy recognises that current reserves, while substantial, may prove insufficient for long-term demand projections. Electric vehicle adoption alone could require significant capacity expansion beyond currently planned levels.

What Role Does Government Policy Play in Supply Chain Development?

Government support has proven essential for establishing competitive mine-to-magnet operations, given the substantial capital requirements and long development timelines involved. Policy frameworks combine direct investment, purchase guarantees, and regulatory support to encourage private sector participation.

Strategic Investment and Partnership Programmes

The Trump Administration has prioritised domestic rare earth capabilities as a national security imperative, providing both financial support and regulatory facilitation for critical projects. Furthermore, this support extends beyond domestic operations to include trusted international partners like the Pensana-VAC collaboration.

The US International Development Finance Corporation has played a crucial role in enabling partnerships that enhance Western supply chain resilience. For instance, this support includes financing mechanisms that help bridge the gap between private sector capabilities and strategic national requirements, similar to Europe's critical raw materials facility.

The 2027 defence restrictions on rare-earth imports from China create guaranteed demand for domestic production capabilities. These procurement mandates provide revenue certainty that helps justify the substantial capital investments required for mine-to-magnet operations.

However, defence applications typically require higher-grade materials with stricter quality specifications than commercial markets. This creates premium pricing opportunities that can support the economics of domestic production despite higher initial costs compared to Chinese suppliers.

Regulatory Framework Development

Government agencies have worked to streamline permitting processes for critical mineral projects while maintaining environmental and safety standards. Consequently, this regulatory support proves essential for meeting compressed development timelines driven by strategic requirements.

Environmental review processes, mining permits, and facility approvals typically require years of preparation. Furthermore, expedited review processes for strategically important projects help balance national security needs with regulatory compliance requirements.

Which Technologies Drive Modern Magnet Manufacturing Excellence?

Advanced magnet production requires sophisticated technologies that precisely control material properties, dimensional accuracy, and magnetic performance. These manufacturing processes represent decades of accumulated expertise that new market entrants must develop or acquire through partnerships.

Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities

VAC's recently commissioned eVAC Magnetics facility in South Carolina represents state-of-the-art magnet manufacturing technology. The facility demonstrates how advanced equipment and process control systems enable production of high-performance permanent magnets that meet stringent defence and commercial specifications.

Moreover, modern NdFeB magnet production utilises sophisticated metallurgical processes that rapidly cool molten alloys to create optimal microstructures. This technology, combined with precision powder metallurgy techniques, enables production of magnets with exceptional magnetic properties and dimensional accuracy.

Quality Control and Performance Standards

Magnet manufacturing requires comprehensive quality control systems that monitor magnetic properties, dimensional accuracy, and material composition throughout production. These systems ensure consistent performance in demanding applications such as electric vehicle motors and military systems.

Critical Quality Parameters:

Magnetic flux density consistency

Coercivity measurements across temperature ranges

Dimensional tolerances for precision assembly

Corrosion resistance for harsh environments

Temperature stability for extreme operating conditions

Process Innovation and Efficiency

Manufacturing excellence extends beyond basic production to include process optimisation, waste minimisation, and energy efficiency improvements. These factors become increasingly important as production scales to meet growing demand while maintaining cost competitiveness.

In addition, advanced automation and process control systems enable consistent production quality while reducing labour requirements and improving safety outcomes. These technological advantages prove essential for competing with established international producers through data-driven operations.

How Do Environmental Considerations Impact Supply Chain Development?

Modern mine-to-magnet operations must address environmental concerns that extend throughout the production cycle, from responsible mining practices to waste management and recycling programmes. These considerations increasingly influence investment decisions and regulatory approval processes.

Sustainable Mining Practices

Contemporary rare earth mining operations implement advanced environmental management systems that minimise water usage, control dust emissions, and prevent groundwater contamination. Furthermore, these practices require additional investment but are essential for obtaining operating permits in developed nations.

The Longonjo project has incorporated environmental considerations into its development planning, recognising that sustainable practices provide long-term operational advantages and community acceptance. However, modern mining techniques can significantly reduce environmental impact compared to historical operations.

Waste Management and Processing Efficiency

Rare earth processing generates various waste streams that require careful management to prevent environmental contamination. Consequently, advanced processing techniques focus on minimising waste generation while maximising material recovery efficiency.

Closed-loop water systems, chemical recovery processes, and waste treatment facilities represent standard components of modern rare earth operations. These systems add to initial capital costs but provide long-term operational benefits and regulatory compliance.

Magnet Recycling and Circular Economy

Permanent magnet recycling represents an emerging opportunity to reduce primary mining requirements while capturing value from end-of-life products. Advanced recycling technologies can recover rare earth elements from used magnets, creating secondary supply sources that complement primary production.

Recycling technologies could potentially supply significant portions of rare earth demand within the next decade, reducing pressure on primary mining operations while improving overall supply chain sustainability.

Recycling programmes require sophisticated collection networks, dismantling procedures, and reprocessing capabilities. Furthermore, as electric vehicle adoption accelerates, the volume of magnets available for recycling will increase substantially, creating new supply chain opportunities.

What Market Applications Drive Mine-to-Magnet Demand Growth?

The rapid expansion of electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and advanced manufacturing creates unprecedented demand for high-performance permanent magnets. Understanding these market drivers helps explain the urgency behind establishing secure supply chains and the broader mine to magnet supply chain development.

Electric vehicles represent the fastest-growing application for rare earth permanent magnets, with each vehicle requiring multiple kilograms of high-performance magnetic materials. Consequently, traction motors, power steering systems, and auxiliary components all depend on permanent magnet technology.

The automotive industry's transition to electrification creates predictable, long-term demand that supports investment in domestic supply chain capabilities. Major automakers have committed to electric vehicle production targets that require substantial magnet supply increases over the next decade.

Automation and Robotics Applications

Industrial automation systems, precision robotics, and emerging humanoid robot applications create additional demand growth beyond traditional markets. These applications often require specialised magnet configurations with exceptional performance characteristics.

For instance, Pensana's exploration programme specifically targets demand from automation and humanoid robot applications, recognising these emerging markets as significant growth drivers. Advanced manufacturing systems rely heavily on precise servo motors that utilise rare earth magnets for positioning and control applications.

Renewable Energy Infrastructure

Wind turbine generators, particularly offshore installations, utilise permanent magnet technology for improved efficiency and reliability. Large wind turbines require substantial quantities of rare earth magnets, creating concentrated demand from renewable energy projects.

Furthermore, the global transition to renewable energy creates sustained demand growth that aligns with national energy security objectives. Domestic magnet production supports both clean energy goals and strategic material independence, as highlighted by initiatives to establish mine to magnet supply chains in the US.

How Do Companies Manage Supply Chain Risk and Resilience?

Establishing resilient mine-to-magnet supply chains requires comprehensive risk management strategies that address operational, financial, and geopolitical uncertainties. Companies are implementing diverse approaches to ensure supply security while maintaining cost competitiveness.

Strategic Partnership Structures

The Pensana-VAC partnership demonstrates how strategic alliances can distribute risk while combining complementary capabilities. The five-year initial term with extension options provides flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions while ensuring supply continuity.

However, contract structures include pricing mechanisms that balance cost predictability with market responsiveness. These arrangements help manage commodity price volatility while ensuring sustainable economics for both mining and manufacturing operations.

Operational Risk Mitigation

Mine-to-magnet operations face multiple operational risks including equipment failures, process disruptions, and quality control challenges. Consequently, successful operations implement comprehensive risk management systems that address these potential disruptions.

Risk Mitigation Strategies:

Redundant equipment systems for critical processes

Multiple supplier relationships for key consumables

Comprehensive insurance coverage for operational disruptions

Emergency response procedures for environmental incidents

Quality control systems with multiple verification points

Financial Risk Management

Long development timelines and substantial capital requirements create significant financial risks that require careful management. Furthermore, government support programmes help bridge financing gaps while private investment provides operational flexibility.

The Longonjo mine's financed status demonstrates successful risk management that enables project advancement despite challenging market conditions. This financial foundation provides stability for the broader partnership with VAC.

What Does the Future Hold for Mine-to-Magnet Supply Chains?

The next decade will likely see significant expansion of Western mine-to-magnet capabilities as government support programmes mature and private investment accelerates. However, achieving supply chain independence will require sustained commitment and continued technological advancement.

Production Capacity Scaling

The Pensana-VAC partnership's scaling from 2,000 to 12,000 tonnes annually by 2029 represents substantial capacity growth that could significantly impact Western supply security. This expansion requires successful execution of mining, processing, and manufacturing components simultaneously.

Furthermore, additional partnerships and projects will likely emerge as market demand grows and government support programmes expand. The success of early initiatives like Pensana-VAC will influence future investment decisions and policy support.

Technology Innovation Opportunities

Ongoing research focuses on developing alternative magnet technologies that maintain performance characteristics while reducing rare earth content requirements. These innovations could potentially reshape supply chain requirements and reduce strategic material dependencies.

In addition, advanced recycling technologies, improved processing efficiency, and alternative material development represent key innovation areas that could enhance supply chain resilience. Investment in research and development proves essential for long-term competitiveness.

Market Demand Evolution

Future demand growth will likely exceed current projections as new applications emerge and existing markets expand. Humanoid robotics, advanced aerospace systems, and next-generation electric vehicles may require magnet capabilities that current projections underestimate.

Consequently, the strategic importance of rare earth magnets will likely increase as technology dependence grows across multiple sectors. Defence applications, clean energy systems, and advanced manufacturing all require continued access to high-performance magnetic materials.

Investment and Partnership Expansion

Successful partnerships like Pensana-VAC will likely catalyse additional investment and collaboration across the mine-to-magnet supply chain. Government support programmes provide frameworks for future partnerships that can build upon proven models.

Furthermore, international collaboration between trusted partners offers advantages over purely domestic approaches, combining resource access with technical expertise and market reach. These partnerships can achieve supply security while maintaining economic efficiency.

The mine-to-magnet supply chain represents one of the most critical industrial challenges of the 21st century, combining complex technical requirements with significant geopolitical implications. Success in establishing resilient domestic capabilities will determine technological competitiveness and national security for decades to come.

As partnerships like Pensana-VAC demonstrate early success, the foundation exists for broader supply chain transformation that can meet growing demand while ensuring strategic independence. However, the next few years will prove crucial for establishing the production capabilities required to support America's technological and defence requirements.

The collaboration addresses one of the most significant challenges in renewable energy construction: waste management.
By working with Woodchuck, Barton Malow is ensuring that these materials find a higher purpose in clean energy production.
“Turning wood waste from a solar construction site into clean, renewable energy is exactly the kind of circular solution our energy future demands,” said Brian Hartmann, president of NorthStar Clean Energy.
For Barton Malow, the effort underscores its commitment to helping clients meet sustainability goals while advancing renewable energy infrastructure.","Woodchuck, the AI-powered climate-tech startup redefining how construction and manufacturing industries handle wood waste, today announces that Barton Malow, a 101-year-old construction enterprise committed to delivering innovative, trust-based solutions, has partnered with Woodchuck to divert wood waste from the Hart Solar Farm project away from landfills and into clean energy production. Together, the companies are not only diverting thousands of tons of wood waste from landfills, but also saving valuable time and resources by streamlining the waste hauling process. The diverted material is processed and delivered to Genesee Power Station, a NorthStar Clean Energy project, where it is repurposed as biomass to generate renewable power.

The collaboration addresses one of the most significant challenges in renewable energy construction: waste management. Traditionally, pallets, cable spools, and miscellaneous wood supports would have been sent to landfills. By working with Woodchuck, Barton Malow is ensuring that these materials find a higher purpose in clean energy production.

“Partnering with Woodchuck gives our project teams a real opportunity to put waste diversion into practice on a large scale,” said Jill Katic, senior sustainability director at Barton Malow. “Not only does this help us reduce environmental impact, but it also provides quantifiable reporting we can use in our greenhouse gas inventories and annual sustainability reports. That level of accountability helps us deliver greater value to our clients.”

For Woodchuck, the partnership reflects its mission to eliminate construction waste from landfills and create renewable energy streams.

“Our work with Barton Malow at the Hart Solar Farm is proof that waste can be an asset,” said Todd Thomas, CEO of Woodchuck. “By coordinating hauling, shredding, and processing on-site, we make the logistics easier for builders while ensuring that every pallet and piece of wood debris is diverted into clean energy production instead of buried in a landfill.”

NorthStar Clean Energy, which utilizes the repurposed biomass, sees the project as a demonstration of how collaboration across industries can drive measurable sustainability outcomes.

“Turning wood waste from a solar construction site into clean, renewable energy is exactly the kind of circular solution our energy future demands,” said Brian Hartmann, president of NorthStar Clean Energy. “Working with Barton Malow and Woodchuck shows how innovative partnerships can scale sustainable practices while delivering reliable energy to Michigan communities.”

The Hart Solar Farm project, which spans more than four square miles, has already diverted nearly 500 tons of wood waste that was converted into 38M BTU, enough energy to power 16 Detroit homes for a month (or equal to 824 tons of CO2e, the equivalent of taking 180 cars off the road for a year). For Barton Malow, the effort underscores its commitment to helping clients meet sustainability goals while advancing renewable energy infrastructure.

Not only does this project support Woodchuck’s mission, but it also proves that the company’s model can be scaled dramatically to support large construction projects. Any construction company struggling to manage waste due to cost or lack of manpower can look to Woodchuck for a proven, scalable solution.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Woodchuck_Oct25_16476b7a8e.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 08:58:29.701724

These projects support water quality improvements, reduce soil erosion, and enhance long-term productivity and health of farmland in six Allegheny County municipalities.
“By building strong partnerships with state and federal agencies, we bring significant resources to Allegheny County that directly support farmers and protect natural resources,” Manzo stated in the release.

Allegheny County has 372 farms, 87% of which are small operations selling less than $250,000 annually.","The Allegheny County Conservation District has always helped family and urban farms in its work. A partnership with federal and state agencies has permitted it to increase the scale of what it can do.

With the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of Community and Economic Development, more than $1.4 million in infrastructure funding has been awarded to farms across Allegheny County from 2023 to 2025, according to a news release from the agency.

These projects support water quality improvements, reduce soil erosion, and enhance long-term productivity and health of farmland in six Allegheny County municipalities.

It’s called the Agricultural Conservation Assistance Program or ACAP, and through it the conservation district awarded $953,893 to seven farms located in Findlay, Plum, Fawn, West Deer, Forward and South Park Township. Additional funding of $539,055 was provided through NRCS’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program, DEP Growing Greener and through state Sen. Lindsey Williams’ support of the DCED Community Economic Assistance Program.

Pennsylvania created conservation districts, which date back to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s tenure to alleviate the disastrous effects of the Dust Bowl, through a 1945 law. These administrative commissions work under the departments of Environmental Protection and Agriculture in every county except Philadelphia. The goal: support local grassroots conservation efforts on a range of issues unique to each one.

Allegheny County’s district began its work in 1946, and it’s part of a national regulatory network. Its mission is to engage and lead through partnerships, innovation and implementation to conserve, promote and improve Allegheny County’s natural resources. It launched a strategic plan in 2021, its 75th year.

Executive Director Heather Manzo said the district has four regulatory programs related to state clean water laws, and its authority comes from the state. The focus is hyperlocal, and partnerships like this one help farms, both urban and rural, and grow its existing programs.

This infusion of money has a direct effect on water quality and soil health in addition to the farms’ viability, she said.

“By building strong partnerships with state and federal agencies, we bring significant resources to Allegheny County that directly support farmers and protect natural resources,” Manzo stated in the release. “These investments help farmers improve their land, reduce runoff to nearby waterways and strengthen their operations. ACCD bridges the gaps between agencies, making it easier for local farms to access the tools and infrastructure they need to succeed.”

The release listed the following farms as receiving funding from 2023 through summer 2025, with details on each one’s project:

Mamone Farm, Findlay

Merico and Victoria Mamone, both raised in farming families, run a beef cattle operation with their two daughters. Aging infrastructure on the farm presented an opportunity to redesign with a focus on conservation.

Morning Glory Farm, Plum

This fifth-generation family farm was preserved in 2024 under the Farmland Preservation Program, administered by ACCD. The Morrows farm beef, pork and chicken while also producing honey and birdseed. Updated infrastructure will protect animal health and safety by improving animal high-traffic areas.

Blackberry Meadows, Fawn

Blackberry Meadows Farm produces pork, eggs and vegetables while also serving ready-to-eat foods at local farmers markets. The farm was preserved in 2019 under the Farmland Preservation Program, administered by ACCD, and operates a Farm Club that encourages community members to get involved in local agriculture. Funded improvements have made operations more efficient while preventing erosion.

South Park Police Horse Barn, South Park Township

The Round Barn at South Park is home to the Allegheny County Police Department’s horses. Manure produced by horses is transported to Round Hill Demonstration Farm and used to fertilize fields. Because of the impacts on a nearby stream, this project focused on engineering solutions to prevent manure runoff into surface water.

Good Dog Farm, West Deer

Lindsay McKee and Brian Wiltrout produce chicken and duck eggs, fresh vegetables and cut flowers. They operate their small farm with the help of Ham and Cheese, the namesake “good dogs.” A combination of funding from ACAP and DCED will transform a site of severe erosion into useful growing space and substantial quality habitat for wildlife.

Two additional projects have been approved by ACCD’s board of directors and will be contracted after the Pennsylvania state budget is passed:

Solomon Farms, Findlay

Lee and Brittany Hartman raise beef cattle along with a few horses and poultry birds. With guidance from NRCS, they developed a grazing management plan to implement intensive grazing practices to restore land once impacted by strip mining.

Jersey Settlement Farm, Forward

The Pasini family raises beef cattle, sheep and pigs, selling directly to consumers and select local restaurants. Committed to protecting their farm’s natural resources, they have previously partnered with ACCD on stream improvement projects. Now, they plan to replace aging spring developments to prevent erosion and ensure the safety of their livestock.

Allegheny County has 372 farms, 87% of which are small operations selling less than $250,000 annually. The release noted, “the existence of and output from these farms are responsible for enhancing local food security for the region and providing meaningful economic support for adjacent business and industry.”

“Small farms are on the front lines of keeping our families fed by providing fresh, local produce for communities, schools and food banks. They also play an important role as stewards of our environment,” Williams, D-West View, said in the release. “Every Pennsylvanian has a constitutional right to pure water, and this funding will help small local farms like Blackberry Meadows and Good Dog Farm continue to feed our families, while prioritizing sustainability and protecting our waterways for generations to come.”

Manzo noted that the number of small farms has declined in the county. “We are losing family farms at twice the rate as the national average,” she said. “We are losing land and farms.”

But some progress has been made. “Some of our farms are first-generation. That is wonderful, too,” she said. “That is a giant undertaking. We have some success. We have some talented, dedicated smart folks who have created [them].”

The partnerships that enabled these grants have “been amazing” and enable a scale of work that would have taken a decade to do, Manzo said. “This huge money was a very critical infusion to help farms with their natural resource needs at the farm level. And it has ripple effects into the larger watersheds they are part of.”

Finding grants can be a long process, she added. These awards took time but “have been game changing for the farms in Allegheny County.”

Greg Boulos, whose family owns Blackberry Meadows Farm, agrees and said the grant enabled the farm to complete heavy-use area pavilions needed to protect high traffic areas. “We designed them to allow the animals to move out of the building in many different directions so they would not cause soil disruption around the pavilion,” he wrote in an email. “We just started using these pavilions this fall, and they are working great! Animals are finding shade without us setting up temporary shade structures. I’ve been changing their exits and entrances to reduce damage around the building, which is awesome for the environment.”

He said another part of the project included the installation of partial pasture fence to keep the animals from following their noses into local waterways and out of the back side of the farm’s pastures. “This project has saved 75% of the time needed to set up livestock containment as they move around the property, through pasture and forest,” he wrote.

The process was competitive, too. After the announcement about the grants, the district formed a reviewing committee and developed a rubric based on state guidelines to score the applications. They looked for interventions and projects that would have the most impactful environmental impact and permitted rolling applications during the two-year period.

She credits her staff for making this program a reality and far-reaching.

Manzo said all the money could have been spent on one big project but decided not to do that. “We wanted to lift all boats as the saying goes,” she explained. That meant making phone calls to state and federal programs to get additional dollars to fund as many as possible, and she also credited Williams for assistance here. “It’s another big nod to the staff,” Manzo said. “They were tenacious.”

Farms that did not win grants can apply again. That’s important because with farming, unless the owners have some degree of wealth, Manzo said the funded projects surpass anything most farmers would be able to afford.

“Family farms to do large capital improvements like this have to partner with organizations like the conservation district and its partners to provide this supplemental funding,” she said.

Boulos agreed with that statement. “ … Being able to use these funds to improve production and benefit nature is a win-win-win-win: for us, the taxpayers, the neighbors and everyone who loves our rivers and parks,” he wrote.

Getting these projects underway helps ease labor costs. Updated infrastructure – including something as low tech as spring bank fencing to keep pigs and other livestock away from the water – is just a good intervention, too. So is building cement pads and cover for animals and proper manure storage as all can help slow down or prevent soil erosion, just as Blackberry Meadows did. The latter gives farmers “the best land that they can grow food on.”

She agrees with Boulos on how wide the impact can be with these efforts. “The public benefit is there,” Manzo said. “These things help the farms with viability and provide food security. All these things are critical. These types of projects help the water quality far beyond the edge of the farm. They keep the cost of drinking water lower, helps aquatics.”

Her staff inspects the projects throughout the construction work. “Typically we have long-term relationships with these farms,” she said. “We see how [the projects] are happening and how they hold up. We will continue to support the farms and their future once this funding ends.”

How much more major funding will be available remains to be seen. The state budget impasse has held up two projects, but state departments also can fund programs with pass-throughs of federal money earmarked for agriculture and the environment.

For example, the district had embarked on an agriculture and soils program to prevent pollution through ACAP, and it had received $830,000 to award over three years.

Another effort is the Urban Grower Success Micro-Grant program made possible through the state receiving a USDA’s Farm Service Agency $860,000 grant over two years. It was working on these through a partnership to be more efficient, Manzo said, with the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council, Grow Pittsburgh, Hilltop Urban Farm, Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture and Chatham University. The target for these: urban farmers who hadn’t been in the system to access federal dollars.

But those are on hold right now. Manzo said the money has not been canceled but noted there has been some turbulence. “We’re hoping for a positive answer soon,” she said. “We just want to get this money into the farmers’ hands.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.unionprogress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Morning-Glory-Farm-family-presentation.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-22 10:19:16.826290

Here’s a fact advocates of the Green New Scam want you to forget: under Joe Biden's administration, electricity prices climbed a staggering 29.4%, outpacing overall inflation by about 50%. Families across the country felt the pinch as the cost of running a dishwasher or keeping the lights on became a budget-buster. This wasn't some natural market shift—it was the direct result of an aggressive push toward wind and solar mandates that shuttered reliable baseload power plants without adequate replacements. As The Wall Street Journal highlighted, cheap natural gas kept rates stable for years before Biden's green agenda kicked in, but now we're paying the price for policies that prioritized ideology over reality.

The evidence is overwhelming that green projects are not the solution for a stable grid. A recent analysis from Power The Future, drawing on over 500,000 federal electricity records, shows a clear pattern: states that aggressively retired fossil fuel generation in favor of intermittent renewables saw sharp price hikes. California lost 57 million MWh/year of fossil generation since 2010, driving prices up 8.3 cents per kWh. Massachusetts fared even worse, with a 74% drop in fossil output leading to a 6.4-cent increase. These aren't anomalies; they're the predictable outcome of replacing dispatchable power—sources that can ramp up on demand—with weather-dependent alternatives that require costly backups, storage, and transmission infrastructure.

And the crisis is only deepening. Electricity demand is poised to double by 2030, largely driven by AI workloads that could consume as much power as 40 million homes. Without firm, reliable generation, we'll see higher rates and economic fallout. Working families are already struggling—73% of Americans are concerned about rising energy bills, with 64% reporting higher costs than last year, according to national surveys. For a typical family of four, a 30% rate hike adds $600 annually just in utility bills, plus hundreds more in inflated prices for groceries, goods, and services.

This is why the Trump Administration is absolutely correct in declaring an energy emergency. We've seen decades of bad policy: renewable portfolio standards forcing coal phase-outs, carbon regulations, and state mandates in places like New York and Oregon that rushed plant closures without backups. Democrats like Elizabeth Warren cheered these moves, only to blame Trump when the bills came due. But finger-pointing won't keep the lights on. We need continued action to prioritize grid stability.

Congressman Balderson's bill does exactly that. It ensures policies are grounded in science, not ""Green New Deal"" rhetoric. Within 90 days of enactment, agencies must review and report on their actions, and within 180 days, update rules to align with these terms. This provides congressional oversight and protects reliable sources of power as vital to our energy mix.

America's energy future demands an approach that prioritizes affordability and reliability. Congressman Balderson's Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act is part of the roadmap to get there, lowering costs for families, bolstering our grid against surging demand, and securing our energy independence.

If we don’t continue to prioritize affordable and reliable energy today, we sow the seeds for the next price shock tomorrow.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/700124_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-10-22 11:25:21.997932

Mickelson and Company, a tax credit advisory firm, now highlights Indiana as one of the states with a railroad tax credit program on its website.
“All the states that have a history of this have shown significant improvements in rail infrastructure: safety derailment declines, grade crossing improvements.
Improvements The first railroad expenditure element of the legislation is a $3,500 tax credit per mile for existing rail infrastructure improvements up to $9.5 million each fiscal year.
And in preparation last year, I purchased an additional ten acres that I can now develop with this tax credit.","State tax credits for qualified rail expenditures on improvements and new infrastructure are expected to help short line railroads compete with other modes of freight transportation and spur economic development in rural Indiana.

House Enrolled Act 1461 allows short line railroads and businesses investing in rail maintenance, track expansion, and new projects in rural counties with populations under 300,000 to receive up to 50% in state tax credits.

Adam Robillard — general manager of Madison Railroad — is also chairman of Railroads of Indiana (ROI) and a staunch supporter of the legislation. He is raising awareness about the tax credits since lawmakers passed the law in April.

“We’re working by word of mouth, trying to get it out to all the economic development agencies and communities who can benefit and even educating the other small railroads who may not be as familiar or don’t have the resources to understand how this works,” he said.

Robillard believes the state tax credits will increase rail infrastructure safety while encouraging the growth of Class II and Class III railroads. Mickelson and Company, a tax credit advisory firm, now highlights Indiana as one of the states with a railroad tax credit program on its website.

“All the states that have a history of this have shown significant improvements in rail infrastructure: safety derailment declines, grade crossing improvements. There are so many benefits that have been proven over and over again,” Robillard said.

Joe Gioe — president and CEO of Indiana Rail Road — sees the law’s economic potential for small railroads evolving through the cultivation of customer relationships.

“The better our railroad is, the more our customers will have confidence in us because we’ll be reliable. Then, ultimately, they’ll want to do more business with us,” said Gioe.

Improvements

The first railroad expenditure element of the legislation is a $3,500 tax credit per mile for existing rail infrastructure improvements up to $9.5 million each fiscal year. Unlike other modes of freight transportation that benefit from taxpayer-funded infrastructure, Robillard pointed out that small railroads primarily pay to maintain their privately-owned tracks.

“Trying to direct some kind of support to these small businesses, nearly 50 of them in the state, small railroads, which for the most part are for-profit railroads, that receive no direct funding and are also a direct competitor with publicly subsidized interstate highways, airways and waterways,” he said.

The rail improvement tax credit will allow small railroads to reinvest money previously allocated for maintenance into growing their businesses, according to Robillard.

“It offsets the need even slightly from having to commit all of their resources to just a maintenance capital to a growth capital and developing business and working with customers and communities, economic development agencies, and such to invest in growth. And that’s something that our industry in this state has never been able to do properly,” he said.

Part of the law’s goal is to boost investment in rail, not only through the improvement tax credit, but also through private sources by emphasizing the importance of repairs and reconstruction.

“The real education part is going to come in on the maintenance side to ensure that all the route miles in the state that can take advantage of it are taking advantage of it. And that means making sure they’re planning their capital properly so they’re spending enough money,” said Robillard.

New infrastructure

Another component of the legislation is a tax credit of up to $500,000 per new track project, up to $5 million each fiscal year. Gioe said building new infrastructure that benefits customers will help small railroads be more competitive.

“In the state of Indiana, we compete with other modalities. The number one competitor is trucks. And that infrastructure is nearly 100% subsidized by the taxpayers of the state, by Hoosiers,” he said.

Robillard stressed many site selectors require rail-ready spots when locating businesses that are nearshoring, onshoring, or growing — and the motivation to invest in that type of infrastructure is something small railroads didn’t have before this law.

“And that [tax credit] can be utilized by any railroad in a rural community. So this levels the playing field for investment into these rural communities and not just in the urban areas of our state,” he said.

Since the federal 45G railroad tax credit only applies to maintenance, Gioe believes the new rail infrastructure incentive in Indiana’s legislation is an element that could create additional high-paying jobs for Hoosiers.

“Every time we get a tax credit, we reinvest or respend that money on something else. We’ve added 52 jobs on Indiana Rail Road in 2025. In Greene County, Vigo County, think of Linton, those types of areas,” said Gioe. “We’re fundamentally working towards long-term career value generation for people that benefits their kids and their kids. And that’s what we are the most excited about.”

Full steam ahead

Now that the railroad expenditures tax credits are law, Robillard is moving forward with endeavors that benefit Madison Railroad.

“We’re planning for next year to spend almost an additional half a million dollars because of this [tax credit]. That’s going to be in transloading capacity in the city. And in preparation last year, I purchased an additional ten acres that I can now develop with this tax credit. So it’s going to be huge for us and a few other small railroads who have projects coming to come into fruition,” he said.

Gioe is approaching customers with a new mechanism to invest capital into his railroad business, which he believes is the most important part of the legislation.

“I have to spend it to get it. It’s not a handout,” he said. “Terre Haute is one of those places where we see a ton of potential in our partnerships with Mayor [Brandon] Sakbun and his economic development council. We have purchased a significant amount of real estate in the city to leverage this tax credit in 2026, 2027, and beyond.”

Though the railroad tax credits don’t apply to Class I railroads and counties like Allen County with more than 300,000 people, New Haven Mayor Steve McMichael believes what’s good for small towns in northeast Indiana is good for the whole region.

“It is a great public-private agreement to be able to offset some of those infrastructure costs for sidings and additional industrial loads, which could be a shot in the arm to smaller counties in rural development along those short-line railroads and help them compete,” said McMichael.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/paintingprep3634-32-1024x7681761131230.jpeg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=c7wvIEH5,N,,2025-10-22 13:02:23.419152

Taxes add an average 76% to the costs of battery-based ESS, with batteries taxed more than conventional power generation equipment.","The adoption of energy storage technology such as lithium-ion batteries and pumped hydro could reduce the average cost of the Brazilian electricity system by up to 16% in 2029, in addition to contributing to reliability and enabling a greater share of renewables without increasing dependence on fossil-fuel thermoelectric plants.

Those estimates were included in the study “Accelerating the Brazilian Energy Transition: Comprehensive Energy Storage Meta-Analysis for Brazil,” which analyzes the role of energy storage systems (ESS) in the country’s energy transition. The report examines technical, economic, and regulatory measures that could enable the adoption of energy storage in the electricity sector at a time when solar and wind power generation are expanding.

The study states lithium-ion batteries and pumped hydro sites can solve operational problems in the Brazilian electricity system, especially loading ramps and the curtailment of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, in addition to providing ancillary services.

While batteries are more suitable for up-to-four-hour, short-term application – and can be deployed in modular fashion – pumped hydro offers long-term storage, can exploit Brazil’s topography, and draws on domestic hydroelectricity expertise.

Electricity mix transformation

Rising penetration of variable renewable energy sources, mainly wind and solar, is affecting the operational dynamics of Brazil’s National Interconnected System, which was structured around hydroelectric dominance.

Hydro’s share of the national generation mix has fallen from 65%, in 2014, to less than 48%. When micro- and mini-generation (MMGD) are factored in, hydro accounts for only 40% of the total. During that period, wind power rose from 2% to 16% – or 13.22% with MMGD – and solar from zero to 8% (rising to 24% with MMGD included).

Those structural changes in the generation mix necessitate the electricity system’s need to increase capacity, flexibility, reserves, and ancillary services. While demand is growing, generation – particularly from hydro and thermal power – faces operational constraints and raises environmental and economic concerns.

ESS offer a strategic solution, according to the report by consultants PSR.

“Energy storage is a key part of the Brazilian energy transition,” said PSR chief executive Luiz Barroso. “It contributes to reducing systemic costs by enabling a greater share of renewable sources in the electricity matrix but it needs regulatory and economic conditions that enable its expansion.”

More flexibility needed

With “non-dispatchable” solar generation fluctuating throughout the day – and suffering steep ramps at sunrise and sunset – a more flexible grid needs to rapidly ramp other power sources to maintain reliability and balance supply and demand.

PSR analyzed the flexibility requirements of the Brazilian grid under various 2029 scenarios. One-hour daily ramps would require 5 GW of grid flexibility by that date, according to PSR, rising to 16 GW in critical scenarios. Four-hour ramps would need an average 19 GW and a critical 47 GW and seven-hour ramps would need an average 30 GW, rising to 58 GW of critical flexibility.

The grid’s operation could be at risk without such rapid response capability, PSR warned, and ESS could play a vital role in providing it.

The report’s authors said 32 GW/128 GWh of batteries could reduce grid costs 13% by 2029, and 32 GW/3.2 TWh of pumped hydro could save 16%, based on the current generation fleet. The study found 32 GW of flexible gas-fired power plants would reduce equivalent grid costs 4.1%.

Revenue, tax, regulation

The consultancy’s report stated batteries are not economically viable in Brazil because of market conditions and taxation. Lack of regulatory frameworks is another barrier to deployment.

Electricity arbitrage – storing energy in ESS when prices are low to sell when they are high – does not generate sufficient revenue. That would require average daily price differences of $72 per megawatt-hour to $152/MWh for four hours daily over the 15-year life of a battery. Profitable pumped hydro arbitrage would require price differences of $65/MWh to $161/MWh for eight hours per day over 40 years. Brazil’s daily prices typically vary around $29/MWh.

For that reason, PSR stated, the capacity and ancillary services that could be provided by ESS need to be adequately remunerated and stackable.

Taxes add an average 76% to the costs of battery-based ESS, with batteries taxed more than conventional power generation equipment.

On the regulatory front, Brazil’s National Electric Energy Agency (Aneel) has been developing a roadmap which it expects to complete by 2027. Progress has been made but gaps remain concerning revenue allocation, capacity auctions, environmental permits, and clearer rules for the broad market integration of storage.

While acknowledging the first cycle of the Aneel roadmap will be an important stage, PSR’s report states further measures will be needed to enable ESS to compete in capacity auctions and be part of electricity sector planning.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Battery.jpeg,N,,2025-10-22 08:58:34.138417

Once erected, it has withstood meaningful efforts at reform, and atrophied. However much some existing laws helped address twentieth-century environmental problems, they are increasingly obsolete and ill-suited to today’s environmental challenges.

Steven Hayward is absolutely correct that “it is long past time for something new,” and properly identifies many of the key attributes upon which a “new environmentalism” could be built. The case for greater utilization of property rights and supplementing market incentives for environmental purposes, such as through prizes, is quite strong. Substantial challenges remain, however. The environmental policy establishment shows little sign of altering course, and, at present, right-of-center political leaders show little interest in a serious or substantive approach to environmental policy.

The birth of the modern environmental movement coincided with an explosion of federal environmental legislation. In less than a decade, Congress enacted a raft of statutes seeking to counteract the environmental consequences of industrialization and centralize control of environmental policy in Washington, DC. Yet, as Hayward suggests, the specific contours of the new regulatory regime were premised upon mistaken, and in some contexts quite harmful, assumptions. For many in the nascent political movement, an environmental crisis required a reconsideration of basic liberal ideals, such as the importance of individual liberty and a belief in progress. In reality, it would have been more productive to commit more fully to applying classical liberal principles to ecological concerns—but that was not the road taken.

The statutes enacted in the wake of the first Earth Day sought to limit and control those economic activities identified as the source of environmental harms, often through the imposition of various permitting requirements. The idea behind this approach was that existing market institutions, however efficient they may be as a general matter, fail to account adequately for the “external” consequences of economic activity. The failure to account for such “externalities” thus required governmental intervention, in the form of regulation or other measures, to correct for this “market failure.” The problem is that such “externalities” are everywhere, so this rationale for government intervention can justify control of just about all economic activity.

Under the rationale of controlling “externalities,” regulatory mandates proliferated to the point where, as the late Richard Stewart observed, “it amounts to nothing less than a massive effort at Soviet-style central planning of the economy to achieve environmental goals.” And much like Soviet-style central planning, this approach initially produced some gains, but ultimately began to falter underneath the weight of its own ambitions. Since then, little has changed. Regulations continue to proliferate, and there has been minimal effort to enact reforms. Indeed, most of the major federal environmental statutes have not been reauthorized or meaningfully revised in the twenty-first century.

This could have been avoided. In his influential 1968 essay, “The Tragedy of the Commons,” Garrett Hardin explained how most environmental problems could be understood as the natural and avoidable consequence of treating ecological resources as open-access commons. In such situations, there is no incentive to conserve or protect the underlying resource, as any benefits from such forbearance are dispersed among all users. On the other hand, each individual can capture the benefits of exploiting the resource for themselves. And as each individual responds to the incentives created by the underlying arrangement, “ruin is the destination toward which all men rush.”

Hardin noted that one way to prevent this tragedy is through “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon,” and that is the lesson most drew from his essay (in addition to a myopic and somewhat misanthropic fear of population growth). Too often overlooked was Hardin’s other prescription: property rights. The tragedy of the commons can be “averted by private property, or something formally like it,” Hardin noted, but few heeded this advice. Instead of seeking innovative ways to apply property principles to threatened resources, policymakers sought to bring ever more private activity under government control, and the environment was not much better for it.

Hardin’s lesson has been learned in some areas, even if there is a reluctance to expand on the lesson. Fisheries conservation, in particular, has benefitted from the proliferation of “catch shares” and other property-based reforms, coinciding with increased aquaculture production outside of the marine commons altogether. Western water rights have further shown that the recognition and protection of marketable rights in natural resources can foster conservation and encourage sustainable use, allowing users to fulfill economic demands while accommodating and accounting for ecological concerns. Taking a broader view, it is generally those resources most incorporated into market institutions through property rights and market exchange, protected by the rule of law, that are managed most sustainably.

Beyond conservation in the commons, the economic incentives created by property, prices, and the pursuit of profit have yielded what is simultaneously the most important and least remarked environmental trend of the twenty-first century: dematerialization. In advanced market economies, resource consumption has been decoupled from economic growth, such that material consumption is actually declining as countries continue to grow. This development has been driven not by regulatory mandates or restraints, so much as it is the product of market dynamics, entrepreneurial responses to economic constraints, and permissionless innovation. In the simplest of terms, where markets are most robust, Malthusian prognostications have been most often dispelled.

The architects of federal environmental law also erred in assuming that centralized leadership and direction of environmental policy in Washington, DC, was necessary, or even desirable. When the first federal environmental regulatory statutes were adopted, it was assumed that state and local governments could not be trusted to address local or regional environmental concerns. The prevailing narrative, that the failure of state and local governments and private efforts to prioritize environmental protection was leading to ever-worsening environmental conditions, was but a fable. The same groundswell of environmental concern that led to the enactment of federal environmental laws had already been working at the state and local level, and many key environmental indicators were already pointed in the right direction. Progress continued after the enactment of federal environmental laws, to be sure, but it is far from clear that federal intervention was the cause.

Particularly with the benefit of hindsight, the outlines of an alternative environmental agenda should be visible, one that recognizes property rights as the foundation of effective conservation, embraces the importance of local community input, and encourages technological innovation and market-driven efficiency improvements. Such an alternative is in line with classical liberal principles and would align with constitutional values far more than the sprawling regulatory edifice we currently have in place.

The problem is that few political leaders have been willing to embrace such an alternative vision of environmental progress. As Hayward recounts, the initial wave of environmental lawmaking was a bipartisan enterprise. Over time, Republican lawmakers grew disenchanted with the growth of centralized environmental regulation and the environmentalist movement’s near-unending appetite for further government constraints on productive economic activity. Yet few were willing to consider, let alone embrace, an alternative policy vision.

For most of the past thirty years, conservative political figures have had an easier time deciding what to oppose and what to support. Criticizing regulatory overreach and opposing the enactment of additional controls is relatively easy. Identifying alternative paths toward continued environmental progress has been far more difficult. Thus, the conventional Republican response to Democratic proposals has been to offer a similar agenda at a discount or to deny the need for reform altogether. Neither is particularly satisfying on policy or political grounds. There are real environmental problems and ample reasons to want change from the status quo. Denying the existence of environmental problems is mere avoidance, and it is neither inspiring nor effective to try and solve existing problems on the cheap.

In recent years, the political dynamic may have gotten even worse as tribal loyalties have subsumed policy development. To many, it has become enough to oppose whatever the other side wants, without regard for the merits. So if Democrats like renewable energy projects, Republicans must oppose them. Subsidies and regulatory barriers must thus be adjusted accordingly to align with each tribe’s preferred energy sources and industries.

A more principled approach would get the government out of the practice of picking winners and losers altogether, providing for a stable and predictable legal environment in which firms could invest in promising energy projects of whatever sort without having to navigate mountains of paperwork and rivers of red tape.

Despite the tremendous environmental progress of the past century, serious environmental challenges remain. Meeting such challenges in an effective and efficient way, without sacrificing other societal needs, will require turning away from the environmental paradigms of the past and embracing the sort of new environmental vision Hayward recommends. The real question is whether there are any political leaders willing to embrace such an environmental agenda and push for reform.

Mickelson and Company, a tax credit advisory firm, now highlights Indiana as one of the states with a railroad tax credit program on its website.
“All the states that have a history of this have shown significant improvements in rail infrastructure: safety derailment declines, grade crossing improvements.
“We’re planning for next year to spend almost an additional half a million dollars because of this [tax credit].
And in preparation last year, I purchased an additional ten acres that I can now develop with this tax credit.","State tax credits for qualified rail expenditures on improvements and new infrastructure are expected to help short line railroads compete with other modes of freight transportation and spur economic development in rural Indiana.

House Enrolled Act 1461 allows short line railroads and businesses investing in rail maintenance, track expansion, and new projects in rural counties with populations under 300,000 to receive up to 50% in state tax credits.

Adam Robillard — general manager of Madison Railroad — is also chairman of Railroads of Indiana (ROI) and a staunch supporter of the legislation. He is raising awareness about the tax credits since lawmakers passed the law in April.

“We’re working by word of mouth, trying to get it out to all the economic development agencies and communities who can benefit and even educating the other small railroads who may not be as familiar or don’t have the resources to understand how this works,” he said.

Robillard believes the state tax credits will increase rail infrastructure safety while encouraging the growth of Class II and Class III railroads. Mickelson and Company, a tax credit advisory firm, now highlights Indiana as one of the states with a railroad tax credit program on its website.

“All the states that have a history of this have shown significant improvements in rail infrastructure: safety derailment declines, grade crossing improvements. There are so many benefits that have been proven over and over again,” Robillard said.

Joe Gioe — president and CEO of Indiana Rail Road — sees the law’s economic potential for small railroads evolving through the cultivation of customer relationships.

“The better our railroad is, the more our customers will have confidence in us because we’ll be reliable. Then, ultimately, they’ll want to do more business with us,” said Gioe.

Improvements

The first railroad expenditure element of the legislation is a $3,500 tax credit per mile for existing rail infrastructure improvements up to $9.5 million each fiscal year. Unlike other modes of freight transportation that benefit from taxpayer-funded infrastructure, Robillard pointed out that small railroads primarily pay to maintain their privately-owned tracks.

“Trying to direct some kind of support to these small businesses, nearly 50 of them in the state, small railroads, which for the most part are for-profit railroads, that receive no direct funding and are also a direct competitor with publicly subsidized interstate highways, airways and waterways,” he said.

The rail improvement tax credit will allow small railroads to reinvest money previously allocated for maintenance into growing their businesses, according to Robillard.

“It offsets the need even slightly from having to commit all of their resources to just a maintenance capital to a growth capital and developing business and working with customers and communities, economic development agencies, and such to invest in growth. And that’s something that our industry in this state has never been able to do properly,” he said.

Part of the law’s goal is to boost investment in rail, not only through the improvement tax credit, but also through private sources by emphasizing the importance of repairs and reconstruction.

“The real education part is going to come in on the maintenance side to ensure that all the route miles in the state that can take advantage of it are taking advantage of it. And that means making sure they’re planning their capital properly so they’re spending enough money,” said Robillard.

New infrastructure

Another component of the legislation is a tax credit of up to $500,000 per new track project, up to $5 million each fiscal year. Gioe said building new infrastructure that benefits customers will help small railroads be more competitive.

“In the state of Indiana, we compete with other modalities. The number one competitor is trucks. And that infrastructure is nearly 100% subsidized by the taxpayers of the state, by Hoosiers,” he said.

Robillard stressed many site selectors require rail-ready spots when locating businesses that are nearshoring, onshoring, or growing — and the motivation to invest in that type of infrastructure is something small railroads didn’t have before this law.

“And that [tax credit] can be utilized by any railroad in a rural community. So this levels the playing field for investment into these rural communities and not just in the urban areas of our state,” he said.

Since the federal 45G railroad tax credit only applies to maintenance, Gioe believes the new rail infrastructure incentive in Indiana’s legislation is an element that could create additional high-paying jobs for Hoosiers.

“Every time we get a tax credit, we reinvest or respend that money on something else. We’ve added 52 jobs on Indiana Rail Road in 2025. In Greene County, Vigo County, think of Linton, those types of areas,” said Gioe. “We’re fundamentally working towards long-term career value generation for people that benefits their kids and their kids. And that’s what we are the most excited about.”

Full steam ahead

Now that the railroad expenditures tax credits are law, Robillard is moving forward with endeavors that benefit Madison Railroad.

“We’re planning for next year to spend almost an additional half a million dollars because of this [tax credit]. That’s going to be in transloading capacity in the city. And in preparation last year, I purchased an additional ten acres that I can now develop with this tax credit. So it’s going to be huge for us and a few other small railroads who have projects coming to come into fruition,” he said.

Gioe is approaching customers with a new mechanism to invest capital into his railroad business, which he believes is the most important part of the legislation.

“I have to spend it to get it. It’s not a handout,” he said. “Terre Haute is one of those places where we see a ton of potential in our partnerships with Mayor [Brandon] Sakbun and his economic development council. We have purchased a significant amount of real estate in the city to leverage this tax credit in 2026, 2027, and beyond.”

Though the railroad tax credits don’t apply to Class I railroads and counties like Allen County with more than 300,000 people, New Haven Mayor Steve McMichael believes what’s good for small towns in northeast Indiana is good for the whole region.

“It is a great public-private agreement to be able to offset some of those infrastructure costs for sidings and additional industrial loads, which could be a shot in the arm to smaller counties in rural development along those short-line railroads and help them compete,” said McMichael.

What lies ahead is the problem.

Analysts forecast that the company on Wednesday will report adjusted earnings of about $1.9 billion, driven by record sales of nearly 500,000 cars during the quarter. But that falls short of the $2.5 billion Tesla earned a year ago, a sign of the headwinds the company faces.

The company’s third quarter sales surged as Americans rushed to buy electric cars before a $7,500 federal tax credit expired on October 1. But American electric vehicle sales are widely expected to plunge in the fourth quarter because people who would have normally bought later in the year purchased early to lock in the tax break.

That credit loss could also affect EV demand among American buyers going forward. Tesla gets nearly half of its revenue from US customers.

The loss of a key source of income

But the removal of the EV tax credit is only part of Tesla’s problem. The Trump administration also eliminated what has been a key profit driver throughout the company’s history – the sale of regulatory credits.

In years past, the federal government set emissions limits on the total greenhouse gases that came out of all the cars a company sold in a given year. If a car company sold too many gas-guzzling pickups, as opposed to economical hatchbacks or cars with no emissions at all, it would have to buy “credits” from companies like Tesla.

Those sales have brought in $11 billion for Tesla since 2019, including $439 million in the second quarter of that year alone. Sometimes credit sales were the only thing keeping the company profitable at all – including in the first three months of this year.

But the Trump administration’s massive tax and spending bill passed by Congress in July eliminated the federal penalties for violating emissions rules, and thus the need for automakers to buy regulatory credits.

As a result, investors will be watching how much the company’s regulatory credit sales fell in the latest quarter as well as any guidance for how it will handle a future without them.

Tesla is also facing increased competition for EV sales globally, particularly from Chinese automakers. Those automakers not only dominate their own domestic market, but are also moving into Europe. Chinese automaker BYD is poised to overtake Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs this year, despite the fact that it does not sell any of its cars in the United States.

Tesla sales worldwide fell 13% during the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier both due to that increased competition as well as backlash to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s political activity.

But Musk has said the future of the company’s success doesn’t ride on car sales but on self-driving technology and robotics.

Tesla launched the company’s long-promised robotaxi offering with limited service in late June, with Musk promising much grander things to come. Investors and analysts will be listening closely to what he says about the state of those expansion plans during Wednesday’s earnings call.

Wednesday’s call will also be Musk’s first time talking to investors since the company unveiled a new proposed pay package for the CEO, which could award him stock worth $1 trillion. Shareholders are set to vote on that pay package at Tesla’s annual meeting next month.

The summit combined hands-on vehicle demonstrations with policy discussions and technical sessions highlighting real-world progress in alternative-fuel adoption. Attendees included representatives from Cleco, the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and national clean transportation organizations such as the North American Council for Freight Efficiency and Drive Clean Rural USA.

Port NOLA’s Sustainability Initiatives

Emily Federer, Director of Sustainable Development at the Port of New Orleans (Port NOLA), participated in a panel discussion on port sustainability initiatives moderated by Tom Haysley, Principal Planner, New Orleans Regional Planning Commission.

“I discussed our upcoming project under a Federal Highway Administration Grant (FHWA) – Reducing Truck Emissions at Port Facilities – to work with our terminal operators at New Orleans Terminal and Ports America to help them purchase lower emissions yard equipment, and to purchase equipment for our Harbor Police Department,” said Federer.

New Orleans Terminal and Ports America are two major leaseholders with Port NOLA. They both participate in the Green Marine certification program, which requires high-level environmental performance on standards relating to air emissions, aquatic ecosystems, underwater noise, waste management and spill prevention.

“I also talked about our recent registration of the LIT project with Envision,” said Federer. The $1.8 billion Louisiana International Terminal (LIT) project, designed to expand the state’s capacity to handle the world’s largest ships and strengthen global trade competitiveness, is now officially registered with the Envision Sustainable Infrastructure Framework. The designation marks the first Envision project registered in Louisiana and the first new container terminal registered in the United States, reflecting Port NOLA’s commitment to infrastructure that advances environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and long-term economic resilience.

“It might not sound like such a big challenge, but infrastructure we are planning to build today will be around for 50 to 100 or more years, and if you look at where our technology and infrastructure was 50 to 100 years in the past, there is a huge leap that no one could have imagined the technologies we are using today,” said Federer. “Self-driving technologies and fuel innovations have made some big leaps in the last 10 years. I imagine these types of transportation innovations will continue to accelerate.”

Federer said the port collaborates with the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA), Green Marine and the Blue Sky Maritime Coalition on innovations and the future of fuel.

“A major message for this type of work is that no one, no agency or business, can make these transitions alone. It takes an ecosystem and change of our status quo to make overarching transportation changes,” said Federer.

Federer said lasting progress in clean transportation will depend on strong policy support and collaboration across both public and private sectors. “I would also want to emphasize that these changes require support from our government in implementing policies and opportunities for public agencies, businesses and private individuals in lowering the bar for new technologies in transportation until we reach a tipping point where the low- and zero-emissions transportation technologies are equal- or lower-cost options for consumers,” she said.

2025 Clean Fuels Summit: Advancing Cleaner Fleets and Future Fuels

Because a significant feature of port operations involves land-based vehicles, cleaner trucking and fuel-diversification for land-based fleets emerged as a central focus of the summit. Discussions included progress updates on replacing conventional vehicles with more modern trucks that produce fewer emissions and expanding alternative-fuel infrastructure such as charging stations and propane or CNG pumps.

“I found the Keynote Speaker, Mike Roeth, Executive Director of the North American Council for Freight Efficiency, particularly enlightening regarding forecasts for medium- and heavy-duty trucking,” said Federer.

Federer said introducing clean technology results in significant maintenance cost reductions because electric motors have far fewer moving parts, as well as noticeable improvements in driver health. “Fully electric capabilities for short haul, local trucking is close to being available, and it would be great to see some pilot projects implemented in New Orleans,” said Federer.

Roeth also discussed fuel-efficiency and electrification trends in long-haul trucking, while Louisiana Clean Fuels Executive Director Ann Vail outlined statewide progress in clean transportation adoption.

“To further the heavy-duty discussion, Andre Champagne, CEO of Hollywood Trucks, talked about his journey into providing eco trucks and trailers for the movie industry that feature electric storage and rooftop solar for power generation,” said Federer.

Earlier sessions included LSU’s Dr. Greg Upton, who examined the economic challenges and opportunities of decarbonizing Louisiana’s energy sector, and a panel featuring experts from Chevron, LSU and the American Sugar Cane League discussing renewable fuels in agriculture and manufacturing. The conference also featured the “Road to Zero” Ride & Drive showcase, where attendees tested light-, medium- and heavy-duty clean vehicles and learned about state regulations for EV charging equipment.

Day two shifted toward national strategy, with sessions on electric transit, hydrogen workforce development, and the integration of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity in vehicle systems.

(Reuters) -Tesla is expected to post a surge in third-quarter results on Thursday, thanks to U.S. buyers rushing to take advantage of an expiring $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit.

But investors and analysts may be more focused on Chief Executive Elon Musk's outlook, including whether new, cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y Tesla can keep U.S. customers buying and attract new ones in Europe and Asia.

The new trims - called Standard - are $5,000 to $5,500 cheaper than their predecessors as Tesla shrunk the battery, switched to a less-powerful motor and stripped out a myriad of features - from rear touchscreens to seat-back pockets. The company also temporarily has slashed lease prices on the higher-priced Premium versions.

The cheaper Standard variants as well as Tesla's offers and discounts to stave off competition globally throughout the year have pressured the company's once-enviable margins, worrying investors.

Sales of Tesla's aging lineup declined for the first time last year and analysts expect an 8.5% fall this year, in part because of Musk's far-right political rhetoric.

ROBOTAXIS ROLLOUT UPDATE

Musk also will be expected to update on robotaxis, the project that he sees as the key to Tesla's next stage of growth. Musk has said Tesla's robotaxis will serve half the population of the U.S. by year-end.

""What are the relevant metrics - fleet size, cumulative miles, and territories - you expect in Q4 and 2026?"" was the top question for the CEO in a note by analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald on Tuesday.

While Musk has pivoted Tesla's focus to robotics and artificial intelligence and much of the company's $1.4 trillion valuation hangs on that bet, most of its current revenue and profit comes from vehicle sales.

Analysts expect Tesla to report a revenue of $26.24 billion in the quarter ended September, up 4.2% from a year earlier, according to data compiled by LSEG. Tesla also will report on whether regulatory credits that it sold to makers of gasoline-powered cars to satisfy pollution standards have faded away after policy changes by the Trump administration.

Automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, is estimated to be 15.6%, according to 19 analysts polled by Visible Alpha. That is lower than 17.05%, a year earlier.

Rutinel, amid his run for Congress, says his opinions on meat and dairy are more nuanced than his previous actions and statements would suggest.
“I think we need someone in Congress who will fight these reckless economic policies,” said Rutinel, who added that he consumes animal products.","A Democratic state representative running in Colorado’s highly competitive 8th Congressional District, which is one of the state’s ranching and agricultural centers, has a long history of raising questions about the production and consumption of meat and dairy products.

Manny Rutinel’s activism dates back to at least his days as an undergraduate student in Florida, where he posed shirtless on campus, draped in a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals banner, to illustrate the amount of water used in beef production measured in showers.

As a student at Yale Law School, he was quoted in a campus publication saying “animal agriculture is a horrific, exploitive industry.”

“Farmers are polluting a lot in animal agriculture, and if they switched to plant agriculture, they would emit much less while still producing great products,” he said, explaining a proposal he supported to use carbon-offset credits to pay farmers to transition from animal agriculture to plant agriculture.

And in the years before entering the state legislature, he founded an organization that signed onto letters encouraging a shift away from animal products, including by raising taxes on meat, dairy and eggs.

“The globe must dramatically shift away from animal products and toward fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts,” Rutinel told a legislative committee in Connecticut in 2021, citing a report on climate change.

Rutinel, who lives in Commerce City, now wants to represent the 8th District, which could be called Colorado’s agricultural capital. The district is home to some of the nation’s biggest meat and dairy producers, the kinds of corporations that Rutinel’s past advocacy appeared directed toward.

One of the district’s largest employers is JBS, the international meatpacking giant, whose U.S. headquarters are in Greeley. The district houses many cattle feedlots, including the Five Rivers operation in Kersey, which is one of the state’s largest. Ranches dot the landscape. Leprino Foods operates a major mozzarella plant in Greeley. Aurora Organic also has dairy operations in the district. Morning Fresh Farms cultivates eggs in Platteville.

Statewide, agriculture is a $47 billion industry that employs nearly 200,000 people. And Weld County, much of which is in the district, is considered the most agriculturally productive county in the state.

Ranching and agriculture played a role in the past two elections in the district, which were each decided by a few thousand votes and less than a percentage point. The district’s current representative, Republican U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, owns a small cattle herd and describes himself as a beef producer. The Democratic incumbent he beat in 2024 made the farm bill one of her biggest priorities.

The race next year in the 8th District will likely be just as close. And likely just as focused on ag, especially given the ongoing war of words between rural communities and Democratic leaders, like Gov. Jared Polis, over their livelihoods.

Rutinel, amid his run for Congress, says his opinions on meat and dairy are more nuanced than his previous actions and statements would suggest. He said he opposes the bad actors in those industries, not the industries as a whole.

“Like all industry, there are bad apples, and I’ve spoken out against those bad apples that cause extreme and unnecessary animal cruelty in parts of the food industry and against the environmental cost of unsustainable food practices,” he said. “I think that cruelty and environmental harm is concerning to many Coloradans, whether you’re a Republican, Democrat or independent.”

Agriculture accounted for about 11% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions, with livestock management representing 6% of statewide emissions alone, according to 2020 estimates from Polis’ administration. The energy sector, including transportation, oil and gas drilling, electricity generation, made up 84% of the state’s emissions.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector is part of Colorado’s climate mitigation plan to stave off the worst effects of climate change, like worsening wildfires and flooding.

In an interview this month, Rutinel called Colorado ranchers “the envy of the globe” and leaders in sustainability.

“They’re good stewards of the land, they care for their animals and they are the backbone of our economy and our communities,” he said. “Colorado ranchers are my friends and neighbors, and I’ve gotten to know them.”

“Maybe they should be a little scared”

When asked about his biggest concerns in meat and dairy production, Rutinel said he’s worried about caged, egg-producing hens. Colorado banned the sale of eggs from caged hens starting this year, a change in law that Rutinel says he supports.

As for ranching, Rutinel said he’s most concerned with deforestation abroad to make room for grazing. Deforestation releases carbon dioxide and reduces greenhouse gas absorption, which in turn accelerates climate change.

When asked for examples of other issues he has with the ranching industry, Rutinel said “nothing else is coming to mind at the moment.”

“Like I said, Colorado ranchers do great practices,” he said. “They graze appropriately. They use sustainable watering practices, source their feed from sustainable sources.”

In the past, however, Rutinel’s opposition to meat and dairy farming has appeared to go much further.

The Colorado Sun asked Rutinel to elaborate on some of his past comments on the topics.

He said he never worked with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, in any formal way and that his goal in posing in the group’s banner in college was to bring attention to “the environmental cost of various agricultural practices.”

As for the Yale Law School interview, Rutinel said he was only referring to the agricultural industry’s “bad apples.”

While at Yale, Rutinel also started a petition to get the fast-food chain Popeyes, famous for its fried chicken, to offer a plant-based protein option.

Rutinel said he doesn’t support increasing taxes on meat, dairy and eggs in order to persuade voters to buy other food products, despite signing the organization he led, Climate Refarm, onto a letter calling for just that.

“In coalition work, lots of ideas get circulated,” he said. “I don’t agree with every single sentence within those letters.”

Climate Refarm was a small operation that Rutinel cofounded and led as CEO. The organization’s goal was to help institutions like schools and hospitals reduce food-related emissions by shifting to plant-based meals. It has since dissolved.

“I will not support any new taxes on hardworking Coloradans,” Rutinel said.

As for his testimony before the Connecticut legislature, Rutinel said he wasn’t advocating against all meat production and consumption.

“I was advocating for a sustainable food system,” he said.

But for all of his explanations about his past comments and actions on meat and dairy, he’s also acknowledged why people who work in those industries may be worried about him.

“There’s a tweetstorm happening about me right now where somebody from the meat and oil industry — they’re all scared and they’re trying to warn everybody about what I’m about to do,” he said at the University of Denver in October 2023, a few days after he was appointed to a seat in the state legislature by a vacancy committee.

“Maybe they’re right,” he joked. “Maybe they should be a little scared.”

In fact, he told students at DU’s law school, the way animals are treated as part of agricultural processes was one of the reasons he decided to get involved in politics. And during the speech, he called a pair of 2024 Denver ballot measures that would have banned fur sales and slaughterhouses in the city “really awesome.”

Both initiatives were rejected by voters.

Rutinel sees eliminating tariffs as a way to help ag producers

Rutinel says if elected to Congress he does plan on taking up issues that affect farmers and ranchers, but in a context different from his previous advocacy.

He said he wants to do away with President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which he says are threatening the livelihood of ranchers and farmers.

“I think we need someone in Congress who will fight these reckless economic policies,” said Rutinel, who added that he consumes animal products. “I think we need someone who’s focused on lowering costs, and that’s been my focus since I got to the legislature.”

Rutinel also expressed interest in expanding Colorado’s law allowing farmers and ranchers to repair their equipment by requiring that manufacturers provide them with the tools and information to do so.

And if elected, Rutinel vowed to work with all employers and industries in the 8th District, including the meatpacking giant JBS, which is based in Brazil and has faced scrutiny for how it treats its workers and the environment.

“I want to work with all of them wherever possible to make sure their workers are safe and they’re producing products that are safe, healthy, sustainable and affordable,” he said.

The Democratic primary in the 8th District will be held in June.",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250822-20250822-legislature-special-session-hwv057.jpg?fit=1800%2C1200&quality=85&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-22 07:59:01.294167

These are common sense steps to balance the existing investment incentives with the corresponding rate burden on customers.

Joe also serves as the Legislative Director for Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, Inc., a trade organization comprised of over 20 of the state’s largest manufacturers.","Frustration over utility rates and concerns about the impact of new businesses locating in Indiana have driven discussions about Indiana’s energy policy to an unprecedented but justified level of intensity in recent months.

It is not hard to understand why. Access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to our daily lives. It is also critical to the state’s manufacturing and industrial sectors, which account for 26% of the state GDP, a larger share than any other state.

Though it is easy to understand why energy anxiety has hit new levels, it is a little harder to pinpoint exactly why. Suffice to say that economic incentives to support utility investment, the necessary process of retiring aging power plants and building replacement generation, inflationary pressures, changing customer demand, and a litany of other factors have all played a role in bringing us to this point. The interplay of these factors help explain why the process of creating balance between customers and utilities — which is the ultimate goal of the regulatory process — is difficult.

Unfortunately, while Indiana and some very dedicated policymakers and stakeholders have tried very hard to find the right balance between those pressures and their impact on customers, we haven’t gotten the mix quite right.

At this historic juncture, with a need to expand electric capacity on a scale the likes of which this country has not seen since the 1940s and ’50s, we now have two broad paths open to us. One is to keep doing what we have been doing. The other is to try new approaches to adjust the balance. Understanding the story of how we got here is important, not to lay blame, but to focus on the essential question: “Which path do choose?” If we want reliable and affordable power as well as economic prosperity and development, we cannot continue along our current trajectory.

But if we choose a different path, what does that look like?

One step is to establish better support for customer investment in the energy resources which serve them. Indiana already has customer generation and, in fact, industrial customers in Indiana generate hundreds of megawatts of their own power to support their operations. But more could be done to balance the rights of customers and the interests of utilities. Expanded options for ownership and operational models for customer generation, actively supporting voluntary partnerships between utilities and customers to develop generation, and removing geographic and economic constraints on generation are all positive steps that could expand private investment in energy resources and reduce the need for costly new utility construction at public expense.

We also need to re-evaluate the incentives currently provided to utilities. In the past, Indiana has encouraged infrastructure investment by providing financial incentives for cost recovery. But a sustained cycle of incentivized capital investment by utilities will continue to drive utility rates higher. Gov. Mike Braun has suggested we need to be more “attentive” to the investments utilities make.

One approach would be to revisit prior legislation to add stronger ratepayer protections. Utilities should be required to provide better justification for investments which receive automatic rate recovery; to demonstrate more than ordinary business risk before recovering cost overruns from customers; and adjust their profit margins to reflect the reduced risk arising from pre-approved investments. These are common sense steps to balance the existing investment incentives with the corresponding rate burden on customers.

Indiana has many advantages. Our location means we have the highways, the pipelines, the transmission facilities and other resources to propel ourselves forward. No single answer is the “right” one. It is clear that if we want different outcomes, we need to implement different approaches. Hopefully, we choose that path.

,Indiana Environment,2025-10-22 10:03:26+00:00,The Daily Campus,A statement of support to the Indiana Daily Student,The Editorial Board,,,,,https://dailycampus.com/2025/10/22/a-statement-of-support-to-the-indiana-daily-student/,"Last week, the Indiana Daily Student, Indiana University’s student run newspaper, was told by university officials to cease its printing production following its refusal to agree to administrative censorship.
Still, the school asked for specific extra “special editions” for significant campus events, which the IDS agreed to produce.
This content-based restriction would be antithetical to the role of a student newspaper as an independent voice of student speech, and generally the role of newspaper to report the news, so the IDS would not agree.
As such, we will add our voice to many other student publications who have called upon Indiana University to reverse this decision.
Furthermore, we encourage all the viewers, alumni and community members from Storrs to Bloomington to continue supporting local student media.","Last week, the Indiana Daily Student, Indiana University’s student run newspaper, was told by university officials to cease its printing production following its refusal to agree to administrative censorship. The university took issue with IDS continuing to report the news in certain “special editions” of the paper, which it hoped to see center around unifying campus events like Homecoming weekend. This print ban came alongside the firing of the student media director, who had refused administrative orders pressuring the newspaper to stop publishing news articles.

This mandated termination of printing comes after a series of events which created tensions between the newspaper and the university. In June, the university decided to deny the IDS a funding boost which students had voted to support, following a typical biannual review process. Instead, it cut their printing schedule to only every other week, down from their weekly schedule in the past academic year. Still, the school asked for specific extra “special editions” for significant campus events, which the IDS agreed to produce. However, the school wanted no news reported in these editions. This content-based restriction would be antithetical to the role of a student newspaper as an independent voice of student speech, and generally the role of newspaper to report the news, so the IDS would not agree. As such, the university fired the professional advisor of the newspaper and ended its entire print edition.

It claimed this was for budgetary reasons, citing past newspaper monetary losses. However, this point falls short given previously mentioned contentions where the university denied them extra funding students were willing to give. Additionally, as editors for IDS pointed out in a statement, cutting the print production against the will of the organization can only serve to worsen its economic situation. They ask how they are supposed to make deals with sponsors and donors when they cannot even ensure the proper independent operations of their own organization.

The Daily Campus Editorial Board condemns in the strongest terms this blatant university overreach and silencing of the free press. As student journalists at the University of Connecticut, we are deeply concerned that a fellow public university would take such a drastic step to prevent factual reporting of the news. This action goes against the most basic principles of our democracy and the values that our universities are supposed to stand for. It is entirely hypocritical that Indiana University would claim such “core values” of discovery and the search for truth, diversity of ideas, respect for the dignity of others and academic freedom, while simultaneously undermining them by censoring student press.

The role of student media on campus is not to serve institutional comfort or appease administration leadership, but rather to speak truth to power. It is to inform the people of what they have a right to know and help bring forth their voice when they face injustice. This often places student journalists against those in power, and a necessary part of their job is holding administration leadership accountable. These basic tenets are non-negotiable and only serve to strengthen our communities.

As such, we will add our voice to many other student publications who have called upon Indiana University to reverse this decision. We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the IDS and call upon other student publications to speak out on this issue as well. Attacks against the student press are sweeping the nation, from Stanford to Indiana to New York City, and each one, no matter how far, is a threat upon our freedoms as well.

Furthermore, we encourage all the viewers, alumni and community members from Storrs to Bloomington to continue supporting local student media. Your engagement, viewership and support is crucial to our continued ability to do this job, deliver the news and strengthen our communities across the country.",https://i0.wp.com/dailycampus.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-338.png?fit=520%2C720&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-22 07:59:18.201952

After President Donald Trump directed the Energy Department to end the Biden administration’s LNG export pause and resume the consideration of pending applications to export LNG to countries without an FTA, DOE has authorized more than 13.8 bcf/d of LNG exports.
Currently, U.S. exports are approximately 15 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of around 25% from 2024 levels.
However, the LNG bonanza is facing greater scrutiny after a recent court ruling in Louisiana, which axed a permit for another U.S. LNG export terminal due to climate change concerns.","Venture Global, an American producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) sourced from North American basins, has received the final seal of approval to export up to 3.96 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day of U.S. natural gas as liquefied natural gas (LNG) to non-free trade agreement (FTA) countries from its proposed multibillion-dollar export project in Louisiana, United States.

While confirming the final export authorization for Venture Global’s CP2 LNG, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) explained that the approval, signed by Chris Wright, U.S. Secretary of Energy, follows the conditional authorization in March 2025 and reflects the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s May 2025 decision approving the siting, construction, and operation of the facility.

This approval is said to incorporate the U.S. Department of Energy’s May 2025 response to comments on the 2024 LNG Export Study, which reaffirmed that U.S. LNG exports strengthen America’s energy leadership, expand opportunities for American workers, and provide its allies with secure access to reliable U.S. energy.

Kyle Haustveit, Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy, commented: “In less than ten months, President Trump’s administration is redefining what it means to unleash American energy by approving record new LNG exports.

“Finalizing the non-FTA authorization for CP2 LNG will enable secure and reliable American energy access for our allies and trading partners, while also providing well-paid jobs and economic opportunities at home.”

The launch of site works and the initiation of full mobilization at the development came after Venture Global took a final investment decision (FID) on July 28 and closed the project financing. Worley has been tasked with bringing this $28 billion LNG terminal to life.

Located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, the LNG terminal will be built at an approximately 1,150-acre site in Cameron Parish, with the proposed CP Express pipeline set to originate in Jasper and Newton County, Texas, before it ends at the CP2 LNG terminal in Cameron Parish, where it will feed natural gas to the proposed LNG facility.

The associated marine facility will be situated on Monkey Island, between the Calcasieu Ship Channel and Calcasieu Pass. CP2 LNG is Venture Global’s third LNG export project, with the Calcasieu Pass project coming online in March 2022 and the Plaquemines LNG project beginning exports in late 2024.

WILLACY COUNTY — Scattered across the acres of open fields, dozens of wind turbines stood tall one morning last month, some moved their blades with the wind as designed. Others didn’t move at all.

The inactivity at the Las Majadas Wind project was by design. This set of windmills in the Rio Grande Valley were generating more power than could be used. Now one company has a plan to bring those turbines to life.

Soluna Holdings, a data center developer focused on using renewable energy, broke ground on its data center here that will be used to manage data for Bitcoin hosting and artificial intelligence. Data centers have sprung up across the state, housing servers and infrastructure that store and process our online activity. Their growth has been spurred, in part, by the growing use of artificial intelligence.

As data centers face scrutiny over the energy required to power these facilities, as well as the water needed for their cooling systems, this facility is meant to circumvent waste by utilizing energy that would otherwise go unused.

“It became clear to us that there's lots of energy out there. Lots of it is wasted,” Soluna CEO John Belizaire said. “And if you tap into that wasted energy, you actually can power this next revolution without materially reshaping the trajectory of our climate.”

Power is wasted, or “stranded,” largely because of insufficient infrastructure, according to Jeff Clark, president and CEO of Advanced Power Alliance, a group that advocates for renewable energy.

Clark said the state’s grid hasn’t kept pace with where new generation is being built. In particular, there aren’t enough transmission lines to deliver power to high demand areas, especially power generated in rural Texas

“Until new transmission lines are built to connect the two, the power that could be generated in those regions often has nowhere to go,” Clark said.

This new data center, Project Kati, is an example of what’s referred to as a flexible load — a facility that can ramp up or down its power use based on grid conditions. And its location near where power is being generated means it won’t require the use of long-distance transmission lines.

At peak capacity, the data center will use 166 mega watts of energy — about 16 times the estimated use of AT&T Stadium on game day, according to a 2013 report. The first phase will be built to deliver 83 megawatts of computing capacity for Bitcoin. The second 83 megawatt expansion will support artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

Soluna hopes to have part of the facility running in December with plans to complete the first phase in June or July.

Las Majadas Wind project, the farm that will power the data center, is co-owned by EDF Renewables North America and Masdar, a renewable energy company based in the United Arab Emirates.

Las Majadas is one of a handful of wind energy projects located in Willacy County, a county of little more than 20,000 people on the northeast corner of the Rio Grande Valley. Its largely rural landscape with wide open fields makes it an ideal location for such projects which include the Los Vientos wind farm, one of the largest wind projects in the country.

Willacy County Judge Aurelio “Keter” Guerra said securing these projects is an everyday effort to allow the small county to prosper.

Soluna estimates the project will create 18 permanent, direct jobs within the first two to three years during the first phase. It expects an additional 75 jobs during the construction phase.

Regardless of the number of jobs created, Guerra said those positions will be high-paying. And, the most important benefit, he said, is the taxable value that it will bring to the county.

“Value is how counties survive,” he said. “Unlike cities that depend more on sales (taxes), counties depend more on value, and so these types of projects bring in value.”

He added, “For a small county like ours that operates on a $9 million budget, I think it's great.”

Texas is uniquely positioned to see more of these types of projects.

Eric Gimon, a senior fellow with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank, said using “stranded” renewable energy is much easier to do in Texas because of favorable rules set by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Such policies include netting, which allows data centers to consume energy directly from the power generator, avoiding fees from ERCOT for using power from the grid.

Texas also allows “sleeving,” which is when an intermediary retailer sells renewable energy from the generator to the buyer for a fee, allowing buyers to purchase energy at a negotiated price.

The benefit of cost stability is significant for data centers to secure the energy they need at a price they can afford through a long-term, predictable contract even in times of high market volatility.

Those benefits could play a role in drawing more data centers to the state that could make use of stranded energy.

Clark said electricity demand is expected to double over the next 10 years all across the country. To meet that demand, he said it will take collaboration among solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear, and energy storage technologies.

“The vision we have is an ‘all-of-the-above’ power mix — every resource working together to meet growing electricity demand,” Clark said. “Projects like this one in Willacy County are just the beginning of how flexible, innovative solutions can strengthen our grid and grow local economies.”

Gimon also expects to see more partnerships as more data centers take advantage of wind farms that are being underutilized.

“It is definitely a signal of things to come,” Gimon said. “There is not enough power to power up all the data centers that want to get built; you can't build it fast enough.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AGBTgCqmH8nzLGETR8vLyg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/corpus-christi-caller-times/2a2d3a3461e1395b7b39bfb86aeb46cf,N,,2025-10-22 11:25:08.910558

General Motors will take a $1.6 billion charge as it reassesses its electric vehicle strategy, underscoring a broader pullback in what was once seen as an inevitable transition to electrification. The automaker disclosed the charge in a regulatory filing ahead of its third-quarter earnings, citing stalled consumer adoption and regulatory changes that have altered the economics of EV investments.

Of the total charge, $1.2 billion is non-cash and tied to asset impairments from changes to EV production capacity. The remaining $400 million reflects cash costs related to canceling contracts and commercial agreements. The company noted that the reassessment is ongoing, leaving open the possibility of future charges.

Policy and demand misalignment

GM’s aggressive push into EVs had been backed by a $30 billion investment pledge, aimed at transforming its product lineup and building out battery manufacturing infrastructure. That vision is now being challenged by a slower-than-expected market response.

A key catalyst behind the revised outlook is recent U.S. policy shifts. The Trump administration eliminated the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers and eased emissions regulations, both of which had previously underpinned consumer demand and justified GM’s investment pace. Combined with rising interest rates and continued limitations in charging infrastructure, these changes have prompted American buyers to hesitate on large-scale EV adoption.

Wall Street has been anticipating this retrenchment. In June, Bank of America’s John Murphy projected that automakers who overcommitted to the EV timeline would face multibillion-dollar write-downs. Ford has already taken a $1.9 billion hit that included asset impairments and cancellation of an electric SUV in advanced development.

Market realities force a reset

GM’s recent sales growth in the EV segment has not been enough to offset structural challenges. Motor Intelligence data shows GM increased its EV market share from 8.7 percent at the start of the year to 13.8 percent by the end of the third quarter. Still, it lags far behind Tesla, which maintains a commanding 43.1 percent share of the U.S. market.

While the $1.6 billion charge will impact GM’s net income, it will not affect its adjusted EBIT — a key metric for investors. However, the move indicates a deeper strategic rethink that may affect future model launches, factory investments, and production timelines.

GM has not formally scaled back its long-term electrification targets, but the pace is clearly changing. It joins a growing list of global automakers recalibrating their timelines, focusing on hybrids or delaying EV models to better match current demand.

A more cautious road ahead

The charge represents more than a financial adjustment. It highlights the volatility of the EV transition and the difficulties automakers face balancing innovation, regulation, and profitability. For GM, the road to electrification is far from abandoned, but it is now paved with far more caution.

After months of consultation, the private briefings on Wednesday confirmed how Labor intends to deal with some of the most contentious elements, including climate impact.
The Greens – Watt’s other possible partner in the Senate – issued a statement condemning Labor’s plan after a briefing on Wednesday morning.
It will take us backwards and is worse than the status quo,” the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said.
Watt used the virtual meeting to encourage Labor supporters to challenge Greens and environmentalists who claimed the laws were “no good for the environment”.","Labor has confirmed the climate impact of fossil fuel projects still won’t be considered before they are approved under a revamp of federal nature laws, with the Greens labelling the government’s plan “worse than the status quo”.

The Greens, opposition and select environment and business groups have been briefed on parts of the long-awaited rewrite of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act ahead of its introduction to parliament in the upcoming sitting fortnight.

Environment minister Murray Watt’s hopes of passing the laws this year hinge on reaching a quick deal with either the Coalition or the Greens, neither of which are yet on board.

After months of consultation, the private briefings on Wednesday confirmed how Labor intends to deal with some of the most contentious elements, including climate impact.

As Watt had forecast, the laws will create a new requirement for proponents of high-polluting projects to disclose their expected greenhouse gas emissions, along with a plan to mitigate them, as part of the application process.

The new rule – which would apply to projects with predicted emissions above 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year – was a recommendation from Graeme Samuel’s review of the EPBC Act.

“By ensuring projects disclose their emissions, for the first time the public will know exactly what to expect from new projects and how they are accounting for our key climate policies, like the safeguard mechanism,” Watt said.

The proposed new reporting rules fall short of the sort of mechanism the Greens and environmental groups have long called for, which would require decision-makers to consider climate impacts when assessing applications.

“The minister or the EPA needs the powers to assess those emissions and, in the right circumstances, reject a project if the emissions are going to have an impact on our threatened species, for example, or on the Great Barrier Reef,” Glenn Walker, the head of nature at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said.

The legislation will also create a new definition for what constitutes an “unacceptable impact” on the environment, which, if, met would result in a project being immediately refused.

Industry sources briefed on the definition said it was too broad, creating an “inexhaustible level of uncertainty”.

Stakeholders were not shown the entire bill and contentious elements are yet to be finalised, including the scope of the proposed environment protection agency (EPA).

The EPA’s powers have been the main sticking point for the Coalition, which want the watchdog’s role restricted to compliance and enforcement of nature laws and the minister to retain decision-making powers on projects.

While the shadow environment minister, Angie Bell, was confident Labor had agreed to that model, Guardian Australia has confirmed with Watt’s office that no decision has been made.

Bell, who has been positive about her negotiations with Watt so far, said the opposition would await the full draft legislation before agreeing a position because “we know the devil is in the detail”.

The Greens – Watt’s other possible partner in the Senate – issued a statement condemning Labor’s plan after a briefing on Wednesday morning.

“This bill has been drafted with the interests of mining industry front and centre. It weakens environmental protection. It will take us backwards and is worse than the status quo,” the Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said.

The legislation will include a provision that requires developers to achieve a “net gain” for the environment, which could be through the use of offsets.

At a virtual meeting with grassroots Labor members on Tuesday night, Watt said developers would also be able to contribute to a “restoration fund” that the government would use to purchase offsets.

The Biodiversity Council’s chief executive, James Trezise, said the proposed fund had “serious design flaws that could leave nature worse off”, in part because the government planned to relax “like-for-like” rules that required developers to protect the same sort of environment it had damaged.

Watt used the virtual meeting to encourage Labor supporters to challenge Greens and environmentalists who claimed the laws were “no good for the environment”.

“So when you’re seeing Greens or environment groups peddling this line that we’re going backwards on the environment under Labor, and under these laws, it’s completely untrue, and we need to set the record straight.”

In a statement to Guardian Australia on Tuesday, Watt said: “No one will get everything they want.”

“Everyone agrees that these laws are failing the environment and business – that’s why we are determined to get this legislation through the parliament,” he said.

“I have always said that stakeholders would need to be willing to compromise in order to get these vital laws passed.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6755726576b7b04cac560af650c94920b966248d/653_0_6527_5222/master/6527.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f79e867c15c0f119db13fb9de73ec79c",N,,2025-10-22 04:58:33.576666

These projects are helping lower energy costs, create jobs, and strengthen local economies while reducing planet-overheating pollution.
For homeowners, going solar is one of the most effective ways to save money on energy while supporting the nation's clean energy transition.
Taking advantage of the 30% federal tax credit, which expires at the end of 2025, can save homeowners thousands on solar installation costs.
With solar installations spreading rapidly across the country — from sun-drenched deserts to farm towns and suburbs — the clean energy boom is no longer just a coastal story.","Despite policy uncertainty from Washington, the U.S. solar industry continues to shine.

A new report from the Solar Energy Industries Association and global energy research group Wood Mackenzie shows that nearly 18 gigawatts of new solar capacity was installed in the first half of 2025, a milestone that highlights how quickly clean energy is becoming a dominant force in America's power mix.

Together, solar and battery storage accounted for 82% of all new electricity added to the grid during that time.

Much of that growth is happening in places you might not expect. According to the report, 77% of new solar capacity installed this year so far came from states across the South and Midwest; Texas, Indiana, Arizona, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, and Arkansas constituted eight of the top 10 states for new installations. These projects are helping lower energy costs, create jobs, and strengthen local economies while reducing planet-overheating pollution.

Solar manufacturing is expanding, too. In the first half of 2025, the U.S. added 13 GW of new solar module production capacity, with major new expanded facilities in Texas, Indiana, and Minnesota. That brings total domestic manufacturing capacity to 55 GW, a promising sign for energy independence and supply chain resilience.

""Solar and storage are the backbone of America's energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses,"" said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper in a release.

For homeowners, going solar is one of the most effective ways to save money on energy while supporting the nation's clean energy transition. EnergySage offers free tools to compare quotes from vetted installers and estimate potential savings. Taking advantage of the 30% federal tax credit, which expires at the end of 2025, can save homeowners thousands on solar installation costs.

The average homeowner can save up to $10,000 by using EnergySage to find the best deal. The site's solar mapping tool also shows average costs and available incentives by state, a useful resource for anyone looking to see how much they could save.

For those not ready to purchase solar panels outright, leasing is a viable option. Palmetto's LightReach program installs solar panels with no money down, letting homeowners lock in lower, more predictable energy rates while reducing their carbon footprint. Pairing solar with other electric upgrades, such as energy-efficient heat pumps from Mitsubishi, can drive utility costs down even further.

With solar installations spreading rapidly across the country — from sun-drenched deserts to farm towns and suburbs — the clean energy boom is no longer just a coastal story. It's a national one, and it's lighting the way toward a more affordable and sustainable energy future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/solar-powerimage-recJp1cDNNXLGQOmy-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 06:58:11.003882

This significant federal backing, tied to the company’s massive Thacker Pass project in Nevada and a joint venture with General Motors (NYSE:GM), isn’t just about mining a critical mineral. It’s about control.

By integrating its mining and downstream processing plans at the Thacker Pass project, Lithium Americas represents a new generation of lithium producers bringing critical supply chains back onshore.

For investors, the implications are significant: control of more stages of production can mean stronger margins, greater resilience through price cycles, and higher strategic value to downstream partners.

Investor takeaway

Vertical integration has evolved from a business strategy into a geopolitical necessity in the lithium sector. It enables producers to capture more value, attract stronger partners and withstand market volatility.

For investors, understanding where integration adds real value, and where execution risk lies, is key. The leaders will be those that combine credible resources, technical depth and the capital discipline to build midstream capacity efficiently.

The giant US automaker — which has faced tough questions over the impact of Trump’s policy pivots — reported better than expected third-quarter profits and boosted some full-year projections.

The good results came despite a $1.6 billion hit to write down EV investments and $1.1 billion in tariff costs in the third quarter.

Profits fell 56.6 percent to $1.3 billion, while revenues dipped 0.3 percent to $48.6 billion.

But shares rocketed up more than 15 percent in a sign investors believe better profitability lies ahead after GM’s heavy lifting in recent months to reposition the company.

“When we have a clear challenge in front of us, that’s when the team does their best work,” Chief Executive Mary Barra said on a conference call.

“We don’t sit around and you know look to blame others. We just say, ‘Okay, here’s the situation, how are we going to adjust to it and how quickly can we do it?”

– Pivot away from EVs –

GM reported increased deliveries in the United States and China compared with the prior-year period, while vehicle pricing remained solid, with dealer inventories below year-ago levels.

Executives described the US market as “resilient” with still-healthy demand for GM’s fleet of gasoline-powered vehicles, which is dominated by sport utility vehicles and trucks.

GM also scored a jump in EV sales in the United States in a quarter that culminated with the September 30 expiration of a US tax credit of up to $7,500 for vehicle purchases. Executives said EV sales are on track for a drop in the fourth quarter but are expected to stabilize in 2026.

GM earlier this month announced the $1.6 billion cost hit from the changes in EVs.

The automaker had been aggressively investing in EV capacity throughout the presidency of Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden. It announced in 2021 a target of having its cars and trucks emissions-free by 2035.

Barra, in a letter to shareholders, said EVs “remain our North Star,” but that the company’s pivot was needed in recognition that the transition in the United States will take longer.

“By acting swiftly and decisively to address overcapacity, we expect to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond,” Barra said.

At the same time GM has pulled back some EV capacity, it has bolstered investments in US plants in response to the tariffs.

In June, GM announced $4 billion in investments to expand production of plants in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee in a plan that also shifts towards a greater mix of vehicles with internal combustion engines.

– Tariff policy tweaks –

Barra had a trying relationship with the White House during Trump’s first term. On Tuesday, she thanked “the President and his team” for adjusting tariff policies, including a shift on Friday that lets the company offset some of the costs of tariffs on imported parts through 2030.

GM now sees its 2025 tariff cost hit at between $3.5-$4.5 billion, down $500 million from an earlier forecast.

The company projected full-year adjusted profits of between $12 billion and $13 billion, up from the prior range of $10-$12.5 billion.

Executives declined to go into detail on their outlook for next year, but Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said “we do expect that 2026 can be better than 2025.”

Analysts at JPMorgan Chase have estimated that GM’s 2026 results could benefit $1 billion from a US-South Korea trade agreement that has yet to be finalized and another $1 billion annually from Trump’s watered down fuel economy rules.

“The overall impression is of a company firing on all cylinders within the context of those factors that management can control, and with improving visibility with regard to those factors outside management’s control,” said the JPMorgan note.

On October 21, King County Councilmembers voted to adopt the 2025-2030 Strategic Climate Action Plan (SCAP) and Climate and Workforce Strategy, launching the official start of the implementation process for King County and partners.

Story

King County Councilmembers approved the 2025-2030 Strategic Climate Action Plan and 2025 Climate and Workforce Strategy on October 21, formally adopting the plan that Executive Shannon Braddock announced in June.

""This Strategic Climate Action Plan advances ambitious climate action and builds on years of work to advocate for strong policies that deliver solutions and real benefits, especially for our frontline communities,” Executive Braddock said. “I am grateful for the Council’s partnership. Together, alongside community and partners, we are preparing for climate impacts while also building stronger, more resilient ecosystems.”

The plan prioritizes community-driven solutions, strengthens partnerships to scale up action, and introduces nine “flagship” outcomes to outline how these efforts will make a tangible difference for people and places across King County.

“Thank you to our many partners, who advocated and provided their time and energy to make sure this plan offered a streamlined, accessible vision for a healthier, safer future where everyone can thrive,” King County Climate Director Marissa Aho said. “The new flagships in this plan offer a results-driven vision, and we are excited to work with existing and new partners to make them a reality.”

King County communities are already facing the impacts of climate change, from warmer air and heavier rain events to declining long-term snowpack and changing ocean chemistry. Actions in the 2025 SCAP will help communities prepare for climate impacts on health, homes, businesses, and the environment, while also building stronger, more resilient ecosystems.

""King County continues to lead the nation and the world in local government planning for climate change,"" King County Councilmember De'Sean Quinn said. ""We can be proud of this plan for its comprehensive approach. This plan provides a clear path forward and answers the question our youth are asking us every day: 'What are you doing for our future?'""

All of those actions are built around the following flagships:

Put Frontline Communities First: Investing in community leadership, local partnerships, and community preparedness to strengthen frontline community resilience and support community-driven climate action.

Safe, Healthy, and Climate-Ready Homes and Buildings: Fostering a transition to clean energy; strengthening housing and workplaces to withstand extreme heat, wildfire smoke, and flooding, while ensuring affordability and preventing displacement.

Connected and Accessible Transportation: Expanding sustainable mobility options like transit, biking, and walking to reduce car dependency while improving access to jobs, schools, and services.

Economic Mobility and Career-Building Opportunities: Ensuring that the economic opportunities created by the clean energy transition benefit historically excluded workers and local communities.

Fresh, Local Food for Everyone: Strengthening food security and sustainable agriculture by supporting farmers, reducing food waste, and increasing access to fresh, healthy food.

Design Out Waste: Redesigning our systems to reduce consumption, prevent waste, and increase the reuse of valuable materials.

Clean Air, Water, and Healthy Ecosystems: Protecting and restoring forests, waterways, and green spaces to improve climate resilience, public health, and biodiversity.

Reliable and Future-Ready Infrastructure: Changing how we design, build, and maintain roads, utilities, and public services to withstand climate extremes while ensuring equitable access to essential infrastructure.

Collaborative and Community-Led Solutions: Centering climate action and equity in climate governance by ensuring frontline communities, tribes, and local organizations shape and lead climate solutions.",https://cds.kingcounty.gov/favicon_kcgov.ico,N,,2025-10-22 06:18:24.436362

Venture Global has already secured long-term offtake agreements with several major international buyers, positioning CP2 as a key driver of U.S. LNG growth in the late 2020s.
The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to reverse the previous LNG export pause implemented under President Biden.
According to DOE data, the administration has now approved more than 13.8 Bcf/d of new LNG export capacity—surpassing the total current exports of the world’s second-largest LNG supplier.","The U.S. Department of Energy has approved Venture Global’s CP2 LNG project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, to export up to 3.96 billion cubic feet per day of liquefied natural gas to countries without a free trade agreement with the United States. The decision marks the final regulatory milestone for one of the largest U.S. LNG export projects currently under development.

The authorization was signed today by U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who emphasized the administration’s push to expand American energy exports and restore what he described as “energy dominance” under President Trump. “Finalizing the non-FTA authorization for CP2 LNG will enable secure and reliable American energy access for our allies and trading partners, while also providing well-paid jobs and economic opportunities at home,” said Kyle Haustveit, Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy.

The decision follows DOE’s conditional approval granted in March 2025 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s May 2025 authorization for siting, construction, and operation of the $10 billion CP2 LNG terminal. The DOE also cited its updated 2024 LNG Export Study, reaffirming that U.S. LNG exports enhance global energy security and economic competitiveness while benefiting domestic workers.

The CP2 project, located adjacent to Venture Global’s existing Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal, is designed to include up to 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of liquefaction capacity. Venture Global has already secured long-term offtake agreements with several major international buyers, positioning CP2 as a key driver of U.S. LNG growth in the late 2020s.

The move comes as the Trump administration seeks to reverse the previous LNG export pause implemented under President Biden. On his first day in office, President Trump directed DOE to resume approvals of pending applications for non-FTA exports, leading to what the department describes as a record pace of authorizations. According to DOE data, the administration has now approved more than 13.8 Bcf/d of new LNG export capacity—surpassing the total current exports of the world’s second-largest LNG supplier.

U.S. LNG exports have surged to approximately 15 Bcf/d, up around 25% from 2024 levels, supported by strong global demand and continued infrastructure expansion along the Gulf Coast. The CP2 approval solidifies Louisiana’s role as a central hub for America’s LNG ambitions, strengthening the country’s position as the world’s leading LNG exporter.

The resolution, introduced by Councilmember Amber Fellows, affirms the city’s opposition to the U of M and Los Alamos development.

Fellows’ resolution calls attention to Los Alamos’ nuclear weapons work and said questions linger about the university’s precise role in nuclear weapons research through the project.

The resolution urges the Ypsilanti Township board to use all available means to deny permits and prevent the project; the University of Michigan Board of Regents to end its partnership with Los Alamos; and the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners to take a formal position against the project, among other calls to action.

“It is incumbent upon us, with the support of our community here, to take a formal position in opposition to this project and to encourage our local partners to also do that, so that we have a chance to actually prevent it from being completed,” Fellows said.

Ypsilanti is joining the group Mayors for Peace, an international organization for cities that works for total abolition of nuclear weapons and lasting world peace, according to the resolution.

The city will hold annual observations of Hiroshima Day on Aug. 6 and Nagasaki Day on Aug. 9 with “appropriate remembrance to honor victims of nuclear weapons.”

Nine people spoke in support of the data center resolution during Tuesday’s council meeting, raising concerns about Los Alamos’ nuclear weapons work and potential impacts to air quality, water resources, utility costs, and energy reliability.

Commenter Logan Fortino said data centers are expected to increase energy bills 8% by 2030.

“Passing that on to the residents of this community and having them deal with the environmental impacts … seems really unreasonable,” Fortino said.

U of M and Los Alamos plan to site the project on 144.5 acres of land on Textile Road south and east of Ford Lake Dam and North Hydro Park, according to university documents.

U of M refers to the $1.2 billion, taxpayer supported project as a “high-performance computing facility,” not a “commercial data center.” It will “support important research in science, energy and national security,” and will not manufacture nuclear weapons, according to the university.

The university expects to start construction in 2027, with the project becoming fully operational by 2031, according to an August story in The University Record, an in-house publication for faculty, staff, and retirees.

Ypsilanti Township attorney says ‘no transparency at all’ from U of M

The Ypsilanti Township Board of Trustees adopted a resolution Aug. 19 that urges U of M and Los Alamos to relocate the development to the American Center for Mobility, next to Willow Run Airport.

Township officials are excluded from talks over a potential relocation of the facility, Ypsilanti Township attorney Doug Winters told Planet Detroit Tuesday.

“There’s no transparency at all,” Winters said, adding that the project could dictate the future of land use in the township and impact utility ratepayers and the environment.

The University of Michigan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In August, a spokesperson told Planet Detroit the university is reevaluating the American Center for Mobility site at the township’s request and would keep local officials informed.

Ypsilanti Township residents have voiced concerns about the facility’s potential water and energy demands and the presence of Los Alamos in the community, which they said could support drone warfare and surveillance technologies.

Six of the 45 indicators are “off track”—progress is being made, but not fast enough—while almost 30 are “well off track,” meaning progress is much too slow.
There is usually a barrage of reports measuring climate progress as the world moves toward the UN climate change conference, held annually in November.
The US does remain in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the treaty that provides the basis of the Paris Agreement—for now.
But he points to the massive international adoption of renewable energy, as laid out in the report, as a point of hope.","In the 10 years since the signing of the Paris Agreement, the backbone of international climate action, humanity has made impressive progress. Renewable energy is increasingly cheap and reliable, while electric vehicles are becoming better every year.

By virtually every key metric used to measure progress, though, we are still lagging behind where we would need to be to avert the worst effects of climate change, according to a report released Wednesday by a coalition of climate groups—and we’re running out of time to right the ship.

“All systems are flashing red,” Clea Shumer, a researcher at the World Resources Institute, one of the organizations involved in the report, said last week on a call with reporters. “There’s no doubt we are largely doing the right things—we are just not moving fast enough.”

The Paris Agreement aims to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by the end of this century. To measure progress toward this goal, the report looks at emissions from 45 different sectors of the global economy and environment, measuring everything from building electrification to use of coal in the power sector to global meat consumption.

Grimly, none of the indicators the report measures are where they need to be to keep the world on track to meet the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees. Six of the 45 indicators are “off track”—progress is being made, but not fast enough—while almost 30 are “well off track,” meaning progress is much too slow. Five, meanwhile, are headed in the “wrong direction,” meaning the situation is getting worse, not better, and needs an urgent U-turn. (There’s not enough data, the report says, to measure the remaining five indicators, which include peatland degradation and restoration, food waste, and the share of new buildings that are zero-carbon.)

One of the most consistently off-track markers, experts said, was the global effort to phase out coal, one of the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. While coal’s share in global electricity generation did go down slightly in 2024, total coal use actually hit a record high last year thanks to growing electricity demand, especially from China and India. A dirty power grid, Shumer said, has “huge knock-on effects” for other progress indicators like decarbonizing buildings and transportation.

To get on track, the world needs to increase its pace of coal phaseout tenfold, Shumer said. That, she continued, would entail shutting down more than 360 medium-sized coal plants each year and canceling every coal-fired power plant currently in the global development pipeline.

“We simply will not limit warming to 1.5 degrees if coal use keeps breaking records,” Shumer said.’

Rachel Cleetus, the senior policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, points out that phasing out coal is also a net good for public health. Recent research estimated that pollutants from coal-fired power plants killed 460,000 Americans between 1999 and 2020.

“Coal is a killer especially in developing countries, but the health burden is immense even in countries like the US,” says Cleetus, who was not involved in the new report.

Meanwhile, the only indicator that was on track in the last installment of the report, which was published in 2023, has since taken a turn for the worse. In the last report, the share of electric vehicles in passenger car sales was a welcome silver lining; nearly one in every five new cars purchased in 2023 was an EV, a 35 percent increase from the year before. Compared to the fact that EVs were less than 1 percent of passenger car sales when the Paris Agreement was signed 10 years ago, that progress is truly impressive. But despite continuing runaway success in Chinese markets, where EVs account for almost half of all new passenger car purchases, sales in markets including the EU and the US slowed last year.

The backslide on electric vehicles surprised Laurens Speelman, who serves on the strategy team of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit that works on market-based climate solutions. (Speelman has been involved in crafting past versions of this report, but was not involved in the current iteration.) Despite the progress the world has seen since Paris, Speelman says, “the message that we're still not on track is really sobering, and a stark one.”

The news isn’t all bad. Solar power is one of the big success stories of the current moment, with 33 percent more solar installed worldwide last year than in 2023. Much of that growth is, again, driven by China, which installed twice as much solar capacity in 2024 as the US has installed on the grid in total.

The report’s authors also point to private climate finance—investments from banks, businesses, and other private entities—as another promising high point. This type of investment has increased so much since the last iteration of this report that it has been upgraded from “well off track” to “off track.” Public climate finance, though—money pledged from wealthier countries to developing ones to help them adapt to climate change and cope with damages—is still “well off track,” the report finds.

There is usually a barrage of reports measuring climate progress as the world moves toward the UN climate change conference, held annually in November. With the addition of the Paris anniversary in December, there’s plenty of opportunity to take stock of where we are now. A report released last week sounded the alarm that the first climate “tipping point”—a group of ecological thresholds past which small changes can lead to cascading and catastrophic effects—has been reached, as the world’s coral reefs are in the middle of a multi-year bleaching event. The World Meteorological Organization also said last week that CO2 levels increased by a record amount in 2024.

The US, meanwhile—which Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement for the second time in his career on his first day in office this year—seems eager to destroy as much climate progress as possible, both at home and abroad. In a scattered September speech to the UN General Assembly, the president called climate change a “con job,” attacking scientific predictions as “made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.”

The Trump administration is currently launching a full-scale attack on EVs, removing tax credits for buyers, and freezing funding allocated for building new charging stations. It’s also attacking all forms of renewable energy; while it seems to reserve special animus for offshore wind, it’s also pulling tax credits for clean energy buildouts while simultaneously boosting coal. The US does remain in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the treaty that provides the basis of the Paris Agreement—for now.

Speelman, who is based in Amsterdam, says he has no idea the impact a second Trump administration will have on this year’s negotiations, which are taking place in Brazil. But he points to the massive international adoption of renewable energy, as laid out in the report, as a point of hope.

“There’s a factor at play which is very different from a few years ago, which is that the economics are really behind a lot of different clean technologies,” he says. “It's simply good business to invest in renewable technologies, electrified grids, and electrification technologies and in energy efficiency.”

Cleetus sees what’s happening in the US as part of a larger, more troubling pattern.

“Fossil fuel entities and their political allies continue to hold sway over countries’ energy policies and are showing up at the international climate talks in ever larger numbers to directly interfere with the outcomes,” she says. “What’s happening in the US is an especially acute and alarming example where the government is explicitly pushing a fossil fuel agenda, right down to spreading lies and disinformation about climate science.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/68f67b35328039a7a6b7066c/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/World-Not-Doing-Anything-About-Climate-Change-Science-2205540770.jpg",N,,2025-10-22 00:18:18.460144

His emergence has helped open the rest of the field for Sarratt, which is precisely what Indiana wanted.
(Williams Jr.) in there, Sarratt, Cooper, there were new transfers we stuck in there,” Cignetti said.
Sarratt and Cooper didn't expect anything less when they opted to come back for one more season together.","Elijah Sarratt came to Indiana to show he could excel against the nation's top secondaries. Omar Cooper Jr. stuck around his home state, hoping to get the same opportunity.

Now, under the brightest spotlight, both are outperforming expectations.

Seven games into their second season together, the Hoosiers top two receivers find themselves ranked among the Football Bowl Subdivision's statistical leaders, increasingly becoming the targets of defensive game plans and leading an emerging group of playmakers as No. 2 Indiana chases a second straight playoff bid.

Sarratt saw the possibilities early on.

""There's a lot of talent in that (receivers) room,"" he said in September. ""We work to make each other better. We all want to catch every single pass, but we understand that the ball has to be spread around, so none of us are selfish. All of us just want to go out there and perform in the game.”

So far, they've fulfilled that mission.

Indiana (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten) heads into Saturday's game against UCLA hoping to extend a school record home winning streak to 14 games and maintain at least a share of the conference lead with defending national champion Ohio State. The Hoosiers are averaging 271.3 yards passing per game and have the most TD passes (24) in the FBS.

Sarratt is the steady, experienced leader of this versatile receiving group.

He's been an all-conference selection each of his first three college seasons despite stair-stepping his way from St. Francis (Pennsylvania) in the FCS' Northeast Conference to Sun Belt member James Madison and finally following coach Curt Cignetti to the Big Ten.

Along the way, he's amassed 220 catches, 3,450 yards and 38 TDs, ranking in the top five nationally among active players in all three categories. It's about more than numbers with Sarratt though.

His ideal size, 6-foot-2, 213 pounds, and rare combination of strong hands, incredible body control and penchant for big plays almost certainly has NFL scouts watching. Two of Sarratt's FBS-leading nine TD catches — a 49-yarder with 88 seconds left at Iowa and an 8-yarder with 6:23 left at then-No. 3 Oregon — were the go-ahead scores.

Back in Indiana, meanwhile, Sarratt also has caught the attention of new quarterback Fernando Mendoza, who is firmly in the Heisman Trophy debate with 21 TD passes, only two interceptions and the nation's top efficiency rating at 191.01.

But Mendoza and Sarratt each acknowledged they couldn't do this by themselves.

“We've got a special core on our offense,” Mendoza said Saturday. “Surratt, Cooper, Williams, all of our tight ends, all of our offensive linemen, running backs, coupled with the game planning of coach Cignetti and (quarterbacks/co-offensive coordinator ) coach Chandler Whitmer, it really has been a perfect marriage and we're seeing the results.”

While Sarratt was the known quantity entering this season, Cooper has been the breakout star. After logging 46 catches, 861 yards and nine TDs in his first three seasons with the Hoosiers, he's logged 37 receptions, 581 yards and seven TD catches this year, emerging as a deep threat out of the slot after winning the job this spring.

His emergence has helped open the rest of the field for Sarratt, which is precisely what Indiana wanted.

“We gave everybody an opportunity in spring ball. We stuck E.J. (Williams Jr.) in there, Sarratt, Cooper, there were new transfers we stuck in there,” Cignetti said. “Cooper just seemed the most comfortable (there). He still gets his reps outside when we’re playing with two receivers. I just think what you’re seeing from him, he’s older, more mature, he’s a veteran now. He sees what’s out there.”

Yet as Cooper has embraced a more prominent role on the nation's fourth-highest scoring offense (43.9 points), he's still willing to share credit rather than celebrate alone in the spotlight.

Williams attended high school in Alabama, started his career at Clemson and transferred to Indiana in 2023 before opting, like Cooper, to play for Cignetti instead of finding a new school. As a result, Williams went from playing six total games in 2023 and 2024 to becoming a key cog in this offense.

He's already surpassed his previous two-year totals with 19 receptions, 212 yards and three receptions in 2025 as this trio has become one of the nation's most potent receiving combinations.

Sarratt and Cooper didn't expect anything less when they opted to come back for one more season together.

“A lot of people sleep on E.J. because of (Elijah and me), but E.J. is a really good player, and he was able to show you that today,” Cooper said after Williams caught a key TD pass against Michigan State. “The fact that it’s three of us allows us to go out there and play more free, knowing you can’t just double team one person because we've got more weapons than you can hold.""

The new consultations cover the GHG Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance, updating the initial guidance from 2015, and an update on consequential accounting methods for estimating avoided emissions from electricity-sector actions.

GHG Protocol was established in 1997 by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to develop comprehensive global standardized frameworks to measure and manage GHG emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. GHG Protocol’s standards have been integrated and referenced in major global sustainability reporting frameworks including the IFRS Foundation’s ISSB standards and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) underlying the CSRD regulation.

Scope 2 emissions typically constitute a significant portion of the GHG emissions under a company’s control. According to GHG Protocol, nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced to energy generation, and half of that energy is used by industrial or commercial entities. Efforts to address Scope 2 emissions usually include initiatives such as energy conservation, efficiency upgrades, and shifting to low-carbon electricity.

The GHG Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance standardizes how companies measure emissions from purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat and cooling. According to GHG Protocol, the updates are aimed at improving accuracy, keeping GHG reporting methods consistent and align with how electricity is produced and delivered, as the energy landscape evolves.

Key aspects of the proposed update include new requirements for emissions from energy contracts and instruments, such as renewable energy credits, in GHG inventories, as well as “Scope 2 Quality Criteria” that all contractual instruments must meet in order to be a reliable data source for the scope 2 market-based method, and recommendations for transparently disclosing information about energy purchases.

Among the central features included in the new GHG Protocol proposal is a new hourly matching and deliverability requirement for market-based reporting, aimed at aligning emissions claims more closely with the time and place electricity is consumed, in order to reduce double counting, and to ensure that reported clean energy purchases more accurately reflect the physical realities of the power grid.

Alongside the Scope 2 guidance, GHG Protocol is also conducting a consultation on consequential accounting methods, which estimate the system-wide impacts of actions such as clean energy procurement or investment beyond an organization’s operational boundaries. According to GHG Protocol, maintaining separate reporting for inventory emissions and system-wide impacts would help to preserve the integrity and comparability of corporate inventories, and ensure that reported emissions remain consistent across organizations and over time.

Alexander Bassen, Chair of Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Independent Standards Board, said:

“A decade after publishing the Scope 2 standard, an update is both timely and necessary. This revision is an opportunity to make improvements based on how the standard has been applied in practice and how power systems have become cleaner, more complex, and more interconnected than ever before.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Wind-Eni.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 01:17:51.025240

As battery technology evolves, more batteries are being built directly into the devices they power, demanding contoured shapes that maximize space efficiency.
TOSS sealing systems can scale to accommodate parts in any shape or size, ensuring consistent, reliable seals for a range of applications.
While constant heat sealing requires continuous heating of the tooling, consuming large amounts of energy, impulse heat sealing only requires heat for the heating portion of the heat-sealing cycle, TOSS noted.

As battery technology evolves, more batteries are being built directly into the devices they power, demanding contoured shapes that maximize space efficiency. TOSS says its new PIREG technology can adapt to complex shapes while ensuring a secure and reliable seal.

By measuring the temperature of the heat seal band 60 times per second, the PIREG C2-220 temperature controller ensures consistent and uniform sealing cycles. This model features Ethernet/IP controls that directly interface with Ethernet/IP PLCs for real-time feedback, while also providing a full set of terminals for analog PLC connections. It can be fully controlled by either analog PLCs or Ethernet/IP PLCs, offering flexibility in automation setups.

To ensure adaptability to specific heat-sealing applications and plant design, a wide range of compatible accessories and peripheral devices are available, optimizing the PIREG temperature controllers for various operational needs.

TOSS sealing systems can scale to accommodate parts in any shape or size, ensuring consistent, reliable seals for a range of applications. The systems also offer validation capabilities, allowing users to monitor temperature with high resolution and ensure the sealing process functions as intended.

While constant heat sealing requires continuous heating of the tooling, consuming large amounts of energy, impulse heat sealing only requires heat for the heating portion of the heat-sealing cycle, TOSS noted. Its seal-and-cut technology streamlines manufacturing by enabling simultaneous sealing and cutting of films, which eliminates excess tooling and reduces process steps. In case a seal-and-cut application is not needed, TOSS offers a wide variety of other band profiles and can make heat seal bands in various shapes and sizes.

What he says is something like this rural America is seeing in rural places, in a much more globalized, digitized knowledge based economy, are seeing their economies weaken.
And then there are many other Americans who’s in rural places, whose ideas are in flux, just like those elsewhere.
And the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill can try to do rural broadband and cite factories in rural America.
Yeah, I think, what I’ve been describing is this historical process over several decades of how the rural urban divide emerged.","I think there’s a particular lens worth using right now as we watch the Trump administration deploying the National Guard from red states into blue cities. We are watching a rural political coalition militarily occupying urban centers. It is moving armed troops in over the objections of the residents, of their mayors and of their governors. This is an attack on neighborhoods, on lawful residents, on U.S. citizens. That’s not preventing crime, as Donald Trump claims, that’s threatening public safety. The Trump administration is doing this while describing these cities as something like enemy territory. They need to be liberated, taken back. Trump said this to a room of America’s top military leaders. What they’ve done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they’re very unsafe places. And we’re going to straighten them out one by one. That’s a war, too. It’s a war from within. Trump also said that the people in these cities resisting this occupation, these deployments, that they should be understood as insurrectionists. We have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up. Sure, I’d do that. For years, I have been skeptical of warnings that America was at risk of a renewed Civil War. There were all kinds of reasons to not take that particularly seriously. But when I see troops being sent into cities over the objections of the people elected in those cities, of the people elected in those states. When I hear them talked about this way, I think you have to take those warnings more seriously now. And I told Pete we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military National Guard. But military. A massive rural urban divide has opened in our country’s politics. Urban and rural voters used to vote pretty much in lockstep. But then in the 90s, that split. Urban voters became reliably Democratic, and rural voters became overwhelmingly Republican. We treat this as an inevitability in our politics, but it is only a few decades old, and our political future and stability might rest on reversing it. Certainly, for the Democratic Party, any durable political power rests on reversing it. Reversing it isn’t going to be easy, but it begins with understanding it and taking seriously the resentments that fuel it. “Rural Versus Urban“, a new book by the political scientist Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown, is the best place I’ve found to start. And so I asked Mettler to join me on the show, to walk me through how we got here and whether we can get out. As always, my email, ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com Suzanne Mettler, welcome to the show. Happy to be here. I think a lot of people who have followed politics over the past 10, 20 years. Assume the big political divide between rural America and urban America is a constant, an inevitability, just a feature of our politics. Is that true. No the rural urban divide did not exist nationwide in the past in the United States. If we look at how people voted in presidential elections through the middle of the 20th century, right up to the early 90s, rural and urban Americans voted, almost in lockstep, just a couple of percentage points dividing them. That’s true as recently as 1992. Two percentage point gap. Then it starts growing and growing and growing. And it was in 2020 for a 20 percentage point gap. All regions of the country have moved in this way, have this big gap. Almost all states have a big rural urban divide. And, it’s really driving polarization in a particularly pernicious way because it’s place based. Rural and urban people don’t encounter each other in ways that could soften the divide. And so it’s creating an us versus them kind of politics that’s really dangerous. Before we get into what created the divide beginning in the 90s, what kept urban and rural America politically United for so long. Well you go back to say that, the late early 20th century, as industrialization is happening, rural areas really feel left behind. There’s a big agricultural depression in the 1920s. Then the depression comes, and rural people at that point are really upset and policymakers are worried. There’s about to be like a revolution in the countryside, as they call it. But what happens is that Franklin D Roosevelt steps in and he creates this big rural urban Coalition and to an extent that I was unaware of until we wrote this book. He really put rural Americans front and center in his vision of what needed to happen for the country, and created all of these policies that were really designed to lift up rural America. I cannot escape the conclusion that one of the essential parts of a national program of restoration must be to restore purchasing power to the farming half of the country. Without this, the wheels of the railroad and the wheels of the factories will not turn. Rural Americans really appreciated that, and they felt the Democratic Party was there for them, and many of them remembered it for their lifetimes. And then their kids did as well, all the way up until the 1990s. In the 1980s and early 90s, rural places were more likely to send Democrats to Congress and Republicans and to think that a few decades ago, there was still really a coalition where there were rural politicians who were really at the forefront in Congress in brokering compromises on all sorts of important policies. When we study the Affordable Care Act, for example, you have all of these rural lawmakers who were really playing an important role. And influencing the policy right up till the end, and those lawmakers are gone. Bart Stupak, for example, who was a swing vote from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. And he gets replaced by people who are like Marjorie Taylor Greene going forward. So it moves from being these people who are functionally moderating polarization in America, who are building bridges. Stupak is a pro-life Democrat, very famously Ben Nelson from Nebraska, the same thing to. The most extreme members of the Republican coalition. You have a thing towards the end of the book where you show that if you’re looking at Republicans who was likeliest to support the lies about the 2020 election, it is heavily overrepresented by the Republicans who represent rural districts. Yes, that’s right. So on January 6, 2021, when Congress reconvenes, there’s a large portion of the Republican caucus, about 138 members who vote against accepting the votes from all of the states. And they’re heavily rural. It’s not just that these folks who are being elected in rural areas now are more conservative on policy issues, is that it’s also that they are more willing to go against basic Democratic norms and principles. In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. And that kicks off this process of ideological polarization where the parties into liberal and conservative. The Dixiecrats die out. And I think the most commonly believed story about what happened in the urban rural divide is that they hated the Civil Rights Act. I think if you look at a lot of Democratic accounts of this, you’ll see something like that. You don’t buy that account. Yeah, well that’s wrong. So, for one thing, just look at when the rural urban divide emerged. It’s not until the late 1990s. So the story that you’re telling usually then the follow up is that the South left the Democratic Party. Well, in fact, it was a lot of urban Southerners who left the Democratic Party. But rural Southerners stuck with it up until the 1990s. And then they left one of the most striking things that we find is that this rural urban divide is not a function of differences in views about public policy. And so we look exhaustively at public opinion polls and we find that on most issues, if you look at the views of non-Hispanic white Americans, there’s no difference, no significant difference in their opinions about how much we should be spending money on things like education, health care, policing. And so on. There are a few issues abortion and gun rights where there’s a gap, but the gap is not that large and it hasn’t been growing over time. So it doesn’t explain this growing rural urban divide. So in other words, while we are divided by place in terms of which party people support, that’s not because there’s a difference in Americans actual views in those two places on major issues. So then why are people in rural America electing representatives who are so different on policy to the people they used to elect. What we find is that when the rural urban divide began to grow in the 1990s, it was economic factors that were driving it. And so you’d had economic decline that was happening starting in the 1980s. Loss of family farms with agricultural consolidation, loss of jobs in extractive industries like mining and oil and the. And then deindustrialization, which had already been hitting cities pretty hard. Then it hits with NAFTA and change in trade policies. It hits rural areas to an extent. That really surprised me. I wouldn’t have realized there was so much industry in rural places. So that’s in the late 90s, early 2000. And as all of that’s happening, rural people start to feel that this party that they had long thought was there for them or they were at least willing to support, on occasion, vote, split ticket, whatever. They start to feel like it’s abandoned them and that it’s no longer there for them. I think it’s a factor that Bill Clinton is President during that point in time. So even though most Democrats in Congress were opposed to NAFTA and opposed to a lot of deregulation, that was happening, there were just enough Democrats endorsing it and then Bill Clinton signing it into law. And so rural people moved away from the Democratic Party and started supporting the Republican Party. So let me push on some parts of this story. You one thing that your book really did convince me of is that if you look at the timing of different things, the political divergence and the economic divergence really do track each other. But as you say, a lot of the policies people often blame here, not just NAFTA. There were a lot of free trade policies. There was a lot of deregulation. Deregulation is a big focus of your book. They’re heavily supported by Republicans to say nothing of taxes that are cut for rich people. And then the spending cuts fall on programs that people in rural America use very heavily. Obamacare, in very important ways, subsidizes a lot of health. And rural America helps hospitals there, helps people who are uninsured there. The thing I was thinking as I was reading your book was that there is what happens, and then there is who is blamed for what happens and where something happened that could plausibly be blamed on Democrats. You see it blamed on them. Why Well, I think you’re putting your finger on why this is so puzzling and paradoxical. So I said, it starts with the economic stuff. But then the second phase is the development of resentment. 2008 to 2020. Then at that point, rural Americans are looking at the Democratic Party, and they start to think of it as having a center that is affluent people, wealthy people, people better off than themselves who are running the party and who don’t seem to understand them or their communities, but they’re creating policies that they’re foisting upon them in all sorts of different areas, and they resent it. So that’s when grievance begins to grow. So there’s this sense of anger, and it has become channeled at the Democratic Party, even though that is in many ways unfair. But I think it is true now that much of the Democratic Party, because it’s become so distant from rural voters, doesn’t understand their situation and their communities. And so there is a basis in fact, there in 2008, when George W Bush is incredibly unpopular, the Iraq war is understood to be a disaster. The financial crisis is in full swing. Obama and the Democrats do quite well in rural America. I mean, it’s one of the last times on some of your charts when you see the cities and the rural areas swing together. Yes but then there’s I mean, the first bailout passes under George W Bush, but the Democrats support it. The recovery from the financial crisis is slow, and it is slower in rural America. There is a feeling that the banks got bailed out. The cities ended up doing fine. The stock market comes back, but the devastation in rural America really lingers. How much did you hear about that and how much do you think that soured people in these areas on the Democratic Party in a kind of final fashion. One of the things we did for our research was interviewing political party County chairs, both Democrats and Republicans in several states. I drove thousands of miles and talked to a lot of people. I remember one County chair saying to us, we’ve been in a recession here for 30 years. So I think in a sense, it’s all been kind of a blur from the loss of jobs that was happening in the 1990s and early 2000. As plants closed and and workforces downsized to then what happens in 2008 and beyond with the Great Recession that things went from bad to worse. How much is this just educational polarization that what you’re seeing is the cities are much more highly educated, a greater density of college graduates. How much is the urban rural language simply obscuring the main issue being the educational divide. Yeah well, the educational divide certainly plays into it and is very important. It’s fascinating. You go back to the 1980s and the average person with a college degree or more in the United States voted for the Republican Party. And then that changes in starting in the 90s, that group starts moving toward the Democratic Party. And these are urbanites with higher education. And it’s not until 2008 and beyond that, rural people start to emulate that same pattern. But they’re it the average rural person has less education. And then the switch that’s happening is from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. So the educational divide is important. But in all of our analysis, we control for that. And rurality still matters. It matters over and above that there being a coalition that is more urban and a coalition that is more rural, and the rural coalition being particularly more culturally conservative, more religious, more traditionalist. That’s a pretty common structure for political systems. We see this same divergence in many countries. Does that imply there’s something if not inevitable, then heavily predetermined here. Given that it’s happening in different countries with different political parties who have passed different economic policies at different times. Typically other countries have more parties than we do. And the rural urban divide, while it has grown in lots of countries in the past few decades, it’s grown most dramatically in the United States. And here I’m turning to the work of Jonathan Rodden at Stanford. He’s done a lot of work on this. It’s grown more quickly here during that time period. And I would also add that it’s more consequential in the United States because we have so many of our electoral institutions give extra political power to less populated places. So if you think of the US Senate, for example, every state gets two senators, regardless of population. So California has more than 60 times as many residents as Wyoming. But they both have two senators. And that gets replicated in all these other rural states. And that means that in the Senate, when it comes to policymaking, that rural places have extra cloud. It also means that in choosing the judiciary, confirmations of judges, that the rural urban divide matters a lot. And, of course, the electoral college. So right now, for the first time in our history, all of these advantages are consolidated in one party. And that hasn’t been the case before. So I very much by that point that it is more consequential here because of the somewhat distinctive place based structure of our political system. But I want to hold on this question of what the commonality across countries might teach us or might not teach us. I think a lot of Democrats believe something very similar to what Barack Obama said in the infamous bitter Clinger comments. People have been beaten down so long and they feel so betrayed by government. So it’s not surprising then, that they get bitter and they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren’t like them, or a way to explain their frustrations. And if you wipe the argument he made of some the more condescending language it was in it, I think, very much to his regret. What he says is something like this rural America is seeing in rural places, in a much more globalized, digitized knowledge based economy, are seeing their economies weaken. That is true across countries. And the people who stay there. They stay there for a number of different reasons. They want to be where they grew up. They are more traditionalist, and as both the people who can leave and want to leave do, and as the people who can stay and want to say stay have less and less economic dynamism and you have more identification with the way things used to be with a better time from before. And that goes alongside more religiosity. It goes alongside more traditional ways of life hunting, and it comes with a resentment of the urban elites who you feel are doing this to you and who don’t respect your way of life. I’m not saying this is true, but I’m presenting it as a thing I think Democrats believe is true. So there’s a lot of stereotypes there. And so I grew up in a rural place myself, and I still spend a lot of time in rural places. So I think if a lot of rural Americans heard this, they would really want to push back and say, no, we’re not part of some entirely different sect of people over here. There are lots and lots of rural Americans who do identify as Democrats. It tends to be about one third on average. Now in presidential elections. And then there are many other Americans who’s in rural places, whose ideas are in flux, just like those elsewhere. You’re suggesting there’s a political sorting going on that the people move away who have these different policy attitudes or different. I’ve heard it phrased as psychological attitudes. People with more openness to experience, people who want to compete in the urban job markets, that there is a sorting happening. Yeah now there’s other scholars than ourselves who’ve looked at this very carefully, and they find that that’s not driving rural people’s moving to urban places and that in fact, when people change their party, it tends to be after they’ve made a move. So it’s not pulling them to urban places. So I don’t think that holds up. And you’ve been talking a bit about the rise of grievance politics and resentment. I think there’s something upstream of that which you talk about a bit in the book, but is affinity. And I just don’t think there’s a way to get around this. I’ve been covering politics and particularly Democratic politics since the early 2000, and the Democratic Party is an urban Coalition, and it does in many ways feel distant from rural America. I mean, I remember in that George W Bush years all the talk about losing touch with the heartland, right. Democrats were the party of John Kerry and coastal liberals and Republicans were the party of the heartland. And Democrats losing touch on gods, guns and gays was the way it used to be talked about. And it seems, for reasons that aren’t primarily policy, but might have to do with religiosity and other things there developed just more affinity. I mean, there are elites in both parties, and the elites in both parties are educated, and the elites in both parties are rich. And often the elites in both parties come from or live in cities. And yet the elites in the Democratic Party much more identify with urban America than the elites in the Republican Party. Even when the elites in the Republican Party like Donald Trump, live in New York City. And that affinity feels very important in terms of everything that comes after. Yes well, I think that they are you’re really explaining the second dynamic that we identify, this sense that rural people have that of elite overreach coming from the Democrats and that Democrats don’t understand them. So I think that’s a real thing. And I agree with you. What I would say for the Democratic Party is that unless it can overcome that, it’s going to be a minority party. It’s not going to win back the Senate again until it can overcome the rural urban divide. It’s going to have very challenging time, getting a very big margin in the House. It’s going to be challenged in presidential elections and in many state level elections. And that’s consequential just in so many ways. So I mean, it’s problematic for the country. It means that also for rural people that they are subjected to one party government in so many places. If the Democratic Party just decides to throw up our hands, we’re not going to go organize in rural places, which is what’s been happening. It’s really problematic for democracy at so many levels. The way your book is structured, you say there’s this economic divergence and then layered on top of that very quickly is what you call elite overreach. And that’s what we’re talking about here. And the way you describe it is that quote, it was not any one issue that tipped the scales, but rather the persistent commonality that ran across him. From 2008 onward, rural Americans perceived an urban elite that sought to impose itself on far flung places, controlling residents’ lives through New rules and procedures in which they felt they had little voice. And you argue that the issue here was not the policy, but the sense of. Respect or disrespect, of listening or not listening. Of representation or absence of representation. That there was something beneath policy that drove this. Tell me about that. That sense of we are being ruled from afar. Yeah that’s right. It’s illustrated. We illustrate it in the book through a couple of different policy areas. And one is renewable energy, which actually you might find interesting because of the ideas that you explore in abundance. So there’s a fascinating literature of scholars have looked at many different parts of the country. And when wind and solar comes into rural places, which is, of course, where the land is and where you need to develop it, it so often happens without rural communities having a chance to have a voice. So there’ll be a big developer that comes in a company that, cuts a deal with a big landowner. And all of this happens and agreements are made before the local community hears about it. And then people are upset. And as what scholars have found who study very carefully public opinion on environmental issues, and we do as well that there’s not a big difference between rural and urban Americans, in their view on environmental issues. And in fact, a lot of rural people care very deeply about the environment because the land is so important to them, and yet they feel that the process is really problematic. There’s one study that was about wind farms in Indiana and to quote a person in that they quoted, they said, it’s not that I’m against wind energy. I’m against how it was done. Here I found this raised a lot of skepticism for me. I mean, first, I’m not against x where x is clean energy, affordable housing, mass transit. I’m just against how it was done. Here is I feel the most common structure of I’m against x, but in abundance. As you note, I spend a lot of time talking about and researching and reporting on how clean energy projects in particular are sited in different parts of the country. And what I can say for sure is that red states cite different forms, all kinds of different forms of energy, much more easily than blue states do, because they have much less complex and deliberative procedures for siting them. If you want to build a wind farm in Texas, in rural Texas, it is just much easier than building it in rural California or rural New York. And yet, rural Americans are not turning against the government of Texas for the lack of deliberative, consultative, and veto oriented siting. So something about that felt off to me because I would think that would then lead to much more anger in red states, where it is much easier to just plow through a new development than it is in blue states, which have, again, much more veto oriented structures here. It’s very interesting that it’s been easier for Republican governors to roll out these policies. And I would love to look under the hood and find out the dynamics that are happening there. But we don’t do that in our book. What I would say is that it’s problematic to have people in cities who accuse rural people of NIMBYism when renewable energy is needed, particularly by urban people. And so this can be a really extractive kind of industry that just is one more thing that where rural people are taken advantage of and where their needs are not taken into account. I’m getting at something even a little bit larger here than clean energy. One thing that your book just seems to accept, and even talk about is that the attribution of blame for policy is very, very muddy, and it relies a lot on how people get their information and whether they get their information. You talk about a particular study where Republican policies close rural hospitals and people are mad, and Republican vote share goes up in the next election because people blame the party they already don’t like. I could tell a story where people don’t like the renewable energy coming in, and even though it’s coming in more aggressively in red states because of their procedures, nobody knows that much about siting rules. So they’re still blaming the party they see as connected to renewable energy. But there’s something here about how many of the policies that you describe as particularly painful or destructive or irritating to rural America are not promulgated by Democrats, but Democrats get blamed anyway. Yes no. That’s true. And politics is full of paradox. What’s going on there. And we argue, is that there’s another component of our explanation that I haven’t gotten to talk about yet. And that is the organizational component here. The question is, who is on the ground in a place connecting the dots for voters, saying to them, here’s what’s happening in public policy, and here’s how it matters for our community. Here’s the party that is best representing your interests and values. Doing that, connecting of the dots. So political parties need to do this for people. And so in rural places, the Democratic Party has become very weak. And so it’s much harder for them to really be there making the case. And then the Republican Party for the same kinds of reasons that all civic organizations have suffered over time, has had challenging times as well. And yet, it has been helped by other organizations that are prevalent in rural places. So we find that evangelical churches are more occur on a greater per capita basis in rural places, and so do gun groups affiliated with the National Rifle Association. And so those groups have been playing a supportive role to the Republican Party in helping to connect the dots for voters and to get out the vote, essentially. Democrats used to be aided by labor unions in rural places. And that’s really been decimated very much with deindustrialization. I want to actually spend a moment on the media side of this. I’ve talked to Democratic politicians. Barack Obama said this to me once who say that they felt able to run in rural areas in 2000 or 2000 and 8 or 1996, but as depending on the place we’re talking about as talk radio and Rush Limbaugh took hold. Then later as Fox News rolled out. Now we have social media and all these other partisan and hyperpolarized forms of information that they don’t even feel they can get a hearing because the people who are interested in politics, what they are hearing is so angry at Democrats and so polarized that there’s no way to get around it. Well, I have no doubt that the Media Matters. And so in our analysis, we do all this quantitative analysis. And we were limited to the things that we could where we had data for all counties over these many decades. And we didn’t have a way to measure the rise of talk radio. Rush Limbaugh and where are people listening to it. And Fox News and the loss of local newspapers and all of these important changes in the media. And I’m sure they’re important. But this is where Democratic Party organizing is so needed. And crucial. And I remember County chair in Southern Ohio saying, look, there’s no one here shouting from the rooftops back against Fox News. They’re lying to you. And so whether it’s the media or organizations, that’s the problem, that in rural places people aren’t hearing another message very strongly. Political scientists use, I always think the slightly strange tool, the feelings thermometer, where they ask people to rate other groups on a one to 100 scale, and you have this data for white rural Americans. And on a scale of 1 to 100, they put Black Americans at a 70. So pretty good. Hispanic Americans at 67. Gay men at 57. Illegal immigrants at 39. Pretty low. And Democrats at 14 points. So Democrats are rated about actually I mean less well, less than half as highly as illegal immigrants. By the way, this is not just a rural America. White urban Democrats put Republicans at 17 points, but the hatred is much more concentrated at the political outgroup, at least in these measures, than at any other group. Exactly Yeah. So the way we sum this up, if you think of what I was saying earlier about public policy issues and how we don’t differ very much rural and urban Americans on these issues, we barely disagree, but we are bitterly divided and the divide is over partisanship. So in other words, it doesn’t have to be this way. It’s teams, it’s tribalism, but it’s not based in really different views about issues. But it does create then these self-reinforcing dynamics. But it creates anger. I mean, I think about the soft version is maybe Barack Obama’s bitter clingers comment. The harder version is Hillary Clinton’s deplorables comment. It creates I mean, I remember this so strongly from the Bush era, and I see it now when Republicans are in power. Urban liberals do feel threatened do feel like that power is being deployed against them, do feel very angry at what is being done. And then it creates political strategy. Because parties work with limited resources, they have to choose where to put their energy and their attention. In 2016, Chuck Schumer famously says, for every blue collar Democrat we lose in Western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia. And you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin. Now, whether you can repeat that is, I guess, a reasonable question to ask. But you do see the Democratic Party begin to say to itself, we’ve lost rural America throwing good money after bad. There is not worth doing. Let’s try to pick up the suburbs. How do you think about that. Both as a matter of short term and long term political strategy. It’s a losing strategy given what I was saying earlier about the electoral institutions in the United States. A party has to be able to win less populated places if it wants to have national power. FDR really understood this, and contemporary politicians don’t. It’s not the same to pick up those suburban voters. You need to be picking up rural voters. So it’s crucial to build that bridge because otherwise you know you’re not going to win the Senate. The electoral college is an uphill battle. And then when it comes to house districts, we might think, oh, well, that’s not so much an issue. Well, it is because Democratic votes are wasted in effect, because they’re consolidated in densely populated places. And so Republican voters tend to be much more evenly distributed across the landscape. So it’s much easier for Republicans to draw districts that favor them than for Democrats to do so. It would be good if you could do that. But I guess the question I don’t want to put any words in Chuck Schumer’s mouth, but that I would hear from Democrats is can you. One thing you have in the book is quite a few Democrats who used to win rural areas, saying, I couldn’t win that today. Bob kerrey, who was a very successful politician in Nebraska, runs again in Nebraska later on loses easily. Bill Clinton says now, quite a long time ago, I don’t know that I could win in Arkansas anymore. There are a pretty small handful of Democrats. Jared Golden in Maine, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in Washington, who now run in and win pretty rural areas. So while, Yes, you’re of course, given the structure of the American political system, that it would be better if you could have a mixed geographic coalition, is it actually possible or do you just have to work from a place of futility? No, it’s not futile. But what it takes is a long term strategy of deep, full time, year round organizing and listening to rural Americans. Other parties like to put a focus on messaging. Messaging is very surface level, and it does not have enduring effects. But organizing really matters. And an illustration of this. We were talking earlier about Congress the basic pattern from 1994 to the present is that rural places have elected Republicans. But in the middle of that time, things went in a different way. And that was when Howard Dean became the head of the Democratic National Committee, 2005 through 2008. And his strategy was to work hard in all 50 states, and particularly to organize in rural counties. Some of the County party chairs that I interviewed still remember how well organized they were at that time. And then Barack Obama comes along, and uses similar kinds of organizing strategies, and it really makes a difference. So 2006 Democrats take back Congress. And then in 2008, Barack Obama wins. And he does very well in rural places. And so with that kind of organizing, you can turn things around. But if you’re just going to rely on messaging, it’s not going to happen. So then how do you tell the story of what happens after 2008? And I’ll say I am I respect Howard Dean’s 50 state strategy, and I don’t think the Democratic Party did great organizing in the coming years. But there is a collapse in Democratic support after Barack Obama becomes president that I don’t think is explicable by organizing. It is a genuine collapse. 2010 is a Wipeout for Democrats in much of rural America. And I think a lot of Democrats I know they say that it’s that Barack Obama was Black, That is their basic view of what happened. I don’t think it’s your view of what happened, but what is your view of what happened. Let me speak about both things about. Was it because Barack Obama was Black. And then also what happened. So a lot of people think the rural urban divide is reducible to racism. We find that when it started in the 1990s, that was not the case. There was plenty of racism in the country among non-Hispanic whites, but it was as prevalent among urban Americans as among rural Americans. Then you get to the period 2008 to 2020, and at that point, we find that there is a slightly greater concentration of racist attitudes among rural Americans than urban. One factor among several that is driving the divide at that point. The way we understand it is part of the resentment of the Democratic Party because rural people feel that they’re not understanding our communities. These Democratic leaders, but they’re really working hard on behalf of urban communities, people of color and immigrants, but they don’t really understand us. And So it’s a factor. But it’s not a sole cause. But what is really important is that then after you had all that organizing energy that gets mobilized in the period from 2005 to 2008, Barack Obama gets elected. And there’s a lot of rural people who are who’ve worked hard in the campaign, and they’re really excited and they want to do more. And then what happens is that basically the ball is dropped by the Democratic Party and it becomes just a mailing list of the DNC, and it all goes into the ether. And then Meanwhile, the Tea Party mobilizes among the Republicans and they claim the day. But it didn’t have to be this way. It was not inevitable. There’s a quite big but also somewhat subtle distinction between anti-black attitudes causing the anger and the sense that the Democratic Party is prioritizing other groups over you, causing anger. White rural America’s sense. The Democratic Party sees all these other groups as in need help and respect, and C and is prioritizing them ahead of them. Arlie Hochschild’s idea about other groups are getting to cut in line. And then there’s a real rise of discourse around white privilege. And this creates I mean, we’ve seen this in our politics. A lot of anger, right. You’re telling me, in a poor community that has very few jobs now where life expectancy is going down, that I have white privilege. And your urban Coalition is what needs the help or illegal immigrants need the help. I’d like you to talk a bit about that distinction between the divide being discriminatory and the divide being a feeling that coalition doesn’t prioritize me. So I’m going to go with a coalition that does. Yeah I think it’s a really important issue in that I think a lot of urban Democrats assume that what’s at play in this rural urban divide is that rural white people are racist. And what we find is that it’s not reducible to that. But the way we understand it is, it’s in the same period that, as we’re saying, there’s the sense of elite overreach on the part of Democrats and where rural Americans are looking at the Democratic Party and thinking they don’t understand us, they don’t care about our communities. And on this, they’re seeing that the Democratic Party, they’re viewing the Democratic Party as really prioritizing the needs of people of color in urban communities and immigrants, but not really understanding or caring about rural people who are struggling as well. So into this moment of divide steps of all people, Donald Trump, who is, I would say, more associated with New York City than any human being alive, is almost himself an emblem of New York City. How does he become this vehicle for the channeling of rural rage. Well, I think about this Republican County chair that we interviewed in Southern Ohio. The area had had voted for Bill Clinton twice and for Democrats, for Congress. But then the economy really goes downhill. The loss of all these jobs, closing of all these plants. And what he said was people got tired of government. And then he said, along comes Donald Trump. And yet he’s rich and he’s done all these things, but he got people really excited here, he said. And he said, why are you kowtowing down to these elites. They’re not like you referring to. This is Trump referring to Democrats. And of course, it’s ironic because, as you’re saying, Trump himself is an elite and he’s urban, et cetera. But people felt that there was an affinity that Trump was hearing them, that they had been left behind, that they hadn’t been listened to. And so he was channeling that grievance and resentment. Trump hates all the right people. That’s a way of putting it. But that’s a powerful force in politics. I mean, we were talking earlier about elites, and one of the things I was saying was that both parties have elites, and I mean, Hillary Clinton, who runs against Donald Trump in 2016. Her political background is in Arkansas. She’s first lady of Arkansas and has a lot of experience alongside her husband and in a state with much more rural concerns than being a real estate developer in New York City and a guy who builds golf courses. But Trump in his campaign just hates like the urban elites in the cities. And that is a stronger building of affinity, it seems to me, than more traditional. Identity right. I think if Bill Clinton had run against Donald Trump in 2016, Bill Clinton, with all of his skill as a politician, weaving together concerns of rural and urban residents. I don’t think there’s any doubt Donald Trump would have beat him in rural America, whether he would have beat him, I don’t but I think he would have beat him in rural America because Bill Clinton, by that point, no longer hated, never did, in fact, hate the right people. And I think that raises some really difficult questions for what builds or degrades affinity when you’re trying to rebuild these relationships. I think Democrats want to believe they can do it all through positive sum policy. Obamacare can help rural hospitals. And the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill can try to do rural broadband and cite factories in rural America. And it seems to me that so long as there is not a preexisting sense of affinity, it’s all going to fall flat politically. Well, Donald Trump has been masterful at reinforcing and widening the divide that was already growing right and creating this us versus them politics and demonizing people on the other side. And so that makes it harder and harder to build affinity. And yet it’s the only hope now, most of my scholarship until a few years ago was all about public policy and what policy can do. But I think we’re at a point now where these divides are so great that policy can’t do it all by itself. Of course, rural places really need policies in all sorts of ways to help with the economy and with health care and education, et cetera. But it’s really crucial to find ways to bridge the divide. And that’s where deep long term organizing is so important. Is there a way right now with Trump, in which you are seeing the rise of the most dangerous possible version of this divide, which is to say, not a divide on policy, not different votes, but a move towards violence. I’ve heard a lot of people who study civil wars say it is a bad sign when the federal government is ordering armed troops from some states into other states over the objections of those states governors. And these are all cities that are ordering them into those cities, mayors. And you can look at this and I think I have been looking at this and say, this sure looks like a rural coalition militarily occupying the cities whom it has come to see as the power centers of their enemies. Well, it’s unthinkable. It’s so un-American to be telling the military you can use cities as training grounds and to be sending in federal troops and federalized National Guard into cities. And this comes on top of Trump for the past few years using a lot of rhetoric against cities, but now using actual violent force against cities. So how is this possible. It’s possible because of the rural urban divide. It’s possible because this US versus them. Politics has become so deep. Do you feel as a political scientist. I mean, your last book was about threats to democracy and authoritarianism. I mean, do you think we are coming a lot closer to something that could spiral into Civil War or something like it. Well, that’s a really horrifying, harrowing thought, obviously. But my colleagues who are scholars of comparative politics, who study Democratic deterioration around the world have been very worried because they see the things happening here that have happened elsewhere and led to such demise. My focus as someone who is always hopeful about the future is, how do we avoid that. And it’s going to take a lot of deep rebuilding and organizing. Let’s talk about how we avoid that or begin to reverse some of the urban rural split. Let’s take as a premise what you say is right, that it would be good if the Democratic Party invested much more in organizing and contesting in rural areas. I was surprised, as I read the end of the book, that you did not have more to say about who the Democratic Party runs, particularly nationally, and what they run on. I would assume you could tell me if you think this is wrong. It is going to be easier for an organizer in much of rural America if it’s Andy Beshear on top of the ticket, than if it’s Gavin Newsom or Kamala Harris that it was in some ways easier when it was, when the Democratic Party was led by Harry Reid and Tom Daschle in the Senate. And now both of the Congressional leaders are from New York. The political scientist Steve Talley likes to talk about costly signals. The sending of costly signals, things where you’re doing something that show you’re a different kind of Democrat or Republican than others are. Donald Trump sends lots of costly signals. He attacks urban America and urban elites in personal, vicious, vitriolic terms. He talks about sending the National Guard into their cities. He’s talked about that for a long time, and he takes the conflict because it communicates to the people he wants to communicate to that he’s on their side. Yeah if the Democratic Party really wanted to do this right, if it said, this is a we have to figure something out here. And that requires doing things that are different than what we have been doing. What can it do. So at the moment, Trump has done very well getting elected in rural places by bigger and bigger margins. Fueled by grievance. But grievance ultimately does not put food on the table. It doesn’t bring you health care, affordable health care in your community. And it doesn’t help you to your kids to get a good education. Democrats need to be in rural places to say these issues are the priorities of our party, to help with the economy, health care, education, et cetera and to be there to make those connections for people if they’re not there, if they’re not campaigning there, if statewide Democrats are not going to rural places to campaign, if the party is not putting full time organizers in rural places, then people feel abandoned there and they feel this party doesn’t care about us. I guess one place where I was skeptical goal of yearbooks insistence that policy wasn’t a big contributor here was that most of the modern politicians who you talked about who had been successful in rural America, were known not just for their moderation but for the Democratic politicians. I mean, not just for moderation but for often running against the Democratic Party. Joe Manchin, who in his first Senate campaign shoots the cap and trade bill Democrats are considering with a gun to show what a different kind of Democrat he is. Ben Nelson in Nebraska, who is such a thorn in the side of the Democrats during Obamacare. The same with Congressman Stupak. Bob kerrey, who was often very annoying to the Democratic Party when he was a representative from Nebraska, John Bel Edwards, who was the governor of Louisiana until pretty recently a Democrat, very, very, very pro-life. And, I mean, it looked to me and it looks to me like the Democrats who have done well in rural areas, actually do differ from other Democrats on policy. Jared Golden is a supporter of tariffs. Ray Gluesenkamp Perez is a very different kind of politics and policy than her colleagues. I don’t know if what is happening here is that shifting on policy is a way of communicating. You’re not like the other Democrats, or if it is actually the policy itself that matters. But it felt like attention to me in your book that on the one hand, the Democratic politicians who’ve succeeded in rural America and still succeed look on policy very different than the Democrats in urban America. And on the other hand, there was a real push that they don’t need to do anything on policy. They just need more organizers. I would say, looking at the members of Congress for whom, we took kind of a deep dive and the Affordable Care Act to look at all these rural members, many of whom were swing votes on the Affordable Care Act. But most of them ultimately voted for it. And some chose some of the rural Democrats ultimately voted against it. But some of them were very progressive on economic issues. And they were trying very hard to be faithful to their communities in that some of them, as you say, were pro-life and not pro-choice. And so they had concerns until there was a deal cut on how the Aca would handle abortion. But I would say, while incorporating rural districts and states may mean more moderates, it doesn’t necessarily mean that because some rural places, a politician will represent them in a way that’s more progressive. And that’s being true to their constituents. Have we seen any of that in modern times. I mean, I would like that to be true. It would be, from my perspective, better if you could just go full economic populist and moderate on nothing else and win. And my leftist friends tell me That’s true and I just don’t see the representatives. I mean, even somebody like Dan Osborn in Nebraska, who runs not as a Democrat because the Democratic Party is just too toxic to run on in Nebraska. He is economically populist. And he also says, I will build the wall on the border with my own hands. He swings very far right from where Democrats are at that moment on immigration. I just don’t see the examples of these Democrats winning back or even non-democrats independents somehow winning back rural areas without running against some parts of the Democratic party’s platform from the right. And I’m not saying this because I would like to see more Democrats move to the right, but I think that seems to be what has worked. I think it’s less moderating on issues than what issues you prioritize. I think that what the political party, County chairs that we spoke to told us is that the issues that are most important to people are the economy, health care, education, et cetera they were not mentioning gun rights and abortion and immigration as top issues. So it’s a matter of the level of priority that you give those, but also different kinds of. Stances in different places could work. So I guess that raises the question of what happened to all those Democratic representatives who did run in exactly that way. I have watched some of the Democratic politicians doing that just not be able to survive. Sherrod Brown is a very effective economic populist, and despite how much he has emphasized that set of issues for his entire career, he has gone from being extremely competitive in Ohio’s rural districts to completely destroy in them. When he was running against a car dealer who had had to settle a bunch of wage theft lawsuits. But the same is true for Jon Tester in Montana. Tester was, again, a very, very capable bread and butter pocketbook issues politician that something has happened where the politicians who are doing the strategy to a T cannot survive, not even in the most conservative states. Montana and Ohio are far from the reddest states we have in the union now. And it just seems to me that we are seeing that the drag of the National Democratic Party is making the just talk about the popular stuff strategy no longer viable, when maybe 10 years ago or 12 years ago, it was still viable. Yeah, I think, what I’ve been describing is this historical process over several decades of how the rural urban divide emerged. And it’s now very deep, and it’s the causes for it are multilayered and entrenched. So you can’t just overcome it with a particular race. There has to be this deep, long term effort to rebuild bridges to rural America by the Democratic Party being there. And you know that when we spoke with Democratic County chairs in all of these different states, they would say to us that they didn’t feel supported by their state level party, and they didn’t think the DNC even knew about them. These are local organizations where in the past there were lots of people who had come out for meetings. Now it’s a handful of people and they’re senior citizens and they need support. But they did feel that when Howard Dean was the head of the DNC, they were getting that kind of support. And they were able to make a real difference. So that’s what’s essential. It’s also the case that while it can seem really daunting in a statewide election, giving some support to rural areas can make a big difference. If you use the strategy of losing by less, which is something they all talk about. There were County chairs like when we went around Georgia and they’d had these very tight races statewide, the Senate, Senate races where senators Ossoff and Warnock got elected and the Democratic County chairs would say, if I can get my margin here to not be just 34 percent but get it up to 37 percent for the Democratic candidate. And if everybody does that in rural areas, we’re going to win statewide. And they did it. And they felt very proud of it. And they felt they made a big difference in getting those candidates over the finish line in those very tight races. And that’s exactly the kind of thing that can make a huge difference in statewide races. For president and for governorships and for senators all across the country. Our final question what are three books you’d recommend to the audience. Oh, yeah, I love this question. So I want to recommend first, another book about rural America by a political scientist. And that’s Catherine Kramer’s book “The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin” and the rise of Scott Walker. This book came out several years ago in 2016. It’s based on years of her going to all sorts of conversation groups around rural Wisconsin, and really listening to people and understanding how they were thinking about politics in the state. And so it’s deeply insightful. And we really built upon her work. But then for my other choices, I decided we shouldn’t just be reading nonfiction in this time. I feel strongly about that. So my second choice is going to be a novel, and that is Barbara Kingsolver’s book, “Demon Copperhead.” And Barbara Kingsolver grew up in rural Kentucky, and she writes this book that’s really based in Appalachia. And I think just really helps people to understand much more the nuance and complexity of what’s going on in one place in rural America. And then finally, I found that this year, well, when I was a young person, I loved poetry a lot. And this year I decided I need more poetry back in my life. So I have been reading Mary Oliver’s book “Devotions,” which is a collection of a lot of her best work. She grew up in rural Ohio, and then she lived a lot of her life on Cape Cod. And it’s about the beauty of natural places. And I think it’s also a great tribute to rural America. Suzanne Mettler, Thank you very much. Great to be with you.

“Now, data centers are consuming hundreds of megawatts at a time.” “You have this large mismatch between not just the willingness to pay but also the speed and volume at which these data centers want to interconnect,” he added.
The grid includes Loudoun County in Virginia, home to almost 200 data centers — the largest market for hyperscale data centers in the world.
Utilities are telling PJM they expect even more electricity demand from data centers.
“When [data centers] do come online, they’re going to contribute by paying for the system,” Lapp said.","Your electricity bill is rising. Naturally, you’re mad about it and looking around at who to blame. But it’s not a who, it’s a what — and the recent AI-driven data center construction spree is at least partly the reason why.

Copious data centers have sprung up across the United States, nearly doubling in number between 2021 and 2024, with no end in sight to their rapid spread. According to consulting firm McKinsey & Company, companies are projected to spend $1.6 trillion on data center hardware in the US by 2030.

It’s not just the existing facilities that are creating heftier bills; even data centers that have yet to be built are driving up power prices today.

These imposing, flat-walled, near-windowless buildings are filled with processors, hard drives, and memory chips that devour electrons. Today, some of the biggest tech companies in the world are now racing each other to secure more computing facilities and the energy to power them as they scramble to dominate the AI sector. BloombergNEF, an energy research firm, estimates that data centers will consume more than double their current share of electricity by 2035, accounting for nearly 9 percent of all US electricity demand. The US Department of Energy last year projected that data centers could devour upward of 12 percent of the country’s total electricity production as soon as 2028.

Key Takeaways

Household electricity bills are climbing across the US, partly because of the explosion of power-hungry data centers.

Tech companies are scrambling to lock in more electricity for their planned computing facilities, even ones that might never get built.

That rush for energy is already driving up today’s power and infrastructure costs.

Maryland’s consumer advocate says it’s time for grid operators to step in and stop this kind of energy speculation before it hits customers even harder.

“Large loads have always existed, but they tended to be much smaller. A large load might be 10 to 50 megawatts,” said Pieter Mul, an associate partner at PA Consulting. “Now, data centers are consuming hundreds of megawatts at a time.”

“You have this large mismatch between not just the willingness to pay but also the speed and volume at which these data centers want to interconnect,” he added. “It’s running at a pace far ahead of the supply’s ability to meet that load.”

And that mismatch is a recipe for soaring electricity prices.

Last week, Maryland state’s legal representative for utility customers sent a letter to its regional grid operator, PJM, asking them to halt a “land rush” for electricity from data centers that is increasing power bills for households.

Marylanders are getting unhappier about their power bills, and this request is a significant escalation in the consumer-driven backlash against the rapid expansion of the tech industry’s footprint.

Maryland’s ratepayers — like most of us — are paying for the data center buildout

Advocates on behalf of Maryland’s ratepayers finally pushed back after, earlier this year, an auction for power capacity to meet peak demand in PJM’s territory set a new record high price, soaring 22 percent above its previous peak. And they are already starting to raise monthly bills by about $16.

PJM is an important part of the US energy system. It’s the largest power grid operator in the US, serving 67 million people across 13 states and Washington, DC. And it’s also a global hotspot for this expanding tech. The grid includes Loudoun County in Virginia, home to almost 200 data centers — the largest market for hyperscale data centers in the world.

Utilities are telling PJM they expect even more electricity demand from data centers. According to Maryland’s Office of People’s Counsel, PJM’s forecast for load growth by 2030 has nearly doubled compared to its previous forecast. The costs of building the infrastructure to support these new data centers are already getting baked into power prices, including in places that have seen little benefit from the race for more computing power.

“It’s totally unfair,” said David Lapp, who serves as People’s Counsel for Maryland. “All the laws and regulations that we have are set up for an entirely different scale and scope of growth and electricity demand, so we’re dealing with essentially antiquated rules.”

Lapp explained that tech companies are shopping around for favorable electricity prices from different utilities, trying to buy up as much power as they can at low prices. Those utilities, in turn, are telling grid operators like PJM how much electricity they’re going to need in the future. Just the speculation of increasing energy demand in the future is setting off a scramble for power that’s already manifesting in higher prices for ordinary people.

But it’s unlikely that all of those data centers are going to get built, especially if the AI boom turns out to be a bubble or as companies consolidate. Some tech companies may also be soliciting electricity bids from multiple utilities for the same data center, so there may be some double-counting driving up demand forecasts, as well. And even the facilities that do get built may not need all the electricity that they requested as computing hardware gets more efficient.

This all means that ordinary households will end up holding the bag for the new power generators and transmission lines intended to support data center demand that may never arise.

And all of this could be very expensive for ordinary people. In other power markets with a lot of new data centers in recent years — places such as Phoenix and Chicago — monthly wholesale electricity prices rose 267 percent.

Can data center energy speculation be reined in?

By raising the alarm about how predictions of future energy needs are making things more expensive now, Lapp is hoping to start the process of creating reforms in PJM to keep prices under control.

In an emailed statement, PJM spokesperson Jeffrey Shields told Vox that the grid operator agrees that it’s crucial to try to get as accurate a picture of demand growth as possible. Unfortunately, that’s a tough thing to do. PJM doesn’t directly interact with power customers. That’s the job of utilities, and they need to be the ones tracking how much power their users actually need.

For its part, PJM is working on ways to get a sharper picture of the future, including requiring data center developers to disclose the full scale of their projects in multiple areas and developing a more thorough review process for requests for more power.

Once they’re online, data centers can actually be a boon for the power grid. They’re ratepayers, too, and their bills can start paying back the costs of the new infrastructure, which can boost reliability across the grid. Data centers don’t necessarily have to run flat out all the time, and many come equipped with their own backup power systems, so they can be optimized to run when power is especially cheap and help make the grid more stable on balance. Some tech companies are also constructing their own generators to keep their giant boxes humming. But that’s only if they get built at all.

“When [data centers] do come online, they’re going to contribute by paying for the system,” Lapp said. “But if half of them don’t come online, then there’s going to have been a lot of costs that are incurred. … Those costs get shifted onto existing customers, so existing customers are taking on a ton of risk with these forecasts.”

There is a key way to lower the power bill for ordinary people, though. Julia Kortrey, deputy state policy director at Evergreen Action, a climate policy advocacy group, said one way to limit electricity speculation is to force tech companies to put more skin in the game.

“We can put incentives like requiring data center developers to put down a deposit or some type of financial commitment,” Kortrey said. “That would help reduce the number of double proposals or over-speculation.” Shields, the PJM spokesperson, said the grid operator is working on recommendations for utilities to “require financial commitments from large load customers based on the additional capacity PJM is required to acquire on their behalf.”

Consumer electricity prices are still likely to rise further, and more power-chugging data centers will crop up, but tamping down on rampant speculation of future demand could make power bills more manageable.

Otherwise, rising energy prices will be an even bigger drag on the economy, and more people will struggle to keep the lights on.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-2223681402.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.737892056687%2C100%2C78.524215886627&w=1200,N,,2025-10-22 00:58:30.997704

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright gave Venture Global VG final approval on Tuesday to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its CP2 plant, under construction in Louisiana, to countries that do not have a free trade agreement with the U.S.

The approval will allow Venture Global to export 28 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) or 3.96 billion cubic feet per day of U.S. natural gas to so called non-Free Trade Agreement (FTA) countries.

""In less than ten months, President Trump's administration is redefining what it means to unleash American energy by approving record new LNG exports,"" said Kyle Haustveit, Assistant Secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy.

Venture Global is the second-largest U.S. exporter of LNG and when the CP2 plant is complete could leapfrog Cheniere Energy LNG and become the largest U.S. exporter of the super-chilled gas.

""We look forward to continue advancing the project safely and quickly to bring new LNG to the global market at a record pace beginning in 2027,"" Venture Global's CEO Mike Sabel said in a statement to Reuters.

Companies need permission to export LNG to non-FTA countries. The majority of buyers in Europe and Asia do not have free trade agreements with the U.S.

In 2024, the U.S. under former President Joe Biden paused issuing of non-FTA export permits to LNG developers so it could study the environmental and economic impact of more U.S. export of LNG.

The Trump administration reversed that decision.

In order to qualify, your solar system must have “expenditures made” by December 31st, 2025. While interpretations of “expenditures made” vary, the safest option is to have your system installed and operating by December 31st, 2025. If utility delays prevent full interconnection, you may still qualify as long as installation is complete. Keep all receipts and installation records in case of an IRS audit. Here is Energy Sage’s FAQ with more information.

If you purchased a solar system either with cash or a solar loan, you are eligible for this tax credit (if you sign a solar lease or PPA for the system, you are ineligible).

If you do not have a large enough tax bill to claim the entire credit in one year, then one will receive credits equal to their tax liability.

Costs that are eligible for the tax credit include solar panels, additional solar equipment (e.g. inverters, wiring, mounting hardware), labor costs for installation, and energy storage systems. Costs that are ineligible for the tax credit include roof repairs, roof replacements, or tree trimming or removal.

The SMART program is an incentive program for solar projects in Massachusetts, which provides compensation for solar projects if they meet certain criteria.

There is still some allocation in SMART 2.0, but SMART 3.0 is the most recent version of the program that is currently in development and is expected to come out soon.

To qualify for SMART 3.0, a project must provide documentation to show that on-site construction did NOT begin before June 20, 2025, but the current SMART 2.0 program will remain open for applications until December 21, 2026. To qualify for that, the project must provide documentation to show that on-site construction began before December 31, 2025.

Most residential projects would most likely be under 25 kW, and those projects will have a fixed incentive level of $0.03/kWh under SMART 3.0. Projects under 25 kW that serve low-income customers will have a fixed incentive level of $0.06/kWh.

Net metering is a renewable rate program in Massachusetts that allows customers to offset their energy use and transfer energy back to their electric companies via their systems in exchange for a bill credit.

One must be serviced by Eversource, National Grid, or Unitil to participate in net metering.

Customers who net meter are billed for their net consumption of electricity, which is calculated by the total electricity consumed in a month subtracted by the total electricity generated in a month.

If your net consumption is positive, meaning your electricity generated covers only a portion of your consumption, you would pay the remaining balance to your electric company. The energy generated would show up as a net meter credit subtracted from your balance.

If your net consumption is negative, you would not owe anything as the net metering credit would appear on your bill.

Net metering credits do not expire and will roll over to the next billing period.

Net metering is a renewable rate program in Rhode Island that allows customers to offset their energy use and transfer energy back to the electric company via their systems in exchange for a bill credit. Participants can receive bill credits for up to 125% of the on-site consumption during a billing period.

One must be serviced by Rhode Island Energy to participate in net metering.

Customers who net meter are billed for their net consumption of electricity, which is calculated by the total electricity consumed in a month subtracted by the total electricity generated in a month.

If your net consumption is positive, meaning your electricity generated covers only a portion of your consumption, you would pay the remaining balance to your electric company. The energy generated would show up as a net meter credit subtracted from your balance.

If your net consumption is negative, you would not owe anything as the net metering credit would appear on your bill.

You cannot participate both in net metering and the Renewable Energy Growth (REG) program.

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google are all known for announcing long-term renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) to finance clean energy projects and use credits to offset their energy emission profiles.
Under PPAs companies rarely receive the energy directly, but the investment does not help finance construction and commissioning of utility-scale renewable energy projects.
“For example, Google boasts that it is not only “advocating for [clean] energy policies,” it is also using its “purchasing demand to accelerate the commercialization of advanced [clean energy] technologies” and “prioritizing clean energy procurement.” Misleadingly carbon-free to lock up nuclear and lock out consumers?
The Republican attorneys general say this is misleading and has forced the closure of reliable power plants both coal-fired and nuclear.","Attorney generals for 16 states which voted for President Trump in the last presidential election are challenging the four of the nation's biggest internet technology companies over the latter’s claims of using renewable energy credits to be powered 100% by clean energy.

The letter written to legal leadership at Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google decried the companies’ alleged use of “environmental accounting gimmicks” to claim decarbonization goals are being met. None of the four have been charged in a case releated to the letter, but the attorneys general are expressing skepticism and alleging misleading actions.

The Sept. 24 letterhead was topped by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, but included signing by his counterparts in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Iowa, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google are all known for announcing long-term renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs) to finance clean energy projects and use credits to offset their energy emission profiles. Under PPAs companies rarely receive the energy directly, but the investment does not help finance construction and commissioning of utility-scale renewable energy projects.

The Republican state attorneys general are skeptical, to say the least, noting the utility grid in the U.S. is about 60% powered by carbon rich resources such as natural gas and coal. Some 30% is powered by nuclear, hydro, wind and solar, which are considered carbon-free at the point of generation.

A 2025 report by World Resources Institute contradicts the attorneys general contention that renewable PPAs do not decarbonize the U.S. energy landscape, noting that more than 400 GW of solar, wind and battery storage have been deployed nationwide. Many of these large-scale renewable energy farms capable of 100 MW and above were financed at least partially with PPA commitment of companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google.

“These upward trends signal that clean electricity sources are an increasingly vital part of the U.S. economy and power system, with renewable sources and battery storage making up the vast majority of new additions to the grid,” the WRI report reads.

Renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, sans the balancing impact of battery storage, can be intermittent since, as many have noted, “the wind does not always blow, and the sun does not always shine.”

Sixteen of the nation’s Republican state attorneys general argue that this intermittency is a key negative factor on the resiliency of the grid. Indeed, the American Society of Civil Engineers graded U.S. energy infrastructure at a lowly D+ earlier this year in its quadrennial report card but blamed much of that on aging equipment which is not upgraded to deal with 21st century challenges.

The states’ elected and appointed legal minds say that it’s renewable energy’s fault, or certainly that of Big Tech companies purporting to use those resources.

“When Big Tech companies claim to use 100% renewable energy, they pressure utilities to move away from fossil-fuel-generated baseload power to attract or retain big tech data center development,” reads the AGs’ letter, quoting other sources. “For example, Google boasts that it is not only “advocating for [clean] energy policies,” it is also using its “purchasing demand to accelerate the commercialization of advanced [clean energy] technologies” and “prioritizing clean energy procurement.”

Misleadingly carbon-free to lock up nuclear and lock out consumers?

Certainly, the looming rise of data center and AI load growth is pushing digital infrastructure entities to seek more flexible and baseload power resources such as conventional nuclear and small modular reactors of the future. The 16 state attorneys argue that these companies are locking up more “reliable” power while potentially locking normal customers out.

“Big tech’s efforts to lock up nuclear power are necessary for tech companies to actually meet their net-zero commitments—commitments which are currently propped up by misleading climate marketing based on unbundled REC use,” the letter reads. “But if these sources of reliable power are reserved for tech companies, Americans will be left with less reliable energy.”

All four of the companies have previously announced net-zero goals in line with the Paris Accords, while some companies say they have achieved net zero in Scope 1 emissions. The Republican attorneys general say this is misleading and has forced the closure of reliable power plants both coal-fired and nuclear.

Some utility and power generation entities are reopening or keeping open certain nuclear plants thanks to long-term nuclear PPAs with firms such as Microsoft and Meta.

President Trump and some of his executive branch agencies such as the Department of Energy and Interior have withdrawn funding for billions of dollars in previously approved and sometimes under-construction renewable energy projects.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/10/68f7e2ebcb9532299c8faa54-renewables_rec_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-21 22:59:04.420053

Hedging

As at 30 September 2025, delivered approximately 83% of the 30 MMboe of 2025 oil production that was previously hedged at an average price of $78.7 per barrel.

The realised value of all hedged positions for the period ended 30 September 2025 is an estimated pre-tax profit of $139 million, with a $135 million profit related to oil price hedges offset by a $16 million loss related to Corpus Christi hedges, and a $20 million profit related to other hedge positions. Hedging profits will be included in ‘other income’ except hedging profits related to interest rate swaps which will be included in ‘finance income’ in the financial statements.

Funding and liquidity

As at 30 September 2025, Woodside had liquidity of approximately $8,300 million.

Embedded commodity derivative

In 2023, Woodside entered into a revised long-term gas sale and purchase contract with Perdaman. A component of the selling price is linked to the price of urea, creating an embedded commodity derivative in the contract. The fair value of the embedded derivative is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

As there is no long-term urea forward curve, Title Transfer Facilities (TTF) continues to be used as a proxy to simulate the value of the derivative over the life of the contract.

For the quarter ended 30 September 2025, an unrealised loss of approximately $15 million is expected to be recognised through other income.

Capital Markets Day

Woodside’s Capital Markets Day 2025 will be held on Wednesday, 5 November 2025, commencing at 9:30 AEDT / 6:30 AWST / 16:30 CST (Tuesday, 4 November 2025).

All statements, other than statements of historical or present facts, are forward-looking statements and generally may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as ‘guidance’, ‘foresee’, ‘likely’, ‘potential’, ‘anticipate’, ‘believe’, ‘aim’, ‘aspire’, ‘estimate’, ‘expect’, intend’, ‘may’, ‘target’, ‘plan’, ‘strategy’, ‘forecast’, ‘outlook’, ‘project’, ‘schedule’, ‘will’, ‘should’, ‘seek’, and other similar words or expressions. Similarly, statements that describe the objectives, plans, goals or expectations of Woodside are forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements in this report are not guarantees or predictions of future events or performance, but are in the nature of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions. Those statements and any assumptions on which they are based are subject to change without notice and are subject to inherent known and unknown risks, uncertainties, contingencies and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Woodside, its related bodies corporate and their respective officers, directors, employees, advisers or representatives. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and assumptions on which they are based include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in commodity prices, actual demand for Woodside’s products, currency fluctuations, geotechnical factors, drilling and production results, gas commercialisation, development progress, operating results, engineering estimates, reserve and resource estimates, loss of market, industry competition, sustainability and environmental risks, climate related transition and physical risks, changes in accounting, standards, economic and financial markets conditions in various countries and regions, political risks, the actions of third parties, project delay or advancement, regulatory approvals, the impact of armed conflict and political instability (such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East) on economic activity and oil and gas supply and demand, cost estimates, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including but not limited to those related to the imposition of tariffs and other trade restrictions, and the effect of future regulatory or legislative actions on Woodside or the industries in which it operates, including potential changes to tax laws, and the impact of general economic conditions, inflationary conditions, prevailing exchange rates and interest rates and conditions in financial markets and risks associated with acquisitions, mergers, divestitures and joint ventures, including difficulties integrating or separating businesses, uncertainty associated with financial projections, restructuring, increased costs and adverse tax consequences, and uncertainties and liabilities associated with acquired and divested properties and businesses.

A more detailed summary of the key risks relating to Woodside and its business can be found in the “Risk” section of Woodside’s most recent Annual Report released to the Australian Securities Exchange and in Woodside’s most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the Woodside website at https://www.woodside.com/investors/reports-investor-briefings. You should review and have regard to these risks when considering the information contained in this report.

If any of the assumptions on which a forward-looking statement is based were to change or be found to be incorrect, this would likely cause outcomes to differ from the statements made in this report.

All forward-looking statements contained in this report reflect Woodside’s views held as at the date of this report and, except as required by applicable law, Woodside does not intend to, undertake to, or assume any obligation to, provide any additional information or update or revise any of these statements after the date of this report, either to make them conform to actual results or as a result of new information, future events, changes in Woodside’s expectations or otherwise.

Investors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Actual results or performance may vary materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. None of Woodside nor any of its related bodies corporate, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, advisers or representatives, nor any person named in this report or involved in the preparation of the information in this report, makes any representation, assurance, guarantee or warranty (either express or implied) as to the accuracy or likelihood of fulfilment of any forward-looking statement, or any outcomes, events or results expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement in this report. Past performance (including historical financial and operational information) is given for illustrative purposes only. It should not be relied on as, and is not necessarily, a reliable indicator of future performance, including future security prices.

Other important information

All figures are Woodside share for the quarter ending 30 September 2025, unless otherwise stated.

All references to dollars, cents or $ in this report are to US currency, unless otherwise stated.

References to “Woodside” may be references to Woodside Energy Group Ltd and/or its applicable subsidiaries (as the context requires).

Notes to petroleum reserves and resources

The petroleum resource estimates are quoted as at the effective date of 30 September 2025, net Woodside share. For details of Woodside’s year end 2024 reserves position, see the Reserves and Resources Statement included in the 2024 Annual Report. US Investors should refer to “Additional information for US investors concerning reserves and resources estimates” below.

All numbers are internal estimates produced by Woodside. Estimates of reserves and contingent resources should be regarded only as estimates that may change over time as additional information becomes available.

The reference point is deﬁned as the outlet of the floating production storage and offloading facility (FPSO).

‘Reserves’ are estimated quantities of petroleum that have been demonstrated to be producible from known accumulations in which the company has a material interest from a given date forward, at commercial rates, under presently anticipated production methods, operating conditions, prices, and costs. Woodside reports reserves inclusive of all fuel consumed in operations. Woodside estimates and reports its proved reserves in accordance with SEC regulations which are also compliant with the 2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)/World Petroleum Council (WPC)/American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG)/Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (SPEE) Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) (SPE-PRMS) guidelines. SEC-compliant proved reserves estimates use a more restrictive, rules-based approach and are generally lower than estimates prepared solely in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines due to, among other things, the requirement to use commodity prices based on the average of first of month prices during the 12-month period in the reporting company’s fiscal year. Woodside estimates and reports its proved plus probable reserves in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines which are not compliant with SEC regulations.

Assessment of the economic value in support of an SPE-PRMS (2018) reserves and resources classification, uses Woodside Portfolio Economic Assumptions (Woodside PEAs). The Woodside PEAs are reviewed on an annual basis, or more often if required. The review is based on historical data and forecast estimates for economic variables such as product prices and exchange rates. The Woodside PEAs are approved by the Woodside Board. Specific contractual arrangements for individual projects are also taken into account.

Woodside uses both deterministic and probabilistic methods for the estimation of reserves and contingent resources at the field and project levels. All proved reserves estimates have been estimated using deterministic methods and reported on a net interest basis in accordance with the SEC regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X.

‘MMboe’ means millions (106) of barrels of oil equivalent. Natural gas volumes are converted to oil equivalent volumes via a constant conversion factor, which for Woodside is 5.7 Bcf of dry gas per 1 MMboe. All volumes are reported at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).

‘Proved reserves’ are those quantities of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating contracts, and government regulations. Proved reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest basis in accordance with the SEC regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X.

‘Undeveloped reserves’ are those reserves for which wells and facilities have not been installed or executed but are expected to be recovered through future significant investments.

‘Probable reserves’ are those reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. Proved plus probable reserves represent the best estimate of recoverable quantities. Where probabilistic methods are used, there is at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves. Proved plus probable reserves are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and are not compliant with SEC regulations.

The estimates of petroleum reserves and contingent resources are based on and fairly represent information and supporting documentation prepared by, or under the supervision of, Mr Benjamin Ziker, Woodside’s Vice President Reserves and Subsurface, who is a full-time employee of the company and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The reserves and resources estimates included in this announcement are issued with the prior written consent of Mr Ziker. Mr Ziker’s qualiﬁcations include a Bachelor of Science (Chemical Engineering) from Rice University (Houston, Texas, USA) and 27 years of relevant experience.

Additional information for US investors concerning resource estimates

Woodside is an Australian company with securities listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. As noted above, Woodside estimates and reports its proved reserves in accordance with SEC regulations, which are also compliant with SPE-PRMS guidelines, and estimates and reports its proved plus probable reserves and 2C contingent resources in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines. Woodside reports all petroleum resource estimates using definitions consistent with SPE-PRMS.

The SEC prohibits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, from disclosing estimates of oil or gas resources other than ‘reserves’ (as that term is defined by the SEC). In this announcement, Woodside includes estimates of quantities of oil and gas using certain terms, such as ‘proved plus probable (2P) reserves’, ‘best estimate (2C) contingent resources’, ‘reserves and contingent resources’, ‘proved plus probable’, ‘developed and undeveloped’, ‘probable developed’, ‘probable undeveloped’, ‘contingent resources’ or other descriptions of volumes of reserves, which terms include quantities of oil and gas that may not meet the SEC’s definitions of proved, probable and possible reserves, and which the SEC’s guidelines strictly prohibit Woodside from including in filings with the SEC. These types of estimates do not represent, and are not intended to represent, any category of reserves based on SEC definitions, and may differ from and may not be comparable to the same or similarly-named measures used by other companies. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery, and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of not being recovered by Woodside. In addition, actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from Woodside’s properties may differ substantially. Woodside has made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities. The Reserves Statement presenting Woodside’s proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with the regulations of the SEC is filed with the SEC as part of Woodside’s annual report on Form 20-F. US investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures in Woodside’s most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC and available on the Woodside website at https://www.woodside.com/investors/reports-investor-briefings and its other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov.

Bitfarms used cash on hand to purchase capped calls to offset economic dilution up to a cap of 125% premium to the last reported sale price of Bitfarms’ common shares on Nasdaq on the date of pricing

TORONTO, Ontario and NEW YORK, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ/TSX: BITF), a North American energy and digital infrastructure company (“Bitfarms” or the “Company”), today announced that it has closed its offering of US$588 million aggregate principal amount of 1.375% convertible senior notes due 2031 (the “Convertible Notes”), which includes the exercise in full of the $88 million option granted to the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes.

“I am happy to announce our tremendous success as a first-time issuer in the convertible bond market,” said Ben Gagnon, CEO. “We were able to upsize the deal while improving on pricing, preserving upside and minimizing potential economic dilution through a 125% capped call, and introduce many high-quality institutional partners into our cap table. The funds raised through these Convertible Notes have strengthened our balance sheet with cash, Bitcoin, and remaining funds available to draw under the Macquarie project facility to over US$1 billion. We now have the financial firepower and flexibility to move forward at full speed with our HPC/AI infrastructure developments in North America. I would like to thank everyone who participated in the deal – we look forward to working together as we execute on our exciting infrastructure pipeline.”

Summary of the Offering

Approximately US$568 million in net proceeds to Bitfarms, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, but before deducting the cost of the capped call transactions.

Interest coupon of 1.375% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2026.

The initial conversion rate for the Notes is 145.6876 common shares per US$1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately US$6.86 per common share (approximately 30% premium to the last reported sale price of US$5.28 per common share on the Nasdaq on October 16, 2025).

Bitfarms may settle conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash, common shares or a combination of cash and common shares, at its election. Bitfarms will have the right to redeem the Convertible Notes in certain circumstances and will be required to offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of certain events.

Prior to October 15, 2030, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of holders at any time until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.

The Convertible Notes will mature on January 15, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms.

Bitfarms intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. Additionally, the Company used cash on hand to pay the cost of the capped call transactions.

The cap price of the capped call transactions is initially US$11.88 per common share, which represents a premium of 125% to the last reported sale price of US$5.28 per common share on the Nasdaq on October 16, 2025, and will be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions.

Deep in Louisiana’s Cajun Country, there’s a renewable energy research center dedicated to studying solar energy and biopower. And it smells like barbecue.

Located in Crowley, Louisiana, the Cleco Alternative Energy Center is sponsored by Cleco Power, LLC, and operated by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Inside the research station, UL Lafayette faculty, staff and students conduct experiments on bioenergy from waste sugarcane (bagasse) and other plant-based material. As soon as you step inside, a deep, rich smell of barbecue wafts through the air. UL Lafayette uses two separate processes with heat to transform biomass into torrefied material that could be used as a fuel alternative in coal-fired power plants, or to turn biomass into a synthetic gas (syngas). Researchers work to achieve the greatest energy content, in an effort to make bioenergy more cost competitive with traditional resources.

Outside, the Center operates a 650 kilowatt solar thermal pilot project – the nation’s first university owned-and operated solar thermal power plant. As if something from a James Bond film, two huge parabolic troughs with mirrors reflect and concentrate the sun’s rays to heat water. Instead of generating electricity directly, like photovoltaic solar panels, the heated water can be used directly or coupled with an electric generator. UL Lafayette’s research is designed to improve the performance of concentrated solar power, with the end goal of reducing costs.

Had it not been for cheap electricity, the university may not even exist.

In 1896, concerned Lafayette citizens petitioned local government to develop an electric and water utility system. That community desire led to the creation of Lafayette Utilities System. A few years later, several Louisiana cities competed to become the home of a new university. Lafayette was chosen, in part, due to the availability of electricity. In 1900, construction began on the newly minted Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute, which was eventually renamed the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The university and city’s future were interconnected.

The Cleco Alternative Energy Center is not the first time the Ragin’ Cajuns have concentrated their energy on renewable energy. In 2009, the university competed in the Department of Energy’s Solar Decathlon program against student-led teams from around the world. UL Lafayette students designed and built an off-grid solar home designed to generate as much power as it consumes. Their efforts culminated in the “BeauSoleil” home (Cajun French for “Sunshine”). At the heart of the solar home was Cajun hospitality and joie de vivre (joy for life), as virtually the entire home could be opened to host a massive party at any time. BeauSoleil was also designed with disaster preparedness in mind – Hurricane Katrina’s effects are still cemented in the community’s mind. The student team took first place in both the People’s Choice and Market Viability categories. The BeauSoleil home is now located permanently on the main campus of UL Lafayette.

But the university isn’t resting on its laurels. Its Center for Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Energy “is working to: 1) Develop local expertise in sustainable power technology design, development, manufacturing, and deployment, 2) Assist small to medium sized businesses develop and commercialize new sustainable power products, and 3) Encourage sustainable power businesses to locate in Louisiana.” In fact, the university is developing a 1 megawatt solar photovoltaic system and is already using virtual reality technology. You can check out the university’s graduate programs, here.

It is designed to meet the needs of the economy, close skills gaps and support growth.

The clean energy jobs plan sets out, for the first time, the workforce needed to deliver its clean energy ambitions. It also looks at how government will work in partnership with industry and trade unions to deliver it.

Beatrice Barleon, our Head of Policy and Public Affairs, shares our reaction to these announcements:

Post-16 education and skills white paper

“We are pleased to see the publication of the long-awaited post-16 education and skills white paper.

“We cautiously welcome the announcement of V Levels, designed to work alongside A levels and T Levels. This signals a promising step towards strengthening work-focused training for young people in key sectors like engineering and technology.

“Government must ensure that this new qualification is recognised and supported by employers and further and higher education institutions and will lead to meaningful outcomes for both young people and employers. Plus, it is vital that any subsequent changes are followed by a period of stability, with young people, employers and providers alike crying out for some clarity.

“We also welcome the confirmation of the government ambition for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher level learning by age of 25. And we are pleased to see the data driven approach that will drive investment in education and training in growth sectors. It is vital, however, that the focus on getting more young people trained at Levels 4 and 5 does not distract from the need to increase apprenticeship opportunities for young people at Levels 2 and 3. These serve as important entry routes into the engineering and technology sector.”

Clean energy jobs plan

“We were also interested to see the Clean energy jobs plan, published this week. The plan makes it very clear that the UK needs a coherent strategy as to how to meet growing workforce demand. The white paper does provide some clarity of direction and the funding available to achieve this. We welcome the confirmation of a £182 million investment in engineering sector skills, as well as the funding for construction skills. This is a positive step towards recognising the dependence of the Industrial Strategy growth-driving sectors (IS-8 sectors) on engineering skills and their cross-cutting nature.

“We look forward to working with government to ensure that the system delivers for growth, for young people and for engineering and technology employers alike.”",https://www.engineeringuk.com/media/en5d0guy/solar-cells.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 22:58:08.739625

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources.
The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials.
“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months.
That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent’s rich rare-earth resources at a time when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.

The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.

“In about a year from now we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won’t know what to do with them,” said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. “They’ll be worth $2.”

Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship “to the next level.”

Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.

“Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we’re seeing from the Chinese,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump’s meeting with Albanese.

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.

A push for more mines

The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years — if not decades — to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce its dominance.

Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.

For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.

“I think taking away that arrow in the quiver of China to manipulate pricing is an absolute crucial first step in Australia and the West being able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our supply chain demands,” said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China’s influence.

“China is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. “They are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.”

The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.

“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

But Althaus cautioned that Australia can’t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.

“Keep in mind, China has almost a 40-year head start on us,” Althaus said. “We have at least a couple of decades to catch up to China in terms of being able to meet our own supply chain requirements.”

Albanese’s visit comes just before Trump is planning to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.

The security partnership

Another topic of discussion was AUKUS, a security pact with Australia, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that was signed during U.S. President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration.

Trump noted Monday that AUKUS was established “a while ago” but that the agreement now is “moving along very rapidly, very well.” Albanese said that “our defense and security partnership with AUKUS is so important for us.”

John Phelan, the Navy secretary, said that the U.S. wants to take the original AUKUS framework and improve it for the three signatory countries while clarifying “some of the ambiguity” in it.

“So it should be a win-win for everybody,” Phelan said.

In Beijing, the Chinese government reiterated its opposition to the pact, which would help Australia obtain and build nuclear-powered submarines.

“We always oppose creating bloc confrontation, increasing nuclear proliferation risks and intensifying an arms race,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Tuesday.

The center-left Albanese was reelected in May and suggested shortly after his win that his party increased its majority by not modeling itself on Trumpism.

“Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,” Albanese told supporters during his victory speech.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/10/Minerals.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 21:58:13.700773

Livestock, mostly beef and dairy cattle, account for roughly one-third of global emissions of methane, a short-lived but especially potent greenhouse gas. Yet, unlike energy companies, beef and dairy companies are not required to report their greenhouse gas emissions.

So, in an effort to understand the climate impacts of these livestock companies, the nonprofit research firm Profundo and four environmental advocacy groups calculated emissions by cobbling together available production and slaughter data and plugging the numbers into an updated modeling framework used by the United Nations.

They looked at 45 major livestock and dairy companies, finding that they generated about 1 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2023—roughly the same amount as reported for Saudi Arabia, the world’s second largest oil producer.

“These emissions are huge and are not really mentioned or confronted in government policy right now,” said Ben Lilliston, the director of rural strategies and climate change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, one of the advocacy groups that published the report.

The others are Friends of the Earth U.S., Foodrise and Greenpeace Nordic.

The top five greenhouse gas emitters were the Brazilian meat giants—JBS, Marfrig and Minerva—and American companies Tyson and Cargill. Together these five accounted for nearly half of the emissions of the 45 companies analyzed in the report. JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, accounted for nearly one-quarter—more than the methane emissions reported by fossil fuel giants ExxonMobil and Shell combined, the advocacy group found.

The report comes three weeks before the annual United Nations climate summit, or Conference of the Parties (COP), being held this year in Belém, Brazil, the first time the conference has come to the Amazon region. The Brazilian beef industry has long been blamed for the destruction of the world’s largest rainforest as ranchers cut and burn huge swaths of trees to clear pasture. Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation in the region, accounting for nearly 80 percent, and despite public commitments to stop buying cattle from illegally deforested land, the practice continues.

Meanwhile, only a handful of countries that have signed on to the Paris climate agreement have set targets to cut emissions from livestock.

“We hope that with this report, it’s another set of data that show that unless the meat and dairy sector significantly curb their emissions—and that means an overall reduction in the number of animals—we won’t even come close to meeting climate targets,” said Kari Hamerschlag, deputy director of food and agriculture at Friends of the Earth. “We hope this will provide important input in this conversation about the need to implement more mandatory emissions reductions, particularly around methane.”

Inside Climate News contacted the top five emitters in the analysis to ask if they noted any inaccuracies or misrepresentations in the report. They did not respond.

Even if the world stopped burning fossil fuels, by far the largest source of climate-warming gases, emissions from the current food system would surpass climate targets, research has shown.

Yet despite some voluntary promises to cut emissions, most livestock and dairy companies have set ambitious growth targets. JBS has said it plans to increase production to match an estimated 70 percent increase in global meat consumption by 2050, even as it promised to cut emissions.

“They’re not planning to stop,” Hamerschlag said.

In February 2024, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against JBS USA, accusing it of misleading the public about its plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 despite its strategies to ramp up production.

Earlier this year, the Supreme Court of the State of New York granted JBS’s motion to dismiss the case, agreeing with the company’s challenge of New York as the correct jurisdiction.

The agriculture sector’s climate emissions and environmental impacts, already largely unregulated in the United States, are seeing even less scrutiny under the Trump administration.

At least three major companies covered in the report have quietly dialed back some of their voluntary emissions targets and climate-related claims in recent months amid the broader regulatory backslide.

Nestlé dropped out of a dairy industry compact in which companies agreed to report and reduce their methane emissions. JBS has said that its goals for net-zero were only aspirational, not actual commitments. Tyson has dropped its “climate smart” beef label, which it no longer advertises on its website.

“They seem to be walking back even some of the weak commitments they made,” Lilliston said. “It’s discouraging.”

In an emailed statement, Nestlé said it reduced methane emissions by 21 percent between 2018 and 2024. “Nestlé regularly reviews its memberships of external organizations. As part of this process, we have decided to discontinue our membership of the Dairy Methane Action Alliance,” a company spokesperson said. “Nestlé remains steadfast in delivering against the objectives in our Dairy Climate Plan and Net Zero Roadmap. These strategies continue to guide our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, throughout our supply chain.”

Lilliston noted that California and the European Union will start requiring large companies, including food and agriculture companies, to report emissions linked to their supply chains in the next two years.

“What we’re hoping is that we can start to get more transparency around companies’ reporting and be able to compare them over time, using one agreed-upon methodology,” he said. “That’s where we need to get to at a minimum.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1075825776-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 01:57:43.982654

Lagos, Nigeria. September 11, 2025

Newdigit, a Lagos-based clean energy company, is improving healthcare in Nigeria by providing hospitals with reliable electricity and medical-grade oxygen through a modular system. Supported by the Powering Healthcare Innovation Fund, its Just Add Water technology combines solar power and Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology to generate electricity, oxygen, and clean water for health facilities. Beyond healthcare, Newdigit’s innovation also supports agriculture and other small- to industrial-scale uses.

“Many hospitals in Nigeria rely on unstable electricity from the grid, with 8-10 hours of power cuts every day, so they use polluting diesel generators for backup”, says Derick Nwasor, co-founder and CEO of Newdigit. “With Just Add Water, hospitals can power essential equipment, produce life-saving oxygen onsite and even recover clean water, leading to improved healthcare services.”

Turning sunlight and water into reliable energy for hospitals

The system combines a PEM electrolyzer that splits water to produce hydrogen and oxygen, a PEM fuel cell that converts hydrogen into reliable electricity, and a solar-powered array that runs the entire process using renewable energy. Together, these components provide hospitals with 12–15 kW of continuous clean power, 10–40 litres per day of medical-grade oxygen, and clean water as a by-product. Its plug-and-play design allows for fast installation and easy scaling.

Newdigit’s Just Add Water systems are being installed in three hospitals across Lagos, Nigeria, serving more than 24,000 patients each year. By reducing dependence on unreliable grids and costly diesel generators, the systems will generate around 274 MWh of clean electricity in their first year and avoid over 150 tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually. To ensure sustainability and local ownership, Newdigit is training hospital staff and local technicians to operate and maintain the systems—building capacity to keep facilities powered and self-reliant.

“We have started now in Lagos, but our goal by 2030 is to reach at least 1,000 hospitals across Nigeria”, says Joy Princess, and COO of Newdigit. “We aim to improve the lives of millions of patients, every single year”

Powering Healthcare Innovation Fund

This project is part of the first cohort of the Powering Healthcare Innovation Fund, launched by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) in 2024 with support from UK aid through the Transforming Energy Access (TEA) initiative. The fund backs innovative approaches to healthcare electrification.

Housing SB 79.","Thanks to CSAEW’s coordinated advocacy efforts, IBEW came out the winners for several of our legislative priorities during the 2025 legislative session. Here is a summary of our key issues:

Energy

AB 825. This bill, sponsored by CSAEW, establishes an independent, non-profit, regional energy organization that will improve grid reliability, expand renewable energy use, and lower electricity costs for consumers across the Western U.S. by centralizing energy planning. AB 825 also supports increased deployment of renewable energy resources by providing market access for California’s clean energy and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The bill was signed by the Governor.

SB 254. This landmark energy and affordability bill, which was signed by the Governor, coordinates transmission planning and public financing and may save California ratepayers up to $3 billion annually while creating hundreds of jobs for IBEW members in grid maintenance and hardening projects. The bill strengthens California’s wildfire protections by requiring updated wildfire mitigation plans every four years and creates a new, $9-billion Continuation Account within the Wildfire Fund that will ensure faster approval of grid undergrounding projects.

SB 283. SB 283 is a direct outgrowth of CSAEW’s partnership with the California Professional Firefighters (CPF) to pass a battery storage safety bill. SB 283 significantly strengthens the fire safety, permitting, and emergency preparedness standards for battery storage sites. Importantly, SB 283 preserves the AB 205 expedited approval process and retains the process for skilled and trained workforce requirements.

Cap-and-Trade Extension. California has extended its cap-and-trade program through 2045, helping the state reach its goal of net-zero carbon emissions while creating jobs for thousands of IBEW skilled and trained workers. The extension provides long-term policy certainty while revising emissions allowance allocations, updating offset rules, and establishing new frameworks for spending program revenues on priorities like affordable housing, high-speed rail, and community air protection.

Housing

SB 79. In a landmark commitment to help ease California’s desperate housing shortage, legislators passed SB 79, which will override local zoning laws and allow denser housing developments up to nine stories near transit hubs statewide – and create new union jobs. This bill will require cities and counties to allow multifamily housing developments that meet affordability, labor, and anti-displacement standards near transit-oriented development stops.

AB 130. AB 130, signed into law in June, reduces costs and cuts red tape to alleviate California’s housing crisis by enacting significant reforms to CEQA environmental review. The bill will ultimately lower costs for families, and allow for permit streamlining, building standard limits, and housing accountability to accelerate infill housing development and limit local regulatory delays while creating more jobs for IBEW members.

Sarah Liguori, D-Phoenix, along with advocates for the solar industry held a press conference outside of a Phoenix home Tuesday afternoon that utilizes solar energy to underscore the importance of the technology.
In Arizona, energy efficiency is key to homeowners during the summer months and can curb energy bills, which are increasing for many people, as the impacts of climate change are leading to intensely high temperatures.
To Seitz and Jess White, Arizona program associate at Solar United Neighbors, solar is a way to fill that gap.
White called solar energy “one of the cheapest and most democratic” types of energy available today.
But with the Trump administration’s cuts, Seitz said that it feels like “going back to 2005” when the industry was hit with major growing pains and pushback.","With Arizona’s abundance of sunshine, advocates for solar energy are worried that the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to cut the $7 billion Solar for All program is sending the state and country backwards, right when energy demands are as high as the summer temperatures.

State Rep. Sarah Liguori, D-Phoenix, along with advocates for the solar industry held a press conference outside of a Phoenix home Tuesday afternoon that utilizes solar energy to underscore the importance of the technology.

“This is the wrong direction for our country and definitely the wrong direction for our sunshine state,” Liguori said of the EPA’s proposed cut.

Shortly after the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” this summer, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the Solar for All program, and other clean energy initiatives, would be cut.

Trump’s $3.4 trillion deficit-boosting tax cut and spending package also cuts a number of federal tax cuts for residential solar users who will have until the end of year to take advantage of the 30% federal tax credit — an average of $9,000 in savings — to install solar panels.

The credit, which was created in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act, was originally set to expire in July 2036, but the Republican budget bill takes specific aim at a number of clean energy initiatives included in the IRA, which was one of President Joe Biden’s key legislative victories.

In Arizona, energy efficiency is key to homeowners during the summer months and can curb energy bills, which are increasing for many people, as the impacts of climate change are leading to intensely high temperatures.

The cuts also are estimated to cost the state approximately $58 billion and 69,000 jobs due to the loss of many projects, according to the Arizona Commerce Authority.

Liguori urged the EPA to rethink what she said is an “unlawful” decision to halt the program which included getting rid of $156 million in grants already established for Arizona. That included a $25 million grant to the Hopi Tribe that would have aided in the creation of solar panels and battery storage for homes on the Hopi Reservation for approximately 600 homes.

Last week, Democratic Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes joined nearly two dozen other states in a lawsuit that argues the decision to end Solar for All is unlawful and that the EPA is breaching its contract with the states in doing so.

Luis Avila, the homeowner whose house Ligouri and others rallied in front of on Tuesday, said that installing solar panels allowed him to put money back into his business and the community. Avila is the President of Iconico, a consulting firm that works with left-leaning causes.

“That cash that could be in the community impacts my ability to attract people,” Avila said, referring to the construction and other jobs that solar advocates have warned are at risk by the cuts.

But it isn’t just about jobs — it is also about the future of the power grid, according to Joy Seitz, president and CEO of American Solar and Roofing.

The U.S. and the world are currently undergoing a data center boom, due largely in part to artificial intelligence. Those data centers are putting a strain on utility companies who are struggling to figure out how exactly to keep the lights on, with some proposals in Arizona around the topic even considering co-locating small nuclear reactors with them.

With the increase in data center electricity usage expected to continue to rise, some are already starting to use solar power as an alternative to non-renewable sources in order to offset the carbon footprint created by data centers.

“AI is very real, it is putting pressure on our infrastructure,” Seitz said. It is also putting pressure on elected officials, Seitz said, who are trying to figure out how to meet the growing data center demand needed for the AI industry.

The Grand Canyon State is home to 151 data centers and counting — Arizona is No. 7 in the number of data centers nationally — which used more than 1.5 gigawatts of electricity in 2024.

Utility rates in the state have also continued to skyrocket, as customers with Arizona Public Service are anticipated to see a double-digit increase in their rates starting next year, with concerns that Arizona’s booming data center economy could make matters worse for consumers.

To Seitz and Jess White, Arizona program associate at Solar United Neighbors, solar is a way to fill that gap. White called solar energy “one of the cheapest and most democratic” types of energy available today.

But with the Trump administration’s cuts, Seitz said that it feels like “going back to 2005” when the industry was hit with major growing pains and pushback.

“We now have to double down again,” Seitz said, adding that people are seeing utility demand and rates “spiking like a hockey stick,” which may spur some to action.

“We need new blood, we need new representation,” Seitz said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-79/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/solar-press-conference-1024x6831761090575.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=TFSaERYU,N,,2025-10-21 20:02:41.200394

GM's plan includes further scaling back EV production and making more of its popular pickup trucks and SUVs.
GM's per-share profits of $2.80 and revenue of nearly $49 billion both topped Wall Street expectations.
Analysts have said GM likely would have taken a hit from the slow-growing EV market regardless of federal policy.
On Tuesday, GM lowered its projected tariff costs for the year to between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, with the goal of mitigating about 35% of those costs.","Buoyed by healthy third-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations, General Motors Co. on Tuesday upped its full-year financial guidance, saw its stock price soar and laid out plans to boost profits further next year amid a shifting tariff and regulatory climate.

The Detroit automaker's rosy outlook comes as it on-shores manufacturing to offset tariff costs and leans back into gas-powered models to take advantage of loosening federal emissions rules that had incentivized unprofitable electric vehicles.

As part of efforts to reduce losses from EVs, CEO Mary Barra said GM no longer is making its battery-powered BrightDrop vans, which had been produced in Canada. Work at GM's CAMI assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, has been idled for months because of lagging demand.

Barra and other GM executives outlined a strategy to boost the company's profit margins in a radically different environment under President Donald Trump, a case bolstered by the company's $3.4 billion in net profits before taxes between July and September despite numerous market hits this year.

""Looking ahead, our top priority is to restore North America to our historical 8-10% EBIT-adjusted margins,"" Barra said in a letter to investors. ""We are focused on driving EV profitability, maintaining production and pricing discipline, managing fixed costs, and further reducing tariff exposure.""

GM's net income margins were at 4.3% at the end of September, the most recently available data.

GM's plan includes further scaling back EV production and making more of its popular pickup trucks and SUVs. As previously announced, that includes manufacturing more full-size SUVs and light-duty pickup trucks at Michigan's Orion Assembly Plant beginning in early 2027 and the popular gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox at Kansas' Fairfax Assembly and Stamping.

Analysts and traders noted the company's resilience so far in the face of headwinds that include tariffs on auto imports and the rapid reversal of Biden-era EV policies under Trump, including the end of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV sales.

""Overall, while the tariff headlines and EV restructuring activities continue to put further pressure on the bottom line for the foreseeable future for GM, Barra & Co. are doing well at strategically operating in this very difficult environment with greater focus on ramping its (internal combustion engine) vehicle fleet to drive profitable growth and mitigate headwinds across the business,"" Wedbush analysts wrote Tuesday.

GM's per-share profits of $2.80 and revenue of nearly $49 billion both topped Wall Street expectations. Analysts expected revenue of about $44 billion and earnings of $2.26 per share between July and October, according to consensus estimates reported by Yahoo Finance.

GM also upped its estimated yearly net profits to between $12 billion and $13 billion, up from a previous projection of $10 billion to $12.5 billion. The automaker's stock closed up nearly 15% Tuesday.

Despite outperforming analysts' expectations, GM's third-quarter net profits before tax fell below last year's earnings of more than $4 billion in the same period.

""Looking forward to 2026, we have multiple levers to carry our current momentum forward, including progress on EV losses, warranty costs, tariff offsets, regulatory requirements and fixed costs,"" Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told investors Tuesday. ""As a result, we expect next year to be even better than 2025.”

GM's third-quarter earnings reflect a $1.6 billion write-down issued last week over the stunted EV market, which the company has attributed to the loss of the federal tax credit for EV buyers and lessees. The incentives expired last month under legislation signed by Trump.

The impending deadline to take advantage of the tax breaks pushed buyers to snap up battery-powered vehicles from July to September in a record-breaking few months for EV makers. Jacobson said the company brought EV inventory down 30% in that time.

GM and analysts predict a drop-off in sales moving forward.

Most of the impairment charge — $1.2 billion — represents investments in equipment and other manufacturing capacity that is no longer needed now that GM has pulled back on ambitious EV plans. The company expects $400 million in losses on contracts with suppliers who had planned to provide EV parts or equipment.

""With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,"" Barra wrote to shareholders. ""That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges.""

Analysts have said GM likely would have taken a hit from the slow-growing EV market regardless of federal policy. High price tags and lagging charging infrastructure remain top barriers to broader EV use among drivers, and currently EVs represent about 10% of the overall U.S. auto market.

Trump's import taxes on certain vehicles, auto parts and raw materials further complicated GM's finances so far this year, although the White House last week extended a deal that eases tariffs on automakers assembling vehicles in the United States.

A 25% tariff on medium- and heavy-duty trucks is also set to take effect Nov. 1.

An analysis from East Lansing consulting firm Anderson Economic Group last week estimated that U.S. automakers through July had paid $6.45 billion in tariffs this year on autos and auto parts from suppliers and assembly plants in Canada and Mexico. Those figures don’t include tariffs paid on aluminum and steel or imports from Europe and Asia.

Barra earlier this year said she expects the Detroit automaker's total tariff costs this year to hit between $4 billion and $5 billion, which she said the company expects to offset by about 30% in part by tightening the budget and moving more supplies and manufacturing to the United States.

On Tuesday, GM lowered its projected tariff costs for the year to between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, with the goal of mitigating about 35% of those costs.

Efforts to limit tariff exposure include a $4 billion onshoring investment to up production of money-making trucks and SUVs in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee.

This is the act that gave us a $7,500 credit depending on certain criteria like critical mineral sourcing and final assembly.

The 2026 NX plug-in just lost its $7,500 lease cash offer, while the RZ lost a whopping $11,500 in discounts.","It's been a few weeks since we lost the EV tax credits on eligible electric cars like the Model Y, and we're starting to see just how much money we're not saving now. One of the quickest ways to see the effect is to take a look at leasing costs. While some brands are actually doing their best to match the deals they were offering while the incentives were still in play, the vast majority of once-eligible cars now cost a lot more to drive from month to month.

If you want to put a silver lining on it, you could argue that the credits already did what they were intended to do. That is, Americans bought around 1.3 million electric vehicles last year, representing 7.3% year-over-year market growth from 2023. Of course, the bottom line is simply that EVs are generally more expensive for the consumer now, so we can't blame anyone who doesn't feel like looking on the bright side of life this time. Here's what you need to know.

The EV Credits Officially Went Away At The End Of September

EV credits date back further than you might think. President Obama first offered federal EV credits all the way back in October 2008, with the Extension Act. The latest iteration of the EV tax credit was enacted under President Biden by the bi-partisan 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

This is the act that gave us a $7,500 credit depending on certain criteria like critical mineral sourcing and final assembly. In short: the more American your car, the more money you could claim. $3,750 of the credit was dependent on battery components alone, which is why some cars could score you a bigger incentive than others.

To run down the qualifiers, according to the IRS, eligible vehicles must:

Of course, this is all a history lesson at this point, because the credits were wiped completely off the table on October 1, 2025, by President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill.

State Level Incentives Are Still Available

Most US states offer some sort of incentives for driving an EV, although these are being expired, rewritten, and renewed all the time, especially in the wake of the federal EV credits expiring. But, there are some good deals to be had out there. For example, according to DriveClean, Californians can claim a $1,350 credit just for retiring a gas-powered vehicle.

You shouldn't expect to make up the total $7,500 in tax credits through state-level incentives alone, but you're not totally on your own out there. Many state governments have crunched the numbers and determined that it's better for the economy and better for the state to have people buying electric vehicles, and they're happy to give drivers a little nudge in that direction.

How Is This Affecting Leases?

The EV credit didn't technically apply to leasing. The idea was that you would buy the EV, and then claim the credit next April when you file your taxes. But, if you were leasing, the dealer could claim a $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit, even if the car didn't meet certain made-in-American qualifications. This allowed dealers to pass the credit on to drivers as an incentive, until these credits went away along with the ones we were able to claim as consumers for buying a new EV.

EVs Are More Expensive To Lease Now, By And Large

It doesn't take a financial analyst to guess that, when you pull an incentive from the table, things get more expensive. To list a few of the automakers who have raised the price on lease offers, according to auto seller CarsDirect.

Teslas are $242 more expensive to lease, month by month, than they were when the federal credits were in effect. The Model 3 Sedan in particular now lists at $529 per month, with $4,224 due at signing, where it had been listed at $349 with $4,044 due at signing.

Volkswagen buyers may be hit the hardest, with the ID.4 losing a whopping $12,350 in potential lease incentives via the company's Bonus Customer Cash program.

Toyota has dropped a vast majority of their lease discounts as of October first, with the RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid seeing a nearly 50% increase in lease price.

Nissan completely scrapped the lease cash deal they had going on the Ariya, with estimated lease costs nearly tripling from $319 a month to $950 a month.

Lexus is dropping big incentives left and right. The 2026 NX plug-in just lost its $7,500 lease cash offer, while the RZ lost a whopping $11,500 in discounts.

BMW Seems To Be Eating The Cost

We don't know how the financing guys at BMW have it figured out, but the brand has managed to keep their lease deals unchanged since the EV credit expired. The 2025 BMW i4, for instance, leases at $399 a month for three years, with $4,999 due at signing, just like it did a month ago.

It remains to be seen for exactly how long BMW can keep this up, of course, but, for the time being, this has created a weird scenario where, for the 2025 model year, the $57,900 BMW i4 actually sells at an MSRP of $15,410 more than the $42,490 Model 3, but it's more than a hundred dollars cheaper to lease every month. If you've been looking for an excuse to lease a brand-new German luxury car, we can't think of a better one than that.

BMWs – including the electric ones – tend to depreciate pretty quickly, so you can often buy a three-year-old Bimmer at half its MSRP. But, when we're talking luxury cars, there's something to be said for being the first owner.

There Are Still Some Great Deals To Be Had

Just before the EV credits were scrapped, we recommended the VinFast VF 8 as potentially the very best EV to lease in the US. A month ago, you could lease the EV for zero dollars down, and just $199 a month for the first three years. Today, an entry-level Eco model costs $279 a month, and zero dollars down, with an available $7,500 lease bonus. Not bad, right?

Cheap To Buy Doesn't Mean Cheap To Lease

Some cars are still very easy to recommend as a purchase, like the $29,990 2026 Nissan Leaf, but difficult to recommend as a lease, as the deal will have you paying an estimated $499 a month for three years, with an initial payment of $3,699.

Note that the fine print is in effect for all of these lease deals: for qualifying drivers. VinFast is advertising a nice low rate of $279 a month, but your credit score might tell a different story. But the big picture is the same across the whole industry: electric vehicles are more expensive to buy now that the EV credits are gone, and, by and large, more expensive to lease, as well.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ioniq-9-seoul-95-wid-1024-bfc-off.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-21 19:00:45.048169

With only a fraction of staff on duty and most routine operations halted, the chemical and pesticide regulatory landscape faces a new round of challenges in both the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) and the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP).

EPA’s September 29, 2025, contingency plan officially took effect at the start of the shutdown. The shutdown has affected 89 percent of the Agency’s employees, with only those 1,734 employees deemed “essential” to protect life, property, or national security retained. That means most rulemaking, permitting, and scientific work has ground to a halt. Exceptions include:

Emergency response and environmental monitoring tied to imminent threats;

Superfund cleanups that, if paused, would endanger public health;

Information Technology (IT) and facility security; and

Select projects funded by unexpired or fee-based appropriations, such as the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2022 (PRIA 5) pesticide reviews, Superfund Tax-funded activities, and certain Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) or Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) initiatives.

For companies that rely on predictable regulatory timelines, these exceptions matter — but they also highlight how uneven the shutdown’s impact will be.

EPA’s ongoing implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) is among the most directly affected programs. Progress on most risk evaluations and prioritization activities — which require cross-office collaboration and public engagement — are effectively paused. This includes work on preparing in final draft risk evaluations and internal review of the Agency’s proposed TSCA “framework rule” update, released shortly before the shutdown.

The New Chemicals Program is also expected to slow significantly. While the Agency may process a limited number of submissions, most premanufacture notices (PMN), significant new use notices (SNUN), and microbial commercial activity notices (MCAN) will remain in queue until operations resume. Applicants should anticipate extended review periods and potential post-shutdown backlogs.

The pesticide program is also affected, although some work is continuing from funds available from the fee-schedule for pesticide submissions (required fees collected by PRIA 5). The PRIA 5 funds allow staff working on those submissions to continue even after any “carryover” funds, from earlier appropriations, have been exhausted. The carryover funds were available to support Agency work for the first days of the shutdown; OPP staff working on submissions are allowed to meet with submitters, but meetings about “policy” matters are subject to the shutdown. As residual funds are depleted, EPA has signaled its intent to reduce its workforce by issuing notices of Reduction in Force (RIF) to approximately 20 to 30 employees in its waste office. RIF notices generally take about 60 days to execute, although the Administration has previously discussed the idea of invoking an exemption that would allow them to fire employees within 30 days for separate RIF plans. It is likely that such actions will be met with legal challenges.

Other impacts across EPA likely will include:

PFAS and Fees Rules: Ongoing rulemakings — such as the final per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule, the PFAS maximum contaminant level (MCL) implementation guidance, and the TSCA fees rule — are likely to face delays in clearance and publication.

Enforcement and Inspections: Routine inspections are paused, though emergency enforcement actions may proceed. Regulated entities can expect a surge of inspection activity once normal operations resume.

Permitting and State Coordination: State and Tribal programs that rely on EPA approval (e.g., air quality State Implementation Plans (SIP), water total maximum daily loads (TMDL), delegated hazardous waste permits) could experience cascading delays if federal staff are unavailable to review submissions.

Pesticide companies, chemical manufacturers, processors, and importers should prepare for delays, deferrals, and shifting compliance milestones. Companies awaiting new chemical determinations or rulemakings tied to market access should build additional lead-time into internal planning. Practical steps to take include:

1. Planning for slippage. Add flexibility to internal project timelines, especially where EPA sign-off is a gating step.

2. Using downtime strategically. Refine new chemical submissions, test plans, and exposure assessments now — so materials are ready when reviews restart.

3. Monitoring program-specific updates. Fee-funded programs like PRIA 5 may keep moving, even as TSCA work stalls.

4. Expecting an uneven restart. When the shutdown ends, EPA will triage its workload, prioritizing public-health and statutory-deadline matters before lower-risk filings.

However long this shutdown lasts, its effects will linger. EPA faces significant challenges with staffing shortages even in normal times. A multi-week pause could cascade into months of delayed decisions, postponed rulemakings, and additional strain on overextended staff in both OPPT and OPP. Deadlines for program actions may likely be delayed by more than a simple “one for one” delay — a one month shutdown may set back program deliverables by a much longer timeframe, as has been the case in past shutdowns.

For regulated entities, the key is transparency and preparation: stay in communication with EPA contacts where possible, document outreach attempts, and maintain flexibility on compliance planning. Whether Congress resolves the funding impasse in days or weeks, the pesticide and chemical sectors should brace for another reminder of just how deeply dependent regulatory predictability is on government continuity.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/cap05-e1750115759442.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 20:02:45.075899

Ensuring the State’s Water Future Looking ahead, the integration of water conservation, ASR, water recycling, and desalination will continue to contribute to a comprehensive approach to water security in Texas.","Water scarcity is an ongoing challenge across Texas driven by rapid population growth, economic expansion, and persistent drought conditions. As water demands rise and supplies become increasingly constrained, a shift toward more diversified water management practices is occurring.

Cities across Texas are implementing strategies that include conservation, water recycling and reuse, aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), and desalination. Water utilities in some cities, such as El Paso and San Antonio, have employed all the above strategies, while others have chosen a subset based on their individual circumstances. The result is more resilient and sustainable local economies.

The following examples highlight how these strategies have been applied in select Texas cities to address local water supply challenges.

Conservation as a Core Strategy

Conservation alone cannot solve Texas’ water challenges. However, it is an essential component of a diversified water supply policy. Numerous Texas cities are implementing programs to conserve water and ensure long-term supply reliability.

The City of Lubbock created a broad water conservation plan built around four main strategies: keeping water prices structured to discourage overuse, fixing leaks in the water system, educating the public, and enforcing rules regarding when and how residents can water their lawns. Lubbock updated its water pricing system to reward conservation and limit waste by charging residents more per gallon as their usage increases. The City of San Antonio has invested in water monitoring systems that track real-time household water usage and alert users to potential leaks. On the horizon, the City of Austin’s 100-year water plan foresees integrating the collection of air conditioning condensate with gray water for reuse in their municipal water system.

“Conservation wasn’t an easy sell in the beginning,” Christina Montoya Halter, communications and marketing manager at El Paso Water, said. “Now it’s a way of life for our residents. Educating the consumer has been key.”

El Paso consumes about 40 percent less water per capita today than it did in the 1980s due to conservation and education programs, while total water usage remains flat.

Technology-driven conservation solutions can help both water utilities and consumers make more informed decisions about water use. Together with public education campaigns, comprehensive conservation approaches are helping many Texas cities supplement existing water supplies while preparing for future droughts and population growth.

Real-time water-saving statistics are not published. However, the Texas Water Development Board’s (TWDB) 2022 State Water Plan projects a water savings of 2.2 million acre-feet (717 billion gallons) through conservation efforts alone by the year 2070.

Wastewater to Drinking Water

The role of water recycling is expanding in Texas, with potable water reuse projects offering a dependable supplement to traditional water sources. Direct potable reuse (DPR) involves treating wastewater to drinking water standards and returning it directly into the local water supply system. Indirect potable reuse (IPR) is a system where clean treated wastewater is returned to a lake, river, or underground aquifer to be mixed with natural water sources before being consumed again.

In May 2013, the City of Big Spring launched the first DPR facility in the U.S. Local wastewater first undergoes standard biological treatment to remove most solids and organic matter. The treated wastewater is then purified using a three-step process of microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet advanced oxidation.

The highly purified water is then mixed with conventional surface water from nearby lakes at about a 50 50 blend. The blended water is delivered to the city’s conventional drinking water treatment plants where further treatment uses filtration, disinfection (e.g., chlorine), and chemical stabilization to meet all Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) drinking water standards.

The treated water then enters the city’s municipal distribution system for consumption. Continuous testing is conducted at each step of the procedure to detect any contaminants. If contaminants are detected, typical steps taken can include:

Investigating and addressing the source of contamination to prevent recurrence.

Confirming the type and level of the contaminant detected to understand the potential risk.

Modifying or increasing treatment methods such as filtration, disinfection, or chemical stabilization to neutralize the contaminants.

Conducting more frequent or detailed testing to monitor contaminant levels and effectiveness of adjustments.

Informing regulatory agencies (like EPA or TCEQ) if contaminants exceed safe limits and follow mandated protocols.

If necessary, notifying the public with advisories or boil water notices until safety is assured.

More than 1.7 million gallons of recycled drinking water are produced daily using this system, with capacity to recycle up to two million gallons.

The City of Wichita Falls installed a 17- mile pipeline in 2018 as part of an IPR project that transports treated wastewater from a local treatment plant to Lake Arrowhead. Purified effluent is returned to the lake for later use, supplementing the surface water reservoir while also enhancing drought preparedness.

In San Antonio, three major water recycling centers produce more than 125,000 acre-feet (41 billion gallons) of treated effluent annually. The system can recycle up to 25,000 acre feet per year, supporting industrial uses and landscaping while helping maintain nearby river flows. El Paso has had an IPR system in place since 1985. As of January 2024, more than 95,000 acre-feet of water (30 billion gallons) has been recycled through the project.

The natural buffer in IPR systems has proven to be more readily accepted by consumers. Although IPR also faces public opposition, it tends to have a higher level of public acceptance compared with DPR because of perceived purification by natural processes, which serves to distance water from its history as wastewater (Millan et al. 2015; Rodriguez et al. 2009).

However, ongoing public education about the safety of all water recycling and reuse systems remains essential for long-term public acceptance.

The implementation of these and other recycling programs demonstrates the state’s commitment to integrating recycled water into a larger water supply portfolio. Significant state and federal funding initiatives also highlight recycling’s increasingly important role in regional water security.

Aquifer Storage and Recovery

ASR projects across the state have emerged as important tools for water management. As a result, communities implementing ASR have become much better prepared to handle climate and rainfall variability.

El Paso Water broke ground on the Enhanced Arroyo Infiltration Project in May 2023. In phase one, the Hueco Bolson aquifer will be recharged through “infiltration basins.” More cost-effective than deep injection wells, the basins are engineered depressions in the ground designed to capture and temporarily store treated wastewater, stormwater, or surface water while it slowly seeps back into the aquifer. The soil will act as a natural filter, removing impurities and pathogens. Phase one is nearing completion.

Phase two of the project will include pump station upgrades and a pipeline to move treated river water to infiltration basins in years when El Paso receives full allotments of water from the Rio Grande. The nearly $22 million initiative requires strong federal and state monetary support. The result will be improved drought resilience, groundwater management, and sustainability.

The San Antonio Water System (SAWS) implemented an ASR system known as H2Oaks in June 2004. SAWS injects excess high-quality water from the Edwards Aquifer into the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer. During periods when Edwards Aquifer levels are high, and SAWS is allowed to pump more water, the utility stores surplus water underground in the Carrizo rather than letting it go unused.

When Edwards Aquifer restrictions are imposed, SAWS can recover the water from the Carrizo to maintain a consistent water supply without violating withdrawal limits. In this way, Edwards Aquifer water rights are maximized, while also addressing population growth, climate variability, and long-term sustainability.

H2Oaks currently includes 29 injection/recovery wells with a recovery capacity of about 60 million gallons per day. The facility can store up to approximately 233,000 acre-feet (75 billion gallons) of water in the Carrizo. As of May 2024, San Antonio had stored more than 155,000 acre-feet (50.5 billion gallons), nearly half of the city’s annual consumption.

Efforts to conserve water is especially vital for San Antonio, where extreme drought conditions impacted the city as recently as mid-July 2025. Before recent rainfall, San Antonio was experiencing the second worst drought in the past century.

Desalination’s Expanding Role

Desalination of brackish groundwater is another emerging solution for diversifying local water resources. With Texas’ estimated 2.7 billion acre-feet (880 trillion gallons) of brackish water, investments in desalination technology are showing progress in reducing dependence on finite freshwater supplies.

El Paso is home to the Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant, the world’s largest inland desalination facility. This joint project between El Paso Water and Fort Bliss treats brackish groundwater from the Hueco Bolson Aquifer using reverse osmosis technology, producing up to 27.5 million gallons of fresh water a day. The plant not only provides a significant portion of the city’s water supply, but also helps prevent the intrusion of brackish water into freshwater wells.

In San Antonio, the SAWS brackish groundwater desalination facility is currently one of the largest in the country. Completed in 2016, it uses reverse osmosis to convert brackish groundwater into high-quality drinking water.

Managing the wastewater byproduct remains a challenge with the process, requiring careful disposal or reuse to avoid environmental impacts. The SAWS brine is injected deep underground through two injection wells drilled to depths exceeding 5,200 feet into the hypersaline zone of the Edwards Aquifer to safely contain the concentrate. El Paso’s brine is pumped about 22 miles northeast of the desalination plant and injected approximately 3,500 feet into a fractured rock formation, isolating the brine from surface water and the environment. Ongoing research is exploring several possibilities, including mineral recovery and other beneficial uses for the brine discharge.

Although desalination is not a new technology, continued investment and innovation to bring the cost down is critical to fully realize its benefits. A May 2025 San Antonio Express-News article noted that SAWS desalinated water was about three times the cost of Edwards Aquifer groundwater.

A Second Life for Oilfield Produced Water?

The Texas oil and gas industry generates billions of barrels of produced water each year, historically disposed of through deep well injections. Oilfield produced water is the wastewater that surfaces along with oil and gas during extraction, typically containing salts, hydrocarbons, and other contaminants. Pilot projects in the Permian Basin are testing advanced water recycling and desalination methods for potential use in irrigation, industrial cooling, and aquifer recharge.

The Texas Produced Water Consortium, established by the Texas Legislature, is playing a key role in evaluating the safety, cost-effectiveness, and regulatory framework needed to safely implement wide spread produced water reuse. Although technological barriers remain, produced water treatment and reuse could help Texas lower the environmental impact of oil and gas operations while offering an additional water source.

Ensuring the State’s Water Future

Looking ahead, the integration of water conservation, ASR, water recycling, and desalination will continue to contribute to a comprehensive approach to water security in Texas. Each strategy has its unique strengths and weaknesses. Together they are helping create a resilient, diversified water portfolio focused on withstanding the pressures of growth and climate variability being experienced by the state.

Collaboration among state agencies, local utilities, the private sector, and community stakeholders will be key to unlocking the full potential of these strategies. Ongoing public education must also continue to build trust and ensure that new technologies are accepted by the communities they serve. Texas is already a leader in sustainable water management, and the lessons being learned here can hopefully benefit water policies and practices across the country.",https://trerc.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/In-the-Pipeline.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 20:02:54.231921

Jamberoo Action Park was approached by Chinese EV maker BYD to use its car park during the off-season to store new cars arriving through Port Kembla, New South Wales' main vehicle import hub.

The park's marketing manager, Grant Wright, said the park saw the opportunity as a ""maximisation strategy"" to make the most of another one of its assets.

Thousands of cars were moved onto the site during the past couple of months while the park was closed to visitors.

The activity has caused concerns for neighbours, who contacted Kiama Council.

Residents said they had safety worries about the impact of heavy vehicle traffic and that the activity breached conditions approved for the use of the car park.

The operator said the cars were being stored in ""pre-delivery"" mode.

The site's location is also a factor. Port Kembla, the primary port for large-scale vehicle imports in New South Wales, is less than an hour's drive away.

Electric vehicle sales are rising rapidly, accounting for more than 12 per cent of new cars in the first half of 2025.

The national electric vehicle fleet has grown to more than 410,000 vehicles.

About 77 per cent of all electric vehicles purchased this year were made in China.

Car park use

Kiama Council inspected the business earlier this year and issued a compliance order.

Jamberoo then lodged a development application on August 22 for the land to be used as a car park for vehicles unrelated to park visitors.

""Initially, we thought, cars being parked in a car park, seemed quite reasonable, but when we looked into it, we had some concerns,"" Kiama Council's director of planning, environment and communities, Ed Paterson, said.

On Monday, Kiama Council rejected the application on Monday, citing rural zoning rules and traffic concerns.

""The adage is it's always easier to ask for forgiveness than approval, but we really encourage people to come and speak to us before they start doing things because it is easier and cheaper,"" Mr Paterson said.

Mr Wright said the park was confident in its ability to manage the operation.

""Dozens and dozens of school buses turn around safely here all summer months,"" he said.

He also said that in the past, the park operated 365 days a year.

The proposal has sparked discussion on local Facebook pages, with some people raising concerns about the impact on roads, while others called out the ""Karens"" for complaining, pointing to the irony of criticising a car park being used to park cars.

Mr Wright said the car park had also been used by the University of Wollongong for electric vehicle testing, which was scheduled outside peak periods.

The council decision meant the cars would have to be removed.

Mr Wright said the park would work with the council to ensure compliance.

""Despite this setback, we will continue to explore ways to make the most of our infrastructure while prioritising safety and guest experience,"" he said.

A BYD Australia spokesperson said it took its ""compliance obligations seriously"".

""Our storage and logistics partner manages several locations in the Port Kembla and surrounding region,"" they said.

""Vehicles stored locally are allocated to fulfil customer orders and reflect BYD's commitment to timely deliveries of our products.""

We’re also investing in cleaner energy generation like modern natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy.","VICKSBURG, Miss. – Vicksburg will once again be home to an Entergy Mississippi power generation source with construction of the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station, the company’s latest investment to replace retired, 50-year-old natural gas generation facilities with newer, highly efficient resources. The 754-megawatt combined-cycle combustion turbine facility will be located on the grounds of the former Baxter Wilson Steam Electric Station and, along with already-announced plants in Greenville and Ridgeland, will help ensure Entergy Mississippi’s 459,000 customers continue to have efficient, reliable and affordable energy.

Replacing legacy power plants with new, highly efficient power generation sources provides long-term savings to customers. Modern natural gas plants are 40% more fuel efficient than older facilities, saving customers more money on future bills for decades to come.

In the short term, the construction of this and other new generation units at the time of new large industrial technology customers’ investments in the grid – like Amazon – will reduce forecasted bill increases by 16% over the next five years.

Savings include an estimated $1.3 billion in the materials and equipment costs to build new power plants today, compared to the cost to build those facilities on their original schedules. Given the inflationary trends in materials and construction costs, building facilities now will save customers money.

Our diverse generation portfolio offers us flexibility to lessen the impact on customers’ bills should one fuel source spike in price. Additionally, we expect to pass on to customers an estimated savings of $700 million in fuel costs over the life of the new units.

These measures are part of Superpower Mississippi, the largest grid upgrade in the company’s history, which makes distribution improvements, adds new generation and prioritizes keeping customers’ rates affordable while building an all-of-the-above generation mix that makes the electric grid more reliable and efficient.

While electricity costs are rising nationally, growth in our service area – including new large industrial customers like Amazon – means some of the increased costs for equipment and fuel that otherwise would be incorporated into future bills won’t be passed on to our other existing customers. Customers will also share a smaller portion of the costs than they would have to build the same plants on their original schedules.

“Vicksburg is one of the four original cities we began serving in 1923, and we’re proud to continue our legacy here with the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station. We’re building new natural gas plants in our service area for the first time in more than 50 years. Replacing older plants has been in our long-term resource plan for several years, but we’re taking advantage of the economic growth happening in our region to bring modern generation technology online sooner, while minimizing the rate impact to customers’ bills,” said Haley Fisackerly, president and CEO, Entergy Mississippi.

“These upgrades are not only important to keeping bills affordable for customers, but also to making sure we have the capacity to promote economic development, recruit new and higher paying jobs, and power residential, commercial, industrial and technology growth for Mississippi’s future.”

“Our reliability effort announced last month combined with this additional commitment to develop new power generation sources means our Superpower Mississippi plan is bringing more power and better power to customers, all at a lower cost to them,” Fisackerly continued. “Our state leaders have been instrumental in recruiting large industrial customers, like Amazon, that afford us the ability to provide these significant benefits to customers. And, thanks to support for that growth from Governor Reeves, the Mississippi State Legislature and the Mississippi Public Service Commission, all customers will benefit from lower bills than they otherwise would have seen in the future. We’re also grateful to local leaders, like those in Warren County, who welcome these investments that not only help their communities prosper but also serve Mississippi families and businesses throughout the western half of the state.”

A $1.2 billion investment, the Vicksburg Advanced Power Station represents a significant economic impact for the area, including more than 560 construction jobs over the next several years and additional tax revenue for Warren County. Entergy will employ about 21 personnel to operate the plant once completed.

This advanced facility will be equipped with combined-cycle combustion turbine technology that primarily uses natural gas and is also designed to support blended hydrogen in the future, mirroring the other power plants Entergy Mississippi is building – Delta Blues Advanced Power Station in Greenville and Traceview Advanced Power Station in Ridgeland. Much like the legacy units that have been cornerstones of our local communities for half a century, these new plants will power life for the next generation of Mississippians and beyond.

After they’re gone, it will be interesting to see if and how electric camper van builders pivot.","General Motors is pulling the plug on its BrightDrop delivery van. While this probably isn’t a big deal for most readers of this site, one immediate thought came to my mind. The RV industry has been proud to announce brand-new, state-of-the-art camper vans that use the BrightDrop to have nearly 300 miles of zero-emissions range. The death of the BrightDrop means that the best platform for building an electric camper van on is now dead, and the RV industry just got set back practically overnight.

As I have written before, the RV industry has had a difficult time cracking into the electric vehicle world. RV manufacturers are usually secondary manufacturers, which means that they get trucks, vans, and chassis from an automaker or truck builder and then construct a camper onto that. Until recently, this has meant that if an RV company wanted to get into EVs, they had to wait until a company like General Motors or Ford created a viable platform.

At first, this meant that early factory-built electric motorhomes sucked. The Ford E-Transit-based Winnebago eRV2 (below), for example, had a pitiful range of only 104 miles. But there wasn’t anything Winnebago could do about that because the EV part came from Ford. Most other electric camper vans have been custom-built based on gas vans that get converted to electric.

The BrightDrop was actively changing the electric camper van game. GM’s electric delivery van was spacious, powerful, fast-charging, and perhaps most important to RV owners, had a range of 270 miles to 286 miles depending on the camper van configuration. The BrightDrop was the first platform that could be made into a camper van that realistically handled long drives without driving its occupants insane with charging stops.

BrightDrop Campers Have Been Around

I have been writing about BrightDrop-based vans for a couple of years now. In 2023, Detroit-based startup Grounded RVs began production of the G2, a camper van with lots of space and 270 miles of range. Then, this year, Grounded launched the G3, an update to its BrightDrop camper van with a better interior and up to 286 miles of range. The folks of Grounded were also building custom BrightDrop camper vans for California startup RollAway Hospitality.

These vans didn’t just have great range, but the platform itself was almost perfect for camper vans. Our Thomas Hundal enjoyed his drive in a BrightDrop. The common camper van configuration involved Zevo 400 and 600 vans sporting dual-motor AWD with 300 HP and 390 lb-ft of torque.

Later this year, some huge news came out of Indiana with the debut of the BrightDrop-based Coachmen RVEX. The launch of this van signified the first serious production all-electric camper van from one of the massive Indiana RV manufacturers. Things were looking great. Between Coachmen, RollAway, Grounded, and smaller outfits, Americans had some real choices for a practical factory-built electric camper van.

I have criticized these vans for being imperfect for the role of being a camper. Since the BrightDrop was designed as a delivery van, the cab is separated from the cargo area. When these are built into campers, this dividing wall means that the front seats cannot be used as lounge chairs, as you’d get in a typical camper van. The cab of the BrightDrop also isn’t very luxurious, either. However, the BrightDrop was long enough to make up some of the difference, and at least there was a pass-through in the cab to get to the camper portion. I think the quirks of using a delivery van platform were worth it to get the BrightDrop’s great range.

Now, the RV industry isn’t going to have access to these vans anymore. The death of the BrightDrop is being blamed on “market demand” and the loss of EV incentives, but it doesn’t really matter why GM is killing it. Once the supply of BrightDrop vans runs dry, that’s it.

An RV Manufacturer Responds

Admittedly, the first company that I thought of was Grounded. The startup was a pioneer in turning BrightDrop vans into campers, and, I think, would be impacted the hardest by GM’s decision here. Coachmen is a huge and flexible company, it can cancel the RVEX and perhaps few people would even remember. But this was Grounded’s bread and butter. So, I reached out, and got this back from Grounded:

BrightDrop is shutting down. Given GM’s whiplash-inducing EV strategy over the past few years, this comes as a surprise to no one. Detroit-based mobility innovation startup Grounded has long been considering expanding the company’s wildly successful personal and commercial upfits beyond electric and to gas for a truly platform agnostic future.

Today the company announced its expansion to the Grounded Gas line, which makes the company’s modular interiors, designs, Grounded+ telemetics software, and electronics available on any gas-powered platform.

Here’s what Sam Shapiro, founder of Grounded RVs, said:

“No one in the world tried as hard as we did to build on all-electric vans. But at the end of the day what differentiates Grounded is everything above the chassis: our design, materials, technology, and integrated fleet management software. We’ve built on fully-electric and hybrid platforms like Ford, GM, and Harbinger, and now, with Grounded Gas, which we’ve long considered, we’re looking to a truly platform-agnostic future. Our stock of available Brightdrops is strong at the moment, but expansion to gas vehicles will move the business forward and allow Grounded to continue to lead toward an electrified and hybrid future.”

I reached out to Coachmen and have not yet heard back. But it looks like in either case, both companies should have enough BrightDrops to build campers out of for a decent while. However, at some point, these companies will have to pivot away from the BrightDrop platform.

It’s unclear what Coachmen is going to do, but Grounded is going to move away from depending entirely on an EV platform. That alone is pretty surprising, as Grounded started off as an all-electric, affordable camper van company. But it makes sense that Grounded would pivot to a fuel-agnostic design. That way, Grounded won’t have to start over every time a company kills a van or announces a new one.

At the same time, I feel like this decision sets the RV industry back. There doesn’t seem to a direct replacement electric van on the market. The Ford E-Transit currently goes about 159 miles on a charge. There’s also the Mercedes-Benz eSprinter, which is rated for up to 206 miles on a charge. The Ram ProMaster EV still comes more than 100 miles short at 164 miles of range. Even the Rivian Delivery, a logistics van like the BrightDrop, goes 161 miles on a charge.

Thankfully, GM’s decision only somewhat kneecaps the RV industry. This doesn’t impact the brilliant partnership between Thor Industries and Harbinger, which has produced the world’s first production extended range electric motorhome. However, that beast is a Class A motorhome and is not a pure battery electric camper. If you’re into electric vans, you just lost the best choice for range.

The Future

In the near future, the next best thing might be a camper based on the eSprinter. At least those will go about 200 miles, depending on the conditions. It’s not quite as sexy as 286 miles, but it seems to be better than the other options. Or, perhaps maybe Harbinger can make a camper van. With GM out of the market, there’s probably a void to be filled. Harbinger has already teamed up with Grounded to make the C1 all-electric or plug-in hybrid mobile command center; maybe some of those could be made into campers one day.

Or, perhaps, because of the changing climate around politics and EVs in America, maybe the BrightDrop doesn’t need a replacement. I’m not really sure what’s going to happen, but I can say that all of this whiplash about what EVs may or may not exist is absolutely headache-inducing.

The good news is that, for now, if you want to get a BrightDrop-based camper van, I’d buy one now before the stock dries up. After they’re gone, it will be interesting to see if and how electric camper van builders pivot. Either way, I hope this doesn’t discourage the RV industry as a whole. It’s still worthwhile to rid RVs of emissions and it’s still worthwhile to try out new tech in motorhomes.

From the September / October 2025 Issue

In 2025, Texas has continued to reinforce its status in economic growth by pursuing a multi-pronged strategy centered on workforce expansion, business-friendly policies, infrastructure development, and strategic incentives.

January data from the Texas Workforce Commission revealed a labor force of 15.75 million Texans working—a new record—and a total of 14.24 million nonfarm jobs, representing an increase of 187,700 jobs over the previous year. In spring 2025, these numbers grew. By May, Texas had added 215,500 nonfarm jobs since April 2024.

A cornerstone of this success is the newly released “Bigger, Better, Texas” five-year economic development strategic plan, which is designed to coordinate regional, sector-specific growth initiatives. Emphasizing collaboration in favor of top-down mandates, the plan empowers local communities, identifies target industries, and channels investment toward global competitiveness.

Texas has prioritized career and technical education. Funding passed through initiatives such as House Bills 20 and 120 that aim to expand job training pathways, while grants have underwritten customized programs in healthcare, manufacturing, accounting, and other high-demand fields.

Texas continues to offer the Texas Enterprise Fund, which provides deal-closing grants to companies weighing Texas against out-of-state options, and the Enterprise Zone Program, which offers sales and use tax refunds to companies investing in distressed areas and employing underserved populations.

The state has also introduced newer tools tailored to emerging industries and large-scale developments. The Jobs, Energy, Technology, and Innovation (JETI) program offers significant school property tax abatements for capital-intensive projects in fields such as manufacturing, logistics, and infrastructure. These abatements can last up to 10 years, encouraging companies to make-long term commitments to Texas communities.

Another standout in 2025 has been the expanded film and media incentive program, funded by Senate Bill 22. With $300 million allocated for the next two years, Texas has become a rising hub for media production. State lawmakers have proposed legislation like Senate Bill 878 to cap incentive durations and increase public oversight.

Tomball, TX: One Of The Nation’s Biggest Backyards

The city of Tomball, Texas, nestled in one of the nation’s most appealing major metropolitan areas, uses its ideal location, easy access to workforce, and exceptional education options to help businesses thrive.

Situated just 28 miles from downtown Houston and located in the third most populous county in the United States, Tomball has evolved into a delightful destination where businesses and families can prosper. Harris County’s area spans enough square miles to fit the cities of Austin, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, New York City, and Seattle inside its borders.

With nearly eight million people in the Houston area, businesses based in Tomball reap the benefit of a massive audience of customers and job seekers via major transportation options. George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), less than a half hour drive from Tomball, serves as a key advantage for local businesses with 25 airlines flying nonstop to five continents. State Highway 249 (The Tomball Parkway) and the currently expanding State Highway 99 (The Grand Parkway) run directly through Tomball, while Interstate 45 and Beltway 8 are each merely minutes from the city. These highways provide easy access to downtown Houston and all markets from Dallas to Galveston while Port Houston, the busiest port in the United States and one of the most vital industrial and logistics hubs in the world, is situated only 40 miles from Tomball.

While the greater Houston region offers a massive economic footprint, a job-ready workforce is available to Tomball employers right in their backyard. Since 2011, a period during which the city has seen its population spike by 20%, the Tomball Economic Development Corporation (TEDC) has aided in creating more than 5,000 local jobs by delivering nearly $500 million in capital investment from businesses. While experiencing growth, the city and its partners remain centered on training and educating workers for in-demand occupations.

The TEDC spearheads a highly acclaimed Summer Youth Employment Program. Offered to students aged 16-20 (up to 22 years old for individuals with disabilities) who attend Tomball high schools or colleges, youth receive paid summer employment in local industries like healthcare, manufacturing, marketing, media, real estate, and education. After a successful pilot year in 2024, the initiative expanded to 20 participating companies in 2025 and was recognized with the 2025 Workforce Excellence Award from the Texas Economic Development Council.

Tomball’s pledge to premier education and the development of a skilled and ready workforce have created a transcendent educational coalition capable of building the next generation of Tomball’s leaders and labor force. The award-winning Tomball Independent School District, serving more than 23,000 students across 25 campuses, is the highest-rated large district in the state of Texas and has received the highest possible rating (“A”) from the Texas Education Agency for six consecutive years. Lone Star College-Tomball, part of the largest community college system in Texas, teaches and trains students to work in high demand careers.

Port Of Corpus Christi Reaches Global Markets

The Port of Corpus Christi is located on the Texas Gulf Coast, only 150 miles north of the U.S.–Mexico border. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, the Port of Corpus Christi is one of the most strategically positioned and least congested metropolitan areas in the United States.

The Corpus Christi Ship Channel, strategically located on the western Gulf Coast with a 38-mile, 54-foot (MLLW) deep channel, provides quick and efficient sail time to deep blue water, giving a faster turnaround for vessels. The Port of Corpus Christi has exceptional highway connectivity via Interstate 37, Interstate 69, U.S. Highway 181, and the Joe Fulton International Trade Corridor, ensuring seamless ground transportation to major domestic markets. The Port of Corpus Christi also has direct access to three Class I railroads, including the Union Pacific, BNSF Railway, and Canadian Pacific Kansas City, all of which provide comprehensive rail options for cargo movement. The Port of Corpus Christi is a hub for extensive pipeline infrastructure, supporting the efficient transport of oil, gas and refined products.

Coupled with a warm, dry South Texas climate that supports year-round operations, the Port of Corpus Christi delivers unmatched efficiency, connectivity, and cost-effectiveness for global commerce.

The Port of Corpus Christi and its customers moved 206.5 million tons through the Corpus Christi Ship Channel in 2024, a new high mark driven by increases in crude oil and dry bulk commodities, including agricultural products.

Port customers ended 2024 with record quarterly tonnage of 54 million tons in Q4—a 4.3% increase over the same period in the prior year and a 1.9% increase over the previous record quarter (53.0 million tons, Q3 2024). Leading commodities in Q4 2024 included crude oil, refined products, and liquified natural gas. For the year, crude oil shipments increased 3.5% over 2023 to 130.5 million tons, while dry bulk and agricultural goods increased 8.1% and 38.7%, respectively. The new annual tonnage record is 1.7% higher than the previous record set in 2023, marking the seventh consecutive record year set by Port of Corpus Christi customers.

Channel Depth. June 2025 marked the completion of the historic Corpus Christi Ship Channel Improvement Project (CIP). The unprecedented four-phase CIP was conceived more than three decades ago as a massive undertaking to enhance navigational infrastructure—ultimately deepening the ship channel from 47 to 54 feet MLLW and widening it from 400 to 530 feet with additional barge shelves—to accommodate the growing demand for larger vessels needed by Port customers.

C-TPAT and FTZ 122. In 2003, U.S. Customs and Border Protection gave Port of Corpus Christi its official certification as a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program. The C-TPAT program facilitates partnerships between businesses and government to develop working relationships to protect global commerce against terrorism. The program provides the framework for trading communities to develop security policies and procedures. Once established, importers will be given preferential processing by Customs. The C-TPAT program recognizes the added security that such practices bring to the internal supply chain’s final leg and considers the use of FTZs to be a “C-TPAT Supply Chain Security Best Practice.”

The Port of Corpus Christi Foreign-Trade Zone Manager, in conjunction with the Customs Port Director, hosts quarterly meetings with local FTZ operators and users to discuss challenges, develop resolutions, provide updates, and address FTZ issues.

Top Discussion Points

As major economies pursue green industrial policies to drive decarbonization and grow their low-carbon industries, other countries fear that the resulting trade impacts may disadvantage them in the global net-zero transition.

These rising climate-trade tensions, coming against a global backdrop of increased fragmentation, weakening trade norms, and deepening geopolitical rivalries, risk undermining countries’ climate, trade, and development objectives.

New avenues of cooperation can ease climate-trade frictions and unlock climate-aligned trade and investment, helping open significant economic opportunities for many countries and strengthen global climate action.

In the fall of 2024, the Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP) at Columbia University SIPA launched the International Dialogue on Climate and Trade to afford governments and stakeholders opportunities to seek common ground on ways of more effectively and equitably managing issues at the intersection of climate and trade.

Phase one of the dialogue involved regional workshops in Brazil, Singapore, and South Africa that included more than 100 participants from 22 governments, as well as academia, think tanks, the private sector, labor, and civil society. The discussions focused on the sources of rising tension at the climate-trade interface and identified potential pathways for cooperative action to better align climate and trade objectives. The workshops were conducted under the Chatham House Rule, though participants agreed to be identified (see the Appendix).

Trade is an essential enabler of climate action—there is no path to net zero without leveraging trade. Increasingly, however, trade and climate objectives are colliding. As major powers pursue green industrial policies to drive decarbonization and grow their low-carbon industries, other countries fear that the resulting trade impacts may disadvantage them in the global net-zero transition.

In surveying perspectives among government officials, stakeholders, and experts, the dialogue found widespread concern across geographies and spheres that climate-trade conflicts, if allowed to escalate, will increasingly pose obstacles to trade and to achieving countries’ climate, economic, and development ambitions.

The potential for climate policies to affect trade flows was anticipated at the very start of the global climate effort. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the agreed foundation for that effort, cautions that such measures “should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.”[1]

These long-latent tensions are now open conflicts, triggered largely by the green industrial policies of major powers, including China, Europe, and, until recently, the United States. These policies, which include clean energy subsidies, green standards, and carbon border measures, are designed, at least in part, to decarbonize economies, including by preventing carbon leakage. But, as participants noted, most are equally shaped by economic objectives—creating jobs and protecting or strengthening national competitiveness. Many also are justified on energy and national security grounds, particularly as they relate to securing supply chains and critical minerals.

Some dialogue participants emphasized how, in domestic political contexts, this “bundling” of priorities has been important in helping establish and sustain political support for strong climate action. Beyond potential domestic benefits, it was noted that green industrial policies can have positive cross-border spillover effects by lowering the cost of clean technologies and creating incentives for stronger climate action globally.

As economic levers, however, these policies bear invariably, and in some cases by design, on international trade flows. As was evident in the course of the dialogue, the central issues now arising are whether these policies and their impacts are on balance fair and are in keeping with countries’ climate and trade obligations. Countries potentially disadvantaged by these trade-related climate policies—whether developed, emerging, or developing—question whether they are a form of “green protectionism” that makes it harder for them to attract investment and compete in the clean energy and the broader net-zero transition.

As countries strengthen and implement their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, differences in levels of ambition are likely to continue to be reflected in differences in compliance costs among economies, raising the risks of carbon leakage and the need for policies to address them.

Climate-trade conflicts are arising against a global backdrop of increased fragmentation, weakening trade norms, and deepening geopolitical rivalries, amplified by the present US administration’s aggressive trade policies.

Dialogue participants observed that climate-trade tensions are arriving at a time when the global order as a whole faces unprecedented stress. They also recognized that established norms and processes were fraying even ahead of the United States’ wholesale retreat from international alliances and agreements, with countries beginning to tilt toward unilateral action rather than multilateral solutions.

In the trade sphere, the World Trade Organization (WTO) is virtually paralyzed, while a wider array of political, strategic, and economic forces contributes to the fragmentation of global trade. Deepening geopolitical rivalries, meanwhile, have bred economic nationalism tied in some cases to national security agendas.[2] Climate-trade tensions arise within—and have become deeply enmeshed with—this broader geopolitical context. Green industrial policies aimed at securing clean energy supply chains, for instance, may be as often instruments of economic and national security as enablers of climate action.

Some participants saw the recent actions of the Trump administration, including foremost its weaponization of trade, as further undermining the feasibility of rules-based cooperation and injecting new uncertainties into the evolving geopolitical order. Yet there was broad recognition within the dialogue that climate-trade tensions will remain a class of issues that countries must seek to address cooperatively and pragmatically regardless of the course of broader events.

If allowed to escalate, climate-trade tensions threaten to undermine countries’ climate, trade, and development objectives. Alternatively, closer cooperation can help unlock climate-aligned trade and investment, opening significant economic opportunities for many countries.

Dialogue participants expressed strong concern that present climate-trade antagonisms could significantly escalate, potentially triggering a rising spiral of export bans, countervailing duties, and other retaliatory measures. Growing barriers and fragmentation could impede investment and trade in the raw materials, technologies, and infrastructure needed to decarbonize economies, while also harming many countries’ broader economic and development interests. Developing countries, in particular, are deeply concerned that they could find it harder to access global markets and face further obstacles to climate finance.

Conversely, dialogue participants saw significant benefits in closer cooperation among governments at the climate-trade interface. Apart from encouraging a generally freer flow of decarbonizing goods and services, such cooperation could help countries and regions address key needs and priorities and secure a stronger footing in the net-zero transition. Cited examples include developing an integrated ASEAN power grid, which would support regional energy security and decarbonization; critical mineral reserves in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in ways that enable these regions to contribute on equitable terms to the clean-energy transition; greenhouse gas standards in carbon-intensive sectors that incentivize and reward production in regions with natural clean power assets; and green industrialization and regional value chains within the African Continental Free Trade Area to help strengthen Africa’s position in the net-zero transition.

While many emerging and developing countries are now fashioning their own forms of green industrial policy to better position their industries and economies, dialogue participants observed that fully realizing such opportunities will require overcoming a broader array of obstacles, including inadequate capacity, infrastructure and investment flows, high finance costs, and heavy tax and debt burdens.

Climate-trade tensions stem in part from long-standing frictions between developed and developing countries over the equity impacts of both climate change and countries’ responses to it.

The emerging clashes between climate and trade are to some degree a manifestation of the struggle over equity and fairness at the core of global climate debate since its very start. Dialogue participants noted that, broadly speaking, developing countries, which historically contributed less to global warming than developed countries, are at the same time more vulnerable to climate impacts and have less capacity for climate mitigation and adaptation. These equity considerations are reflected in the core UNFCCC principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” (CBDR), amended in subsequent agreements with the phrases “and respective capabilities” (CBDR-RC) and “in the light of different national circumstances,” largely in recognition of the significant economic advances made by many developing countries since the launch of the climate effort. Differing interpretations of this principle, and differing views on the continuing relevance of the historic distinction between developed and developing countries, remain central to UNFCCC negotiations.

Within the trade realm, the related WTO principle of Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) for countries at earlier stages of development has been reflected across trade agreements in provisions granting developing countries longer implementation timelines, greater flexibility in commitments, and preferential market access. Some developed countries are now contesting the application of S&DT and pressing for stricter eligibility criteria.

Against this backdrop, some participants viewed negative spillovers from unilateral climate measures as a further form of climate inequity. Many in the Global South view green industrial policies in the North as inherently trade-distorting, concentrating green investment in developed countries and placing developing countries at a competitive disadvantage in the net-zero transition. Some view these policies as an alternative de facto trade framework that defies established multilateral norms and shifts climate burdens to the South.

Dialogue participants cited the following specific concerns: many developing countries lack the fiscal capacity to compete on green subsidies; many lack technical, financial, and institutional capacity to meet new green trade requirements (e.g., traceability systems, product-level emissions tracking, and standards compliance); and many believe their industries and exports are penalized by standards that don’t accommodate regional differences by, for instance, failing to fully credit the decarbonization benefits of biomass and hydropower. Participants in the Brazil workshop spoke of the need to “tropicalize” green standards.

Other dialogue participants, while acknowledging potential equity impacts, viewed trade-related climate policies as fully within the nature of NDCs under the Paris Agreement and the right of countries to undertake trade-restrictive measures, provided they are not arbitrary, unjustifiable, or disguised trade restrictions. With respect to specific policies, discussions in some cases are emerging over potential adjustments to better address developing country concerns, the most prominent example being the European Union’s recent streamlining of its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

Climate-trade conflicts have begun playing out in respective multilateral settings—the UNFCCC and the WTO—but with little prospect of meaningful near-term resolutions.

At the two most recent UNFCCC Conferences of the Parties (COPs), developing countries pushed strenuously but without success to place “unilateral trade measures” on the negotiating agenda. One modest step at COP29 was the addition of an item to the workplan of the UNFCCC body addressing “response measures”—to “analyse, assess and report on the impacts of measures taken to combat climate change, including cross-border impacts.”[3] However, given the politically charged nature of the issues, as well as the need for decisions to be taken by consensus, the UNFCCC appears unlikely to make substantive progress on climate-trade conflicts.

At the WTO, climate-trade issues are a growing focus of discussion within the standing Committee on Trade and Environment and the Trade and Environmental Sustainability Structured Discussions launched in 2020. They also are arising in formal challenges to members’ policies, including Russia’s recent challenge to the EU CBAM and China’s complaint against US tariffs on electric vehicles, batteries, and other clean-energy goods.[4]

Yet there was broad recognition within the dialogue that, as presently configured, the trade system is not well suited to reconciling climate and trade. As the participants discussed, the regime lacks clear rules for weighing a policy’s climate benefit against its impact on trade (e.g., the WTO’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures focuses solely on the trade effects of subsidies and allows no exceptions or balancing for climate or sustainability purposes[5]). More fundamentally, the WTO regime remains institutionally and politically hamstrung , with little near-term prospect of reviving its appellate function.

As climate-trade issues naturally pertain to both regimes, countries can argue in one regime that they should instead be taken up in the other. The picture that emerges from the dialogue, however, is that the issues fit squarely within neither but rather fall between them. While participants saw continued discussions within the WTO and UNFCCC as a valuable means of clarifying views and establishing a shared knowledge base, they had little expectation that either regime would produce tangible outcomes in the foreseeable future.

Outside the UNFCCC and WTO, countries have begun to take up issues at the intersection of climate and trade in a growing number of plurilateral and ad hoc forums—undertaking analysis, examining policy options, outlining principles, and establishing binding commitments.

Dialogue participants reported on a growing array of efforts among governments touching on issues at the climate-trade interface. The initiatives vary in character and intent; taken together, they suggest a possible hierarchy or progression of efforts.

As one example at the bilateral level, the Australia-Singapore Green Economy Agreement,[6] which establishes a framework for enhanced cooperation to grow green sectors and undertake joint projects, was seen as fostering “new habits” of cooperation. At the plurilateral level, relevant initiatives include the following:

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Inclusive Forum on Carbon Mitigation Approaches (IFCMA), which is undertaking technical analysis of carbon intensity metrics to enable comparability across jurisdictions, an important foundation for stronger cooperative approaches.[7]

The Climate Club launched by the G7, which provides a forum for policy dialogue, including at leader level, on reducing carbon leakage and advancing industrial decarbonization. A growing number of non-G7 countries are participating, though no major emerging economies have joined.[8]

A set of efforts launched recently by the BRICS group, which include recommended carbon accounting principles, proposals on the sharing of intellectual property rights, and a “laboratory” to analyze the effects of “hybrid” climate-trade policies.[9]

The recent G20 Principles on Trade and Sustainable Development, which, rather than invoking the WTO, UNFCCC, or other agreements, offer a synthesis and refinement of relevant guiding principles.[10]

The Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), which establishes enforceable commitments among parties—for instance, to eliminate tariffs on green goods and phase out some fossil fuel subsidies. One lesson from the ACCTS negotiations is the importance of quality data in aligning efforts. Though initially engaging only a handful of countries, the ACCTS’s “open plurilateral” architecture, which enables others to join, may serve as a model for similar agreements.[11]

An essential foundation for cooperation at the climate-trade nexus—and for accelerating decarbonization more broadly—is the establishment of shared norms and comparable methodologies for carbon accounting.

Issues around emissions accounting were not initially presented for discussion but, in the course of the dialogue, emerged as central to understanding and addressing climate-trade tensions.

Measures that condition the flow of goods on the basis of the direct (and, in some cases, indirect) emissions generated in their production must rely on methodologies for the measurement (or estimation) and verification of these “embedded emissions.” In the absence of broadly agreed-upon approaches, differing and often conflicting methodologies have been introduced by governments and by nongovernmental initiatives aimed at facilitating emissions transparency and reduction. Dialogue participants reported that, increasingly, these divergent approaches present barriers to trade by increasing the cost and complexity of market access, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises.

The IFCMA, based on an analysis of carbon metrics with an eye toward promoting greater comparability among them, recommended three guiding principles: seeking “proportionality” (an appropriate balance between data accuracy needs and the resources required to meet them), promoting innovation while preserving markets, and fostering interoperability (e.g., via mutual recognition among systems rather than full harmonization).[12]

Alignment on carbon accounting is not a purely technical challenge. Participants from developing countries, emphasizing their limited capacity and infrastructure to measure and track emissions through supply chains, called for greater flexibility in accounting approaches to accommodate such differences. The carbon accounting principles put forward by BRICS countries, citing the UNFCCC principle of CBDR-RC, include principles addressing both equity (“the need for recognition of varying national circumstances, capabilities and responsibilities”) and fairness (putting differing low-emissions pathways “on an equal footing” through “context-aware” requirements that reflect “what is achievable…in a given sector and geographical region”).[13]

A deeper analysis of equity-related issues and options in carbon accounting was a clear priority among participants for achieving broader agreement on managing climate-trade issues.

As more countries move forward with carbon border measures, steps to ensure some form of interoperability will help ease compliance burdens for exporters and avoid unnecessary trade barriers.

Without question, the measure that has generated the greatest attention and resistance is the EU CBAM, which will levy charges on imports in certain carbon-intensive sectors roughly equivalent to those faced by domestic producers under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In public settings, developing countries, led by the major emerging economies, have steadfastly opposed CBAM-like measures as “green protectionism.”[14]

Yet a more nuanced picture emerged in the dialogue. While some developing country participants voiced strong concerns about specific aspects of the measure, others, from both governments and the private sector, also noted that CBAM has helpfully advanced consideration of carbon pricing options. Indeed, numerous developing countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, are moving toward establishing carbon pricing policies—in part to ensure that any carbon revenues generated are retained domestically rather than paid to the EU or another importing country — and some reportedly are considering border measures of their own.[15]

Border measures are at various stages of consideration or adoption in other developed countries as well, including Australia, Canada, and the UK.[16] In the United States, the Trump administration is not openly weighing carbon as a potential factor in its calculation of tariffs. But the Republican-sponsored Foreign Pollution Fee Act recently reintroduced in the US Senate would impose fees on certain imports from countries with higher-emitting industries.[17] The measure differs markedly from the EU CBAM—there would be no corresponding domestic carbon constraint, and the fee would be based on an import’s greenhouse gas intensity rather than a carbon price.

Dialogue participants expressed concern that a growing patchwork of disparate border measures could further fragment global trade, raise costs for businesses, create uncertainties for long-term investment, and hinder the flow of clean technology. Many emphasized the importance of ensuring some measure of “interoperability” among emerging border measure systems to ease compliance, avoid new trade barriers, and maximize climate benefits.

Options presented included an agreed code of conduct, some form of mutual recognition among systems, de minimis standards exempting low-income/low-export countries, and recycling of carbon tariff revenue to support developing country decarbonization. It was suggested that equity-related concerns could be addressed by coupling carbon fees with other measures or partnerships that could help meet developing countries’ capacity and investment needs.

Using sectoral greenhouse gas intensity standards to help decarbonize key sectors offers a promising avenue to align climate and trade objectives.

A discussion of nontariff measures early in the dialogue led to a focus on both challenges and opportunities in the widening use of sustainability standards to manage emissions in key sectors.

While there was broad recognition of the utility of product- and performance-based standards in driving decarbonization, there was also significant concern about the growing profusion of heterogeneous standards, both regulatory and voluntary, across jurisdictions, as well as the divergent carbon accounting and measurement, reporting, and verification methodologies underlying them. Private sector participants emphasized the challenges, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises, of complying with different standards in different settings and warned of rising barriers to clean trade.

Some developing country participants also expressed the strong view that standards developed in the North, when applied to imports, often fail to account for the differing circumstances of exporting countries. Latin American participants, for instance, objected that measures such as the EU’s Deforestation Regulation do not adequately credit the region’s sustainability assets in their treatment of biomass-based fuels and nature-based carbon removal.

There was strong interest in exploring the potential for closer alignment among standards. Initiatives such as the Carbon Club demonstrate growing convergence around standards in carbon-intensive industrial sectors such as steel and cement.[18] Participants from companies in these and other sectors investing in sustainability said greater consistency and rigor in the application of standards would help justify these investments by ensuring their products earn the “green premium” they embody. It was reported that an emerging coalition of companies seeking to build markets for lower-carbon products and technologies may soon begin advocating for tradable performance-based standards in carbon-intensive sectors.

The general view was that while industry-led standards may be more politically viable in the near term, regulatory backing will likely be required over time to level the playing field and ensure compliance. Many participants also argued that incorporating flexibility for regional differences would help ensure that any emerging framework rewards sustainability rather than geography.

A new “architecture” to manage issues at the climate-trade nexus more effectively and equitably could emerge as a mosaic of bilateral and plurilateral efforts among differing and overlapping groups of countries, which could then inform or evolve into broader multilateral undertakings.

According to many dialogue participants, particularly those from developing countries, climate-trade tensions largely stem from the willingness of some countries to abuse or abandon multilateral norms and institutions, and solutions should ideally be fashioned within the established multilateral order. Yet, given both the fractured state of global relations generally and the particular obstacles faced within the WTO and the UNFCCC, there was simultaneously a broad sense that any overarching multilateral resolution of the conflicts arising at the intersection of climate and trade is unlikely in the near term.

What appears more feasible at this stage is a scaling-up of the types of initiatives now emerging within bilateral and plurilateral settings into a broader constellation of cooperative efforts, each tackling a given aspect of climate-trade relations. Some efforts might address a particular technical, policy, or political dimension—such as accounting methodologies, sectoral standards, or guiding principles—or a combination thereof. Some efforts might arise from a convergence of economic or strategic interests within a given region or among like-minded countries.

In this scenario discussed by participants, there would emerge not a single “architecture” but multiple architectures, ideally more complementary than competing, that can inaugurate and extend shared norms and practices. What such an approach may lack in policy coherence or multilateral embrace, it may make up in political feasibility. And, if successful, it could helpfully inform and, over time, form a stronger political foundation for broader multilateral frameworks.

The dialogue raised several considerations that could be useful in fashioning a next generation of cooperative climate-trade efforts:

Particularly in a more ad hoc approach, it will be important to maximize value and minimize duplication by orienting efforts toward distinct and, ideally, complementary functions.

Alignment on climate and trade will be easier to achieve if they are understood and addressed within the context of countries’ broader economic and development needs and objectives.

It will be especially important to better understand the interplay with finance and investment—how policies at the climate-trade interface can serve either to impede or to help unlock the investment needed for shared prosperity in the net-zero transition.

While it is important to seek alignment on principles, issues of equity and fairness may be more readily addressed through a close consideration of practical issues and options within given contexts.

The linkage of political interests necessary for agreed outcomes may entail a linkage of instruments—for instance, blending border measures with partnerships or forms of assistance to help ensure mutual net benefits.

An essential next step is a neutral forum bridging climate and trade disciplines, as well as North and South groupings, to deepen mutual understanding of the challenges and opportunities and to seek shared principles and cooperative solutions.

One critical gap identified in the dialogue is a credible, more inclusive forum outside the WTO and the UNFCCC where governments can exchange information and views and explore pathways forward. An “interdisciplinary” forum could straddle and draw expertise from both the climate and trade realms. If thoughtfully designed, it could also reach across the North-South divide, drawing in countries presently siloed in efforts associated more with one camp than another.

Rather than a new standing institution, such a forum could be an interim space for open-ended dialogue. Interested governments, having entered voluntarily, may be less inclined to “escape” by objecting that the issues under discussion belong elsewhere. Any outcomes could serve to inform deliberations and action within established forums or provide a basis for new intergovernmental agreements or initiatives.

According to the participants, one valuable function of such a forum would be to help deescalate climate-trade relations and strengthen the trust needed to achieve cooperative solutions. Identifying common ground on core political issues while making further progress on more technical dimensions could open the way for more effective, inclusive, and equitable approaches. CGEP’s International Dialogue on Climate and Trade, in seeking to advance these aims, can serve as a modest starting point for a fuller effort led by governments to broaden and elevate these critical discussions.

This announcement took place at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, which partners with Bourne High School on an Early College pilot, one of the programs under the administration’s Reimagining High School initiative.
Bourne High School currently offers four Innovation Career Pathways and is receiving a grant to plan a new pathway.
“In less than five years, we have built a dynamic Innovation Career Pathways program that has transformed the high school experience.
Since taking office, the administration has expanded Innovation Career Pathways to 82 additional high schools, adding 132 new programs across the state.","BOURNE — As part of Massachusetts STEM Week, the Healey-Driscoll Administration today announced nearly $5.4 million in grants to expand Innovation Career Pathways programs that give high school students hands-on learning experiences in high-demand STEM fields. This investment includes planning grants for 26 high schools, ten of which are first-time applicants, as well as implementation grants for 88 high schools to sustain existing pathways. Through these programs, students explore STEM-related careers, take advanced coursework, and gain real-world experience through internships and work-based learning — all at no cost to them.

“STEM Week reminds us that innovation isn’t just a future goal — it’s happening here and now,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Massachusetts is a national leader in innovation education because we don’t just set the bar — we raise it. Through Innovation Career Pathways and partnerships like the one Bourne High School, we’re showing that STEM learning starts early, continues throughout life, and leads directly to opportunity in our communities and our economy.”

“We’re thrilled that nearly 30 percent of eligible high schools are offering Innovation Career Pathways this school year,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “These programs don’t just give students real-world experience — they connect them to the industries driving Massachusetts’ future. That’s why we’re investing in more planning grants, so even more students can access these opportunities. STEM Week is a powerful reminder of what’s possible when schools, employers, and communities work together to open new doors for our students.”

This school year, Innovation Career Pathways are offered in nearly 30 percent of eligible high schools across Massachusetts, engaging more than 8,500 students in 262 pathways across 117 schools. The planning grants announced today will help high schools design new pathways that align with local workforce needs, particularly in high demand industries like advanced manufacturing, information technology, environmental and life sciences, clean energy, and health care. These grants also support partnerships between schools, employers, higher education institutions, and workforce boards to ensure students are learning skills relevant to their regional economies.

“Transforming the high school experience means giving students the tools and opportunities to see what’s possible for their future — and Innovation Career Pathways do exactly that,” said Education Secretary Dr. Patrick Tutwiler. “During STEM Week, it’s incredible to see how students light up when learning becomes hands-on, purposeful, and connected to the world around them.”

“We want students to have access to learning that connects them to jobs in the Massachusetts innovation economy,” said Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez. Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez. “Innovation Career Pathways help show students how what they’re learning today can lead to a promising job tomorrow.”

“I have been working closely with the Healey-Driscoll Administrations’ Executive Office of Education (EOE) on making significant investments in public education in the Commonwealth. I’m proud to have helped secure over $5.4 million in Career Pathways Programs that provide high school students direct experience in the critical STEM educational discipline. The Apponequet Regional High School, serving Freetown and Lakeville in my district, will receive an important planning grant to lay the foundation for these students to compete in a global economy. These grants will enable students to take advanced coursework and gain real-world experience through internships and work-based learning, great news to recognize Massachusetts STEM Week!” said Senator Michael J. Rodrigues (D-Westport), Chair of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means.

“Congratulations to the many high schools receiving grants this year as we expand the Innovation Career Pathways statewide program,” said Senator Jason Lewis (D-5th Middlesex), Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Education. “These programs provide new avenues for students to explore a number of high-demand industries and have more hands-on learning opportunities while in high school.”

“The Innovation Career Pathways program opens doors to life-changing opportunities for our high school students,” said Representative Ken Gordon (D-Bedford), House Chair of the Joint Committee on Education. “By offering hands-on STEM education, we are empowering students to shape their futures and strengthening our workforce.""

This announcement took place at Massachusetts Maritime Academy, which partners with Bourne High School on an Early College pilot, one of the programs under the administration’s Reimagining High School initiative. Bourne High School currently offers four Innovation Career Pathways and is receiving a grant to plan a new pathway. The administration joined local officials to celebrate this event as a part of Massachusetts STEM Week 2025, held Monday, October 20 through Friday, October 24, which celebrates the message that “STEM Starts Now.” STEM Week highlights that at any age — from our youngest learners to adult learners — everyone can engage with STEM and discover opportunities that connect curiosity to career. Across the state, schools, employers, and communities are coming together to show that STEM learning and STEM jobs are happening here and now in Massachusetts, driving innovation and opportunity in every region of the state.

“At Bourne Public Schools, our district vision — ‘Inspired to learn, empowered to explore, and prepared to act’ — is alive and thriving at Bourne High School, where—even as a small, traditional high school—we are reimagining education,” said Bourne Public Schools Superintendent Kerri Anne Quinlan-Zhou. “In less than five years, we have built a dynamic Innovation Career Pathways program that has transformed the high school experience. We believe deeply in the pathway model because it gives every student access to engaging, hands-on learning experiences that connect academic content to meaningful, future-focused opportunities.”

In 2023, the administration launched a new Clean Energy Pathway, now offered in 10 schools. Since taking office, the administration has expanded Innovation Career Pathways to 82 additional high schools, adding 132 new programs across the state. Through the administration’s broader Reimagining High School initiative, Massachusetts is investing in programs that connect classroom learning to real-world experience and emerging industries. Just yesterday, the administration awarded $13.5 Million in Skills Capital Grants to expand access to hands-on learning opportunities and state-of-the-art technology in schools and colleges across Massachusetts. Over the past two and a half years, the administration has approved 49 new Career Technical Education (CTE) programs and opened applications for $60 million in CTE capital grants to create more than 2,000 new CTE seats. These investments build on expansions to Early College programs, work-based learning opportunities, and My Career and Academic Plan (MyCAP).

“Massachusetts Maritime Academy is fortunate to have a longstanding collaborative relationship with Bourne High School, and our partnership with them on the Early College Program provides even more opportunities for all of our students to explore a variety of careers,” said Rear Admiral Francis X. McDonald, USMS, president of Massachusetts Maritime Academy. “We’re incredibly grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration for creating this program under their Reimagining High School Initiative, and to have had the opportunity to welcome Secretary Tutwiler, Commissioner Martinez, and other representatives from the Commonwealth to demonstrate how we’re incorporating virtual STEM into practical and hands-on learning as well as discuss co-op and internship opportunities and post-college pathways.”

And so, Zorich has decided to fund the creation of the Global Institute for the Future of Energy at Arizona State University with a $50 million gift.
The institute will expand access to energy information and develop practical solutions that advance global energy systems while supporting human flourishing.
“Energy is central to nearly every facet of our daily lives, and we have to prepare now for an evolving energy future,” Crow said.
“This is an opportunity to have a global impact on the future of energy, and ASU is uniquely positioned for that,” Zorich said.","The idea had been tugging at him for years. Whenever Bob Zorich read headlines about energy policy or listened to debates that felt more like shouting matches than discussions, the same thought returned: People don’t really understand energy.

It wasn’t their fault, he knew. For generations, the subject had been siloed or glossed over, reducing something as fundamental as power and fuel to a few scattered lessons. The result was predictable — a public underprepared to wrestle with the choices that would shape society’s global energy future.

And so, Zorich has decided to fund the creation of the Global Institute for the Future of Energy at Arizona State University with a $50 million gift. The new initiative, a collaboration between the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and Thunderbird School of Global Management at ASU, was launched in Houston on Tuesday during a panel event featuring Zorich, ASU leadership and industry experts.

The collaboration between the two ASU units will provide the institute with the energy expertise of the Global Futures Laboratory and the global education leadership of Thunderbird, and the vast international networks of both units.

“ASU has long been a pioneer in building bold, pragmatic solutions for the future. With an enrollment exceeding 194,000 students annually across its in-person campuses and online, ASU continues to fulfill its charter,” said Zorich, managing partner and founder of Texas-based EnCap Investments and an alumnus of Thunderbird.

“President Michael Crow has taken a visionary and action-oriented approach to positioning the university as a leading center for research, educational excellence and global influence. For these reasons, I was excited to fund the formation of this energy institute at ASU because of the university’s unique ability to scale and reach a global audience.”

Zorich and Crow believe the institute will lead the way in energy education and innovation, helping people and organizations navigate and better understand complex energy issues. The institute will expand access to energy information and develop practical solutions that advance global energy systems while supporting human flourishing.

Zorich earned a master’s degree in international management in 1974 from the American Graduate School of International Management (now Thunderbird). A steadfast advocate for the university, he has long supported its mission and ongoing commitment to high-quality education access at scale and to energy innovation.

Crow sees the new institute as vital to advancing the U.S. and the world’s energy systems and everything that relies on it, from national security to economic development.

“Energy is central to nearly every facet of our daily lives, and we have to prepare now for an evolving energy future,” Crow said. “With the rapid growth of AI and other fast-moving innovations, we have a responsibility to ready the next generation of energy leaders and solutions. Bob Zorich’s visionary investment will empower our global understanding of energy, our vital literacy and how we can work together to develop the best paths forward.”

In addition to providing seed money for the new institute, Zorich’s gift will endow a chair, who will also serve as the director of the institute, to lead its work and create fellowships and scholarships to broaden access and opportunity.

Additionally, a portion of the gift will be allocated to sponsor “Energy Switch,” a point-counterpoint show on Arizona PBS that is produced by Switch Energy Alliance. The show brings together renowned experts from government, nongovernmental organizations, academia and industry with different perspectives on important energy topics.

“Transforming our energy systems is not a choice, it is a necessity. But it is also one of the greatest opportunities of our time,” said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures and director of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory. “If we align our decisions, incentives and values with the realities of the need for a transition of the energy system, we create not only a sustainable future but a foundation for energy system economic prosperity.”

The institute will focus on recruiting a new chair and core staff, and on developing curriculum for K-12, undergraduates, graduates, executives and the public, as well as public engagement opportunities.

In its second year, the institute will launch a fellowship and executive-in-residence program, bringing industry leaders directly into research, teaching and community engagement. It will also roll out a dynamic lineup of public programs — from a global energy conference and public lectures to online talks, hackathons and summer camps — sparking conversations and innovation in Arizona and beyond.

The world faces a silent energy crisis. Nearly 7 billion people in developing nations are striving for more power to improve daily life, while 1 billion in developed nations keep expanding their technological reach. The result: Today’s energy systems are straining under unprecedented pressure.

Zorich decided he couldn’t sit on the sideline any longer. He wanted to change the way the world learned about energy.

“People really don’t know where energy comes from, and 50 years ago when I started in this business, I was one of those people,” Zorich said. “I knew there was a hole in the side of a car where I placed the gasoline nozzle, and that’s what I knew. I had no idea the importance of energy.”

His search for the right home led him back to a familiar place. More than half a century earlier, he had walked the halls of Thunderbird. Since then, the school had been folded into Arizona State University, a learning institution that had undergone its own transformation. Under Crow, ASU had become a global force, welcoming nearly 200,000 students each year, measuring success not by exclusion, but by inclusion and achievement.

That spirit of bold pragmatism resonated with Zorich. If he wanted to spark a movement in energy education, this was the soil where it could grow.

“Bob Zorich’s visionary gift reflects the very spirit of Thunderbird — bringing together innovation, global perspective and practical impact to solve humanity’s most pressing challenges,” said Charla Griffy-Brown, director general and dean of Thunderbird School of Global Management. “Energy is the foundation of every economy, community and society, and this institute will prepare learners of all ages to engage with this challenge in thoughtful, pragmatic and transformative ways. We are honored to partner with Bob in creating a global hub that empowers the next generation of leaders.""

Zorich’s vision has been clear from the start: The institute will not preach ideology but instead would arm learners — from curious kindergartners to seasoned professionals — with a practical understanding of energy, including its complexities, trade-offs and the global importance of energy systems. They will learn its history, explore its density and costs, weigh its technological advantages and grapple with the realities of access and effectiveness.

“There’s a difference between affordable energy and aspirational energy. How do we gain energy abundance going into the future?” Zorich said. “The institute will look at what makes sense, what’s cost-effective and what creates the best answer for the most people.”

The institute is partnering with a trusted foundation for content development and distribution: “Switch Energy,” known for its energy-inclusive approach. But this is only the beginning. The institute will be transdisciplinary, weaving together economics, science, policy and technology. It will also be global, reaching beyond Arizona’s borders to classrooms and communities worldwide. And most importantly, it will be learner-centered, designed to spark curiosity rather than dictate conclusions.

For Zorich, the institute is more than an academic initiative. It is a personal mission, a legacy. He believes the choices humanity makes about energy will shape global societies for generations. And he is determined that those choices be guided not by rhetoric, but by understanding.

“This is an opportunity to have a global impact on the future of energy, and ASU is uniquely positioned for that,” Zorich said. “I think anyone who has a conscience wants to make the world a better place. And if you can do that, why wouldn’t you do that?”",https://news.asu.edu/sites/g/files/litvpz161/files/2025-10/20240611%20PowerLineHeatPhotos_579-Enhanced-NR%20%281%29.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 21:03:08.034886

The scorecards summarize indicators on air quality, extreme heat, natural hazards, flood risks, energy efficiency, health impacts of electricity emissions, greenhouse gas emissions from the health sector and commuting emissions from health care workers.
Thus, performing well on these indicators reflects not only health vulnerabilities to climate risks, but also impacts from the health sector on the environment.
Story ideas Here are some potential stories to consider: Find out how states are integrating health outcomes into climate adaptation plans.
The report card ends with policy recommendations, categorized as federal, state and local, or health care systems.","The Commonwealth Fund’s new scorecards on climate, health and health care unmask wide variation across states when it comes to carbon emission contributions and climate health vulnerabilities. Reporting on these differences can spotlight both accountability (why some states lag) and opportunity (what policies are working).

The scorecards summarize indicators on air quality, extreme heat, natural hazards, flood risks, energy efficiency, health impacts of electricity emissions, greenhouse gas emissions from the health sector and commuting emissions from health care workers. Thus, performing well on these indicators reflects not only health vulnerabilities to climate risks, but also impacts from the health sector on the environment.

“Extreme weather is no longer a distant threat — it’s happening more often and disrupting care across the nation,” Matthew J. Eckelman, report co-author and Northeastern University associate professor and associate chair for research of civil and environmental engineering, said in a news release. “No state is spared, and every community is vulnerable. But action matters. Our scorecard shows that states with strong clean energy and resilience policies are doing a better job protecting health and health care infrastructure, while other states leave patients exposed during potential crises.”

More about the report

The new report says, “We selected the indicators in part because they represent risks that can be mitigated through policy change at the local, state, or federal level or through proactive measures taken by health care systems.” That means that journalists can use these score cards to highlight policies that are needed or that are successful in their coverage regions.

Many of the scores are not complete surprises — for example, we tend to know which states are more vulnerable to floods or extreme heat. But the combination of data and the scorecard for each state contains important pointers for journalists.

How a state compares with other states with similar challenges can reveal much about its clever solutions and needs for improvement. For example, Cris Villalonga-Vivoni reported in Connecticut Insider the state’s scorecard performance with this lens, pointing out that the state’s performance lagged behind all its neighbors in the Northeast for its air quality and health impacts.

Story ideas

Here are some potential stories to consider:

Find out how states are integrating health outcomes into climate adaptation plans. Which hospitals sit in flood zones or wildfire corridors?

Investigate what is being done (or not) to harden health systems in vulnerable counties.

The models were made at CAMI Assembly in Ingersoll, Ontario and the company said the “commercial electric delivery van market developed much slower than expected.”

The automaker began producing the vans in late 2022, but the launch was a mess as BrightDrop was its own brand and had a tiny dealership network.

BrightDrop vans were eventually folded into Chevrolet last year, which promised to significantly expand sales beyond seven locations in the United States.

More: BrightDrop Becomes Part Of Chevrolet

Things didn’t pan out and unsold vehicles started piling up. GM recently offloaded 59 vans by donating them to the American Red Cross, but that was a drop in the bucket and the company paused production earlier this year.

Production was originally supposed to resume in May, before stopping again to allow for retooling for the 2026 model year. While production did briefly resume in May, BrightDrop is now dead and there will be no 2026 models.

GM blamed the move on a variety of factors including slow sales, a changing regulatory environment, and the elimination of tax credits in the United States.

They added the axing was part of “broader adjustments” being made to electric vehicle capacity in North America.

Needless to say, blue collar employees are getting the shaft for GM’s bad bet on EVs. In this case, the company said “hourly employees will receive six months of salary and the potential for lump sum payments and other benefits.” Furthermore, CAMI Assembly will be “assessed for future opportunities.”

The Unifor union was outraged and claimed the decision was the result of the Trump administration’s “dangerous and destabilizing auto policies.” Of course, that’s glossing over the fact that sales have been terrible for years.

However, this didn’t stop Unifor National President Lana Payne from saying, “The reality is that CAMI was hit from both directions by Trump as he aggressively acted to undo EV supports and hit Canadian auto assembly plants with a 25% tariff. Now more than 1,000 workers and their families are paying the price for Trump’s political interference and GM’s failure to hold the line.”

Other union officials said GM “abandoned” their employees, who “deserve a future at CAMI – not a dead end.” The anger is being further flamed by the decision to eliminate a shift at Oshawa Assembly in January, “heightening concerns about GM’s long-term manufacturing footprint in Canada.”

Given these developments, Unifor said they will meet with GM and the Canadian government to immediately “press for a new product mandate and ensure CAMI remains a pillar of Canadian auto production.”

GM Canada President Kristian Aquilina said, “The decision to end production of the BrightDrop electric delivery van is driven by market demand and in no way reflects the commitment and skill of our workforce at CAMI.” He added, “This continues to be an uncertain time for our workforce at CAMI, and we are committed to working closely with our employees, Unifor, and the Canadian and Ontario governments as we evaluate next steps for the future of CAMI.”",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gvrefd-c-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 20:18:39.050903

US President Donald Trump has targeted the nation’s own domestic wind industry for destruction, taking down thousands of businesses and many more thousands of working households along with it. Down, but not out. The wind will continue to blow long after the current occupant of the White House (or what remains of it) leaves office as scheduled on January 20, 2029, and wind stakeholders are already in position to pick up the pieces.

The US Wind Industry Is Still Chugging Along

Long before Trump took office earlier this year, the US wind industry was already facing pushback from fossil fuel stakeholders and local residents. A growing number of counties have passed new restrictions on wind development in recent years, and Trump’s second term in office has exposed the vulnerability of the offshore wind industry to sudden shifts in federal policy.

Still, the latest U.S. Wind Energy Monitor report from Wood Mackenzie and the organization American Clean Power indicates that the domestic wind industry still has enough wind in its sails, so to speak, to survive at least over the next five years.

The new report covers H1 (the first six months) 2025 and beyond. The H1 end of things is rather gloomy, with wind installations down 15% compared to the same period in 2024. The record looks even worse on a single-quarter basis. “The Q2 U.S. wind market installed 593 megawatts (MW), down 60% compared to Q2 2024,” the new report notes.

However, moving out of H1 and into Q3, the coming months look brighter. The new report projects that the US wind industry is on track to install 3.8 gigawatts through the first nine months of 2025, outpacing the nine-month record of 2024.

“Despite the slowdown in Q2, activity is projected to pick up, with 51% of forecasted capacity to come online in Q4, rounding out the annual 2025 total to 7.7 GW,” the report summarizes.

The US Wind Industry Is Going To Beat Coal

The US wind industry would be in a better position for future growth without the abrupt shift in federal energy policy this year, but some projects will continue to trickle through the pipeline. The new report arrives at an average figure for new wind capacity additions of 9.1 gigawatts annually through 2029, for a total of about 46 gigawatts.

As may be expected, the report anticipates that new onshore wind farms will account for most of the additions, at 35.5 gigawatts. Only 6 gigawatts will come from offshore wind. Repowering projects (upgrades to existing wind farms) will add another 4.5 gigawatts. All together, the US will land at a total wind power generating capacity of 196.5 gigawatts.

To put that in perspective, in July the US Energy Information Agency reported that the total operating capacity of coal power plants in the US currently stands at 172 gigawatts. With a number of retirement scheduled to take place, that figure will drop to 145 gigawatts by the end of 2028.

Even if the Trump administration succeeds in delaying scheduled coal retirements, wind capacity is all but certain to grow beyond the 172 gigawatt mark by 2029, if the new Wind Energy Monitor assessment holds true.

But…will it?

The Cracks In The Anti-Wind Wall

Maybe, maybe not. Wood Mackenzie director of research Leila Garcia da Fonseca notes that the current surge in activity comes from projects already in the pipeline. Forthcoming proposals face stiff headwinds, especially in the offshore area.

“Recent federal stop-work orders and regulatory uncertainty have disrupted offshore wind sector, weakening already fragile offtake opportunities and exposing the high investment risk in U.S. offshore wind development,” explains Garcia da Fonseca, though she does affirm the accuracy of the five year, 46-gigawatt assessment.

Fair enough. For better or worse, the AI data center boom has lit a renewable energy fire under red state policy makers on the legislative side and the utility side, too. As with the solar industry, the US wind industry has proven time and again that it can bring more kilowatts online more quickly, and less expensively, than traditional power plants.

Examples of red state support for renewable energy have been piling up, beyond US Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), whose well-known advocacy for the US wind industry spans decades. In Nevada, for example, Republican Governor Joe Lombardo has been begging the US Department of the Interior to stop putting roadblocks in the way of the 6.2-gigawatt Esmeralda 7 group of solar projects. Citing his state’s forthcoming data center boom, Lombardo’s plea centers on a proposed transmission line that will benefit wind developers, too.

Then there’s Indiana. A growing number of county governments in Indiana have been pushing back against wind projects, solar projects, or both. However, state leaders are desperate to accommodate data center developers. “With energy demands anticipated to rise significantly in the coming years, especially due to the buildout of AI and data centers, the speed at which wind and solar projects can be built is in their favor,” the news organization Indy Star noted on October 20.

Republican Governor Mike Braun has tapped his energy secretary to come up with a solution. As reported by Indy Star, the state plans to unveil a map aimed at de-risking wind and solar proposals, by steering developers towards counties that have a track record of support for renewable energy.

Another example can be found in Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled state legislature, notorious for blocking wind projects in the early 2000s. The race for data center business has flipped the script. Now the state will become home to two new wind projects. Greenlit by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, the two new wind farms are the first such approvals in almost 15 years.

More Signs Of A Renewable Energy Rebound

The Southeast region of the US does not have the advantage of optimal wind conditions. Louisiana, though, has been low-key pursuing its offshore wind potential. The leading utility Georgia Power is also poised to take advantage of new turbines designed for low-speed winds in the Southeast. On July July 15 the utility released a new Integrated Resource Plan that includes new renewable energy commitments of up to 4,000 megawatts by 2035, along with new energy storage additions.

Then there’s the Republican Governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin. Earlier this year Youngkin vetoed two bipartisan bills supporting small-scale clean energy projects, but he has been a consistent supporter of the massive 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. CVOW is one of the few offshore wind projects to escape the Trump chopper, although that could change. Polling indicates that a Democrat will occupy the Governor’s office when the term-limited Youngkin sees his last term expire after Election Day in November, exposing CVOW to the same partisan attacks that have bedeviled offshore projects in Democratic-lead states.

For that matter, polling also indicates that Democratic candidates will occupy the majority position in the US House of Representatives after Election Day 2026. If and when that does occur, perhaps the House will take up its duties as a separate but co-equal branch of government with oversight authority as a check on executive over-reach by the President.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and let them know what you think.

If charging providers don’t start voluntarily posting the real-time status of their fast chargers, the Arizona State Legislature should require open real-time data.
If charging providers open access to their data, expect to see many more EVs on the road.","When my husband and I moved from Detroit to Boston, we drove the 600 miles twice in electric vehicles. A short road trip by American standards turned into a frustrating validation of our range anxiety.

The reason: a lack of data.

While Tim concentrated on the highway, my job as passenger was to cross-reference charger apps. One app would plan a route with supposedly optimized charging stops, but it often didn’t tell me if the chargers were working, so I would try looking up each one on the charging provider’s proprietary websites — a time-consuming effort that would be dangerous for anyone driving solo.

This frustrating status quo is holding back EV sales and costing American jobs. Many charging providers do not share live data about their equipment — basic stuff, like whether it’s working or broken. This discourages prospective EV drivers: Concern about public charging is the number one reason people do not buy an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. Publishing this data is a way to spur EV adoption.

Arizona can lead the way with a straightforward fix — and it will cost the state next to nothing.

Right now, finding a working and available charger in Arizona is too difficult. On the 209-mile drive from Tucson to Deming, New Mexico, not one charging station shares data on PlugShare, the leading EV-charging app.

The solution is simple and cheap: If all chargers reported their status live so that any mapping app could include this basic information, drivers could easily navigate to working and available chargers. Were this data available, the chargers’ status would appear in your favorite map app, much like Google Maps shows if a restaurant is open. That would go a long way toward eliminating range anxiety.

Moreover, by shining a light on broken chargers, operators will fix them faster, enabling EV drivers to trust what their phones tell them.

My team’s research estimates that making real-time data universal for highway fast chargers would raise the EV share of new vehicle sales by 6 percentage points in 2030 — to about 46% — under current policies. As a result, there would be 3.5 million more EVs on the road by 2030.

That means jobs, including in Arizona. The Lucid factory in Casa Grande, which opened in 2021, has 2,500 workers and wants to hire another 3,500 as it ramps up production. When Congress ended EV tax rebates with the One Big Beautiful Bill, it threatened those jobs. Open data, by increasing EV adoption, will help Lucid keep hiring.

Charging operators may object, saying that their data is available in their proprietary apps, has commercial value and they don’t want to provide too much information to their competitors.

Yet those very operators would benefit if this data helped the EV market take off faster. With 3.5 million more EVs on the road in 2030, operators will enjoy a market that is 9% larger. That means more charging sessions, enabling them to pay off their investments faster.

If charging providers don’t start voluntarily posting the real-time status of their fast chargers, the Arizona State Legislature should require open real-time data. Massachusetts has done so, and the California Electricity Commission is proposing the same.

My team and I have just published model legislation that can help Arizona adopt such common-sense policies.

Making a road trip in an EV shouldn’t be hard. It doesn’t have to be. If charging providers open access to their data, expect to see many more EVs on the road.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/yourvalley/original/20251021-141940-b06-Elaine%20Buckberg%20headshot.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 23:58:20.326476

All told, electricity customers across over a dozen states are paying an additional $12.5 billion this year just to keep the lights on– and it’s only getting worse.

By preventing this proposed renewable energy from connecting to our electricity grid, PJM’s decisions are creating a bottleneck on energy supply. With less electricity supply to meet demand, our electricity bills go up.

What’s worse, instead of fixing the problem by connecting all of these waiting renewable energy projects to the grid (many that have been waiting in line for years), PJM is using this price spike as an excuse to let 50 expensive and polluting fracked gas and nuclear power plants skip the line.

What is PJM and why would they want to block clean energy?

PJM plays a critical role for utility customers in all or part of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and D.C. As a regional grid operator, PJM is responsible for making sure that when you flip a switch, the light turns on.

If a power plant—like a gas plant or a wind or solar farm—wants to provide power to customers in the PJM region, they need to get PJM’s approval before they can start construction. Right now, 98% of projects waiting for PJM approval are renewable energy projects, including significant amounts of solar + storage, battery, and wind resources which don’t pollute our air, are cheaper to dispatch to customers than fossil fuel energy, and have high reliability value whenever PJM needs energy the most.

But PJM also has some of the longest wait times in the country for pending projects trying to get approval. And incredibly, in recent years new projects have essentially stopped being connected altogether. This is because PJM’s current process for approving new power is overly complicated and drawn out, while also giving the upper hand to the polluting and expensive energy sources of the 19th century. PJM has refused to fully comply with a federal order to reform its practices, and estimates it won’t be done with the current backlog and able to process new projects until 2026.

It doesn’t help that stakeholders in PJM, including the owners of power plants, utilities, and transmission lines participate in PJM’s decision-making process as voting members on its many committees.

This is like asking the foxes to guard the hen house. Because PJM’s grid is dominated by fossil fuel power plants—43% gas and 27% coal, compared to only 6% solar, wind, and hydropower combined—most of the companies that vote in PJM have a financial stake in fossil fuel infrastructure. These companies are often able to exercise their decision-making power outside of the scrutiny of the public and ratepayers.

Now more than ever, PJM must prioritize renewable energy projects that can provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy to the grid

There is more than enough clean energy waiting for PJM approval to both bring costs down and keep our electricity grid reliable. One report found that if PJM implements key reforms to its process for connecting new resources, it would both reduce carbon dioxide pollution by 14% and cut average household power bills in the PJM region by $505 annually.

Right now, in PJM and across the country, energy demand is on the rise as more and more energy-hungry data centers come onto the grid. To avoid blackouts, keep electric costs from spiking further, and stop unnecessary development of polluting power plants, PJM needs to prioritize building a modern electricity grid that is capable of using 21st century technologies. That means fixing its broken processes and prioritizing allowing the renewable energy projects that have been waiting for years to come online and supply clean, green reliable power to PJM’s electric consumers.

State leaders can make a difference

We know that governors have the power to influence PJM and its stakeholders. When Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro filed a complaint with federal regulators back in December 2024 in an attempt to stop skyrocketing bills, PJM came to the table and negotiated a new, lower cap on prices.

That’s why we are calling on governors in the PJM states to continue to use their influence to put pressure on PJM to start rapidly approving clean energy projects, and stop catering to fossil fuel interests.

Take action for clean, reliable energy

Environment America Research & Policy Center has done research on powering our lives with clean renewable energy, including the annual State of Renewable Energy report, which documents state-by-state progress on clean energy. Our federation of state groups have dedicated staff on the ground in key PJM states, like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Illinois, ready to rally public support around this issue and advocate for PJM state governors to protect our planet and consumers from PJM’s harmful decisions.

The company’s strategic positioning comes as global powers recognize the critical importance of REEs for modern technologies including electric vehicles, defense systems, and renewable energy infrastructure.

The company’s progress centers on two key assets: its proprietary RapidSX separation technology and the planned Strategic Metals Complex in Louisiana. The RapidSX platform represents a technological advancement over conventional separation methods, offering smaller physical footprint requirements, faster processing times, and potentially cleaner environmental performance. This technology could provide Western nations with a more efficient pathway to process rare earth elements domestically.

Ucore has secured substantial government support for its initiatives, including an $18.4 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense and prioritization status under the Defense Production Act. This government backing underscores the strategic importance of developing domestic REE processing capabilities. The company aims to begin commercial rare earth output from its Louisiana facility by the second half of 2026, establishing a timeline for when Western nations might see tangible results from these diversification efforts.

The company has also established critical supply chain partnerships, including a feedstock agreement with Greenland’s Tanbreez project. This agreement helps secure the raw materials necessary for the Louisiana facility’s operations, addressing one of the key challenges in establishing new REE processing capacity outside China. Additional information about Ucore’s broader strategy and technology can be found at https://www.Ucore.com.

Ucore’s longer-term vision includes developing additional strategic metals complexes in Canada and Alaska, as well as advancing its 100% controlled Bokan-Dotson Ridge Rare Heavy REE Project on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. These expansion plans indicate the company’s commitment to building a comprehensive North American rare earth processing ecosystem. The development comes amid increasing global competition, with Russia also pushing for rapid domestic development of its own substantial REE reserves.

The emergence of viable Western alternatives to Chinese REE processing carries significant implications for global supply chain security, technological independence, and geopolitical dynamics. As nations increasingly recognize rare earth elements as strategic resources, companies like Ucore that can provide secure, efficient processing capabilities are positioned to play crucial roles in reshaping global resource markets and reducing dependency on single-source suppliers.",https://cdn.newsramp.net/qrcode/595ac5164808733c8b0a0a6dd8117ce0.webp,N,,2025-10-22 13:03:10.766151

All of these companies had plans to break ground on projects in states that voted for President Donald Trump in the last presidential election.

Ascend, the largest grant recipient of the group, specializes in creating cathodes—the positive electrode in lithium-ion batteries—out of used batteries. In 2022, the company was awarded over $316 million by the Energy Department to build a facility in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, to scale up Ascend's cathode production. Of this total, $206 million has already been spent, meaning that the Energy Department's announcement only affects a little over $110 million.

The other grantees were awarded money for similar projects. Anovion was given $117 million to build a facility in Alabama to produce synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries, and ICL was awarded $197 million to construct a facility in Missouri to make phosphate powder for these batteries.

American Battery Technologies, meanwhile, was awarded a $57.7 million federal grant in 2022 to develop a commercial-grade cathode material facility in Nevada. The company was then awarded $123 million in 2024 to build another facility, but this grant wasn't affected by the recent cancellation. LuxWall, the only company on the list that doesn't specialize in battery materials, lost federal funding for a vacuum-insulated window facility in Detroit, which was expected to improve energy efficiency in buildings.

The termination of these grants is a win for taxpayers. All of these projects ""had missed milestones, and it was determined they did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,"" an Energy Department spokesman told E&E. The announcement builds on other spending cuts at the agency, including $5 billion worth of green energy loan cancellations in May.

While these efforts might signal fiscal restraint, federal spending has increased under Trump, and the Energy Department has traded much of Biden's green energy spending for its own wasteful initiatives. Since Trump's return to office, the federal government has taken stakes in several mineral firms, approved millions of dollars' worth of coal bailouts, continued subsidizing nuclear power, and finalized a loan for a multistate transmission line project.

Still, the administration deserves credit for the little spending it has cut. With global demand for lithium-ion batteries to power energy storage and electric vehicles expected to grow through 2030, these projects never needed the backing of the federal government to survive, a fact that is supported by American Batteries' recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing. As E&E reports, the firm said that ""regardless"" of whether the funding rescission is reversed, ""the Company intends to move forward with the project without impact to timeline or scope.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/10/10-21-25-v3-a-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:01:38.622358

Tuesday's announcement marks Meta's largest-ever private capital deal. Under the agreement, Meta will retain about 20% equity in the Louisiana project, with the majority owned by funds that alternative asset manager Blue Owl Capital manages. Blue Owl contributed roughly $7 billion in cash to the joint venture, with Meta receiving a one-time payout of about $3 billion.

The planned data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, known as Hyperion, is projected to deliver more than 2 gigawatts of compute capacity to support training of large language models, the technology behind tools such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini.

Doug Ostrover and Marc Lipschultz, Co-CEOs of Blue Owl, called Hyperion ""an ambitious project that reflects the scale and speed required to power the next generation of AI infrastructure.""

Major tech companies, including Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft and CoreWeave, are on track to spend $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year, Morgan Stanley estimates.

OpenAI, the startup at the heart of the AI boom, recently signed multiple deals that may cost over $1 trillion to secure about 26 gigawatts of computing capacity, enough to power roughly 20 million U.S. homes.

Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, called Tuesday's deal ""a bold step forward."" The company has signed leases for the facility with a four-year initial term with an option to extend and expects the project to create more than 500 jobs once it goes online.

Meta reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs in June after senior staff departures and a poor reception for its open-source Llama 4 model. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in July that Meta would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build several massive AI data centers for Superintelligence.

Like many families, we were counting on a federal heat pump tax credit to help us finally upgrade our heating system.
However, that also means we don’t have $8,000 to $15,000 laying around to put toward the average price of a heat pump.
So to recently find out that the tax credit goes away seven years earlier than promised?
We thought we had more time; we thought 2032 was a promise.","We thought we had until 2032 to replace our ancient heating system and take advantage of a federal tax credit. Then the rules changed—without warning—and now families like ours are left out in the cold.

Our home is old. It’s 115 years old, to be exact. And while I love the character that comes with an elderly abode, the near-constant repairs and need for upgrades are exhausting. So when my husband and I learned that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a federal law passed in 2022, included a 30% tax credit for certain home repairs, we were stoked.

Like many families, we were counting on a federal heat pump tax credit to help us finally upgrade our heating system. We thought we had until 2032 to make it happen, but thanks to modifications included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act—which scaled back and repealed multiple green energy tax incentives in the IRA—the rules changed without warning. The deadline to take advantage of that credit moved up by seven years, and ends in December.

See, at 36 and 32 years old, my husband and I, respectively, do our finances a little differently than many of our peers. Our broad rule is: If we can’t pay cash for it, we can’t afford it. Sure, we have student loan debt and a mortgage—but we refused to borrow money to purchase our 2006 truck (which we got in 2020) or our 2014 car in 2024.

Emergencies—like having to repipe our entire house last summer—are a different story. But we’re down to owing $1,500 on the loan we took out for that, and we’re projected to pay it off in March.

Living like this has its perks. We aren’t strapped to credit card debt, and we’re able to take care of our basic needs, a vacation here and there, and a relative amount of wants, too, while still putting back some funds for savings.

However, that also means we don’t have $8,000 to $15,000 laying around to put toward the average price of a heat pump.

It’s not that we don’t need it. We do. Our home’s heat runs off of an oil circulator, which as far as we can tell was installed in the mid-1960s. Sure, it’s lasted a long time—far longer than the average heat pump replacement time of 12 to 15 years. But, boy, is it expensive. In fact, it’s so much a part of our family’s budget that we gave it a name: Wilbur.

Last year, oil costs were about $500 for 125 gallons in our area. Depending on how cold the outdoor temperature is, that amount generally heats our 2,000 square-foot home for three or four weeks when we set our thermostat to 62 degrees. Yes, oil is considered a “warm” heat, but we still have to pay for electricity to run Wilbur.

We usually buy our first 125 gallons in November and last in March—so that’s $2,500 solely in oil costs. That’s in a “good” year when temperatures stay relatively moderate and prices of oil stay low. We’ve also paid over $700 for a single oil delivery before—and like the price of gas, there’s no way to tell when and by how much the cost will fluctuate. That’s why we do our best to be prepared.

Admittedly, we’ve tried saving for a heat pump for a while now. We even got so close in 2023, we had someone come over and quote us on an installation. A few weeks later, our car got totaled by a drunk driver, and we had to reallocate the heat pump savings into buying another vehicle.

We were getting on track to try again last summer, but the pipes burst and we’re still chipping away at repairing everything that was damaged then. A couple of weeks ago, our hot water heater started leaking. We’re replacing that at the end of the month.

It seems like every time we start to try to plan again, something more pressing comes along. It’s something families across Virginia and beyond know all too well. In fact, approximately 42% of Gen Z, millennial, and Gen X workers in America had no spare savings after covering their basic living expenses, according to a recent study.

But that was okay—we had until 2032 to save up for the illustrious heat pump.

So to recently find out that the tax credit goes away seven years earlier than promised? It felt like a gut punch.

And yeah, it does feel strange to have this goading my mind when I know there are so many people who don’t even have a roof over their heads this winter. But I wonder what happens if Wilbur—who’s admittedly finicky anyway—decides that 60+ years of service was more than enough, but the money to replace him isn’t there yet.

We thought we had more time; we thought 2032 was a promise. And sure, we’ll figure it out and we’ll make it work—we always do. But for folks like us who are trying to manage their finances responsibly (or even those who aren’t, but could use the help) banking on the silver lining of that tax credit was big. And now it’s gone.",https://vadogwood.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/img-5429.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:01:50.462086

The Commonwealth is investing $22 million in the project through grants and capital funding to support the relocation and expansion — a move that cements Pennsylvania’s status as a national hub for clean energy manufacturing and innovation.

Under Governor Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is the only state in the Northeast with a growing economy — attracting nearly $26 billion in private-sector investments and creating more than 13,200 new jobs since he took office.

Eos’s new Pittsburgh headquarters will open in 2026 at Nova Place on the North Shore, while its expanded 432,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Marshall Township will drive large-scale battery production and strengthen partnerships with Carnegie Mellon University and other local institutions to develop advanced energy technologies.

Also today, Eos and Talen Energy Corporation(opens in a new tab) have announced(opens in a new tab) a strategic collaboration to develop energy storage projects across Pennsylvania to meet growing electricity demand and support AI and cloud computing infrastructure. The partnership will leverage Eos’ American-made Z3 zinc-based batteries and Talen’s existing generation assets, including operating and retired fossil fuel plants, to create multiple gigawatt-hours (GWh) of storage capacity. The goal is to enhance grid reliability, maximize existing infrastructure, and accelerate Pennsylvania’s clean energy transition.

What people are saying about Governor Shapiro’s latest energy and manufacturing win for Pennsylvania:

Joe Mastrangelo, Chief Executive Officer of Eos Energy: “In today’s competitive environment, and in what we’re working to achieve in powering the nation’s future, you need not only natural resources and technology innovations, but also a strong public-private partnership. What we are announcing today is built upon a strong industrial history, combined with a world class university ecosystem. Pennsylvania is positioning itself at the forefront of America’s energy transition — enabling us to bring America’s battery to scale.”

DCED Secretary Rick Siger: “With this expansion, Eos is strengthening two of the key industries at the center of our Economic Development Strategy — energy and manufacturing. We are committed to positioning Pennsylvania as both an energy leader and an economic powerhouse and bold investments like this one will help us get there. This project will create and sustain 1,000 jobs while expanding opportunity for people across Western Pennsylvania.”

Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato: “Eos Energy’s expansion in Allegheny County is a testament to our region’s collaborative spirit and commitment to shared prosperity. This significant expansion ― made possible with critical support from the US Department of Energy, Governor Josh Shapiro, and a commitment of $2 million from Allegheny County — highlights the power of partnership in driving economic growth. Together, we are not only creating hundreds of jobs in Allegheny County but also laying the groundwork for a sustainable future in clean tech-led manufacturing and clean energy.”

Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development: “Eos Energy’s decision to expand its manufacturing operations in Allegheny County is a powerful testament to the value proposition this region offers at the nexus of energy, manufacturing, and innovation. Eos’ move will not only strengthen our region’s position as a hub for advanced energy storage, but it will also attract new suppliers, partners, and innovators to the Pittsburgh region. We’re especially proud that this growth comes with a continued commitment to the company’s partnerships with local universities and the United Steelworkers—ensuring that good, family-sustaining jobs remain at the center of this story. This expansion underscores what’s possible when business, labor, and community work together to build a more resilient and competitive regional economy.”

Bernie Hall, USW District 10 Director: ""From day one, when we met with Joe and the Eos team, they talked about building an American-made company, doing right by the community, and providing good, family-sustaining jobs. We hear that from many employers, but Eos truly lives it — it’s part of their culture and DNA. We’re proud to stand with them for this exciting announcement and see them grow and create these opportunities. Pennsylvania is the only Northeast state with a growing economy, and with the rise of data centers nationwide, energy demand is surging. At the heart of this, union workers are helping build a more affordable, sustainable energy sector here in Pennsylvania. Last year, the workers at Eos Energy voted to join our union — a pivotal moment for workers — and we’re eager to be part of this expanding and vital part of Pennsylvania’s economy.""

Matt Smith, Chief Growth Officer of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development: “This is the living embodiment of the value proposition of Pittsburgh sitting at the nexus of energy, innovation and manufacturing. Companies from EOS to Google and Meta are sending their toughest problems to Pittsburgh to fix. This is a region that can host manufacturing in each and every county. We continue to be able to make things here.”

But Dems can only seize the upper hand on the issue if they support both renewable energy and key natural gas pipelines that together can reduce electricity costs, especially in contested purple states.
More broadly, Democratic Members of Congress and Governors around the nation have an opportunity to support permitting reform measures on Capitol Hill that will expand both clean energy infrastructure and allow for the building key natural gas pipelines.
At the same time, Democrats must support permitting of key natural gas pipelines in sections to the country where electricity costs are rising quickly.
Democrats can be right about both renewable energy and needed natural gas pipelines, lowering cost and emissions while putting them in an aggressively pro-consumer and pro-environment position to help the nation go forward.","The cost of American electricity is going up fast, at twice the rate of inflation over the last five years, in states around the country due in part to increased electricity demand from big tech data centers and new Artificial Intelligence investments. And by 2030 power prices are expected to go far higher, as much as 40% more, as the AI build out expands even further.

The recent policies of President Trump and his Republican colleagues have made the situation worse, effectively taxing consumers by deliberately removing clean energy incentives and grants that would otherwise be producing large amounts of extra electric power. These policies will mean higher costs for tens of millions of American households and businesses.

This illogical cultural war against new power technologies and consumers by the GOP provides a huge political and policy opportunity for Democrats. But Dems can only seize the upper hand on the issue if they support both renewable energy and key natural gas pipelines that together can reduce electricity costs, especially in contested purple states. If Democrats have the good sense to do this, they will have a politically and economically powerful pro-consumer issue to wield against Republicans going into the mid-term election fight.

But right now, some Democratic leaders are doing just the opposite. Last week, New York House Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, sent a letter to NY Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul opposing a natural gas pipeline Hochul supports that would bring much needed base-load power, and lower prices, to New York State households and businesses.

Governor Hochul has said that the gas pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York is needed to prevent energy shortages in the Empire State, spur economic growth and help insulate her constituents from rising costs. Importantly, Hochul has insisted on rigorous environmental reviews of the project under the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation which are now being carried out.

Indeed, Hochul’s team has made clear that the Governor’s policy is an “all of the above approach that delivers affordability, reliability, and clean energy.” This is precisely the pragmatic, environmentally responsible way forward that hard-pressed households and businesses are looking for from America’s political leaders right now, and that should constitute a major Democratic policy advantage.

And crucially for Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Democrats rightly concerned about climate change, natural gas from Pennsylvania has far lower emissions of methane, a key greenhouse gas, than gas from other parts of the country, according to several major independent studies. Pennsylvania natural gas suppliers have also been at the vanguard of methane emissions reductions through a series of measures to upgrade their gas production and distribution systems, yielding far lower methane emissions than most gas companies producing in other regions. But the letter from ten liberal House members to Governor Hochul completely ignored this key pro-climate factor.

Lower methane emissions are tremendously important since cutting methane is the key to limiting near-term temperatures and reducing expensive and dangerous climate change impacts like flooding, wildfires and heat waves that are increasingly undermining the public safety and quality of life for average Americans. And, tellingly, these climate impacts are also a major reason for increasing electricity outages and higher costs of providing power, according to a new study by J.D. Power which finds extreme weather due to climate change often upending reliability and low prices. Republicans have conveniently ignored this critical connection.

More broadly, Democratic Members of Congress and Governors around the nation have an opportunity to support permitting reform measures on Capitol Hill that will expand both clean energy infrastructure and allow for the building key natural gas pipelines.

The essential outlines of a major Congressional permitting reform agreement have been clear for years. Republicans must support rules to expedite new interstate powerlines to bring cheap renewable power to key markets to lower consumer prices, something most in the GOP have been resisting. At the same time, Democrats must support permitting of key natural gas pipelines in sections to the country where electricity costs are rising quickly.

Support for these for new pipelines includes replacing old leaky infrastructure which are a major source of methane emissions today and contain provisions to do this in a way that keeps cost affordable for low-income consumers. In this way new pipelines can help limit emissions and help working class households.

Democrats should recognize that independent analysis shows current permitting lawsuits and red tape hurt clean energy most, especially solar. These reforms are needed to help consumers. New studies, including by one by federal government itself, show a build out of renewable energy would help cut overall consumer prices.

Electricity prices are becoming a top tier political issue in competitive purple areas around the country, as the tech industry is building massive new data centers to fuel artificial intelligence. Now the tech industry must come to the table with far more robust plans to limit consumer price increases and lower emissions. Democrats must work with the tech industry, electric utilities, and the states to use America’s abundant renewable energy and natural gas resources to keep prices low and make our country more competitive on these key technology issues.

It's the economy stupid, as Democratic political legend James Carville has often said. But, as power prices spike, it’s also the energy economy. Democrats can be right about both renewable energy and needed natural gas pipelines, lowering cost and emissions while putting them in an aggressively pro-consumer and pro-environment position to help the nation go forward.

Harrisburg, PA – Today, Governor Josh Shapiro announced a $352.9 million investment by Eos Energy Enterprises (Eos) — the nation’s leading manufacturer of American-made zinc-based battery storage systems — to relocate its headquarters from New Jersey to Pittsburgh and expand manufacturing operations in Allegheny County, creating and retaining 1,000 total jobs, including 735 new positions.

The Commonwealth is investing $22 million in the project through grants and capital funding to support the relocation and expansion — a move that cements Pennsylvania’s status as a national hub for clean energy manufacturing and innovation.

Under Governor Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is the only state in the Northeast with a growing economy — attracting nearly $26 billion in private-sector investments and creating more than 13,200 new jobs since he took office.

Eos’s new Pittsburgh headquarters will open in 2026 at Nova Place on the North Shore, while its expanded 432,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Marshall Township will drive large-scale battery production and strengthen partnerships with Carnegie Mellon University and other local institutions to develop advanced energy technologies.

Also today, Eos and Talen Energy Corporation have announced a strategic collaboration to develop energy storage projects across Pennsylvania to meet growing electricity demand and support AI and cloud computing infrastructure. The partnership will leverage Eos’ American-made Z3 zinc-based batteries and Talen’s existing generation assets, including operating and retired fossil fuel plants, to create multiple gigawatt-hours (GWh) of storage capacity. The goal is to enhance grid reliability, maximize existing infrastructure, and accelerate Pennsylvania’s clean energy transition.

What people are saying about Governor Shapiro’s latest energy and manufacturing win for Pennsylvania:

Joe Mastrangelo, Chief Executive Officer of Eos Energy: “In today’s competitive environment, and in what we’re working to achieve in powering the nation’s future, you need not only natural resources and technology innovations, but also a strong public-private partnership. What we are announcing today is built upon a strong industrial history, combined with a world class university ecosystem. Pennsylvania is positioning itself at the forefront of America’s energy transition — enabling us to bring America’s battery to scale.”

DCED Secretary Rick Siger: “With this expansion, Eos is strengthening two of the key industries at the center of our Economic Development Strategy — energy and manufacturing. We are committed to positioning Pennsylvania as both an energy leader and an economic powerhouse and bold investments like this one will help us get there. This project will create and sustain 1,000 jobs while expanding opportunity for people across Western Pennsylvania.”

Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato: “Eos Energy’s expansion in Allegheny County is a testament to our region’s collaborative spirit and commitment to shared prosperity. This significant expansion ― made possible with critical support from the US Department of Energy, Governor Josh Shapiro, and a commitment of $2 million from Allegheny County — highlights the power of partnership in driving economic growth. Together, we are not only creating hundreds of jobs in Allegheny County but also laying the groundwork for a sustainable future in clean tech-led manufacturing and clean energy.”

Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development: “Eos Energy’s decision to expand its manufacturing operations in Allegheny County is a powerful testament to the value proposition this region offers at the nexus of energy, manufacturing, and innovation. Eos’ move will not only strengthen our region’s position as a hub for advanced energy storage, but it will also attract new suppliers, partners, and innovators to the Pittsburgh region. We’re especially proud that this growth comes with a continued commitment to the company’s partnerships with local universities and the United Steelworkers—ensuring that good, family-sustaining jobs remain at the center of this story. This expansion underscores what’s possible when business, labor, and community work together to build a more resilient and competitive regional economy.”

Bernie Hall, USW District 10 Director: “From day one, when we met with Joe and the Eos team, they talked about building an American-made company, doing right by the community, and providing good, family-sustaining jobs. We hear that from many employers, but Eos truly lives it — it’s part of their culture and DNA. We’re proud to stand with them for this exciting announcement and see them grow and create these opportunities. Pennsylvania is the only Northeast state with a growing economy, and with the rise of data centers nationwide, energy demand is surging. At the heart of this, union workers are helping build a more affordable, sustainable energy sector here in Pennsylvania. Last year, the workers at Eos Energy voted to join our union — a pivotal moment for workers — and we’re eager to be part of this expanding and vital part of Pennsylvania’s economy.”

Matt Smith, Chief Growth Officer of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development: “This is the living embodiment of the value proposition of Pittsburgh sitting at the nexus of energy, innovation and manufacturing. Companies from EOS to Google and Meta are sending their toughest problems to Pittsburgh to fix. This is a region that can host manufacturing in each and every county. We continue to be able to make things here.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent’s rich rare-earth resources when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.

The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.

“In about a year from now we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won’t know what to do with them,” said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. “They’ll be worth $2.”

Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship “to the next level.”

This month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.

“Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we’re seeing from the Chinese,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters on Monday morning ahead of Trump’s meeting with Albanese.

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials that are used in everything from jet engines and electric vehicles to laptops and phones. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China’s influence.

“China is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. “They are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.”

Albanese’s visit comes just before Trump is planning to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.

Another topic of discussion was AUKUS, a security pact with Australia, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that was signed during U.S. President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration.

Trump noted Monday that AUKUS was established “a while ago” but that the agreement now is “moving along very rapidly, very well.” Albanese said that “our defense and security partnership with AUKUS is so important for us.”

John Phelan, the Navy secretary, said that the U.S. wants to take the original AUKUS framework and improve it for the three signatory countries while clarifying “some of the ambiguity” in it.

“So it should be a win-win for everybody,” Phelan said.

The center-left Albanese was reelected in May and suggested shortly after his win that his party increased its majority by not modeling itself on Trumpism.

“Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,” Albanese told supporters during his victory speech.

Another potential use case is for reliable charging in industrial applications, such as construction.

Powered by Volvo Penta’s high-performance battery system for energy storage, KJ Power Generator’s BESS unit will help meet the growing demand for zero-emission, low-noise mobile power. The product will initially be aimed at customers in Turkey and Europe.

“We chose to work with Volvo Penta as it's a trusted supplier with a proven solution and a skilled engineering team,” says Kadir Sümerkent, Vice President at KJ Power Generator. “Volvo Penta has supplied us with engines for our gensets for around ten years, and now we have embarked on the next stage of our partnership together. Volvo Penta engineers made sure the integration of the high-energy-density battery system within the BESS unit was seamless, which helped make our development journey quick and efficient.”

Towards zero-emission and low-noise

KJ Power Generator entered the generator sector in 1996, producing thousands of gensets a year, which are sold in Turkey and exported to more than 90 countries. The company’s first BESS unit was unveiled at its factory in Istanbul, Turkey, on October 15, 2025. In addition to manufacturing and selling gensets, KJ Power Generator also rents them to customers through its rental business.

“In Turkey, as well as in Europe, we are seeing an increased demand for sustainable, reliable energy,” says Mehdi Kılıç, Volvo Penta's general manager in Turkey. “Not only will this BESS unit help to secure the power supply at large events where there is an increased demand for energy, but it will also deliver zero-emission power at a very low noise level. This is a very important complementary product to gensets as there is a significant cost involved in soundproofing diesel engine-powered gensets – something which is eliminated with a BESS unit.”

Proven technology

Leveraging the electromobility platform from the Volvo Group, Volvo Penta’s battery system for energy storage offers an energy-dense and compact design. It is certified for mobility and tested with high IP-class protection.

“By extending our partnership with Volvo Penta, we can now offer our customers a flexible, efficient mobile BESS unit that supports the growing demand for low-emission and low-noise energy,” concludes Kadir.

This analysis monitors private-sector investment in clean energy manufacturing, generation, and grid infrastructure projects since federal energy tax credits were passed in August 2022. The tracking excludes projects that began, were proposed, sited, or in anyway began development prior to the IRA, as well as those funded entirely by federal sources or lacking specific geographic data. CEW measures key indicators including investment value, job creation or losses, project types (manufacturing, generation, research and development), and distribution by sector, state, and congressional district.

Since 2025, this analysis began to include all project cancellations, closures, and downsizings going back to August 2022 due to rising business uncertainty about the future of U.S. clean energy policy, culiminating in the rollback and restriction of energy tax credits included in the federal tax and spending bill passed in July 2025. E2’s methodology excludes temporary delays or ownership transfers that do not impact production capacity. E2’s tracking of cancelled and closed projects includes developments that may not have been counted as an announcement because they had been proposed, announced, broken ground, or opened prior to August 2022.

This dataset provides a comprehensive look at the evolving U.S. clean energy economy—highlighting the impact of federal policy changes, supply chain dynamics, and market shifts on America’s clean energy workforce and investment pipeline.

E2’s latest CEW analysis finds that private-sector companies canceled, closed, or scaled back nearly $1.6 billion worth of large-scale clean energy projects in September 2025, bringing the total value of abandoned or downsized projects this year to over $24 billion. These cancellations have now erased nearly 21,000 previously announced clean energy jobs nationwide since the start of 2025.

The findings come as the U.S. Department of Energy withdrew nearly $8 billion in federal clean energy grants supporting more than 200 projects, compounding losses in both private and public investment across the sector.

E2’s tracking shows that since the passage of federal clean energy tax credits in August 2022, companies have announced 415 major projects across 42 states and Puerto Rico, representing $135B in investment and 125,000 planned jobs. But with 42 projects now cancelled or scaled back since the beginning of the year, representing over $24 billion in lost investments and 28,800 jobs, the overall trajectory of clean energy growth has sharply slowed in 2025.

The findings underscore the growing risk that federal and administrative policy rollbacks—especially the removal of clean energy incentives—are destabilizing one of the nation’s fastest-growing industries, with ripple effects across supply chains, manufacturing hubs, and rural economic development.

Announcements

Projects that began development, were proposed, or applied for local and state approval before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are not included. This analysis also does not include investments in which the federal government has provided financial resources for the complete project, lease sales, projects in which an announcement was made but lacked specific geographic information, etc. Details on projects came from news reports on new and related projects; press releases from companies announcing new developments; and government announcements.

Cancellations, Closures, Downsizes

This tracking includes all projects, plants, operations, or expansions that were cancelled or closed since passage of the IRA in August 2022. This does not include announced layoffs that are not associated with a project downsizing unless there is a stated decease in production output. This list also does not include the transfer of project ownership, if production will continue under the new ownership, power purchasing agreements, or other similar type of announcements. Project delays or idling of facilities are not included unless there in an announced decrease in production or investment or unless the project will need to be restarted to proceed in the future.",https://e2.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/E2-Default-Social-Image.png,N,,2025-10-21 17:19:46.778365

The company’s decision on Tuesday involves a factory in Ingersoll, Ontario, that began building electric delivery vans in 2022, after G.M.
“Now more than 1,000 workers and their families are paying the price for Trump’s political interference and G.M.’s failure to hold the line,” Ms. Payne said.
Mary Barra, in a conference call with investors on Tuesday, said that “the commercial electric van market has been developing much slower than expected.” BrightDrop is the only fully electric commercial van offered by G.M.
By contrast, she said, G.M.","General Motors said on Tuesday that it was ending production of its electric van in Ontario, a move that will mean the loss of about 1,200 jobs. It was the second major blow to Canada’s automobile industry in less than a week.

G.M. cited low demand for its BrightDrop delivery van, as well as the end of tax credits for electric vehicles in the United States.

But Unifor, the Canadian union that represents auto workers, blamed the company’s move on President Trump’s trade battle with Canada, which has made exporting cars to the United States more expensive.

Last week, the automaker Stellantis announced that it would move production of a new Jeep model from an idle factory in the Toronto suburb of Brampton to a plant in Illinois. The company shut down the factory in 2023 and laid off its roughly 3,000 workers so that it could retool the facilities, but now the fate of those employees is unclear.

General Motors previously announced that it would eliminate a shift at a pickup factory in Oshawa, Ontario, a decision that will lead to a loss of about 2,000 jobs in that community.

The company’s decision on Tuesday involves a factory in Ingersoll, Ontario, that began building electric delivery vans in 2022, after G.M. received about 1 billion Canadian dollars, about $714 million currently, from the Canadian and Ontario governments to retool the site. It was temporarily shut down in May because of slow sales but was expected to restart production in November.

Lana Payne, the national president of Unifor, said the shutdown was a direct result of Mr. Trump’s decision to end support for the electric vehicle industry and the 25 percent tariff he imposed on cars and trucks from Canada.

“Now more than 1,000 workers and their families are paying the price for Trump’s political interference and G.M.’s failure to hold the line,” Ms. Payne said.

Mary Barra, in a conference call with investors on Tuesday, said that “the commercial electric van market has been developing much slower than expected.” BrightDrop is the only fully electric commercial van offered by G.M.

G.M. did not provide any specifics about the factory’s future, saying it would meet with the union and government officials to discuss the situation.

Mélanie Joly, Canada’s industry minister, offered a more measured response to G.M.’s announcement on Tuesday than last week, when she threatened legal action against Stellantis.

“It’s two completely different situations,” she said on Tuesday. The government, she said, is putting “maximum pressure” on Stellantis to keep the new Jeep in Canada because of the “obligation” it took on after accepting government money to retool the Brampton plant. By contrast, she said, G.M. is eliminating its van because it is “not going well commercially.”

Ms. Joly said, nevertheless, that the government would seek to reopen the factory with another vehicle and that it would hold G.M. accountable for any remaining obligations from earlier government assistance.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/02/26/world/21canada-vehicles/26canadaletter-van-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 16:19:22.388925

So at the moment, Trump has done very well getting elected in rural places by bigger and bigger margins, right?
There has to be this deep, long-term effort to rebuild bridges to rural America by the Democratic Party being there.","This is an edited transcript of an episode of “The Ezra Klein Show.” You can listen to the conversation by following or subscribing to the show on Apple, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, iHeartRadio or wherever you get your podcasts.

I think there’s a particular lens worth using right now. As we watch the Trump administration deploying the National Guard from red states into blue cities, we are viewing a rural political coalition militarily occupying urban centers.

It is moving armed troops in over the objections of their residents, of their mayors and of their governors. Here’s JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois:

Archived clip of JB Pritzker: Let me be clear: Donald Trump is using our service members as political props and as pawns in his illegal effort to militarize our nation’s cities.

The Trump administration is doing this while describing these cities as something like enemy territory. They need to be liberated, recaptured, taken back. Trump said this to a room of America’s top military leaders:

Archived clip of Donald Trump: It seems that the ones that are run by the radical left Democrats — what they’ve done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles — they’re very unsafe places. And we’re going to straighten them out one by one. And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That’s a war, too. It’s a war from within.

Trump also said that the people in these cities resisting this occupation, these deployments, should be understood as insurrectionists.

Archived clip of Trump: We have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were being killed and, uh, courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that. I want to make sure that people aren’t killed.

For years, I have been skeptical of warnings that America was at risk of a renewed civil war. There were all kinds of reasons to not take that particularly seriously. But when I see troops being sent into cities over the objections of the people elected in those cities and states, when I hear them talked about in this way, I think you have to take those warnings more seriously now.

Archived clip of Trump: And I told Pete: We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military — National Guard but military.

A massive rural urban divide has opened in our country’s politics. Urban and rural voters used to vote pretty much in lock step. But then in the 1990s, that split. Urban voters became reliably Democratic, and rural voters became overwhelmingly Republican.

We treat this as an inevitability in our politics, but it is only a few decades old, and our political future and stability might rest on reversing it. Certainly for the Democratic Party, any durable political power rests on reversing it. Reversing it isn’t going to be easy. But it begins with understanding it and taking seriously the resentments that fuel it.

“Rural Versus Urban,” a new book by the political scientists Suzanne Mettler and Trevor Brown is the best place I’ve found to start.

So I asked Mettler to join me on the show to walk me through how we got here — and whether we can find a way out.

Ezra Klein: Suzanne Mettler, welcome to the show.

Suzanne Mettler: Happy to be here.

I think a lot of people who have followed politics over the last 10, 20 years assume that the big political divide between rural America and urban America is a constant, an inevitability, just a feature of our politics.

Is that true?

No. The rural-urban divide did not exist nationwide in the past in the United States. If we look at how people voted in presidential elections through the middle of the 20th century right up to the early ’90s, rural and urban Americans voted almost in lock step, just a couple of percentage points dividing them.

That’s true as recently as 1992 — a 2 percentage point gap. Then it starts growing and growing and growing. In 2024, it was a 20 percentage point gap.

Now all regions of the country have moved in this way, have this big gap. Almost all states have a big rural-urban divide. And it’s really driving polarization in a particularly pernicious way because it’s place based: Rural and urban people don’t encounter one another in ways that could soften the divide, so it’s creating an us-versus-them kind of politics that’s really dangerous.

Before we get into what created the divide, beginning in the ’90s, what kept urban and rural America politically united for so long?

If you go back to, say, the late 19th, early 20th century, as industrialization is happening, rural areas really feel left behind. There’s a big agricultural depression in the 1920s. Then the Great Depression comes. And rural people at that point are really upset, and policymakers are worried there’s about to be a revolution in the countryside, as they call it.

But what happens is that Franklin D. Roosevelt steps in and creates this big rural-urban coalition. And to an extent that I was unaware of until we wrote this book, he really put rural Americans front and center in his vision of what needed to happen for the country and created all of these policies that were really designed to lift up rural America.

Archived clip of Franklin D. Roosevelt: I cannot escape the conclusion that one of the essential parts of a national program of restoration must be to restore purchasing power to the farming half of the country. Without this, the wheels of railroads and of factories will not turn.

Rural Americans really appreciated that. They felt the Democratic Party was there for them, and many of them remembered it for their lifetimes. And then their kids did, as well, all the way up until the 1990s.

In the 1980s and early ’90s, rural places were more likely to send Democrats to Congress than Republicans. Only a few decades ago, there was still a coalition where there were rural politicians who were really at the forefront in Congress in brokering compromises on all sorts of important policies.

When we study the Affordable Care Act, for example, you have all of these rural lawmakers who were really playing an important role and influencing the policy right up till the end. And those lawmakers are gone.

Bart Stupak, for example, who was a swing vote from the Upper Peninsula, in Michigan — he gets replaced by people who are like Marjorie Taylor Greene going forward.

So it moves from being these people who are functionally moderating polarization in America, who are building bridges — Stupak is a pro-life Democrat, very famously; Ben Nelson from Nebraska is the same thing — to the most extreme members of the Republican coalition.

You have something toward the end of the book where you show that, if you’re looking at Republicans, who is most likely to support the lies about the 2020 election. And it is heavily overrepresented by the Republicans who represent rural districts.

Yes. So on Jan. 6, 2021, when Congress reconvenes, there’s a large portion of the Republican caucus — about 138 members — who vote against accepting the votes from all of the states. And they’re heavily rural.

It’s not just that these folks who are being elected in rural areas now are more conservative on policy issues. It’s also that they are more willing to go against basic democratic norms and principles.

In 1964, Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law. And that kicks off this process of ideological polarization, where the parties sort into liberal and conservative. The Dixiecrats die out.

And I think the most commonly believed story about what happened in the urban-rural divide is that they hated the Civil Rights Act. I think if you look at a lot of Democratic accounts of this, you’ll see something like that.

But you don’t buy that account. Why?

Yes, that’s wrong. So for one thing, just look at when the rural-urban divide emerged: It’s not until the late 1990s.

The story that you’re telling, usually the follow-up is that the South left the Democratic Party. Well, in fact, there were a lot of urban Southerners who left the Democratic Party. But rural Southerners stuck with it up until the 1990s, and then they left.

One of the most striking things that we find is that this rural-urban divide is not a function of differences in views about public policy. We look exhaustively at public opinion polls, and we find that on most issues, if you look at the views of non-Hispanic white Americans, there’s no difference — no significant difference — in their opinions about how much we should be spending money on things like education, health care, policing and so on.

There are a few issues, like abortion and gun rights, where there’s a gap. But the gap is not that large, and it hasn’t been growing over time, so it doesn’t explain this growing rural-urban divide.

In other words, while we are divided by place in terms of which party people support, that’s not because there’s a difference in Americans’ actual views in those two places on major issues.

So then why are people in rural America electing representatives who are so different on policy from the people they used to elect?

What we find is that when the rural-urban divide began to grow in the 1990s, it was economic factors that were driving it.

You had economic decline that was happening, starting in the 1980s: loss of family farms with agricultural consolidation, loss of jobs in extractive industries like mining and oil and the like. And then deindustrialization, which had already been hitting cities pretty hard — with NAFTA and change in trade policies, it hit rural areas to an extent that really surprised me. I wouldn’t have realized there was so much industry in rural places. So that’s in the late ’90s, early 2000s.

As all of that’s happening, rural people start to feel that this party that they had long thought was there for them, or they were at least willing to support on occasion — vote split ticket or whatever — they start to feel like it has abandoned them and that it’s no longer there for them.

I think it’s a factor that Bill Clinton was president during that point in time. Even though most Democrats in Congress were opposed to NAFTA and opposed a lot of deregulation that was happening, there were just enough Democrats endorsing it — and then Bill Clinton signing it into law. So rural people moved away from the Democratic Party and started supporting the Republican Party.

So let me push on some parts of this story. One thing that your book really did convince me of is that if you look at the timing of different things, the political divergence and economic divergence really do track each other.

But as you say, a lot of the policies people often blame here, not just NAFTA — there were a lot of free trade policies, there was a lot of deregulation — deregulation is a big focus of your book — they’re heavily supported by Republicans, to say nothing of taxes that are cut for rich people.

And then the spending cuts fall on programs that people in rural America use very heavily. Obamacare, in very important ways, subsidizes a lot of health care in rural America — helps hospitals there, helps people who are uninsured there.

The thing I was thinking as I was reading the book was that there is what happens — and then there is who is blamed for what happens. And when something happened that could be blamed on Democrats, you see it blamed on them. Why?

Well, I think you’re putting your finger on why this is so puzzling and paradoxical. Like I said, it starts with the economic stuff, but then the second phase is the development of resentment.

You go back to, say, 2008 to 2020 — at that point, rural Americans are looking at the Democratic Party and they start to think of it as having a center that is affluent people, wealthy people, people better off than themselves, who are running the party and who don’t seem to understand them or their communities. But they’re creating policies that they’re sort of foisting upon them in all sorts of different areas. And they resent it. That’s when grievance begins to grow.

So there’s this sense of anger, and it has become channeled at the Democratic Party, even though that is in many ways unfair. But I think it is true now that much of the Democratic Party, because it has become so distant from rural voters, doesn’t understand their situation and their communities. So there is a basis in fact there.

In 2008 — when George W. Bush was incredibly unpopular, the Iraq war was understood to be a disaster, the financial crisis was in full swing — Obama and the Democrats did quite well in rural America. It’s one of the last times on some of your charts when you see the cities and the rural areas swing together.

Yes.

Then the first bailout passes under George W. Bush, but the Democrats support it. The recovery from the financial crisis is slow, and it is slower in rural America. There was a feeling that the banks got bailed out, the cities ended up doing fine. The stock market comes back, but the devastation in rural America really lingers.

How much did you hear about that, and how much do you think that soured people in these areas on the Democratic Party in a kind of final fashion?

One of the things we did for our research was interviewing political party county chairs — both Democrats and Republicans — in several states. I drove thousands of miles and talked to a lot of people.

I remember one county chair saying to us: We’ve been in a recession here for 30 years.

In a sense, it’s all been a blur — from the loss of jobs that was happening in the 1990s and early 2000s, as plants closed and work forces downsized, to then what happened in 2008 and beyond, with the Great Recession. Things went from bad to worse.

How much is this educational polarization — that what you’re seeing is the cities are much more highly educated, with a greater density of college graduates? How much is the urban-rural language simply obscuring the main issue being the educational divide?

The educational divide certainly plays into it and is very important.

It’s fascinating: You go back to the 1980s, and the average person with a college degree or more in the United States voted for the Republican Party.

That changes starting in the ’90s. That group starts moving toward the Democratic Party. These are urbanites with higher education.

It’s not until 2008 and beyond that rural people start to emulate that same pattern. But the average rural person has less education, and the switch that’s happening is from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.

So the educational divide is important. But in all of our analyses, we control for that, and rurality still matters — it matters over and above that.

A coalition that is more urban and a coalition that is more rural, and the rural coalition being particularly more culturally conservative, more religious, more traditionalist — that’s a pretty common structure for political systems. We see this same divergence in many countries.

Does that imply there’s something that is, if not inevitable, then heavily predetermined here — given that it’s happening in different countries with different political parties who have passed different economic policies at different times?

Typically other countries have more parties than we do. And while the rural-urban divide has grown in lots of countries in the past few decades, it has grown most dramatically in the United States.

Here I’m turning to the work of Jonathan Rodden at Stanford — he’s done a lot of work on this. It has grown more quickly here during that time period.

I would also add that it’s more consequential in the United States because so many of our electoral institutions give extra political power to less populated places. If you think of the U.S. Senate, for example: Every state gets two senators regardless of population. So California has more than 60 times as many residents as Wyoming, but they both have two senators. And that gets replicated in all these other rural states.

That means that in the Senate, when it comes to policymaking, rural places have extra clout. It also means that in choosing the judiciary, in confirmations of judges, the rural-urban divide matters a lot. And of course, the Electoral College.

So right now, for the first time in our history, all of these advantages are consolidated in one party, and that hasn’t been the case before.

I very much buy the point that it is more consequential here because of the somewhat distinctive place-based structure of our political system. But I want to hold on this question of what the commonality across countries might teach us, or might not teach us.

I think a lot of Democrats believe something very similar to what Barack Obama said in the infamous “bitter clinger” comments. If you wipe the argument he made or some of the more condescending language that was in it — I think, very much to his regret — what he says is something like this: Rural America — and rural places — in a much more globalized, digitized, knowledge-based economy, are seeing their economies weaken. That is true across countries.

And the people who stay there — they stay there for a number of different reasons: They want to be where they grew up. They are more traditionalist. And as both the people who can leave and want to leave do, and as the people who can stay and want to stay, you have less and less economic dynamism, and you have more identification with the way things used to be, with a better time from before.

That goes alongside more religiosity. It goes alongside more traditional ways of life, like hunting. And it comes with a resentment of the urban elites who you feel are doing this to you and who don’t respect your way of life.

I’m not saying this is true, but I’m presenting it as a thing I think Democrats believe is true.

Right. So there are a lot of stereotypes there. I grew up in a rural place, and I still spend a lot of time in rural places. I think if a lot of rural Americans heard this, they would really want to push back and say: No, we’re not part of some entirely different sect of people over here.

There are lots and lots of rural Americans who do identify as Democrats. It tends to be about one-third on average now in presidential elections. And there are many other Americans in rural places whose ideas are in flux just like those elsewhere.

You’re sort of suggesting there’s a political sorting going on —

Yes.

That the people who move away have these different policy attitudes —

I’ve heard it phrased as psychological attitudes — people with more openness to experience, people who want to compete in the urban job markets. That there is a sorting happening.

Now there are other scholars than ourselves who’ve looked at this very carefully, and they find that’s not driving rural people to move to urban places. And that in fact, when people change their party, it tends to be after they’ve made a move. It’s not pulling them to urban places. So I don’t think that holds up.

You’ve been talking a bit about the rise of grievance politics and resentment. I think there’s something upstream of that — which you talk about a bit in the book. It’s affinity.

I just don’t think there’s a way to get around this: I’ve been covering politics, and particularly Democratic politics, since the early 2000s. The Democratic Party is an urban coalition. And it does, in many ways, feel distant from rural America.

I remember, in the George W. Bush years, all the talk about losing touch with the heartland. That Democrats were the party of John Kerry and coastal liberals, and Republicans were the party of the heartland. Democrats losing touch on “God, guns and gays” was the way it used to be talked about.

It seems, for reasons that aren’t primarily policy, but might have to do with religiosity and other things, there developed more affinity.

I mean, there are elites in both parties. And the elites in both parties are educated, and the elites in both parties are rich. And often the elites in both parties come from or live in cities.

And yet the elites in the Democratic Party much more identify with urban America than the elites in the Republican Party — even when the elites in the Republican Party, like Donald Trump, live in New York City. [Chuckles.] And that affinity feels very important in terms of everything that comes after.

Yes. You’re really explaining the second dynamic that we identify: This sense that rural people have of elite overreach coming from the Democrats and that Democrats don’t understand them. I think that’s a real thing, and I agree with you.

What I would say for the Democratic Party is that, unless it can overcome that, it’s going to be a minority party. It’s not going to win back the Senate again until it can overcome the rural-urban divide. It’s going to have a very challenging time getting a very big margin in the House. It’s going to be challenged in presidential elections and in many state-level elections. And that’s problematic for the country.

It means that also for rural people, they’re subjected to one-party government in so many places. If the Democratic Party just decides to throw up their hands, that they’re not going to go organize in rural places — which is what has been happening — it’s really problematic for democracy at so many levels.

The way your book is structured, you sort of say: There’s this economic divergence, and then layered on top of that very quickly is what you call elite overreach. That’s what we’re talking about here.

The way you describe it is: “It was not any one issue that tipped the scales but rather the persistent commonality that ran across them. From 2008 onward, rural Americans perceived an urban elite that sought to impose itself on far-flung places, controlling residents’ lives through new rules and procedures, in which they felt they had little voice.”

And you argue that the issue here is not the policy but the sense of respect or disrespect, of listening or not listening, of representation or absence of representation — that there was something sort of beneath policy that drove this.

Tell me about that sense of: We are being ruled from afar.

Yes, that’s right. We illustrate it in the book through a couple of different policy areas, and one is renewable energy — which, actually, you might find interesting because of the ideas that you explore in “Abundance.”

There’s fascinating literature. Scholars have looked at many different parts of the country, and when wind and solar comes into rural places, which is of course where the land is and where you need to develop that, it so often happens without rural communities having a chance to have a voice.

So there will be a big developer that comes in — a company that cuts a deal with a big landowner — and all of this happens and agreements are made before the local community hears about it. And then people are upset.

What scholars have found — who study very carefully public opinion on environmental issues — and we do, as well — is that there’s not a big difference between rural and urban Americans and their view on environmental issues. In fact, a lot of rural people care very deeply about the environment because the land is so important to them. And yet they feel that the process is really problematic.

There’s one study that was about wind farms in Indiana, and a person they quoted said: It’s not that I’m against wind energy. I’m against how it was done here.

I found this raised a lot of skepticism for me.

First: “I’m not against X” — where “X” is clean energy, affordable housing, mass transit — “I’m just against how it was done here” is, I feel, the most common structure of “I’m against X.”

But in “Abundance,” I spent a lot of time talking about and researching and reporting on how clean energy projects in particular are sited in different parts of the country. And what I can say for sure is that red states site all kinds of different forms of energy much more easily than blue states do because they have much less complex and deliberative procedures for siting them. If you want to build a wind farm in rural Texas, it is just much easier than building it in rural California or rural New York.

And yet rural Americans are not turning against the government of Texas for the lack of deliberative, consultative and veto-oriented siting.

So something about that felt off to me. I would think that would then lead to much more anger in red states, where it is much easier to just plow through a new development than it is in blue states, which have much more veto-oriented structures.

It’s very interesting that it has been easier for Republican governors to roll out these policies. I would love to look under the hood and find out the dynamics that are happening there, but we don’t do that in our book.

What I would say is that it’s problematic to have people in cities who accuse rural people of NIMBYism, when renewable energy is needed, particularly, by urban people. And so this can be a really extractive kind of industry that is just one more thing where rural people are taken advantage of and where their needs are not taken into account.

I’m getting at something even a little bit larger here than clean energy. One thing that your book seems to accept and even talk about is that the attribution of blame for policy is very, very muddy, and it relies a lot on how people get their information and whether they get their information.

You talk about a particular study where Republican policies close rural hospitals, and people are mad. And the Republican vote share goes up in the next election because people blame the party they already don’t like.

I could tell a story where people don’t like the renewable energy coming in. And even though it’s coming in more aggressively in red states because of their procedures, nobody knows that much about siting rules, so they’re still blaming the party they see as connected to renewable energy.

But there’s something here about how many of the policies that you describe as particularly painful or destructive or irritating to rural America are not promulgated by Democrats, but Democrats get blamed anyway.

Yes. That’s true. Politics is full of paradoxes.

What’s going on there, and we argue, is that there’s another component of our explanation, and that is the organizational component.

So the question is: Who is on the ground in a place connecting the dots for voters? Saying to them: Here’s what’s happening in public policy, and here’s how it matters for our community. Here’s the party that is best representing your interests and values — doing that connecting the dots.

Political parties need to do this for people. And in rural places, the Democratic Party has become very weak, so it’s much harder for them to really be there making the case. And the Republican Party, for the same kinds of reasons that all civic organizations have suffered over time, has had challenging times, as well. And yet it has been helped by other organizations that are prevalent in rural places.

We find that evangelical churches occur on a greater per capita basis in rural places. So do gun groups affiliated with the National Rifle Association. And those groups have been playing a supportive role to the Republican Party in helping to connect the dots for voters and to get out the vote essentially.

Democrats used to be aided by labor unions in rural places, and that has really been decimated very much with deindustrialization.

I want to actually spend a moment on the media side of this. I’ve talked to Democratic politicians — Barack Obama said this to me once — who say that they felt able to run in rural areas in 2000 or 2008 or 1996. But, depending on the place we’re talking about, as talk radio and Rush Limbaugh took hold, then later as Fox News rolled out — and now we have social media and all these other hyperpartisan and hyperpolarized forms of information — they don’t even feel they can get a hearing. Because the people who are interested in politics, what they are hearing is so angry at Democrats and so polarized, that there’s no way to get around it.

I have no doubt that the media matters. We do all this quantitative analysis, and we were limited to the things where we had data for all counties over these many decades. And we didn’t have a way to measure the rise of talk radio, Rush Limbaugh — and where are people listening to it? — and Fox News and the loss of local newspapers and all of these important changes in the media. I’m sure they’re important.

Exactly. The way we sum this up, if you think of what I was saying earlier about public policy issues and how we don’t differ very much: Rural and urban Americans on these issues barely disagree, but we are bitterly divided. And the divide is over partisanship.

In other words: It doesn’t have to be this way. It’s teamsmanship, it’s tribalism, but it’s not based in really different views about issues.

But it does create these self-reinforcing dynamics. It creates anger. The soft version is maybe Barack Obama’s “bitter clingers” comment. The harder version is Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment.

I remember this so strongly from the Bush era, and I see it now: When Republicans are in power, urban liberals do feel threatened, do feel like that power is being deployed against them, do feel very angry at what is being done. And then it creates political strategy. Because parties work with limited resources. They have to choose where to put their energy and their attention.

In 2016, Chuck Schumer famously said: “For every blue-collar Democrat we will lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia. And you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.”

Now whether you can repeat that is, I guess, a reasonable question to ask. But you do see the Democratic Party begin to say to itself: We’ve lost rural America. Throwing good money after bad there is not worth doing. Let’s try to pick up the suburbs.

How do you think about that, both as a matter of short-term and long-term political strategy?

It’s a losing strategy. Given what I was saying earlier about the electoral institutions in the United States, a party has to be able to win less populated places if it wants to have national power. F.D.R. really understood this, and contemporary politicians don’t.

It’s not the same to pick up those suburban voters. You need to be picking up rural voters. So it’s crucial to build that bridge. Because otherwise, you’re not going to win the Senate. The Electoral College is an uphill battle. And when it comes to House districts, we might think: Oh, well that’s not so much an issue.

Well, it is. Because Democratic votes are wasted, in effect, because they’re consolidated in densely populated places. Republican voters tend to be much more evenly distributed across the landscape. So it’s much easier for Republicans to draw districts that favor them than for Democrats to do so.

It would be good if you could do that, but the question — I don’t want to put any words in Chuck Schumer’s mouth — that I would hear from Democrats is: Can you?

Parties like to put a focus on messaging. Messaging is very surface level, and it does not have enduring effects. But organizing really matters.

An illustration of this: We were talking earlier about Congress, and the basic pattern from 1994 to the present is that rural places have elected Republicans, but in the middle of that time, things went in a different way. That was when Howard Dean became the head of the Democratic National Committee, 2005 through 2008.

His strategy was to work hard in all 50 states and particularly to organize in rural counties. Some of the county party chairs whom I interviewed still remember how well organized they were at that time. And then Barack Obama comes along and uses similar kinds of organizing strategies, and it really makes a difference.

So in 2006, Democrats take back Congress. Then in 2008, Barack Obama wins. And he does very well in rural places.

So with that kind of organizing, you can turn things around. But if you’re just going to rely on messaging, it’s not going to happen.

So then how do you tell the story of what happens after 2008?

I respect Howard Dean’s 50-state strategy, and I don’t think the Democratic Party did great organizing in the coming years. But there is a collapse in Democratic support after Barack Obama becomes president that I don’t think is explicable by organizing. It is a genuine collapse — 2010 is a wipeout for Democrats in much of rural America.

And a lot of Democrats I know say that it’s that Barack Obama was Black. That is their basic view of what happened.

I don’t think it’s your view of what happened. But what is your view of what happened?

Let me speak about both things, about: Was it because Barack Obama was Black? And then also: What happened?

A lot of people think the rural-urban divide is reducible to racism. We find that when it started in the 1990s, that was not the case. There was plenty of racism in the country among non-Hispanic whites, but it was as prevalent among urban Americans as among rural Americans.

Then you get to the period 2008 to 2020. At that point we find that there is a slightly greater concentration of racist attitudes among rural Americans than urban. It’s one factor among several that was driving the divide at that point.

The way we understand it is part of the resentment of the Democratic Party. Because rural people feel: These Democratic leaders are really working hard on behalf of urban communities, people of color and immigrants — but they don’t really understand us. It’s a factor, but it’s not a sole cause.

What is really important is that then, after you had all that organizing energy that gets mobilized in the period from 2005 to 2008, Barack Obama gets elected. And there are a lot of rural people who’ve worked hard in the campaign. They’re really excited, and they want to do more.

Then what happens is, basically, the ball is dropped by the Democratic Party, and it becomes just a mailing list of the D.N.C. And it all goes into the ether.

Meanwhile, the Tea Party mobilizes among the Republicans, and they claim the day. But it didn’t have to be this way. It was not inevitable.

I want to focus on the first point you made there. There’s a quite big but also somewhat subtle distinction between anti-Black attitudes causing the anger — and the sense that the Democratic Party is prioritizing other groups over your causing the anger.

White rural America’s sense that the Democratic Party sees all these other groups as in need of help and respect and is prioritizing them ahead of them — Arlie Hochschild’s idea about other groups getting to cut in line. And then there’s a real rise of discourse around white privilege. And this creates — we’ve seen this in our politics — a lot of anger.

Like: You’re telling me — in a poor community that has very few jobs now, where life expectancy is going down — that I have white privilege, and your urban coalition is what needs the help? Or that illegal immigrants need the help?

I’d like you to talk a bit about that distinction between the divide being discriminatory, and the divide being a feeling: That coalition doesn’t prioritize me, so I’m going to go with a coalition that does.

It’s a really important issue in that I think a lot of urban Democrats assume that what’s at play in this rural-urban divide is that rural white people are racist. What we find is that it’s not reducible to that.

The way we understand it is that it’s in this same period that there’s the sense of elite overreach on the part of Democrats, where rural Americans are looking at the Democratic Party and thinking: They don’t understand us. They don’t care about our communities.

And on this, they’re viewing the Democratic Party as really prioritizing the needs of people of color in urban communities and immigrants — but not really understanding or caring about rural people who are struggling, as well.

So into this moment of divide steps, of all people, Donald Trump — who is, I would say, more associated with New York City than any human being alive, is almost himself an emblem of New York City. How does he become this vehicle for the channeling of rural rage?

Well, I think about this Republican county chair that we interviewed in southern Ohio. The area had voted for Bill Clinton twice and for Democrats for Congress.

But then the economy really goes downhill with the loss of all these jobs, the closing of all these plants. And he said: People got tired of government. And then he said: Along comes Donald Trump. And yes, he’s rich, and he’s done all these things, but he got people really excited here.

And he said: Why are you kowtowing down to these elites? They’re not like you — this is Trump referring to Democrats.

And of course, it’s ironic because, as you’re saying, Trump himself is an elite, he’s urban, etc. But people felt that there was an affinity, that Trump was hearing them, that they had been left behind, that they hadn’t been listened to. And so he was channeling that grievance and resentment.

Trump hates all the right people.

[Soft chuckle.] That’s a way of putting it.

But that’s a powerful force in politics. We were talking earlier about elites, and one of the things I was saying was that both parties have elites.

Hillary Clinton, who runs against Donald Trump in 2016, her political background is in Arkansas. She was first lady of Arkansas and has a lot of experience alongside her husband in a state with much more rural concerns than being a real estate developer in New York City and a guy who builds golf courses.

But Trump in his campaign just hates the urban elites in the cities. And that is a stronger building of affinity, it seems to me, than more traditional identity.

I think if Bill Clinton had run against Donald Trump in 2016, Bill Clinton, with all of his skill as a politician weaving together concerns of rural and urban residents, I don’t think there’s any doubt Donald Trump would have beat him in rural America. Whether he would have beat him, I don’t know, but I think he would have beat him in rural America. Because Bill Clinton, by that point, no longer hated — never did, in fact, hate — the right people.

That raises some really difficult questions for what builds or degrades affinity when you’re trying to rebuild these relationships. I think Democrats want to believe they can do it all through positive-sum policy: Obamacare can help rural hospitals and the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill can try to do rural broadband and site factories in rural America.

And it seems to me that, as long as there is no preexisting sense of affinity, it’s all going to fall flat politically.

Well, Donald Trump has been masterful at reinforcing and widening the divide that was already growing, creating this us-versus-them politics and demonizing people on the other side. That makes it harder and harder to build affinity — and yet it’s the only hope.

Most of my scholarship until a few years ago was all about public policy and what policy can do. But I think we’re at a point now where these divides are so great that policy can’t do it all by itself.

Of course, rural places really need policies in all sorts of ways to help with the economy and with health care and education, etc. But it’s really crucial to find ways to bridge the divide. That’s where deep, long-term organizing is so important.

Your last book was about threats to democracy and authoritarianism. Do you, as a political scientist, think we are coming a lot closer to something that could spiral into civil war or something like it?

Well, that’s a really horrifying, harrowing thought, obviously. But my colleagues who are scholars of comparative politics, who study democratic deterioration around the world, have been very worried because they see the things happening here that have happened elsewhere and led to such demise.

My focus, as someone who is always hopeful about the future, is: How do we avoid that? And it’s going to take a lot of deep rebuilding and organizing.

Let’s talk about how we avoid that or begin to reverse some of the urban-rural split. Let’s take as a premise that what you say is right — that it would be good if the Democratic Party invested much more in organizing and contesting in rural areas.

I was surprised, as I read the end of the book, that you did not have more to say about who the Democratic Party runs, particularly nationally, and what they run on.

I would assume it is going to be easier for an organizer in much of rural America if it’s Andy Beshear on top of the ticket than if it’s Gavin Newsom or Kamala Harris. That it was in some ways easier when the Democratic Party was led by Harry Reid and Tom Daschle in the Senate, than now, where both the House and Senate leaders are from New York.

The political scientist Steven Teles likes to talk about costly signals — the sending of costly signals — things where you’re doing something that shows you’re a different kind of Democrat or Republican than others.

Donald Trump sends lots of costly signals. He attacks urban America and urban elites in personal, vicious, vitriolic terms. He talks about sending the National Guard into their cities — he’s talked about that for a long time. And he takes the conflict — because it communicates to the people he wants to communicate to that he’s on their side.

Yes.

If the Democratic Party really wanted to do this — if it said, we have to figure something out here, and that requires doing things that are different from what we have been doing — what can it do?

So at the moment, Trump has done very well getting elected in rural places by bigger and bigger margins, right? Fueled by grievance.

But grievance ultimately does not put food on the table. It doesn’t bring you health care — affordable health care — in your community, and it doesn’t help your kids to get a good education.

Democrats need to be in rural places to say: These issues are the priorities of our party — to help with the economy, health care, education, etc. — and to be there to make those connections for people.

If they’re not there — if they’re not campaigning there, if statewide Democrats are not going to rural places to campaign, if the party is not putting full-time organizers in rural places — then people feel abandoned there, and they feel this party doesn’t care about us.

I guess one place where I was skeptical of your book’s insistence that policy wasn’t a big contributor here was that most of the modern Democratic politicians you talked about who had been successful in rural America were known not just for their moderation but for often running against the Democratic Party.

Joe Manchin, in his first Senate campaign, shoots the cap-and-trade bill Democrats are considering with a gun to show what a different kind of Democrat he is. Ben Nelson in Nebraska, who was such a thorn in the side of the Democrats during Obamacare — the same with Congressman Stupak; Bob Kerrey, who was often very annoying to the Democratic Party when he was a representative from Nebraska; John Bel Edwards, who was the governor of Louisiana until pretty recently — a Democrat and very, very, very pro-life.

It looked to me — and it looks to me — like the Democrats who have done well in rural areas actually do differ from other Democrats on policy.

Jared Golden is a supporter of tariffs. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez has a very different kind of politics and policy than her colleagues.

I don’t know if what is happening here is that shifting on policy is a way of communicating you’re not like the other Democrat — or if it is actually the policy itself that matters. But it felt like a tension to me in your book that on the one hand, the Democratic politicians who have succeeded in rural America — and still succeed — look very different on policy than the Democrats in urban America.

And on the other hand, there’s a real push at: They don’t need to do anything on policy. They just need more organizers.

I would say, looking at the members of Congress, for whom we took a deep dive, and the Affordable Care Act — to look at all of these rural members, many of whom were swing votes on the Affordable Care Act. Most of the rural Democrats ultimately voted for it, and some ultimately voted against it.

Some of them were very progressive on economic issues, and they were trying very hard to be faithful to their communities in that. Some of them, as you say, were pro-life and not pro-choice, so they had concerns until there was a deal cut on how the A.C.A. would handle abortion.

But I would say that while incorporating rural districts and states may mean more moderates, it doesn’t necessarily mean that. Because in some rural places, a politician will represent them in a way that’s more progressive and that’s being true to their constituents.

Have we seen any of that in modern times? I mean, I would like that to be true. It would be, from my perspective, better if you could just go full economic populist — and moderate on nothing else — and win. My leftist friends tell me that’s true. I just don’t see the representatives.

Even somebody like Dan Osborn in Nebraska, who runs not as a Democrat — because the Democratic Party is just too toxic to run on in Nebraska. He is economically populist, and he also says: I will build the wall on the border with my own hands. He swings very far right from where Democrats are at that moment on immigration.

I just don’t see the examples of these Democrats, or even independents, winning back rural areas without running against some parts of the Democratic Party’s platform from the right.

And I’m not saying this because I would like to see more Democrats move to the right, but I think that seems to be what has worked.

I think it’s less moderating on issues than what issues you prioritize. The political party county chairs that we had spoken to told us that the issues that were most important to people are the economy, health care, education, etc. They were not mentioning gun rights and abortion and immigration as top issues.

So it’s a matter of the level of priority that you give those. But also different kinds of stances in different places could work.

I guess that raises the question: What happened to all those Democratic representatives who did run in exactly that way? I have watched some of the Democratic politicians who were doing that just not be able to survive.

Sherrod Brown is a very effective economic populist. And despite how much he has emphasized that set of issues for his entire career, he has gone from being extremely competitive in Ohio’s rural districts to completely destroyed in them when he was running against a car dealer who had to settle a bunch of wage-theft lawsuits. The same is true for Jon Tester in Montana. Tester was, again, a very, very capable bread-and-butter pocketbook issues politician.

Something has happened where the politicians who are doing the strategy to a T cannot survive — Montana and Ohio are far from the reddest states we have in the union.

It just seems to me that we are seeing that the drag of the national Democratic Party is making the “just talk about the popular stuff” strategy no longer viable — when maybe 10 years ago or 12 years ago, it still was.

What I’ve been describing is this historical process over several decades of how the rural-urban divide emerged. It’s now very deep, and the causes for it are multilayered and entrenched. So you can’t just overcome it with a particular race. There has to be this deep, long-term effort to rebuild bridges to rural America by the Democratic Party being there.

When we spoke with Democratic county chairs in all of these different states, they would say to us that they didn’t feel supported by their state-level party. They didn’t think the D.N.C. even knew about them.

These are local organizations. In the past, there were lots of people who would come out for meetings. Now it’s a handful of people, and they’re senior citizens, and they need support. But they did feel that when Howard Dean was the head of the D.N.C., they were getting that kind of support, and they were able to make a real difference. So that’s what’s essential.

It’s also the case that, while it can seem really daunting, in a statewide election giving some support to rural areas can make a big difference. If you use the strategy of losing by less, which is something they all talk about: There were county chairs, like when we went around Georgia, and they had had these very tight races statewide, Senate races, where senators Ossoff and Warnock got elected.

And the Democratic county chairs would say: If I can get my margin here to not be just 34 percent but get it up to 37 percent for the Democratic candidate, and if everybody does that in rural areas, we’re going to win statewide. And they did it. They felt very proud of it. They felt they had made a big difference in getting those candidates over the finish line in those very tight races.

That’s exactly the kind of thing that can make a huge difference in statewide races — for president and for governorships and for senators all across the country.

We’ll end it there. Always our final question: What are three books you would recommend to the audience?

Oh, yes, I love this question.

So I want to recommend, first, another book about rural America by a political scientist, and that’s Katherine Cramer’s book “The Politics of Resentment: Rural Consciousness in Wisconsin and the Rise of Scott Walker.” This book came out several years ago, in 2016.

It’s based on years of her going to all sorts of conversation groups around rural Wisconsin and really listening to people and understanding how they were thinking about politics in the state. It’s deeply insightful, and we really built upon her work.

For my other choices — I decided we shouldn’t just be reading nonfiction in this time. I feel strongly about that. So my second choice is going to be a novel: Barbara Kingsolver’s book, “Demon Copperhead.” Barbara Kingsolver grew up in rural Kentucky. She writes this book that’s really based in Appalachia and, I think, just really helps people to understand much more the nuance and complexity of what’s going on in one place in rural America.

And then finally: When I was a young person, I loved poetry a lot. And this year I decided I need more poetry back in my life. So I have been reading Mary Oliver’s book “Devotions,” which is a collection of a lot of her best work. She grew up in rural Ohio, and then she lived a lot of her life on Cape Cod. It’s about the beauty of natural places, and it’s also a great tribute to rural America.

Suzanne Mettler, thank you very much.

Great to be with you. Thank you.

“But no systematic review has been done about the interplay of warmer temperatures with the dynamics of atmosphere, ocean and sea ice in weather and climate extremes around the Arctic.” Zhang is the lead author of the study.
The mechanisms in question include changes in large-scale atmosphere and ocean circulation that enhance poleward atmospheric heat and moisture transport and ocean heat transport into the Arctic.
Intense cyclones and blocking high-pressure systems that obstruct the movement of other systems through the upper atmosphere further enhance warming, increasing sea ice and ice sheet temperatures and pushing the Arctic climate system to a tipping point, triggering more extremes.
“Once there is a baseline state change in climate, we also see a change in extreme events,” Zhang says.","By evaluating historical climate records, observational and projection data, an international team of researchers found a “pushing and triggering” mechanism that has driven the Arctic climate system to a new state, which will likely see consistently increased frequency and intensity of extreme events across all system components – the atmosphere, ocean and cryosphere – this century.

“We know that mean temperatures are rising, and the Arctic is commonly considered an indicator of global changes due to its higher sensitivity to any perturbation of external and internal forcings,” says Xiangdong Zhang, research professor at North Carolina State University and senior scientist at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies.

“The annual mean warming rate of the Arctic is more than three times the global average – this is known as Arctic amplification,” Zhang says. “But no systematic review has been done about the interplay of warmer temperatures with the dynamics of atmosphere, ocean and sea ice in weather and climate extremes around the Arctic.” Zhang is the lead author of the study.

The team looked at historic temperature data and the records of extreme events in the Arctic system components, as well as CMIP6 model projections that covered a period from the present-day to the end of the century. Overall, they saw that extreme events – atmosphere and ocean heatwaves, heavy precipitation, sea ice loss and ice sheet melt – have consistently occurred across the Arctic climate system with an increased frequency and intensity since the year 2000. The CMIP6, or Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, is an international project consisting of modeling centers and groups worldwide.

“We usually think about warming as a gradual, quasi-linear change of temperature over time – it slowly gets warmer everywhere,” Zhang says. “But nonlinear changes occur across the entire system. The interplay between warming and the changes in atmospheric, oceanic and sea ice dynamics creates ‘pushing and triggering’ mechanisms that result in a tipping point for the climate system.”

According to the researchers, since the year 2000 these pushing and triggering mechanisms have forced a step change, or sudden shift, in the baseline of the Arctic climate system.

The mechanisms in question include changes in large-scale atmosphere and ocean circulation that enhance poleward atmospheric heat and moisture transport and ocean heat transport into the Arctic. Intense cyclones and blocking high-pressure systems that obstruct the movement of other systems through the upper atmosphere further enhance warming, increasing sea ice and ice sheet temperatures and pushing the Arctic climate system to a tipping point, triggering more extremes.

“Once there is a baseline state change in climate, we also see a change in extreme events,” Zhang says.

According to the researchers’ analysis, since the year 2000 the probability of atmospheric heatwaves has increased by 20%; Atlantic Ocean layer warm events have increased by 76%; sea ice loss events have increased by 83%; and Greenland Ice Sheet melt extent has increased by 68%.

“Prior to the 21st century, these events were rare,” Zhang says. “But with continued warming they will become the new norm, and we could see ice-free summers in the Arctic by mid-century. More work must be done to understanding the interplay of multiscale climate drivers in the Arctic, so that we can predict and plan for the future.”

The study appears in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment. Zhang is supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The work was done by leading and early-career scientists from the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Daniel Raimi: Hello, and welcome to Resources Radio, a weekly podcast from Resources for the Future (RFF). I’m your host, Daniel Raimi. Today we talk with Professor Severin Borenstein, faculty director of UC Berkeley’s Energy Institute at Haas School of Business and chair of the board of governors for California’s Independent System Operator.

Severin has recently written about policies designed to punish “energy hogs”—households perceived as wasteful and excessive users of electricity. In today’s conversation, I’ll ask Severin whether these hogs are really that “hoggy,” or whether other factors explain why some households use more electricity than others.

We’ll talk about other options for pricing electricity, and which approaches are best for aligning economic realities with environmental and social goals. Stay with us.

Severin Borenstein from UC Berkeley, welcome back to Resources Radio.

Severin Borenstein: Nice to be with you again.

Daniel Raimi: I was looking through our archive and realized that it’s been more than four years since you were last on the show. I think we were talking about public safety power shutoffs in California, so it’s been a while. Can you remind our audience how you got interested in working on energy and environmental issues?

Severin Borenstein: Certainly. As a child, I did things like backpacking and camping, and enjoyed the environment. But actually, my career in economics started out [with me] working on industrial organization and competition policy in the airline industry, at first.

Then, I got interested in gasoline pricing—actually from an afternoon when I was filling up my tank and started talking to the owner of a gas station about how he priced gasoline. From there, [I] did a lot of work on energy.

At the time, I was at UC Davis, and I ended up being appointed the director of the University of California Energy Institute just as California was entering its electricity restructuring phase. So, I very quickly had to learn a lot about the electricity industry, because I was called to testify in the state legislature and so forth, and spent most of the late ’90s and early aughts doing research on electricity markets.

From there, California (right around in the mid-aughts) started moving toward adoption of their carbon-reduction policies—including a cap-and-trade program—and did a lot of work on that.

So, I came into environmental economics through first studying competition and markets in the energy side. Then, as California transitioned its policy toward more focus on climate change, [I] got more interested in that area.

Daniel Raimi: That’s really interesting. Yeah, it’s funny, if you start off working on energy, you’re going to end working on the environment, and vice versa.

Severin Borenstein: Yeah. These days, there’s just no way you can ignore the environmental impacts—both for environmental reasons, but also for their impacts on the markets themselves.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, for sure. So, we’re going to talk about electricity today. Specifically, we’re going to talk about how electricity gets priced for household consumers, like folks listening at home—we’ll talk about your electricity bill, essentially.

We’re going to be focused on this question of whether households that use more electricity should be charged at higher rates than those that use less electricity. This is a concept that you’ve termed “energy hogs.” So, we’re going to talk about energy hogs.

Even if you don’t agree with the rationale, What would be the argument for why one might want to charge higher electricity rates to the energy hogs?

Severin Borenstein: Let me first say, I didn’t invent the term—and I actually object to the term “energy hogs.” In some ways, that was the impetus for this work.

For a long time, electricity regulators have looked for ways to raise revenue, particularly by balancing the revenue burden on households that consume a lot of electricity. They have done this through one approach called increasing block pricing (that I’m sure many listeners are familiar with), in which, as you consume more electricity over the month, the cost of an additional kilowatt-hour goes up for you. Even though the actual cost of supplying that additional kilowatt-hour for the utility is not any different, they charge you more if you’re a heavier consumer.

The other way that’s less obvious is that most states have some fixed charge on your bill and collect some of the revenue through fixed charges and some through a volumetric charge. Those fixed charges tend to be very small, and most of the revenue is collected through volumetric charges, far higher than is actually warranted through standard economic analysis of the marginal cost, including pollution costs of consuming more electricity. So, by really raising that volumetric cost above the cost of supplying an additional kilowatt-hour, we’re once again penalizing heavier users.

Politically, how this has played out is regulators and politicians often justify this saying, “Well, if you’re a prudent user, we’re not going to charge you that much.” But if you’re a hog—suggesting if you’re not careful—then you’re going to bear more of the burden.

And that’s what really got my attention. This characterization of customers who consume a lot of electricity being energy hogs, knowing that there are lots of reasons that people consume a lot of electricity that would not be considered imprudent.

Daniel Raimi: Right, for sure. We’re going to talk more about that. But before we do (and you’ve already started this a little bit), Can you give us an example or two of how this idea has actually played out in the real world, maybe in California or elsewhere?

Severin Borenstein: Well, I’ll tell you most recently how it’s played out in California. There was a lot of debate about how California electricity bills should be structured after somebody inserted, in the California budget bill in 2022, a requirement that the California Public Utilities Commission implement what are called income-graduated fixed charges.

This is actually something that came out of work that I did with Meredith Fowlie and Jim Sallee—and I think you had Meredith on the show, and she talked about it at one point. The idea was to increase fixed charges, which are essentially zero in California, and base them on the household income. And that has actually been adopted and will go into effect for two of the three big investor-owned utilities later this year, and for the third sometime next year.

So, when the debate over fixed charges was going on, the idea was of course [that] you collect more of the revenue through fixed charges, and you lower the volumetric charge. Many of the opponents said, “Well, this is just going to benefit energy hogs, and it’s going to punish people who are more prudent consumers.” And this just took me back to the California electricity crisis in 2000–2001, when we had the same debate over increasing block pricing, where the state decided that they were going to raise rates quite a bit (like, double them) for households that consumed large quantities of electricity.

Even back then, I thought, “Wait a second, we’re not really controlling for all of the reasons people consume a lot of electricity—most importantly, and obviously, households that have a lot of people living in them.” So, I thought, nobody’s really done a study asking, What is it that’s driving large electricity consumption across homes?

Daniel Raimi: Yeah. Well, let’s get into that. I mean, you’ve published a series of blog posts, working papers, and academic articles to answer those questions. So, why don’t you tell us, Are the hogs really hogs? Are they wasteful over consumers, or are there other more benign factors that explain why some households use more than others?

Severin Borenstein: Yeah, so we can’t really see whether people are being wasteful in that they are using power they don’t really value. But we can see these benign factors that we would generally not want to penalize, such as how many people live in the house; whether they live in a hotter area; or (in California, importantly) whether they have rooftop solar, because rooftop solar doesn’t make you a more prudent consumer of electricity—it just means that you’re also producing as part of the grid from your rooftop. And those are the three major factors that I control for.

I start out by saying: We have this net electricity consumption that people get billed for. Let’s put it on a per capita basis. Then saying: Well, let’s add back in rooftop solar, since that’s just production; that’s not consumption. And let’s adjust for the differences in average consumption in the hotter climates in California—which can be quite a bit hotter than the coastal regions, which are quite temperate. And then ask, well, How different are consumers after you make those adjustments? And I also make some other adjustments for things like whether there are senior citizens or kids in the house (because they tend to use more electricity), whether they use electric heating and dryers, and so forth.

But the major three factors are how many people live in the house, the climate zone you live in, and whether you have rooftop solar. And the effect was actually much larger than I had anticipated.

If you look at the difference between the half of customers who are above median and the half of customers who are below median consumption, about 75 percent of the difference between the mean consumption in those two groups disappears when you control for the number of people, put it on a per capita basis when you add back in rooftop solar, and directly control for the average difference in consumption in these different climate zones.

That suggested to me that most of what we’re talking about when we talk about energy hogs is not things we actually want to judge as imprudent at all. It’s just differences in the way people live. And of course, ironically, the thing we are penalizing the most is having more people in your household, which, in pretty much every form of prudency and environmental impact, we would probably think of as something we want to encourage.

Daniel Raimi: I’m tempted to ask a question about degrowth, but I’m going to steer away from that and stick with our topic!

So, Severin, you had some great data, actually, that you were able to leverage to do this analysis. Tell us for a second about the data, and then we’ll keep going.

Severin Borenstein: I was very lucky that California actually does a survey of electricity consumers every five years, a very large survey. So, I had over 30,000 households from the three big utilities in California—where they not only collect information on energy use, but on demographics of the household, the type of appliances they use, whether they have an electric vehicle, and all sorts of other factors. That’s what made it possible for me to do this detailed dive in California.

Daniel Raimi: That’s great. And you also had a great term for the opposite of an energy hog. What’s the opposite of an energy hog?

Severin Borenstein: Yeah, “energy hog” is not my term. That is something that politicians and policymakers have introduced. But yeah, I needed to come up with something to describe people who were at the bottom of the distribution. And so, we called them energy angels—also meant ironically. I characterized the energy hogs as the people in the top 20th percentile of the distribution, and energy angels in the bottom.

Daniel Raimi: I was just doing some Googling to see if the internet could tell me if there’s an opposite animal from a hog, like a duck or something, but there’s no clear opposite animal from a hog … So, “angel” works really well.

You also argue in these pieces that it’s just weird to charge households different rates for electricity based on their consumption pattern, because we don’t do the same thing for most other forms of energy, right? If you go to the gas station, you don’t pay a different amount per gallon based on how many gallons you consume; you pay the same amount. So, can you say more about that?

Severin Borenstein: It is interesting that we see this (what I would call judgment-based pricing) in electricity and in natural gas, and not in many other areas. And those are the two areas that are regulated utilities, where not only the company can see pretty much all of your consumption of that good, but the regulator can, as well.

We only have one provider of those goods, typically. They know your full consumption of your, for instance, residential electricity as opposed to your consumption of food, furniture, travel, or all the other things we buy—which are spread out among different companies and don’t have regulators.

My suspicion is that the reason we see this judgment-based pricing in electricity, and to some extent in natural gas, is those are the areas where the regulator can actually see all of your consumption of that good. We don’t see it in other energy sources like gasoline, and we certainly don’t see it in all of the other things we consume that also use energy and create greenhouse gas emissions like travel, consumption of goods, deliveries, and so forth. In fact, in many of those other industries, we actually see the opposite. We see quantity discounts, loyalty bonuses, and so forth that encourage people to consume more of the good.

These two products really stand out as being priced in a very different way than most areas of consumption.

Daniel Raimi: That’s really interesting. I hadn’t thought about the loyalty discount. I always bristle when I go to the gas station and there’s an opportunity to save 10 cents on your gallon of gasoline. I always think that we should be paying more, rather than less, for gasoline—but that’s another conversation, I suppose.

So, Severin, one question that I was thinking about as I was reading this work was connected to the idea of “electrify everything.” As our listeners will know, there’s been this phrase “electrify everything” that’s been going around for a long time—that one of the key ways to deal with climate change is to clean up the electricity grid, and then electrify as much of the end-use sectors as possible like transportation, home heating, cooking, and all those things.

I think there’s a tension here between the way that certain policies treat energy hogs and the desire to electrify everything. Can you reflect on that?

Severin Borenstein: Yeah, there really is a tension when we start trying to increase the price of electricity well above the actual marginal cost of supplying it. Yet, at the same time, we want people to substitute electricity for things like gasoline and natural gas. Again, if we’re going to start penalizing people for more electricity use through this “energy hogs” approach, then I think we’re going to really undermine the transition to a cleaner energy source.

And California, unfortunately, is at the forefront of that. We have extremely high rates, and most of those rates are not collecting anything you would call marginal cost, including the emissions from generating more electricity. California has an extremely clean grid, but in work with Meredith Fowlie and Jim Sallee, we’ve estimated that way over half of what you’re paying for in your electricity bill has nothing to do with the actual marginal cost of supplying it.

Daniel Raimi: Right. We’re not going to get into depth on this, but I’m just curious if you can say what are some of those other things that people are paying for when they’re buying electricity in California?

Severin Borenstein: These days, unfortunately, one of the biggest things is responding to things that climate change is doing to the state—particularly wildfires. We have had to spend a huge amount of money on wildfire prevention, including undergrounding lines, covering insulating lines, and reducing the risk that lines start fires when they do have some problem, such as a tree falling on them.

We also are spending money on things like trying to reduce greenhouse gases—like [electric vehicle] charging stations, subsidies for rooftop solar, and investing in new energy sources before their costs have really come down. Then we also, in California, have the largest program for low-income customers in the country, and that is paid for by raising rates for everyone else.

So, all of those factors are driving up rates in California significantly without actually raising the full marginal cost, including the pollution of generating additional electricity.

Daniel Raimi: Really interesting. So, we’ve been talking about some of the major problems with electricity pricing in California and elsewhere. I’d love to ask you to maybe share an example or two of good news stories. Are there some places that you would point to that exist in the real world that you think of as approaching best practices when it comes to setting the prices right?

Severin Borenstein: I think that we are seeing a greater movement in places toward using fixed charges, but unfortunately, even that is hard to really characterize as best practice.

The goal here should be to set electricity rates so they reflect social marginal costs. That is the marginal cost of generation plus emissions, and there are very few areas that actually do that.

Unfortunately, the ones that are closer are closer because they have very high social marginal costs because of all the pollution they’re putting out. For instance, [for] some of the Midwest, that price is pretty close to social marginal costs. It’s because the cost is very high due to the greenhouse gas and sulfur dioxide emissions from generating in coal plants. That’s probably not something I want to characterize as best practices.

What I think we can do, and it’s hard to find any real good examples of this, is price our electricity to reflect the full social marginal cost. Then, if there are additional costs that need to be borne, treat them like public goods—like the way we pay for roads, police, and fire departments, which is through taxation rather than through just raising the rates for electricity.

That has not been a common practice. In fact, even areas where there are municipal utilities, the flow of funds generally goes in the other direction. The utility, actually, is generally raising funds for the city, rather than the opposite.

Daniel Raimi: Right; really interesting. So,

Severin, before we go to Top of the Stack, I would love to ask just one final contextual question. We’ve been talking about residential electricity consumption primarily on the show today, but that’s only a small part of the ways in which people use energy. Can you talk a little bit about how you see the bigger picture here?

Severin Borenstein: As we talked about before, other forms of energy consumption, direct and indirect, don’t get priced this way. If you look at the US Energy Information Administration’s energy flow diagrams, what is immediately obvious is that home residential consumption is a very small share of the energy we use.

Electricity consumption in households is about 15 percent of the entire consumption that we have in the country, and residential households are responsible for all of that, eventually. And we don’t price all of the other things that are energy consumption indirectly in the same way.

At the end of the paper, I actually do a comparison that I thought was pretty telling. I look at the difference between energy hogs and energy angels, as I characterize them in the paper, and say, “How does that stack up, for instance, against flying?” And because I’ve done a lot of work in the airline industry, as well, I do some calculations of the carbon intensity of flying.

I find that one round trip between San Francisco and Boston, in terms of carbon emissions, is about equal to the entire difference between the 25th percentile consumer of electricity and the 75th percentile after you do these adjustments that I mentioned for number of people in the house, and so forth.

So, it’s unfortunate that we really focus on home energy consumption when people are doing things like travel, consumption of goods, and so forth that also have huge energy impacts, and we don’t ever implement this judgment-based pricing.

Daniel Raimi: That’s really interesting. So, one cross-country flight essentially flips you from an angel to a hog.

Severin Borenstein: That’s right. In fact, one flight from San Francisco to London and back is the equivalent of the difference between a 10th percentile consumer and a 90th percentile consumer after you make these adjustments.

Daniel Raimi: Wow, really interesting. One conversation I would love to have on this show would be the marginal emissions from flying given the markets of airlines, because whether or not you get on that flight from San Francisco to Boston, that flight’s still going to go. But your getting on that flight probably changes the prices for other people who get on the flight. I wonder if you’ve done research on that topic. It’s kind of a whole different conversation, but that’s what I always think about.

Severin Borenstein: I think the premise isn’t quite right, because airlines are incredibly good at adjusting the number of flights. If you look at load factors, the number of seats that are occupied over a business cycle, they actually changed the number of seats pretty quickly so that the actual long-run impact of you getting on that flight is that they are more likely to keep flying that flight.

As a result, the best estimate of your impact is essentially the average consumption per passenger-mile—and that, it turns out, is incredibly high. In fact, the number I use in the paper is just the carbon dioxide content from burning the fuel.

If you read the literature on air travel, there is a disagreement of the size, but there’s no disagreement that the impact is much larger than that, because airlines are emitting black carbon and other greenhouse gases at high altitudes that have much higher impact.

Now, how much higher ranges from up to more than double. I don’t use those numbers, but if that’s the case, then flying has definitely changed the way I think about getting on a plane.

Daniel Raimi: I know. I remember because I saw you by happenstance in Ann Arbor, Michigan, when you were meeting with our mutual friend Katie Hausman.

Severin Borenstein: That’s right.

Daniel Raimi: We talked about the carbon costs of flying, and how much it’s affected the way that you’ve decided about traveling to conferences and stuff like that.

Severin Borenstein: Yeah, it’s really given me pause about travel and, unfortunately, it’s also the case that we’re probably further from a sustainable air travel than we are from pretty much any other form of travel. Sustainable aviation fuels are still very expensive, and they’re really not that sustainable either. They’re biofuels that don’t really cut the greenhouse gas emissions by very much.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, I know we’ve done an episode on that actually with our colleague, Nafisa Lohawala.

Well, Severin, we could keep talking for hours about airlines, electricity, and so much more, but I’d love to ask you now the last question we ask all our guests, which is to recommend something that you’ve read, watched, or heard that you think is really great and that you think our listeners might enjoy. So, what’s at the top of your literal or your metaphorical reading stack?

Severin Borenstein: Well, this is actually on my literal stack. It’s a book that I was given by my friend and former graduate student, Ryan Kellogg (whom you’ve had on the show), which is called Infrastructure: A Guide to the Industrial Landscape by Brian Hayes.

It is on all sorts of infrastructures, so it’s got everything from a section on power plants to a section on airports, shipping, communications, and all the towers in each of these industries. It describes what the infrastructure is, what it does, and how it works, and also gives you a sense of scale of how big these things are physically, of how much land they take up, and so forth.

I found it just a fascinating read to understand and appreciate all of the different types of infrastructure that we have in the country. It even has a section on recycling centers. So, Ryan got this book, and he said he really enjoyed it, so he got me a copy of it, and I thought that would be something that would be great to share with your audience.

Daniel Raimi: This looks totally up my alley. Oh my gosh, this looks fantastic. It’s definitely going to be on my coffee table within a few days.

Great. Well, Severin Borenstein from UC Berkeley, thank you so much for coming onto the show. Thank you for recommending this awesome looking book, and for sharing information with us about energy hogs, energy angels, flying, and so much more.

Severin Borenstein: Thank you.

What Future Developments Could Enhance South32's Critical Metals Position?
Several potential developments could further strengthen South32's critical metals portfolio, particularly as the mining industry evolution continues to accelerate.","How Critical Metals Position South32 for Energy Transition Success

South32 has undergone a remarkable transformation since its 2015 demerger from BHP, evolving from a traditional mining company with significant coal exposure into a diversified critical metals producer. This strategic shift positions the company at the forefront of the global energy transition, with operations focused on materials essential for renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles, and clean technology manufacturing.

The company's portfolio now centers on commodities that are fundamental to decarbonization efforts worldwide. Unlike many large-cap miners that remain heavily exposed to iron ore or petroleum, South32 has deliberately cultivated exposure to critical metals in South32 mining operations that directly support electrification and renewable energy deployment. Furthermore, this approach aligns with the broader critical minerals energy transition currently reshaping the mining sector.

What Critical Metals Does South32 Currently Produce?

South32's critical metals portfolio spans three primary categories: manganese, zinc, and aluminium value chain products. Each plays a crucial role in the energy transition landscape.

Manganese: The Overlooked Battery Component

South32 controls approximately 10% of global seaborne manganese supply through its GEMCO operation in Australia's Northern Territory. The facility produced 3.6 million tonnes of manganese ore in FY2024, making it one of the world's most significant manganese suppliers.

Manganese serves dual purposes in the energy transition:

Battery cathodes: Essential for lithium manganese oxide (LMO) and nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) battery chemistries

Steel strengthening: Critical for infrastructure supporting renewable energy installations

Supply security: Addresses U.S. import dependence, with America sourcing 100% of manganese requirements from foreign suppliers

The GEMCO operation maintains proven and probable ore reserves of 134 million tonnes at 43% manganese grade, providing decades of production capability. This reserve base represents substantial value given manganese's critical mineral designation by the U.S. government.

Zinc Production Across Multiple Jurisdictions

The Cannington mine in Queensland stands as one of the world's largest silver-lead-zinc operations by production volume. In FY2024, Cannington delivered:

89,000 tonnes of zinc in concentrate

6.2 million ounces of silver as by-product

Consistent production from a world-class orebody

Zinc's importance extends beyond traditional applications. The International Zinc Association reports that approximately 50% of zinc consumption supports galvanizing steel, which provides corrosion resistance essential for renewable energy infrastructure. Solar panel mounting systems and wind turbine structures rely heavily on galvanized steel components for long-term durability in outdoor environments.

Aluminium Value Chain Integration

South32 maintains significant exposure across the aluminium supply chain through operations spanning three continents:

Operation Location FY2024 Production Ownership Worsley Alumina Western Australia 3.9 million tonnes 86% Brazil Alumina Brazil 1.2 million tonnes 100% Mozal Aluminium Mozambique 265,000 tonnes 47.1%

This lightweight metal forms the backbone of renewable energy infrastructure, serving as the primary material for solar panel frames, wind turbine components, and electric vehicle body structures. Consequently, the geographic diversification provides operational resilience while exposing the company to varying regulatory environments.

How Will the Hermosa Project Transform South32's Critical Metals Profile?

The Hermosa project in Arizona represents a pivotal development for both South32 and U.S. critical minerals security. This operation will become the only advanced-stage mining development in the United States capable of producing two federally-designated critical minerals: manganese and zinc.

Arizona's Strategic Mining Development

Located in Arizona's Patagonia Mountains, Hermosa received Fast-41 permitting designation under the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, streamlining regulatory approval processes for strategically important projects. This designation reflects the project's significance for domestic supply chain security, particularly in light of the recent US critical minerals order emphasising domestic production.

The Taylor Deposit contains proven and probable reserves of 56 million tonnes at 9.4% zinc equivalent, while the Clark Deposit holds mineral resources of 278 million tonnes at 10.2% manganese. These substantial resources provide the foundation for long-term production capability.

Production Timeline and Scale

South32 made the final investment decision for Hermosa in February 2024, triggering a construction timeline leading to:

First production: Second half of 2027

Full production capacity: 3 million tonnes annually by 2031

Mine life: 28 years for initial Taylor Deposit

Capital investment: US$2.16 billion over construction phase

The project economics demonstrate attractive returns with a post-tax net present value of US$686 million and internal rate of return of 12%. These metrics support the investment case for developing domestic critical minerals production.

Domestic Supply Chain Implications

Hermosa addresses critical vulnerabilities in U.S. supply chains by establishing domestic production of materials previously sourced entirely from imports. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, America currently imports:

100% of manganese requirements (primarily from Gabon, South Africa, and Australia)

Significant zinc imports to supplement domestic production

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides additional support through tax incentives, including the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit offering up to $35 per kilogram for domestically produced critical minerals.

Which Operational Challenges Have Impacted South32's Critical Metals Output?

Despite its strategic positioning, South32 faces operational challenges that highlight the vulnerabilities inherent in critical minerals supply chains.

Cyclone Disruptions in Northern Territory

Cyclone Megan struck the Northern Territory in March 2024, causing significant disruptions at the GEMCO manganese facility. The Category 3 cyclone forced operations to suspend for several weeks, demonstrating the vulnerability of critical mineral supply chains to extreme weather events.

The impact included:

8% reduction in FY2024 manganese ore production compared to FY2023

Several months of recovery time to restore full operations

Approximately US$150 million in EBITDA impact from operational disruptions

Northern Australia experiences an average of 4-5 tropical cyclones per season, with Category 3 events like Cyclone Megan occurring approximately once every 5-10 years in the Groote Eylandt region. This frequency underscores the need for enhanced resilience planning in critical minerals operations.

Power Supply Constraints in Mozambique

The Mozal Aluminium smelter faces potential care and maintenance status due to chronic power supply instability. South32 announced a US$372 million impairment charge in August 2024, reflecting the challenges of maintaining aluminum production in regions with unreliable energy infrastructure.

Key factors affecting Mozal operations:

900 MW continuous power requirement for smelter operations

Mozambique's installed capacity of approximately 2,600 MW versus peak demand exceeding 3,000 MW

Production decline from 286,000 tonnes in FY2023 to 265,000 tonnes in FY2024

The World Bank's Mozambique Energy Sector Report highlights that energy reliability remains a critical constraint for industrial operations in sub-Saharan Africa, with the country ranking in the bottom quartile for power supply reliability.

Jurisdictional Risk Management

South32's geographic diversification provides operational resilience but exposes the company to varying levels of political stability and regulatory environments. The Fraser Institute's Annual Survey of Mining Companies ranks jurisdictions by investment attractiveness:

Australia: 4th globally for investment attractiveness

United States: Top-tier mining jurisdiction

Mozambique: 58th out of 62 jurisdictions surveyed

This risk distribution balances growth opportunities in emerging markets with operational security in stable jurisdictions, reflecting the company's evolving critical minerals strategy.

What Role Do Critical Metals Play in South32's Revenue Transformation?

The shift toward critical metals has fundamentally transformed South32's financial profile since its 2015 demerger from BHP.

Portfolio Evolution Since Demerger

At the time of demerger, South32's asset portfolio included significant thermal coal exposure through Illawarra Coal and South Africa Energy Coal. Coal represented approximately 23% of group EBITDA in FY2015.

By FY2024, the revenue composition had shifted dramatically:

Commodity Segment FY2024 Revenue Percentage of Total Aluminium US$2.45 billion 41% Manganese US$1.37 billion 23% Base metals (Zn, Pb, Ag) US$1.14 billion 19% Other operations US$1.02 billion 17% Total Revenue US$5.98 billion 100%

This transformation positions South32 with approximately 83% of revenue from commodities classified as energy transition-exposed, compared to major diversified miners like BHP where iron ore represents approximately 54% of revenue.

Margin Improvement Through Portfolio Optimization

The strategic shift has enhanced profitability metrics:

FY2024 Underlying EBITDA margin: 31.8%

FY2015 EBITDA margin: 28.4%

Carbon emissions reduction: 15% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity from FY2023 levels

Future Revenue Projections

Bloomberg consensus forecasts project revenue growth driven by Hermosa production ramp-up:

FY2025: US$6.5 billion

FY2026: US$6.3 billion

FY2027: US$7.0 billion (reflecting Hermosa contribution)

FY2028: Continued growth from expanded critical metals production

The projected EBITDA margins demonstrate sustained profitability: 26.2% (FY2025), 31.7% (FY2026), and 30.0% (FY2027).

How Does South32's Critical Metals Strategy Compare to Major Mining Peers?

South32's focused approach to critical metals in South32 mining operations differentiates it from traditional large-cap miners.

Differentiated Exposure Profile

Unlike Rio Tinto's iron ore focus or BHP's petroleum exposure, South32 concentrates on materials directly supporting electrification and renewable energy deployment:

South32 Commodity Mix:

Aluminium value chain: 41% of revenue

Manganese: 23% of revenue

Base metals (Zn, Pb, Ag): 19% of revenue

No iron ore or petroleum exposure

BHP Comparison:

Iron ore: 54% of FY2023 revenue

Copper: 21% of revenue

Metallurgical coal: 14% of revenue

Rio Tinto Comparison:

Iron ore: ~60% of FY2023 earnings

Aluminium: ~24% of earnings

Copper: ~11% of earnings

Valuation Metrics Analysis

South32's growth prospects are reflected in valuation metrics as of October 2024:

Company Market Cap (USD) FY2026 P/E EV/EBITDA PEG Ratio South32 US$9.2 billion 16.3x 5.4x 1.7x Rio Tinto US$124 billion 10.4x – 12.5x BHP US$144 billion 13.8x – –

South32's PEG ratio of 1.7x suggests more attractive growth prospects relative to traditional mining peers, despite trading at a premium P/E multiple.

Geographic Risk Distribution

South32's operations balance stable jurisdictions with emerging market opportunities:

Australia: 50% of assets by value (estimated)

Americas: 30% (including Hermosa development)

Africa: 20% (primarily Mozal operations)

This distribution contrasts with peers having heavier concentration in single jurisdictions or commodity types, particularly as the industry embraces data-driven mining operations to optimise performance across diverse geographic locations.

What Investment Implications Arise from South32's Critical Metals Focus?

Several factors support the investment thesis for critical metals exposure through South32.

Supply-Demand Fundamentals

Global critical metals demand faces structural growth drivers:

Demand growth projection: 3-7x increase by 2030 due to renewable energy deployment

Electric vehicle adoption: Accelerating demand for battery materials including manganese

Grid infrastructure: Massive copper and aluminum requirements for transmission expansion

The International Energy Agency projects that demand for critical minerals could increase by up to six times by 2040 under stated energy policies, with even higher growth under net-zero scenarios.

Government Policy Support

Multiple jurisdictions are implementing policies supporting critical minerals development:

United States:

Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives

Critical Materials Strategy designation

Fast-track permitting for strategic projects

Australia:

Critical Minerals Strategy 2023-2030

Export finance support for critical minerals projects

Research and development incentives

These policy frameworks provide tailwinds for projects like Hermosa while supporting long-term demand visibility.

ESG Considerations

Critical metals mining presents both opportunities and challenges from an ESG perspective:

Positive factors:

Supports global decarbonization objectives

Enables renewable energy deployment

Reduces dependence on geopolitically sensitive suppliers

Challenges:

Mining operations inherently involve environmental impacts

Social license requirements in local communities

Water usage and waste management considerations

South32's approach includes low-carbon mine design, automation focus, and community engagement programs to address investor ESG concerns.

How Might Commodity Price Volatility Affect South32's Critical Metals Returns?

Critical metals in South32 mining operations often exhibit different price dynamics compared to traditional bulk commodities.

Price Correlation Analysis

London Metal Exchange data demonstrates varying volatility patterns:

Zinc prices: US$2,500-3,500/tonne range over past 5 years

Iron ore comparison: US$80-190/tonne range (wider volatility)

Manganese: Less transparent pricing but generally less volatile than iron ore

Critical metals prices respond more directly to industrial demand and supply disruptions rather than broad economic cycles, providing different risk-return characteristics compared to bulk commodities.

Hedging and Risk Management

South32 employs selective hedging strategies:

Selective hedging for base metals exposure

Upside participation maintained in critical metals price appreciation

Balance approach: Cash flow stability versus growth potential

This strategy recognizes that critical metals may experience different price cycles than traditional commodities, warranting flexible risk management approaches.

Long-term Contracting Opportunities

Critical metals producers increasingly secure long-term supply agreements with:

Battery manufacturers requiring security of supply

Renewable energy companies planning multi-year project pipelines

Government stockpiling programs for strategic materials

These arrangements provide revenue visibility and reduce spot price exposure, particularly valuable for capital-intensive projects like Hermosa.

What Future Developments Could Enhance South32's Critical Metals Position?

Several potential developments could further strengthen South32's critical metals portfolio, particularly as the mining industry evolution continues to accelerate.

Exploration Pipeline Expansion

South32 maintains active exploration programs targeting critical minerals:

Key Projects:

Ambler Metals JV (Alaska): Copper-zinc-lead-gold exploration with Trilogy Metals

Jessica copper project (Northern Territory): Farm-in agreement with Encounter Resources

Isa Valley Copper/Zinc: Early-stage exploration prospects

These programs provide optionality for expanding critical metals production beyond current operations and the Hermosa development.

Technology Integration Opportunities

Advanced mining technologies could improve operational efficiency:

Automation systems: Reducing operational costs and improving safety

AI-driven optimization: Enhancing extraction efficiency and ore recovery

Remote monitoring: Minimizing weather-related disruptions through early warning systems

South32's operations in developed mining jurisdictions position the company to implement these technologies effectively.

Strategic Partnership Potential

Collaboration opportunities could accelerate development:

Potential Partners:

Battery manufacturers seeking supply security

Automotive companies requiring critical materials

Government agencies supporting domestic production

Such partnerships could provide funding for expansion while securing long-term demand, similar to arrangements seen in other critical minerals projects globally.

The combination of existing production capabilities, the Hermosa development pipeline, and potential partnership opportunities positions South32 as a significant participant in the global transition toward clean energy infrastructure. The company's focus on critical metals in South32 mining operations aligns with structural demand growth while providing exposure to commodities less correlated with traditional economic cycles.

“We can provide natural gas resources very near-term — almost immediately — and this is just good business,” Gordon said.","SANTA FE, N.M. — Two western state governors set partisanship aside on Monday to unveil a first-of-its-kind infrastructure roadmap to position “responsibly produced” natural gas from the Rocky Mountain region as a cost-effective, low-carbon solution for growing U.S. and Asian energy markets.

The announcement was made during the New Mexico and Wyoming Advanced Energy Roundtable, where New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon met with Japanese Ambassador Shigeo Yamada to discuss potential energy and technology partnerships.

The “Rocky Mountain Gas Roadmap & Implementation Playbook,” developed under the Western States and Tribal Nations Energy Initiative, outlines two main routes — the Pacific Northwest Pathway and the Southwest Pathway — that leverage existing infrastructure and rights-of-way to efficiently move Rocky Mountain natural gas to expanding markets outside the region.

Among the playbook’s attributes, the governors said, is that it spells out the quickest and most affordable connections to Asian markets without relying on the Panama Canal.

“New Mexico is ready to lead the way in unlocking the Rocky Mountain’s potential to create jobs and opportunity, strengthen international collaboration, and write the next chapter in global energy,” said Grisham in a written statement.

“Putting the Rockies’ abundant energy to work benefits red and blue states by fueling our economies and the transition to clean energy,” she said.

Gordon noted that both Wyoming and New Mexico have led the country in producing certified gas meeting the United Nations’ standards.

“Japan is particularly interested in that opportunity for cooperation and investment,” he continued.

“We can provide natural gas resources very near-term — almost immediately — and this is just good business,” Gordon said. “It’s about moving into a future that meets climate concerns while making sure energy is there as demand continues to grow enormously.”

According to the playbook, Rocky Mountain gas has a number of competitive advantages: cost-effective production with breakeven costs between $3.10 and $3.90 per MMBtu, low-carbon certified gas from producers who have achieved significant methane emissions reductions, and 277 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable reserves capable of serving both regional and international demand.

The Pacific Northwest Pathway described in the report serves power markets in Utah, Idaho and the Pacific Northwest, while the Southwest Pathway expands supplies to the Desert Southwest and Mexico.

The Southwest route reduces shipping times to Asia by approximately 50% compared to Gulf Coast routes through the Panama Canal. Both pathways target growing demand from data centers, manufacturing and electrification.

The creation of the playbook and the years of work that went into it were funded by the Wyoming Energy Authority, the New Mexico Economic Development Department, the New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department, the Utah Governor’s Office of Energy Development, the Southern Ute Growth Fund, the Jicarilla Apache Nation, and the western Colorado counties of Garfield, Mesa, Moffat and Rio Blanco.

Yamada described it as a “very informative and detailed introduction to the potential of Rocky Mountain natural gas,” and said, “it is very much appreciated by the Japanese.”

“I hope today’s meeting will lead to further cooperation and economic partnership between Japan and the states of New Mexico and Wyoming,” Yamada said.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rocky-mountains-pdmara.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 16:04:39.763050

Meet our newest Net-Zero Hero, Warinda Harris! As an organizer with Central Texas Interfaith (CTI), Warinda is helping Austin communities build power, strengthen civic engagement, and advance environmental equity. Through her work on green space access and equity, Warinda has helped connect residents in East and South Austin with opportunities to shape the future of their neighborhoods. CTI has partnered with Austin Parks and Recreation, Huston-Tillotson University, and local organizations through the national People, Parks, and Power initiative to ensure that every Austin resident has safe, welcoming access to nearby nature.

Central Texas Interfaith is an affiliate of the Industrial Areas Foundation, the largest and longest-standing network of faith and community-based organizations in the country. It is a broad-based organization of congregations, public schools, worker organizations, health and legal clinics, and neighborhood associations across the five-county area that work together to address public issues that affect the well-being of our families and communities.

We met with Warinda to talk about how community organizing can drive environmental justice, how storytelling sparks policy change, and why building relationships is at the heart of a more equitable and resilient Austin.

What inspired you to take action?

During the pandemic, our leaders at CTI worked hard to stay in touch with each other and share their experiences. We have leaders from all over the area, but we found that our folks in East and South Austin were experiencing the outdoors differently from their wealthier West-side neighbors. Many of them were considered essential employees and could not work from home. They were dying at a higher rate because they were struggling to not bring COVID into their homes. They were also finding it difficult to distance outside with their families and see their neighbors at local parks because their green spaces did not have the infrastructure to support it. Our leaders saw this as an equity issue and began exploring how to engage around it.

Warinda stands in the pocket park of CTI’s most recent project.

How did you do it?

In 2022, Central Texas Interfaith became a part of the People, Parks, and Power cohort through the Prevention Institute. We’re part of a cohort of 14 organizations from around the U.S., all working on green space equity, sharing knowledge with each other, coming into community with each other, and learning from each other as we do the work. We’re part of the first national funding initiative in the U.S. to support power-building by community-based organizations to reverse deep-seated park and green space inequities in communities of color across the country.

Photos of a group of students, faculty, and CTI members discussing pocket park plans outdoors.

We began establishing relationships with our neighbors at Austin Parks and Recreation by setting up meetings to engage with them, learn from them, and have our leaders share stories so they might also learn from us. We found partners in our school district and with the Cities Connecting Children to Nature Initiative. Our leaders educated themselves on our parks system and the history of our city that created it. They gathered within the community to learn about how folks in our neighborhoods feel about their green spaces. While Austin is a green city with many options, we heard that lots of people couldn’t always get to bigger parks — and didn’t always feel like those spaces were really intended for them anyway.

We learned that our parks department has a goal of ensuring a green space within a 10-minute walk of every resident, and we liked that goal. So we turned to the community and said, Is this real for you? Do you see this? And what we often heard was, ‘Yeah, but what do you mean by green space? And what do you mean by park? I go to the space around my local elementary school, or this little green area that I take walks around.’ It turns out that these spaces were pocket parks, and they just didn’t know it. What those spaces looked like and how they were identified by the community were sometimes different than those on the west side of I-35. So we discussed those differences and began to brainstorm ways to narrow and then erase the gap.

Photos of Warinda speaking.

What’s been most rewarding about getting involved in this way?

We work with many people who are used to having negative experiences with power. They’ve seen it used against them and hSave felt helpless. Over the years, and particularly in this work, we focus on helping our community members develop a new relationship with power. They recognize that it doesn't have to be negative, and it doesn’t have to be one-sided. We’re intentional about providing a space in which our neighbors can discover their own voices and use them. They can meet power with their own power. We provide opportunities for our member institutions to negotiate effectively through the political process with public officials around issues of common concern.

Top to bottom: People sit and talk around a green space; a person speaks to an audience of community members outdoors.

What’s been particularly rewarding in our work around green spaces is seeing how our neighbors come into power and what they do with it. For example, CTI student leaders at Huston-Tillotson University — Austin’s oldest institution and proud HBCU — held house meetings on campus on the subject of Black men’s mental health. They listened to young men talk about how they loved their school in East Austin and felt safe on campus within the quad, but that as soon as they stepped outside the gates of the campus and hit the sidewalk in front of the university, they could immediately tell that they were seen as a threat to people around them — people who didn’t know anything about them. They yearned for a space outside, where they could just sit under a tree to do their calculus homework — or nothing at all — and be comfortable in their own skin without someone treating them as a potential criminal. They wanted to be out in nature and not in danger.

There happened to be a parcel of land across the street from Huston-Tillotson that appeared to be vacant, and when leaders inquired, they learned that it was actually owned by Austin Parks and Recreation. The leaders approached the parks department, and our neighbors there responded positively to the idea of students organizing a group to activate the space for use. In May 2024, CTI and Austin Parks and Recreation partnered on a grant proposal offered by landscape architectural firm Design Workshop.

Top to bottom: Warinda stands in the pocket park across from Huston-Tillotson; empty pocket park and site of the next park.

When the grant was awarded, students pulled community members into the park to speak directly with the parks department about what they wanted to see in this space. Student leaders worked with Austin Parks Foundation to host two well-attended It’s My Park Day events in Fall 2024 and Spring 2025. Their work resulted in the creation of a park activation toolkit that provides a reference for community members who want to activate parkland ahead of funding. They were so successful that Design Workshop’s non-profit arm, Design Workshop Foundation, selected the site as its Summer 2025 focus of the Charles Fountain Internship Project, bringing seven architectural students of color from around the country to provide programming options to the parks department for future funding. At the end of the summer, these interns handed their findings off to our student leaders to move the project forward. Huston-Tillotson professors are now creating a curriculum around student experiential learning at the site, focused on reaching out to the neighborhood around College Row to involve the community in activation and future programming. As Huston-Tillotson’s CTI organizer, we’re enormously proud of these young leaders and their work.

What’s been the toughest part?

We’re living in a time during which, across the board, people feel that their institutions have let them down, and confidence in institutions — religious/civic/governmental — is at an all-time low. As our work focuses on building community power through institutions, it can sometimes be difficult to gain trust. But with patience and an eye toward long-term gain, we do it one conversation at a time, one house meeting at a time — developing leaders who want to act and who see the value of working with others for the common good.

Top to bottom: Students presenting and conversing in the empty pocket park; CTI presenting to a group of people.

How do you help community members share their stories in a way that sparks action and policy change?

As we develop leaders, we also work with them to develop their personal stories — the stories that are unique to them, that have shaped them and their worldview, and that have caused them to act. We bring them into a community with other leaders who will be impacted by their stories and who have their own to share. The key is understanding that their stories are worth sharing, that no one can tell them like they can, and that by collective sharing with others, in conjunction with educating themselves on the issues, they can drive policy creation and change.

What advice do you have for others?

Practice having a conversation. People are struggling and are feeling alone. They want to connect with others but don’t know how to begin. Our advice: begin a conversation with someone in your circle of acquaintance who you want to know better. Begin with no expectation of solving a problem or being in agreement with them on anything other than that you want to know each other better. Then, listen more than you talk. Keep an open mind, and go where the conversation takes you. And if you find yourself thinking differently about something you’ve previously believed, take the opportunity to change your mind.

“As the energy industry faces unprecedented demand growth in the coming years, I am excited to lead the New Jersey Green Bank in collaboration with key industry stakeholders that seek to diversify and decarbonize our energy sources,” said Lechky. “I look forward to establishing partnerships with private capital in support of technological innovation and the clean energy entrepreneurs that are delivering a lasting and positive impact on our environment, the economy, and New Jersey communities.”

Master plan

The Green Bank’s creation stems from Murphy’s 2019 Energy Master Plan and Executive Order No. 316. The EO tasked the NJEDA with launching programs to support building electrification and clean energy financing.

The NJGB is modeled on green banks in other states. It will focus on mobilizing private investment through financial tools, such as warehousing and securitization products that address gaps in current climate capital markets.

NJEDA Chief Economic Transformation Officer Kathleen Coviello applauded Lechky’s hiring.

“We are excited for Scott Lechky to join the New Jersey Green Bank, which is poised to support the Murphy administration’s mission to combat climate change, transition to 100% clean energy, and strengthen our communities and economy for generations to come,” said Coviello.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/04/Earth-Day_Depositphotos_666723466.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 17:20:11.904311

,EVs,2025-10-21 18:52:53+00:00,Tech Brew,New report on US EV charging infrastructure finds continued but slower growth in Q3,Jordyn Grzelewski,,,,,https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/10/21/paren-report-us-ev-charging-infrastructure,"The number of public EV fast chargers moved up and to the right in Q3—but at a slower pace than in the previous quarter.
That’s according to EV charging data provider Paren’s latest quarterly report on EV fast-charging in the US.
“Quarter on quarter, the pace of new deployments slowed slightly, following a seasonal pattern,” according to the report.
“But EV drivers enjoyed a more robust and extensive network of fast charging stations during the summer.
The numbers reflect the fact that charging networks increasingly are building stations with eight or more charging stalls.","The number of public EV fast chargers moved up and to the right in Q3—but at a slower pace than in the previous quarter.

That’s according to EV charging data provider Paren’s latest quarterly report on EV fast-charging in the US. Despite the slight slowdown, the firm maintains its previous prediction that 16,700 new fast-charging ports will be deployed in the US in 2025.

“Quarter on quarter, the pace of new deployments slowed slightly, following a seasonal pattern,” according to the report. “But EV drivers enjoyed a more robust and extensive network of fast charging stations during the summer. Utilization rates and reliability are noticeably up while prices remained mostly unchanged.”

Key takeaways: According to Paren’s data, chargepoint operators added 699 new fast-charging stations in Q3, down 12% from the previous quarter, for a total of 12,375 stations. Those stations encompassed 4,061 new ports, down 7.7% QoQ, for a total of 64,486 ports. The numbers reflect the fact that charging networks increasingly are building stations with eight or more charging stalls.

Q3 marked a record-setting sales period for EVs as consumers rushed to take advantage of federal tax credits on EV purchases before the incentives expired at the end of September. Analysts widely expect a slowdown in EV sales in Q4.

Meanwhile, Paren expects to see the pace of new charging infrastructure deployments pick up in Q4. The firm largely attributed the Q3 slowdown to typical seasonal patterns.

“Growth remains healthy when you look at the year over year for the port growth,” Bill Ferro, Paren’s CTO and co-founder, said during a webinar. “That growth is 21%, which is phenomenal.”

Tesla led the way on Q3 deployments with 1,820 new ports, representing 44.8% of openings, according to the report. Next in terms of deployments were ChargePoint and Red E, with 300 and 215, respectively.

The report highlighted new charging network Ionna’s addition of 12 new stations with 132 charging ports, and Red E’s climb to third place on Paren’s leaderboard, as the chargepoint operator expanded beyond Michigan.

Every state got at least one new station; California, Texas, and New York were the three states with the most growth.

Other trends: Meanwhile, 45 states saw increases in fast-charger utilization rates, which Paren attributed in part to demand fueled by summer road trips. The top states for increased utilization were Maine, Montana, and New York. Overall, the utilization rate grew from 16.1% in Q2 to 16.7% in Q3.

“What I found interesting when we looked at this data is, we looked across the northern-tier states, from Washington through Montana all the way over to Maine, and we’re seeing nice, healthy increases,” Ferro said. “That tells me a couple of things: One is, the infrastructure is there to support the vehicles that want to travel. And then, No. 2 is that the drivers have enough confidence in that infrastructure to take the great American road trip.”

And while reliability improved across the country, it was a mixed bag on a state-by-state level, with 32 states doing better on reliability, 15 doing worse, and four staying the same. Oklahoma remained the lowest-ranked state, but had the best quarter-over-quarter improvement.

“Overall, these numbers look very positive and indicative of the growth of infrastructure with new, more reliable hardware, the renewed focus on maintenance across the board, and some of the refreshes that are still happening across the country,” Ferro said of the report’s findings.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/33568c9af903b0eac97cefe76bf72666dbfffad6-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-10-21 15:19:27.794123

Bottom line SB 711 represents California’s latest move to more closely synchronize its tax code with the modern federal landscape.","After nearly a decade of lagging behind federal tax updates, California has finally hit “refresh.” Signed into law on October 1, 2025, Senate Bill (SB) 711 delivers the most sweeping overhaul of California’s tax conformity rules since 2015.

The legislation advances the state’s conformity to the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2025, for taxable years beginning on or after that date, thereby bringing California into line with hundreds of federal tax changes made over the past decade. This alignment is designed to simplify compliance and reduce costly inconsistencies between federal and state returns. But conformity also comes with caveats, and taxpayers will need to understand where California continues to chart its own course.

The major changes introduced by SB 711

Updating California’s IRC “conformity date” to January 1, 2025, the bill incorporates several federal amendments enacted during the last decade. For example, one major innovation in SB 711 is the overhaul of California’s research credit. Starting in 2025, taxpayers may use the Alternative Simplified Credit method under IRC § 41(c)(4), which was adjusted with lower state percentages for qualified research expenses (3% and 1.3% instead of 14% and 6%). Other notable modifications include conformity to federal limitations on IRC § 1031 exchanges to real property and the elimination of the deferral for exchanges of certain non-real property.

Of course, many instances of nonconformity to recent federal enactments remain, including:

Corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). SB 711 continues to exclude the new federal CAMT, created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), from conformity.

Renewable energy credits. SB 711 does not adopt the clean energy credits added under the IRA.

Net operating loss rules. California continues to diverge from federal carryback and carryforward limits.

IRC 163(j). SB 711 continues nonconformity to interest expense limitations under IRC § 163(j).

One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) (P.L. 119-21). Because SB 711 conforms to the IRC as of January 1, 2025, it does not include changes made under the OBBBA, which was signed by US President Donald Trump earlier this year.

Preparing for the transition

SB 711 applies to both the personal income tax and corporation tax regimes for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. Taxpayers should begin modeling how the new conformity affects their liabilities and planning strategies. Key steps include:

Reviewing federal provisions now incorporated into state law.

Identifying exceptions and modified rules applicable to your business or filing type.

Consulting tax professionals to evaluate the impact on research and development incentives, loss carryovers, and credit eligibility, among others.

Monitoring California Franchise Tax Board guidance as the agency clarifies implementation details over the coming months.

Bottom line

SB 711 represents California’s latest move to more closely synchronize its tax code with the modern federal landscape. The reform promises greater clarity, fewer compliance headaches, and a more innovation-friendly framework. Yet, with selective decoupling and transitional complexities, taxpayers will need to remain vigilant. In short, California may finally be closer to being in sync – but understanding the fine print remains essential.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-10/IRS%20tax%20forms%20capital%20gains%20income%20tax%20forms%20internal%20revenue%20fiance%20investing_0.jpg.webp?itok=VJPpWGol,N,,2025-10-21 16:04:51.820171

(October 21, 2025) – Today, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) announced Scott Lechky has been appointed as the first Executive Director of the New Jersey Green Bank (NJGB). The NJGB, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the NJEDA, aims to use climate-related investments and financial assistance to mobilize private capital to accelerate the adoption of clean energy, advance New Jersey’s climate goals, and reduce the cost of energy for all utility ratepayers in New Jersey.

“Establishing the New Jersey Green Bank has been a pivotal step in Governor Murphy’s continued push to meet the ongoing challenges of climate change,” said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. “As the Executive Director of the New Jersey Green Bank, Scott Lechky will work to inject capital into the state’s clean energy economy and support green businesses and good-paying jobs in the energy sector. Additionally, the investments made by the NJGB will pave the way for a cleaner and healthier environment for our residents and future generations.”

Lechky has over two decades of experience in energy and energy infrastructure investing, investment banking, energy project development, and corporate and project finance. He was the Founder and Managing Partner of Andelis Infrastructure Partners, a broker dealer and investment management firm focused on advising clients and investing in early-stage opportunities in the energy transition sector. Prior to launching Andelis, Lechky was the Chief Financial Officer of OYA Solar, a community solar developer that successfully placed 38 Mega Watts (MW) of solar projects into operations in New York. Lechky previously held investment banking roles focused on power, utilities, and infrastructure with Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Barclays, and energy infrastructure investment management roles at Antarctica Capital and Alberta Investment Management Corp. (AIMCo).

“From more violent storms to increased flooding, the effects of climate change have become all too familiar here in New Jersey,” said Chief Economic Transformation Officer Kathleen Coviello. “We are excited for Scott Lechky to join the New Jersey Green Bank, which is poised to support the Murphy Administration’s mission to combat climate change, transition to 100 percent clean energy, and strengthen our communities and economy for generations to come.”

“As the energy industry faces unprecedented demand growth in the coming years, I am excited to lead the New Jersey Green Bank in collaboration with key industry stakeholders that seek to diversify and decarbonize our energy sources,” said New Jersey Green Bank Executive Director Scott Lechky. “I am looking forward to establishing partnerships with private capital in support of technological innovation and the clean energy entrepreneurs that are delivering a lasting and positive impact on our environment, the economy and New Jersey communities.”

Lechky holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management with majors in Accounting and Analytical Finance and a Bachelor of Commerce Degree in Finance from the University of Alberta. He is also a Chartered Financial Analyst charter holder.

Reporting to the Board of Directors, Lechky will have overall strategic and operational responsibility for the NJGB’s staff, programs, and mission execution. In addition, Lechky will serve as the public face of the NJGB with key partners and stakeholders. Importantly, Lechky will provide strategic leadership and guide the organization through its critical start‐up and early growth phase – recruiting a high-performing team with deep investment and clean energy expertise, overseeing the completion of its first investments, and securing additional capital to scale impact across New Jersey.

Established in April 2024, the NJGB is a component of the 2019 Energy Master Plan and Governor Murphy’s Executive Order 316, which directed the NJEDA to implement programs supporting building electrification through the NJGB. As a subsidiary of the NJEDA focused exclusively on climate investments, the NJGB is well-positioned to attract private capital, including funds from public-private partnerships, as has been the case with other Green Banks in the United States. The NJGB intends to facilitate the development of climate and clean energy capital markets in the state through new forms of financial support, such as warehousing and securitization products, that address underdeveloped or nonexistent capital markets for these investments.

Louisiana already has a liquid natural gas production and export megaproject under construction, with several more in different preconstruction phases.

The state has also seen the groundbreaking of two data center megaprojects in 2025.

The combination of energy and data center projects creates a large-scale investment environment for construction firms.

Louisiana has emerged as a key player in US natural gas production, creating potential opportunities for construction professionals across the industry.

The state’s dominance in liquid natural gas (LNG) exports, paired with the emergence of energy-intensive data center projects, generates a strong potential construction project pipeline.

Liquid Natural Gas Megaprojects

Louisiana leads the nation in LNG exports, accounting for 61% of Total US shipments, according to The Center Square. The state’s prominence stems from investment in LNG infrastructure, like a $10 billion production and export facility currently under construction in Sulphur, and its easy access to shipping lanes on the Gulf.

Three additional LNG facilities worth close to a combined $25 billion are in various stages of preconstruction, according to ConstructConnect Project Intelligence (CCPI).

Natural gas’s role in the state’s energy landscape is notable. According to the US Energy Information Administration, natural gas accounted for 73.5% of Louisiana’s total utility-scale electricity generation in July 2025.

The already impressive scale of production and planned expansion of LNG production facilities provide an attractive location option for energy-intensive operations.

Data Centers Follow Power Grid

The state’s energy production seems to have captured the attention of data center developers seeking reliable, large-scale power sources. Louisiana’s first two data center megaprojects broke ground this year: a $10 billion Meta facility in Jefferson Parish and a $2.5 billion Hut 8 AI data center, according to data from ConstructConnect Project Intelligence (CCPI).

The Meta facility alone is projected to consume around 2,600 MW of power, according to 2024 documents from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator. To support this demand, three proposed natural gas-powered generators will provide 2,250 MW of electricity, according to data from Entergy Louisiana.

Data centers can take advantage of this by sourcing natural gas directly from Louisiana’s growing LNG capacity. This could reduce power sourcing costs and ensure a reliable source of fuel for generators on data center sites.

Construction Implications

The concentration of megaprojects presents both opportunities and drawbacks for construction professionals. Several multi-billion-dollar projects are working their way through preconstruction in Louisiana, indicating potential for a strong construction pipeline extending out several years.

On the other hand, the scale of these projects means that significant construction spending will be concentrated in specific geographic areas. Firms positioned to handle these sorts of large-scale projects potentially stand to benefit the most from this pattern.

They don't make it clear if these are pilot program numbers or if that's what they're achieving at scale.

China is the world's leading EV battery recycling power and it's unlikely the West will catch up anytime soon.

The world needs to get electric vehicle battery recycling right. Those cells are complicated to recycle, and the goal is not to simply dispose of them once they are spent. Ideally, we want to recover as much as possible of the materials that go into their construction, so that they can be reused.

This has so far proved a challenge around the world, but now certain companies from China say they are able to retrieve up to 99.6% of the nickel, manganese, and cobalt that goes into EV batteries. If verified, that’s a remarkable achievement, and it surpasses the level the European Union plans to reach after the end of the decade and at much lower recycling volumes. (Nickel-manganese-cobalt, or NMC, is the most common type of lithium-ion battery among today's long-range EVs.) The report was first highlighted by Car News China.

China is a global leader in both EV battery production and recycling. It recently implemented new stricter EV battery recycling standards and is also pushing for global adoption of these standards. When China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) first proposed these standards in 2019, it specified that 85% of the lithium that goes into these batteries should be recovered, but this was increased to 90% in 2024. Other reports indicate researchers in China are making big breakthroughs in this arena.

China’s biggest EV battery recycler is Guangdong Brunp Recycling Technology, a subsidiary of battery manufacturing giant CATL. The company says it has a fully automated recycling process that can handle 120,000 tons of waste batteries and is working to increase that capacity to 1 million tons. It says it has over 200 recycling locations in operation today and that it handles just over 50% of China’s EV battery recycling needs.

It’s worth noting that it’s not clear if the 99.6% recovery rate has been achieved at scale or just in lab testing. It’s probably the latter, and if the recovery process is energy-intensive, it will therefore create a lot of pollution. Some Chinese recyclers use acid leaching (hydrometallurgy) to recover lithium and other elements at a very high purity level, and while this reduces energy needs, it also requires treatment of the wastewater, which is a step that some companies might be willing to overlook to cut costs.

Targets for rare earths, copper and aluminum have also since been introduced. They need to have a recovery rate of 98%, which is the same as for nickel, cobalt and manganese. Some companies are already exceeding these recovery percentage guidelines and are able to retrieve over 99% of these key materials.

The figure is specifically 99.6% for nickel, manganese and cobalt and slightly lower, at 98%, for lithium. The standards don’t just apply to electric passenger vehicle batteries, but also to batteries used in energy storage, marine applications and other uses.

These recycled materials will naturally be reused in new battery packs, automatically lowering the demand for virgin materials. One of the most controversial areas surrounding electric vehicles today is the environmental impact of digging up lithium, rare earths and other elements out of the ground. The labor behind mining for these elements is not always ethical, and it affects natural habitats, so recovering these materials instead of getting new ones will become increasingly important in the future as more vehicles become electric.

The European Union wants to pass a law where any battery with a capacity higher than 2 kilowatt-hours will have to contain certain percentages of recovered materials by 2031—16% for cobalt and 6% for lithium and nickel. The aim is to reduce waste, promote a circular economy and reduce environmental impact. By 2031, the EU also wants to increase recovery rates for cobalt, copper, lead and nickel to 95% and 80% for lithium. All numbers that are lower than what China says it’s capable of retrieving today.

China will likely remain the leader in both production and recycling of EV batteries, and as it amasses more of these elements, most of which are not mined locally, its need for freshly mined virgin materials will go down. This will allow China to essentially close the loop and become virtually independent and self-sufficient, relying solely on high-yield recycling of millions of existing EV batteries rather than bringing in raw materials from places like Africa or South America.

In the U.S., Redwood Materials is one of the biggest battery recyclers. It says it too has technology to allow it to recover up to 95% of the nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper from an end-of-life EV battery pack, but it has yet to do it at scale. The company wants to use these recovered materials to create new battery packs and is targeting a production capacity of 500 GWh by the end of the decade.

Reuters noted back in 2023 that the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act included “a clause that automatically qualifies EV battery materials recycled in the U.S. as American-made for subsidies, regardless of their origin.” The goal was to incentivize EV battery recycling in the U.S., in an attempt to break China’s almost total global monopoly in the field.

With the Trump administration now stripping back incentives for EVs, batteries and their supporting industries, it doesn’t look like China’s battery recycling leadership will be challenged anytime soon. As time progresses and more vehicles on the road become electric, and as the ones that are on the road today begin to age, the need for battery recycling will increase considerably.

As energy costs rise for some Virginians, homeowners are looking for real ways to lower their monthly bills without being uncomfortable. One of the most obvious ways to accomplish this is to upgrade to a more energy-efficient heating system.

While such a large purchase may seem out of reach, it’s not only a good long-term investment but also more affordable than you may think. As a result of the federal Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, homeowners can take advantage of expanded tax credits that make installing energy-efficient heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and biomass stoves more affordable. Helpfully, the incentives can help offset the cost of the new equipment, as well as the installation and labor costs.

However, these savings won’t last forever. In fact, they’re now set to expire at the end of 2025, meaning that homeowners have a limited window to make upgrades and claim their benefits. Here’s your guide to navigating the available credits and choosing the right system to be efficient and affordably heat your home as winter looms on the horizon.

Incentives

The act expanded the Section 25C tax credit, which is now known as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. The tax credits under 25C are set to expire at the end of 2025. Originally, the credits were authorized through 2032, but now have a sunset date of Dec. 31, 2025, due to modifications from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act from earlier this year.

All eligible energy-efficient home improvements—such as the installation of heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and biomass stoves—are eligible for a 30% tax credit. The credit maxes out at $2,000 per year.

Importantly, the credit extends to equipment, installation, and even labor costs. Before installation, you might consider having a home energy audit conducted, which is eligible for a $150 credit. ENERGY STAR recommends having an audit conducted to better understand which improvements would be most beneficial. Just make sure that it’s conducted by a qualified home energy auditor who has completed a qualified certification program.

Additionally, credits for other heating-related improvements, such as new insulation, windows, doors, and electrical panels, are available. ENERGY STAR notes that the optimization of insulation ahead of heating system upgrades can help reduce air leaks and reduce energy waste. The maximum annual credit for those items is $1,200.

Heating systems

Heating systems that are eligible for the credit include heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, and biomass stoves and boilers.

Heat pumps

Any heat pump that has received the ENERGY STAR Most Efficient designation is eligible for the credit.

Two options are available for claiming the credit: the cold climate pathway, for systems designed to work well in colder climates, and the cooling or dual-fuel pathway, for systems designed to work well in warmer climates or with another heating source like a furnace. Importantly, either pathway is eligible for the credit regardless of location, which previously wasn’t the case due to regional requirements.

The Carrier Infinity Variable-Speed Ultimate Cold Climate Heat Pump with Greenspeed Intelligence is one of the eligible models. Carrier describes it as one of its “most advanced heat pumps.”

Trane also offers the 18 TruComfort Variable Speed Heat Pump (5TWV8) that’s eligible for the credit. Its speed technology is designed to adjust output for consistent comfort and energy savings, the company said.

Heat pump water heaters

Heat pump water heaters are eligible for the $2,000 credit if they have earned the ENERGY STAR designation. They use electricity to direct heat from place to place as opposed to having to generate heat directly, which increases efficiency by two to three times that of conventional electric resistance water heaters.

The GE Profile GEOSPRING Smart Hybrid Heat Pump Water Heater 50-gallon-240V is one of the eligible models. The manufacturer says it’s up to 4.7 times more energy efficient. Additional models can be found here.

Biomass stoves and boilers

Biomass stoves and boilers are also eligible for the $2,000 credit. The stoves burn biomass fuel, such as agricultural crops and trees, wood, and wood waste like wood pellets, plants, residues, and fibers, to heat a home. To qualify for the credit, they must achieve a 75% thermal efficiency rating.

Regency Fireplace Products offers several wood stoves, wood inserts, and pellet stoves that are eligible for the credit.

Claiming the credits

The IRS is in the process of requiring manufacturers of heating systems to establish PIN numbers for eligible products. The numbers will eventually be associated with the tax credit claims. As a result, manufacturers will be designated as “qualified manufacturers.”

However, the process isn’t complete, which means those claiming the credits in 2025 will only have to provide the manufacturer’s four-digit qualified manufacturer code on their tax returns.

Importantly, the credit can only be claimed on your primary residence. Although the IRS recommends that systems be installed by a professional, those who are handy enough to install them on their own can still claim the credit.

The IRS notes that there isn’t a lifetime dollar limit on the credits, which means if you’ve received credits for past upgrades, you can still claim them for new upgrades made in 2025. Keep in mind that the credit is nonrefundable, meaning you can’t use the credit to get back more money than you owe in taxes and can’t apply any unused credit to tax liabilities in future years.

Making things better EU state aid could also be available for storage equipment manufacturing — separately from state aid for installations.","The outlook for energy storage in North America is, despite interventions from President Trump, looking positive, the European Association for Storage of Energy heard at its annual conference in Brussels.

The president's US tariffs and border controls have affected the US solar industry and energy storage, with firms typically limited in what they can import.

Emily Burlinghaus, director of energy storage manufacturing and supply chain in the Solar Energy Industries Association in the US, said that members faced policy uncertainty and that many had switched from Chinese suppliers of parts to, typically, those in Korea and Japan.

Although she expected smaller manufacturers and developers to be most affected by the US tariff war, she was generally surprised by how the industry had adapted, although clarification was still awaited on some measures, including possible taxation related to storage.

Burlinghaus also said that European suppliers of battery manufacturing machinery faced difficulties in getting their employees into the US to train customers on the complicated equipment needed to make batteries.

However, she pointed to the addition of a record-breaking 12GW of US energy storage capacity last year for solar power investments, and record increases in the first two quarters of 2025. Also, in California, for example, a change in net power rules has prompted investment in storage.

The US growth is in part thanks to the building of data centres, the developers of which are keen on the speed of installation of large solar and storage plants, compared with long waits for gas turbines for power plants. ""No other energy technology compares,"" said Burlinghaus.

Canada, which is heavily affected by US policy, will need 40GW of energy storage of all technologies and all durations, forecast the Energy Storage Canada trade organisation. ""Right now, we have just under 3GW. So, you can imagine the growth that's about to happen. So, we expect the future to be bright,"" said Justin Rangooni, president and chief executive of Energy Storage Canada. The future will, however, depend on trade talks between the US and Canada, said Rangooni ""We are always watching the geopolitics.""

Storage projects around the world are using a variety of funding methods. Post said that they included tolling agreements that pay a fixed income for battery output — as in Italy and in Germany — and power purchase agreements (PPAs) that pay set prices for agreed energy volumes — including a first hybrid PPA for solar cells and battery storage.

Market reforms

Possible good news for storage developers and operators is potential reforms to electricity markets, based on various assessments ,including national flexibility assessment reports expected in July 2026.

The latter will address factors such as the need for renewables and the short-term availability of energy.

All benefits associated with electricity flows, including from day-ahead power trading, intra-day trading and balancing of the grid to match electricity supply and demand need to be assessed, said Georg Thomassen, scientific officer in the EU's Joint Research Centre.

""There are a lot of challenges,"" he noted. ""The system is too complex to handle with back-of-the-envelope calculations."" How much investment can be backed up by the wholesale electricity market, for example?

And more state aid could be available for energy storage around the EU, particularly under the Clean Industry Deal State Aid Framework. There is no specific support for energy storage in that, but the technology can support aims such as security of electricity supply, flexibility and more renewables, said Julia Majewska, case handler in the European Commission's competition directorate.

""The European Commission recognises the importance of energy storage in securing affordable and secure supply of clean energy in the EU,"" said Majewska. Hence the need for regulatory and planning certainty. However, she said that the hope was that firms could get the revenue from the market, rather than from state aid.

Lukasz Kolinski, director for green transition and energy system integration in the Commission's energy directorate, said that the Commission has asked EU countries to facilitate flexibility and that signals and benefits needed to be clear: ""Network charges could be specific for storage and flexibility.""

Long considered

One concern for some in the sector is the future for long-duration energy storage (LDES), which could take various forms including chemical, thermal, mechanical and electrochemical. Units could supply energy or heat for long periods, from perhaps eight hours up to months.

LDES could avoid 35-88% of the curtailment of renewable energy possible by 2030 because of poor operation of the market, said Paula Rey Garcia, head of unit in the European Commission's energy directorate; ""We need to have a clear basis for long-duration energy storage.""

Mike Vasconcelos Tocchetti, head of European business development at the Italian company Energy Dome, which uses carbon dioxide as the basis for LDES, said that permitting for projects favoured lithium-based batteries over other storage technologies.

He also said that today's markets valued short-term flexibility over duration but suggested that PPAs could help bridge the gap by pricing the firmness of energy delivered.

Marcel Eijgelaar, principal researcher in the certification organisation DNV, said that more volatility in grids favoured more short-duration storage and efficient battery storage, which meant more competition for LDES.

He expected two-hour and four-hour batteries to dominate the storage market, perhaps reaching 20% of peak demand in north-west Europe and up to 80% in solar-dominated south Europe by 2035. And the storage would act partly as LDES, with batteries responding to competition by not fully discharging to avoid negative prices for electricity.

Eijgelaar suggested that to gain a 5% market share (in MW) in 24-hour storage, the cost/MWh would have to be a fifth of the cost of lithium/sodium-ion batteries: ""It is a very competitive environment.""

Making things better

EU state aid could also be available for storage equipment manufacturing — separately from state aid for installations.

Luca Taranto, case handler in the Commission's competition directorate, pointed to three relevant sets of rules: the Climate, Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines of 2022; the General Block Exemption Regulation; and the recently-adopted Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (Cisaf).

All three are part of the EU's clean industrial deal. Cisaf allows a fast-track procedure for clean energy roll-out, decarbonisation and clean-tech manufacturing and covers storage technologies among others. ""We only care about companies starting new investments,"" said Taranto.",https://www.enlit.world/favicon/light/favicon-96x96.png,N,,2025-10-21 15:05:36.295578

Electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems (BESS), and clean energy technologies depend heavily on lithium. Yet even with fast-rising demand, the United States still produces far less lithium than it needs.

In 2024, U.S. production reached only about 25,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) – roughly 2% of global supply, which totaled around 1.2 million tonnes. That output is enough for only about 158,000 Tesla Model 3 battery packs per year.

The gap between national demand and domestic production keeps widening. Most lithium used in the U.S. comes from imports, mainly from Chile, Australia, and China. This dependency exposes the country to supply disruptions, trade restrictions, and price volatility. If imports are interrupted, the U.S. battery and EV industries could face serious setbacks.

Growing Demand Creates a Structural Deficit

Global demand for lithium is growing quickly. Analysts expect it to quadruple by 2030 as more countries adopt EVs and build large-scale battery storage.

According to Katusa Research (2025), global lithium demand is projected to climb from 1.04 million tonnes in 2024 to 3.56 million tonnes by 2035 — a 3.5× increase. About 83% of that demand will come from EV batteries, while energy storage will account for another 11%.

Per the International Energy Agency, the U.S. alone may need over 625,000 tonnes of LCE per year by 2030, compared with only a small fraction produced domestically today.

Building new mines takes time – often 10 to 15 years from exploration to commercial production. This long timeline makes it difficult to ramp up supply fast enough to meet demand. Therefore, a lasting shortage is forming. If the U.S. does not accelerate new projects soon, it may depend on imports for decades.

Each EV battery pack uses large amounts of lithium. On average, an EV requires about 60 kilograms of LCE – or 8 to 10 kilograms per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of battery capacity. As automakers build more gigafactories, that adds up quickly.

Katusa’s data also shows that global EV sales jumped from 2 million in 2020 to 11 million in 2024, a 450% surge — and could exceed 60 million units per year by 2040, more than half of all cars sold globally.

The U.S. is expected to have 440 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery manufacturing capacity by 2025 and more than 1,000 GWh by 2030. That growth alone could double or triple national lithium demand.

Introducing the Nevada North Lithium Project

One company aiming to help close this gap is Surge Battery Metals. Its flagship asset, the Nevada North Lithium Project (NNLP) in Elko County, Nevada, is one of the few high-grade lithium clay deposits in the United States.

The project has an inferred resource of 11.24 million tonnes of LCE, grading about 3,010 ppm lithium, making it the highest-grade lithium clay resource in the country.

Surge’s Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) shows strong project fundamentals:

Post-tax NPV (8%) of US$9.21 billion

IRR of 22.8%

Operating cost ≈ US$5,243/t LCE

Mine life of 42 years

The project benefits from ideal logistics. NNLP is only 13 kilometers from major power lines and close to all-season roads. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has issued a Record of Decision and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), allowing expanded exploration over 250 acres. These factors make NNLP a leading U.S. candidate for large-scale lithium development.

How NNLP Helps Close the Supply Gap

Surge Battery Metals’ Nevada North project has features that position it well to help close America’s lithium gap. Its high grade and large resource size suggest it could deliver significant output once in production. Higher-grade deposits typically allow lower extraction costs and shorter payback periods.

Because NNLP already has key permits and environmental clearance, it may reach production faster than many early-stage peers. That speed is critical as EV demand accelerates and the U.S. targets more domestic battery manufacturing.

Just as important, NNLP supports U.S. policy goals for supply chain security. Producing lithium domestically reduces reliance on imports, helping stabilize supply and pricing for American automakers. It also supports the Inflation Reduction Act, which requires that most EV battery minerals come from North America or allied countries by 2027.

In March 2025, the U.S. government took direct equity stakes in several lithium ventures, including Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass, signaling a strong federal commitment to reshoring critical mineral production. This policy backdrop reinforces projects like NNLP as part of a national security priority.

Strengthening NNLP Through Strategic Partnership

Moreover, Surge Battery Metals signed a joint venture letter of intent (LOI) with Evolution Mining (ASX: EVN), allowing Evolution to earn up to 32.5% ownership by funding C$10 million toward the Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) for the Nevada North Lithium Project (NNLP). Surge retains majority control and project management, keeping its long-term vision and stakeholder priorities front and center.

This partnership delivers big strategic value. By merging Surge’s lithium expertise and mineral rights with Evolution’s 75% stake in 880 acres of private land – and over 21,000 added acres nearby – the deal significantly increases the JV’s land position. The expanded acreage boosts the overall exploration area and brings in mineral rights in key southern zones, possible clay unit extensions to the north, and territory in historic mining districts and key drainage areas.

Importantly, Evolution’s staged funding speeds up completion of the PFS and helps NNLP reach development milestones while lowering capital risk for Surge shareholders. If Evolution completes its full commitment, it will own 32.5% of the JV, but Surge remains the lead partner. This setup means Surge still directs the project, while using Evolution’s operations know-how and resources. With a larger land package and a joint operating committee, NNLP is well on its way to Tier 1 status and is strengthening its spot in North America’s battery metals supply chain – vital for clean energy and EV growth.

Lithium Market Volatility and Project Risks

Like any mining venture, NNLP faces challenges. Lithium prices fell nearly 90% from their 2022 peak, but from June to September 2025, they rebounded 24%, showing early signs of recovery.

This cyclical pattern reflects Katusa’s “cost floor” concept — production costs in China and Australia now average around $5,000–6,000 per tonne LCE, while South American and U.S. projects need about $8,000/t to stay profitable. If prices fall near those levels, high-cost mines pause output, tightening supply again and stabilizing prices.

Another factor is resource expansion. NNLP’s current resource is inferred, but the company expects to complete its current drilling program at NNLP by the end of October 2025. Once the results are released, the lithium resource will be upgraded from Inferred to Indicated and Measured categories. This step will strengthen confidence in the deposit’s scale and quality, supporting the upcoming Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS).

Permitting and community engagement also remain important; even in a mining-friendly state like Nevada, water use and land reclamation practices must meet strict environmental standards.

Surge Battery Metals has emphasized sustainable practices, including water recycling and progressive site reclamation, as part of its exploration and development plan.

Competition is growing, too. Lithium projects across South America, Australia, and Canada are advancing quickly. Still, Nevada’s combination of stable governance, established mining laws, and proximity to major battery plants gives U.S. projects like NNLP a strong advantage.

A National View: U.S. Lithium Resources and Reserves

The U.S. is home to some of the world’s largest lithium reserves, but it still underdevelops them. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, global lithium reserves total around 21 million tonnes, with the U.S. holding roughly 12%. Nevada alone hosts the country’s biggest lithium resources, concentrated in the Thacker Pass region and the northern claystone belts – where NNLP is located.

Unlocking these resources is vital. Every new project that moves forward strengthens the domestic supply chain and supports national goals to lead in clean energy technology.

What to Watch in 2025 and Beyond

Surge Battery Metals plans to continue advancing NNLP through new drilling campaigns and metallurgical studies in 2025. These programs aim to expand and upgrade resources, optimize extraction processes, and confirm the potential to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate with 99.9% purity. The company is also evaluating potential offtake partnerships with battery and automotive manufacturers.

Analysts and investors will be watching for:

Updated resource estimates and grade expansion

Progress toward pre-feasibility studies

Partnerships or funding deals with strategic investors

Regulatory updates supporting U.S. critical mineral development

Positive results in these areas could accelerate NNLP’s move toward construction and help it become one of the first next-generation lithium clay projects to enter U.S. production.

Powering the U.S. Energy Future

The U.S. faces a widening gap between lithium supply and demand that could slow its clean-energy transition. Katusa Research projects a 400,000-tonne global supply shortfall by 2035, roughly the world’s entire 2020 output – a deficit that could keep prices elevated long term.

Surge Battery Metals’ Nevada North Lithium Project provides a realistic and timely opportunity to help close that divide. With its high-grade resource, strong economics, strategic location, and environmental focus, NNLP could play a central role in building a stable, self-sufficient lithium supply for the United States.

As the nation races to electrify transportation and decarbonize energy, projects like NNLP will be critical. They are not only about producing lithium – they are about powering the next chapter of American industry and ensuring that the clean-energy future is built on secure, sustainable ground.

The project marks LRE’s first operating asset in the state and underscores the company’s commitment to advancing energy solutions across the U.S.

Ridgely Solar supplies power to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) under a long-term agreement, supporting TVA’s mission to deliver reliable, clean energy to help meet the region’s growing demand. The project generates substantial economic investment, including approximately $3 million in property tax revenues over its lifetime. Ridgely Solar created approximately 700 jobs during construction, and the revenue generated for the county will go toward supporting schools and public services, altogether strengthening the community.

Beyond delivering reliable and cost-effective energy, Ridgely Solar has become a partner in the Lake County community, supporting initiatives that strengthen education, safety, and family well-being. The project has funded scholarships through the Tennessee College of Applied Technology (TCAT) Northwest, helped build an inclusive playground for children with disabilities, and supported the American Red Cross Mid-South’s local flood relief efforts. Ridgely Solar has also contributed to public safety infrastructure for first responders and provided resources for The Nest, a daycare at Margaret Newton Elementary that offers free childcare to local families.

Ridgely Solar represents a remarkable engineering achievement, driven by innovative solutions that ensure safe construction and long-term performance. LRE’s engineering team collaborated with Nextracker and First Solar, continuing its long-standing partnerships with both U.S.-based leaders. Together, their technologies reduce the need for earthwork and steel, preserve habitats, accelerate deployment, and strengthen domestic supply chains. Nextracker’s NX Horizon-XTR™ terrain-following solar tracker systems, along with First Solar’s advanced thin-film photovoltaic modules, deliver industry-leading performance and reliability. These partnerships underscore LRE’s commitment to resilient energy infrastructure built on U.S.-made innovation.

“Ridgely Solar is a significant milestone as LRE’s first project in Tennessee,” said Eran Mahrer, Chief Commercial Officer at LRE. “The project delivers reliable energy, drives investment in Lake County, and demonstrates our role as a community partner by supporting local priorities. Further, by building on our long-standing relationships with U.S. technology leaders, prioritizing domestic jobs and manufacturing, and integrating innovative solutions that reduce impacts and speed deployment, Ridgely shows how forward-looking projects can strengthen the communities where we operate and contribute to our nation’s long-term energy security.”

The local expansion will also involve leasing a 432,000-square-foot facility in Marshall Township, where future production lines will augment the existing operations in Turtle Creek.
In a statement, Shapiro said the move shows that “my administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter.
That kind of messaging will likely be in evidence at when Shapiro formally announces the deal at Eos’ Turtle Creek facility Tuesday afternoon.","Eos Energy Enterprises, a maker of energy storage systems with production facilities in Turtle Creek, will expand operations and relocate its headquarters from New Jersey to Nova Place on Pittsburgh’s North Side, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Tuesday.

The move, which is set to take place in the latter part of 2026, is expected to create 735 jobs and retain 265 others. A state subsidy of $22 million will spur nearly $353 million in overall investment, Shapiro’s office says. The local expansion will also involve leasing a 432,000-square-foot facility in Marshall Township, where future production lines will augment the existing operations in Turtle Creek.

In a statement, Shapiro said the move shows that “my administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter. …Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Eos makes zinc-based batteries for industrial and other large-scale uses, and at a time when American energy policy is hotly contested, its Turtle Creek operations have been a success story everyone wants to be part of. Eos was among a number of area manufacturers to benefit from President Joe Biden's clean-energy investments, and politicians ranging from progressive Democratic Rep. Summer Lee to Republican U.S. Senator Dave McCormick have championed its presence. It boasts a unionized work force — employees are members of the United Steelworkers — and relies almost entirely on American-made components and materials.

Zinc-based batteries also are less reliant on “rare-earth” materials, access to which has become a flashpoint in tensions between the United States and China.

Shapiro’s office said the move would allow the company to work with Carnegie Mellon University and other local schools to train workers proficient in robotics and other advancing technologies. And Joe Mastrangelo, Eos’ chief executive officer, said the news “is built upon a strong industrial history, combined with a world- class university ecosystem.”

“With this expansion, Eos is strengthening two of the key industries at the center of our Economic Development Strategy — energy and manufacturing,” said Rick Siger, who heads the state Department of Community and Economic Development, in a statement.

The state investment includes $3 million already pledged to EOS, and the company may be eligible for other tax credits in the future. Allegheny County also contributed $2 million to the incentive packages.

“We are not only creating hundreds of jobs in Allegheny County but also laying the groundwork for a sustainable future in clean tech-led manufacturing and clean energy,” said county executive Sara Innamorato in a statement.

The relocation of the corporate headquarters is set to take place at about the time Shapiro is up for reelection. And the announcement dovetails with the record he has sought to build in his first term. Shapiro has often touted own competitive instincts — he has spoken of not wanting to lose investment to “friggin Ohio” in budget speeches — and his desire to make government operate “at the speed of business.” Shapiro similarly celebrated the relocation of tech firm Excelitas from Massachusetts to Pittsburgh early last year.

That kind of messaging will likely be in evidence at when Shapiro formally announces the deal at Eos’ Turtle Creek facility Tuesday afternoon.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8c0b9a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3679x1931+0+373/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4b%2Fe1%2Fd2be46a64ab783ed037d77db4037%2Fnorth-side-hills-skyline-clemente-warhol-carson-bridges-october-2023.JPG,N,,2025-10-21 15:05:17.671078

Today’s announcement is the latest economic development project under the Shapiro Administration to boost the energy and manufacturing industries in Pennsylvania ― the only Northeast state with a growing economy according to a new report.

Governor Josh Shapiro and his Administration have competed for and won nearly $26 billion in private sector investments since taking office, creating more than 13,200 new jobs, and driving economic growth across Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh, PA – Today, Governor Josh Shapiro announced that Eos Energy Enterprises (Eos) — the country’s leading innovator in the design, sourcing, and manufacturing of American-made zinc-based battery energy storage systems – is investing $352.9 million to relocate its headquarters to Pennsylvania from New Jersey, expand its existing manufacturing operation in Allegheny County, and create and retain 1,000 total jobs. The Commonwealth is investing $22 million into the project, which is creating at least 735 new jobs and retaining 265 current positions. Governor Shapiro will join Eos leadership and local officials today at the company’s manufacturing plant in Allegheny County to celebrate the announcement.

Eos currently leases two facilities in Turtle Creek, where an initial phase of the project began in 2024 with the installation of a new state-of-the-art automated production line. As part of this expansion, the company will lease an existing 432,000-square-foot facility in Marshall Township in northern Allegheny County where additional production lines are planned for deployment.

Eos will also relocate its corporate headquarters from New Jersey to a 40,000-square-foot office space at Nova Place, located in Pittsburgh’s North Shore neighborhood in the latter half of 2026.This relocation will support Eos’s proprietary battery management system, software, controls, and analytics platform, DawnOS™, as well as its corporate operations. In alignment with its expanding software and engineering focus, Eos will strengthen its partnership with local universities, notably Carnegie Mellon University, to cultivate a highly skilled workforce proficient in robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and engineering.

“The demand for energy is going up — and my Administration is capitalizing on Pennsylvania’s strengths as a national energy leader and net energy exporter to attract leading energy manufacturers like Eos Energy to the Commonwealth,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re doubling down on our efforts to aggressively compete for — and win — major projects like this one by cutting red tape, building out our skilled workforce, and investing in the next generation of energy technology. I’m proud that Pennsylvania will be home to Eos’ new global headquarters — and my Administration will continue to work to cut energy costs, create good-paying jobs, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come.”

Eos received a funding proposal from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) for a $10 million Pennsylvania First grant and $12 million through the Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) which includes $3 million previously awarded to Eos in 2022. In addition, the company could be eligible for tax credits/tax deductions through the Qualified Manufacturing Innovation and Reinvestment Deduction program, the Manufacturing Tax Credit program, and the Research and Development Tax Credit program.

“With this expansion, Eos is strengthening two of the key industries at the center of our Economic Development Strategy — energy and manufacturing,” said DCED Secretary Rick Siger. “We are committed to positioning Pennsylvania as both an energy leader and an economic powerhouse and bold investments like this one will help us get there. This project will create and sustain 1,000 jobs while expanding opportunity for people across Western Pennsylvania.”

Allegheny County also invested $2 million to support this relocation and expansion by Eos.

“Eos Energy’s expansion in Allegheny County is a testament to our region’s collaborative spirit and commitment to shared prosperity,” said County Executive Sara Innamorato. “This significant expansion ― made possible with critical support from the US Department of Energy, Governor Josh Shapiro, and a commitment of $2 million from Allegheny County — highlights the power of partnership in driving economic growth. Together, we are not only creating hundreds of jobs in Allegheny County but also laying the groundwork for a sustainable future in clean tech-led manufacturing and clean energy.”

“Eos Energy’s decision to expand its manufacturing operations in Allegheny County is a powerful testament to the value proposition this region offers at the nexus of energy, manufacturing, and innovation,” said Stefani Pashman, CEO of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. “Eos’ move will not only strengthen our region’s position as a hub for advanced energy storage, but it will also attract new suppliers, partners, and innovators to the Pittsburgh region. We’re especially proud that this growth comes with a continued commitment to the company’s partnerships with local universities and the United Steelworkers — ensuring that good, family-sustaining jobs remain at the center of this story. This expansion underscores what’s possible when business, labor, and community work together to build a more resilient and competitive regional economy.”

Founded in 2008, Eos develops and manufactures American-made aqueous zinc batteries (Znyth™), currently targeting the utility, industrial and commercial sector for power storage. Designed for a decentralized, democratized, and decarbonized energy system, Eos solutions are helping to support sustainable clean energy systems and resilient power grids, while supporting American supply chains through their 91 percent domestic content.

“In today’s competitive environment, and in what we’re working to achieve in powering the nation’s future, you need not only natural resources and technology innovations, but also a strong public-private partnership,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Chief Executive Officer of Eos Energy. “What we are announcing today is built upon a strong industrial history, combined with a world class university ecosystem. Pennsylvania is positioning itself at the forefront of America’s energy transition — enabling us to bring America’s battery to scale.”

This project was coordinated by Governor Shapiro’s BusinessPA team, an experienced group of economic development professionals dedicated to helping businesses succeed in Pennsylvania through tailored guidance, strategic partnerships, and financial resources. Whether based in the Commonwealth, another state, or across the globe, the team moves at the speed of business to set up companies for long-term growth and success here in Pennsylvania.

Companies are choosing Pennsylvania as their home for growth: Mint-X, which relocated its manufacturing operation from Queens, New York, to Hazleton, Luzerne County; Excelitas Technologies, which moved its headquarters from Massachusetts to Pittsburgh; and Adare Pharma, which relocated to Northeast Philadelphia, and Schless Bottles, which relocated to Allentown, both from New Jersey.

Under Governor Josh Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is the only state in the Northeast with a growing economy, according to a new report from Axios on analysis done by Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi. This latest recognition builds on growing evidence that Pennsylvania’s economy is strong, competitive, and on the rise. Recently, Area Development ranked Pennsylvania among the top 20 “Best States for Business” — the only Northeastern state to make the list — and placed the Commonwealth in the top 10 for “Site Readiness Programs.”

Since taking office, Governor Shapiro has made Pennsylvania more competitive by:

Launching the Commonwealth’s first Economic Development Strategy in nearly two decades

Cutting red tape and streamlining permitting and licensing

Making strategic investments that have attracted nearly $26 billion in private-sector investment, created more than 13,200 good-paying jobs, and expanded opportunity across the Commonwealth

That includes the largest private-sector investment in Pennsylvania history — Amazon’s initial $20 billion investment to build new AI and cloud computing campuses, creating thousands of high-tech and construction jobs.

From day one, Governor Shapiro has worked to spur economic development through historic investments in site development, main streets, small businesses, and workforce development, while speeding up the Commonwealth’s permitting, licensing, and certification processes.

The Shapiro Administration is delivering real results — and building on that momentum. Governor Shapiro’s 2025-26 budget proposal calls for new and expanded investments to advance the Economic Development Strategy and boost Pennsylvania’s competitiveness, including:

$12.5 million dedicated to WEDnetPA to expand our workforce and close critical workforce gaps

$2 million for the creation of Career Connect to build internships at Pennsylvania companies

$10 million for AdvancePA tax credits to create high quality jobs across PA

$3 million to the Marketing to Attract Business program, which supports programs targeting business attraction, retention, and marketing initiatives

Expediting the Corporate Net Income Tax (CNIT) cuts by two years, reducing the current tax rate each year by 0.75 percent

Although wages will vary depending on the position, the average salary for the new positions will be $108,436. The average private-sector wage in Mecklenburg County stands at $86,830. The new jobs will generate an annual payroll impact in the community of more than $24 million per year.

The project will be facilitated, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) officially awarded to SoFi Bank National Association (N.A.) and approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee earlier today. Over the course of the 12-year term of this grant, the project is estimated to grow the state’s economy by $928 million. Using a formula that takes into account the new tax revenues generated by the new jobs and the capital investment, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $1,862,250, spread over 12 years. State payments occur only following performance verification by the departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets.

The project’s projected return on investment of public dollars is 189 percent, meaning for every dollar of potential cost, the state receives $2.89 in state revenue. JDIG projects result in positive net tax revenue to the state treasury, even after taking into consideration the grant’s reimbursement payments to a given company.

“Charlotte and Mecklenburg County come out on top once again, thanks to our investments over the years in education and our specialization with this critical industry,” said N.C. Senator Woodson Bradley. “SoFi Technologies has been a part of our community since 2023, and their distinguished record of accomplishments will only grow with the exciting expansion of their business in North Carolina.”

“I appreciate the hard work put in by all the local, regional, and state economic development teams that helped SoFi Technologies reach this outstanding decision,” said N.C. Representative Laura Budd. “We welcome this new investment and these new jobs that will expand opportunities in our region.”

Under the Biden administration, Cassidy sounded the alarm over Democrats' radical ESG agenda. Last Congress, Cassidy introduced the Restoring Integrity in Fiduciary Duty Act, preventing asset managers from prioritizing ESG factors over the financial success of Americans’ retirement savings. Additionally, Cassidy joined a bipartisan coalition to pass a Congressional Review Act resolution in an effort to overturn Biden’s ESG rule. Biden later vetoed the bipartisan resolution.

Secretary Chavez-DeRemer,

As Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I write in support of the Department of Labor’s decision to replace its final rule titled “Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights.”

When Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), it entrusted fiduciaries with the responsibility to assist workers in saving for retirement. In doing so, it is crucial that fiduciaries act only with a worker’s best interest in mind. This important fiduciary duty of loyalty enables millions of hardworking Americans to confidently prepare for retirement, knowing that their savings are invested for their benefit only.

Unfortunately, some fiduciaries have failed to uphold this duty and misused workers’ savings in order to invest in activist causes. Under the guise of environment, social, and governance (ESG) considerations, fiduciaries choose investments or exercise shareholder rights based on subjective, unprovable factors to further an ideological agenda.

President Trump’s proposed rule signals a return to sensibility. When managing a worker’s investment options or exercising his or her shareholder rights, a fiduciary should only consider the material, pecuniary factors that directly increase workers’ savings. The Biden administration’s ESG rule broke sharply from this practice, enabling fiduciaries to run wild with workers’ savings and putting the retirement security of millions of Americans at risk. Last Congress, I joined with my colleagues to overturn this rule through a Congressional Review Act resolution, which President Biden vetoed despite the resolution’s support from a bipartisan majority in both chambers. By replacing this harmful policy, the Department of Labor will once again ensure that fiduciaries uphold their responsibilities to workers.

To that end, I also introduced the Restoring Integrity in Fiduciary Duty Act last Congress, which would reinforce the important fiduciary duties codified by Congress in ERISA. Alongside the Department of Labor’s final rule, this legislation would clearly outline that fiduciaries must only consider economic factors related to an investment’s performance when managing a worker’s savings.

I look forward to continuing to work with President Trump and the Department of Labor in implementing pro-worker policies. When preparing for retirement, workers should not have to worry about the safety of their hard-earned savings because their fiduciary chose politics over prudence.

Sincerely,

The decision, announced on Tuesday, comes after four years of challenges including production halts, inventory gluts, and sluggish sales that failed to meet expectations. BrightDrop, launched in 2021 as GM’s entry into the burgeoning market for electric delivery vans, aimed to capitalize on the e-commerce boom by offering zero-emission alternatives to traditional fleet vehicles.

The vans, produced at GM’s CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, were designed for last-mile delivery with models like the Zevo 400 and Zevo 600 boasting ranges up to 250 miles and customizable cargo spaces. However, demand never materialized at the scale GM anticipated, leading to repeated production pauses and now a complete shutdown.

The Roots of BrightDrop’s Struggles

According to reports from TechCrunch, the program endured a “chaotic” trajectory plagued by supply chain disruptions and market miscalculations. Early on, BrightDrop secured high-profile deals with companies like FedEx and Verizon, but broader adoption stalled amid economic headwinds and competition from rivals such as Ford’s E-Transit and Rivian’s commercial vans.

GM’s executives had positioned BrightDrop as a key pillar of its $35 billion investment in electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025. Yet, as detailed in an April article from USA Today, the company faced mounting unsold inventory on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border, prompting mass layoffs of about 500 workers at the Canadian facility earlier this year.

Impact on Manufacturing and Workforce

The latest move will idle the CAMI plant indefinitely, with GM stating it is “assessing future opportunities” for the site, which employs around 1,300 unionized workers. This echoes earlier production halts; for instance, electrive.com reported a six-month pause from May to October 2025 due to low demand, highlighting persistent issues with battery supply and market readiness.

Industry analysts point to broader factors exacerbating BrightDrop’s demise, including the expiration of federal EV tax credits in the U.S. and shifting corporate priorities away from aggressive electrification timelines. As noted in Automotive News, GM will record a charge against its fourth-quarter earnings tied to this discontinuation and ongoing reevaluations of its EV capacity.

Strategic Implications for GM’s EV Ambitions

This pullback raises questions about GM’s overall electrification strategy, especially as CEO Mary Barra has championed a transition to all-electric lineups by 2035. Insiders suggest the BrightDrop experience underscores the risks of overcommitting to unproven segments without robust demand forecasting. Competitors like Rivian, backed by Amazon, have fared better by tailoring vehicles to specific client needs, while Ford has ramped up E-Transit production amid steady fleet orders.

Moreover, the decision arrives amid a softening global EV market, with automakers scaling back investments. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) from users like industry commentators reflect sentiment that forced EV adoption overlooks consumer and business hesitations, though these are anecdotal and not definitive indicators.

Looking Ahead: Lessons and Potential Pivots

For GM, the end of BrightDrop could free resources for more promising ventures, such as its Ultium battery platform or passenger EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox EV. However, it also signals caution to the industry: commercial electrification requires not just innovation but alignment with economic realities and infrastructure development.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-5119e100-7699-4ed1-8dd2-50ea96713623.jpeg,N,,2025-10-21 16:19:30.454618

The company announced Tuesday alongside third-quarter earnings that it made the decision because the “commercial electric delivery van market developed much slower than expected.” GM also blames the “changing regulatory environment and the elimination of tax credits in the United States” — the result of the second Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs.

BrightDrop production has been suspended at GM’s CAMI Assembly facility in Ontario, Canada since May, when the company also cut 500 jobs. GM said Tuesday that it needs to have “meaningful discussions” with government leaders in Canada about “opportunities” for the plant. In the meantime, GM told TechCrunch that BrightDrop dealers will “continue to sell and service vehicles as we work through remaining inventory.”

The decision to kill off BrightDrop comes at an odd moment for electric vehicles in the United States. Companies like GM set new EV sales records in the third quarter, though that enthusiasm was driven in part by the expiration of the federal tax credit, which Republicans in Congress decided to end.

Meanwhile, major automakers like GM have spent much of the last year walking back once-lofty promises about how many EVs they plan to make and sell in the coming years. GM, which once pledged to have a fully-electric fleet by 2035, boasted on Tuesday that it is “well positioned to meet strong, sustained demand” for internal combustion vehicles. (Investors have rewarded that decision. GM’s stock price is up 14% at the time of publish.)

BrightDrop’s short existence has been chaotic. GM revealed the program as a pseudo-startup in 2021. The automaker created BrightDrop in its “Global Innovation” organization (which is where OnStar was built) and spun it out as a privately-held company.

BrightDrop launched at the Consumer Electronics Show that year. The automaker touted a lower total cost of ownership and less frequent maintenance as advantages over its internal combustion counterparts. BrightDrop vans seemed poised to quickly take advantage of the fact that major companies like FedEx were pushing to go carbon-neutral and emissions-free. BrightDrop also came into existence at a time when the pandemic was fueling a huge e-commerce surge, upping the need for delivery vans.

Just two years later, GM absorbed BrightDrop into its overall fleet business, GM Envolve. The unit’s CEO, Travis Katz, stepped down. Some of the vans started catching fire, sparking a recall in early 2024. Then GM moved BrightDrop again, this time to within Chevrolet’s commercial division. The automaker continued to struggle to sell BrightDrop vans this year, barely topping 1,500 sold in the first half.

It’s unclear why, exactly, GM struggled so mightily to sell its BrightDrop vans. And while there were plenty of indicators the unit was struggling, the decision appears to have come somewhat abruptly. Earlier this month, GM Envolve vice president Ian Hucker was touting BrightDrop’s vans in a press release about a partnership with delivery driver organization Frontdoor Collective and infrastructure company Circuit EV. That partnership is supposed to provide 50 BrightDrop vans for Target to use in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

GM isn’t alone; Sales of Ford’s E-Transit van are well below where they were in 2024. But Rivian has put more than 25,000 electric vans on the road with Amazon over the last few years. And Los Angeles-based startup Harbinger has sold more than 200 of its electric truck chassis since starting production in April. On Tuesday morning, Harbinger also announced it is expanding sales to Canada.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/v08.7e5AxtJtkCNLKuxENw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/8a5af3da06195877b107a4157302bb7d,N,,2025-10-21 13:19:30.577101

News Release

Natural gas power M&A premiums double as data center demand and capital costs transform U.S. energy market

Advanced financial modeling and portfolio optimization are redefining how investors value assets in the evolving U.S. power sector

CALGARY, Alberta (Oct. 21, 2025) Enverus Intelligence® Research (EIR), a subsidiary of Enverus, the leading energy SaaS and analytics provider leveraging generative AI, today announced the release of its latest market intelligence report, “The State of Power M&A – What Are the Markets Pricing In?” The new analysis explores the shifting dynamics of U.S. power sector mergers and acquisitions, revealing how accelerating data center growth, grid electrification, and rising capital costs and supply chain issues are driving premiums for operating natural gas power plants and transforming valuation methodologies in competitive markets such as the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM) and Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

“The surge in U.S. natural gas-fired power M&A valuations, which have doubled since 2024 and reached up to $1.93 million per megawatt for top PJM assets, demonstrates how data center-driven electricity demand and escalating capital costs are fundamentally reshaping how the market values operational power generation assets,” said Scott Wilmot, principal Analyst at EIR.

Key Takeaways:

U.S. natural gas power sector M&A valuations have doubled since 2024, with buyers paying record prices for high-efficiency generation assets in competitive wholesale electricity markets like PJM and ERCOT.

Data center expansion and grid electrification are driving sustained load growth for the first time in a decade, pushing forward wholesale power prices higher across major U.S. regions.

Rising capital costs for new natural gas power plants now average $2,200–$3,000 per kilowatt, fueling higher asset valuations and reshaping transaction strategies.

Portfolio optimization strategies are increasingly focused on assets with robust capacity payments and spark spreads, reflecting a shift in how investment value is created in the U.S. power sector.

Backed by government and private sector investment in clean energy such as renewables and nuclear, the clean energy economy is sparking a boom in demand for good industrial jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, with 31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians, and welders particularly in demand.

For the first time, the UK Government has published a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030.

The Government says that setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how trade unions are an essential part of the modern workplace and economy.

Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70 percent in the mid-90s to around 30 percent today. According to the Government, recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay, with entry-level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23 percent more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

• Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – five new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

• Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans – working with Mission Renewable, the Government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

• Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

• Upskill existing workers – oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. The Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’ will also be extended, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world-class pay, terms and conditions.

• Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

• A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

• Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

The Government says that setting clear workforce estimates for the first time will galvanise industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how trade unions are an essential part of the modern workplace and economy.

Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70 percent in the mid-90s to around 30 percent today. According to the Government, recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay, with entry-level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23 percent more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

• Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – five new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be backed by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers

• Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans – working with Mission Renewable, the Government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

• Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades

• Upskill existing workers – oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. The Government is also extending the ‘energy skills passport’ will also be extended, which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind, to new sectors including nuclear and the electricity grid

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world-class pay, terms and conditions.

• Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

• A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

• Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50 percent today.",http://www.dpaonthenet.net/global/showimage.ashx?Type=Article&ID=234438&Min=200,N,,2025-10-21 16:19:39.045176

Now, countries such as Australia and the U.S. are looking to refine more lithium at home, and North Carolina is well-positioned to benefit.

A lithium refinery is raising money to ramp up production in Greensboro. Sheeba Dawood cofounded Minerva Lithium with her former professor at UNC Greensboro, Hemali Rathnayake.

Dawood said the majority of lithium refining happens overseas. Australia, China and Chile mine most of the world’s lithium, but China refines more than Chile and Australia combined, according to data from the International Energy Agency.

However, North Carolina is becoming a hub for the mineral, following a string of billion-dollar private investments. International mining company Albemarle, which owns mines in Australia and Chile, plans to reopen the Kings Mountain lithium mine in Gaston County. Toyota built a battery manufacturing plant in Randolph County and may be looking to shore up its domestic supply of battery-grade lithium products. Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer Vinfast has begun developing land in Chatham County, though local news outlets report the project has been plagued by delays.

But it’s not just car companies that are looking to get their hands on refined lithium products:

“It’s used in greases and lubricants and then, you know, battery-grade lithium,” Dawood said.

How much lithium does an EV battery require?

Dawood hopes to raise $5 million to hire enough workers to produce 200 kilograms of lithium carbonate per day — enough to make over 1,000 EV batteries a year.

The refinery can process impure lithium from brine, hard rock or recycled batteries, sources that allow it to recover lithium that might not otherwise be viable. For example, some mines in Nevada pump mineral-rich brine from underground into surface ponds. The brine evaporates, leaving behind a highly concentrated solution with lithium and some impurities.

At Dawood’s facility, nanomosaic absorbers strain out those impurities through microscopic pores.

“We have also gone for a material which is very simple to use, like a sponge,” Dawood said.

The result is a white powder called lithium carbonate that varies in purity, depending on who’s buying.

Mineral refining is a water-intensive process; 500,000 gallons of water yield a metric ton of lithium. But Dawood says Minerva Lithium has made strides to reduce water usage through recycling wastewater, using 95% less water.

Car and battery manufacturers don’t just purchase the refined lithium — they can also provide the refinery with the raw materials through black mass, the shredded remains of end-of-life batteries. Dawood said the facility has conducted successful test runs with black mass, but is still working on scaling up this process.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/79647b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/650x341+0+12/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2Fca%2F71b74951471b8f87aa8c9335da84%2F081622-ford-f-150-ev-charging.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 13:01:10.247620

Dent said this won’t be the last word on how the climate law affects the bottom line of ag businesses.","Washington quietly ended funding this summer for a program that provided millions of dollars in rebates to farmers who paid unfair fuel surcharges under Washington’s landmark climate law.

Lawmakers are hoping instead that legislation enacted in May will make it easier for farm fuel users and haulers of agricultural goods to receive the fuel exemption promised under the state’s cap-and-trade system.

This year’s law directed the Department of Ecology to create an online map of retailers who sell exempt agricultural fuel at a price that excludes any surcharges associated with the Climate Commitment Act.

Rep. Tom Dent, R-Moses Lake, said this will simplify the process for farmers and haulers. Rather than pay a surcharge and submit paperwork to the government for a rebate, they can avoid extra costs up front, at the pump, he said.

“This should be an easier way for farmers to not pay a surcharge,” Dent said.

Complicated carveout

Central to the Climate Commitment Act are auctions for pollution allowances that refineries and other companies need to buy to offset their carbon emissions.

Under the law, the agricultural, maritime and aviation sectors are supposed to be exempt from the law’s cap on emissions and any fees fuel companies might pass to customers to cover the cost of buying the allowances. Fuel used for trucking crops and other agricultural goods on public highways is exempt as well.

Soon after the cap-and-trade program began in 2023, complaints about these exemptions started streaming in.

There were difficulties tracking whether diesel fuel was being used for exempt purposes. A process where exempt fuel buyers had to present certificates to fuel sellers was cumbersome and faulty. One challenge for farmers was knowing where fuel exemption certificates would be accepted.

Bottom line, farmers and truckers said fuel distributors were, in many cases, passing on the cost of allowances to the tune of as much as 70 cents a gallon.

Ecology put together a workgroup that met several times in 2023 to try — unsuccessfully, said farmers and truckers — to iron out the wrinkles.

Even before the panel completed its work, the Washington Trucking Associations and the Washington Farm Bureau were asking a judge to scrap Ecology regulations guiding the exemptions and to open a new rulemaking process.

That fight reached the state Supreme Court this week.

Funding left out of budget

In 2024, the Legislature set aside $30 million for rebates to farm fuel users and transporters of agricultural goods who could show they paid a surcharge tied to the climate law for which they should have been exempt. The Department of Licensing ran the Agriculture Support Program with funding from Climate Commitment Act proceeds.

It launched in August 2024 and ended June 30 this year.

Farmers and transporters could seek rebates for fuel purchased between Jan. 1, 2023, and Dec. 31, 2024. A total of 2,744 applications came in, with $7,887,820 in rebates awarded, according to the Department of Licensing. There were rebate recipients in each of the state’s 39 counties.

Overall, the department spent $9.4 million on the rebate program, with the remaining $20.6 million returned to the climate fund.

Dent said he wanted the rebate program to continue, “but budget writers being budget writers decided not to do so.”

House Bill 1912, which Dent authored this year, says it is the intent of the Legislature to extend the rebate program through the 2025-27 biennium. That is not what occurred, even though the bill passed by margins of 94-2 in the House and 49-0 in the Senate.

The House penciled in $3 million to keep the program going in its budget, but the Senate put no funds in its version. That is what the Legislature passed and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed.

As a result, applications for rebates closed June 2. All those received were processed, with money sent by June 30.

In the meantime, the Department of Ecology developed the new online directory of retailers who have told the department that they sell exempt agricultural fuel at a price that is different from fuel that is not exempt under the climate law.

This directory lists the name, address, county, and, if applicable, city of each exempt retail fuel seller. If additional retailers self-report, the site will be updated.

Dent said this won’t be the last word on how the climate law affects the bottom line of ag businesses.

The new stalls are being installed in front of Petco, ULTA, and Office Depot, across from Chick-fil-A—joining the 8 existing V3 Supercharger stalls already on-site for a total of 24 superchargers.
For current Tesla owners, most models—including the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X—use a 400 V battery system.

The new stalls are being installed in front of Petco, ULTA, and Office Depot, across from Chick-fil-A—joining the 8 existing V3 Supercharger stalls already on-site for a total of 24 superchargers.

See Feb 2020 post on the original 8 superchargers going live: https://developinglafayette.com/wp/completed-tesla-superchargers-at-i-10-louisiana-ave/

The addition brings more fast-charging options to a high-traffic commercial area and introduces Tesla’s latest charging tech to Lafayette.

Launched in 2019, the current V3 stalls offer up to 250 kW of charging power, the new V4 Superchargers are capable of delivering up to 325 kW per stall, with plans for even higher capacity—up to 500 kW—as the technology rolls out further. The V4 setup also supports a wider range of EV battery architectures, including 400 V, 800 V, and higher, making it more future-ready and compatible with newer EVs.

For current Tesla owners, most models—including the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X—use a 400 V battery system. These vehicles will see similar charge times between V3 and V4 stalls when both are capped at 250 kW, though the V4 design allows for potential gains as newer Tesla models—such as the Cyber Truck—and software updates unlock higher charging capabilities.

Other enhancements include longer charging cables and improved support for non-Tesla vehicles, depending on region-specific configurations.

The funding from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s Office for Clean Energy Jobs will also be used to support up to 15 apprentices and knowledge sharing between business and educators.

Enterprise Cheshire and Warrington will commission and oversee delivery of the courses, which will be available to anyone aged 18+ who is a Cheshire West resident working in carbon-intensive industries, or those working in a business based in Cheshire West that would benefit from training to let them access new clean energy opportunities.

Courses will be delivered by a range of local and national providers, typically lasting one to five days, and delivered over a maximum of six weeks. They are designed to upskill local people in a range of sector-critical areas such as electrical engineering, hydrogen skills, and construction.

The funding, announced in the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, is the next phase of the announcement made in January 2025, which highlighted that west Cheshire had been selected as a pilot “key growth region” for clean energy.

The new short courses further enhance Cheshire and Warrington’s already enviable track record of skills training, including the hugely successful Skills Bootcamp programme which offers courses ranging from retrofit and green construction to 3D printing to help thousands of people fast track into jobs and boost existing careers.

Cllr Louise Gittins, Leader of Cheshire West and Chester Council, and Chair of Cheshire and Warrington sub regional Leaders Board and Joint Committee said: “Upskilling existing workers and ensuring the courses available at our local training providers are industry-led, will enable the clean energy sector to go from strength to strength, including attracting the local talent for the future. We are thrilled that west Cheshire can contribute to the UK’s broader goal of achieving clean power by 2030 and will look forward to working closely with the department and the Office for Clean Energy Jobs to ensure this next phase is a success.”

James Johnson, Head of Regional Programme at the North West Net Zero Hub, a delivery partner which helped secure the funding said: “We’re proud to have facilitated the first stage of the regional skills pilot. The robust research delivered by Enterprise Cheshire and Warrington highlights a sharp rise in clean energy workforce demand. This further supports the findings of our recent Clean Power Paper - up to 35,000 roles needed by 2028 across the whole of the North West, particularly in nuclear, offshore wind, CCUS and hydrogen. This growth forecast is not just a challenge; it’s a generational opportunity for communities across the North West. By acting together, we can unlock thousands of high-quality jobs, attract investment, and ensure the region leads the way in powering the UK’s clean energy future.”

The Government published a plan yesterday (October 19), aimed at upskilling the next generation of clean energy workers across the country, forecasting that employment could double to 860,000 by 2030.

The plan sets clear workforce estimates for the first time with the aim of helping industry, the public sector and education providers deliver a strategy to invest in training for specific in-demand occupations. Thirty-one occupations, which includes plumbers, electricians and welders, are particularly in demand, the government says.

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Pat McFadden, said: “We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation.

“Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change.”",https://cheshireandwarrington.com/media/mw4nt1ti/ce-net-zero.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=630&rnd=132871701336730000,N,,2025-10-21 16:04:32.154648

Rivian’s share price has pulled back significantly this month, reflecting fresh concerns around demand and policy shifts, but its 1-year total shareholder return of nearly 25% shows that plenty of investors still see long-term potential, despite a rocky ride since its IPO. The mood lately has shifted more cautious as investors wait to see if new product launches and cost controls can reignite momentum.

If the EV sector’s twists and turns have you wondering what else is out there, now’s a perfect moment to explore more companies in the space with our

With the shares trading at a discount to some analysts’ targets, but fresh downgrades and high uncertainty on the horizon, the big question is whether Rivian is undervalued today or if the market has already factored in what comes next.

Most Popular Narrative: 9.7% Undervalued

With Rivian Automotive's most popular narrative fair value set at $14.48 and the last close price at $13.08, the narrative suggests meaningful upside if the growth story plays out as anticipated. This introduces a chance to examine the key drivers behind this estimate.

The launch of the R2 platform represents a step-change improvement in Rivian's cost structure. Management has secured supplier contracts and component sourcing that reduce the bill of materials by nearly 50% compared to R1, significantly lowering per-unit costs. This operational overhaul is expected to improve gross margins and support a path to profitability as scale is achieved.

Want to know the playbook behind Rivian’s high fair value? This narrative is not just expecting growth; it relies on a bold, disruptive margin shift and ambitious delivery milestones. Curious about how these projections compare to sector norms? Explore further to uncover the assumptions and targets driving this valuation.

Result: Fair Value of $14.48 (UNDERVALUED)

However, ongoing high cash burn and cuts to EV tax incentives could delay profitability and present challenges for Rivian’s ability to deliver on these bold expectations.

Another View: Comparing Market Ratios

While the narrative points to under-valuation based on fair value projections, the current price-to-sales ratio for Rivian stands at 3.1x. This is notably higher than both the US Auto industry average of 1.3x and the peer average of 1.5x, as well as the estimated fair ratio of 1.4x. This gap means investors are paying a significant premium for growth and future expectations, which adds greater downside risk if the growth story falters. Is the market pricing in too much optimism or is there still hidden value?

What is PJM and why would they want to block clean energy?
Now more than ever, PJM must prioritize renewable energy projects that can provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy to the grid There is more than enough clean energy waiting for PJM approval to both bring costs down and keep our electricity grid reliable.
That’s why we are calling on governors in the PJM states to continue to use their influence to put pressure on PJM to start rapidly approving clean energy projects, and stop catering to fossil fuel interests.
Take action for clean, reliable energy Environment America Research & Policy Center has done research on powering our lives with clean renewable energy, including the annual State of Renewable Energy report, which documents state-by-state progress on clean energy.","You may be one of 65 million Americans in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic whose electric bill spiked this past summer. All told, electricity customers across over a dozen states are paying an additional $12.5 billion this year just to keep the lights on– and it’s only getting worse.

By preventing this proposed renewable energy from connecting to our electricity grid, PJM’s decisions are creating a bottleneck on energy supply. With less electricity supply to meet demand, our electricity bills go up.

What’s worse, instead of fixing the problem by connecting all of these waiting renewable energy projects to the grid (many that have been waiting in line for years), PJM is using this price spike as an excuse to let 50 expensive and polluting fracked gas and nuclear power plants skip the line.

What is PJM and why would they want to block clean energy?

PJM plays a critical role for utility customers in all or part of Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and D.C. As a regional grid operator, PJM is responsible for making sure that when you flip a switch, the light turns on.

If a power plant—like a gas plant or a wind or solar farm—wants to provide power to customers in the PJM region, they need to get PJM’s approval before they can start construction. Right now, 98% of projects waiting for PJM approval are renewable energy projects, including significant amounts of solar + storage, battery, and wind resources which don’t pollute our air, are cheaper to dispatch to customers than fossil fuel energy, and have high reliability value whenever PJM needs energy the most.

But PJM also has some of the longest wait times in the country for pending projects trying to get approval. And incredibly, in recent years new projects have essentially stopped being connected altogether. This is because PJM’s current process for approving new power is overly complicated and drawn out, while also giving the upper hand to the polluting and expensive energy sources of the 19th century. PJM has refused to fully comply with a federal order to reform its practices, and estimates it won’t be done with the current backlog and able to process new projects until 2026.

It doesn’t help that stakeholders in PJM, including the owners of power plants, utilities, and transmission lines participate in PJM’s decision-making process as voting members on its many committees.

This is like asking the foxes to guard the hen house. Because PJM’s grid is dominated by fossil fuel power plants—43% gas and 27% coal, compared to only 6% solar, wind, and hydropower combined—most of the companies that vote in PJM have a financial stake in fossil fuel infrastructure. These companies are often able to exercise their decision-making power outside of the scrutiny of the public and ratepayers.

Now more than ever, PJM must prioritize renewable energy projects that can provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy to the grid

There is more than enough clean energy waiting for PJM approval to both bring costs down and keep our electricity grid reliable. One report found that if PJM implements key reforms to its process for connecting new resources, it would both reduce carbon dioxide pollution by 14% and cut average household power bills in the PJM region by $505 annually.

Right now, in PJM and across the country, energy demand is on the rise as more and more energy-hungry data centers come onto the grid. To avoid blackouts, keep electric costs from spiking further, and stop unnecessary development of polluting power plants, PJM needs to prioritize building a modern electricity grid that is capable of using 21st century technologies. That means fixing its broken processes and prioritizing allowing the renewable energy projects that have been waiting for years to come online and supply clean, green reliable power to PJM’s electric consumers.

State leaders can make a difference

We know that governors have the power to influence PJM and its stakeholders. When Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro filed a complaint with federal regulators back in December 2024 in an attempt to stop skyrocketing bills, PJM came to the table and negotiated a new, lower cap on prices.

That’s why we are calling on governors in the PJM states to continue to use their influence to put pressure on PJM to start rapidly approving clean energy projects, and stop catering to fossil fuel interests.

Take action for clean, reliable energy

Environment America Research & Policy Center has done research on powering our lives with clean renewable energy, including the annual State of Renewable Energy report, which documents state-by-state progress on clean energy. Our federation of state groups have dedicated staff on the ground in key PJM states, like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and Illinois, ready to rally public support around this issue and advocate for PJM state governors to protect our planet and consumers from PJM’s harmful decisions.

EGLE’s Dam Safety Unit focuses on identifying and assessing dams that pose the greatest risks to public safety.","Since 2020, the State of Michigan has awarded grants and emergency funds, improved enforcement, and expanded its Dam Safety Unit, but it’s not enough to hold back the pressure on Michigan’s numerous aging, deteriorating, dangerous dams.

With more than 1,000 state-regulated dams – many of them decades or even a century old – the need for regulatory reforms and sustained investment in dam safety has never been more urgent.

“Neglect any infrastructure long enough, and it will fail,” said Luke Trumble, head of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy’s (EGLE) Dam Safety Unit. “Dams that have lasted a lifetime can fail in an instant. Preventive action must be our top priority when people’s lives and homes are at risk.”

The consequences of failure are severe. In May 2020, the Edenville Dam collapsed and the Sanford Dam overtopped during record-setting rainstorms, displacing 10,000 residents and causing more than $200 million in damages in one of Michigan’s worst dam-related disasters.

Across the U.S., dam failures have claimed at least 140 lives over the past 50 years. In 2006, seven people died in Hawaii when the Ka Loko Reservoir Dam burst after poor maintenance, lapsed inspections, illegal modifications, and extreme rainfall. Michigan is not immune to these risks.

State action and investment

Following the Edenville and Sanford dam failures, the Association of State Dam Safety Officials called for increased investment in dam safety, staffing, and enforcement. The Michigan Dam Safety Task Force issued 86 recommendations across key areas including funding, compliance, and emergency response.

In response, the State of Michigan and EGLE took significant steps:

Expanding EGLE’s Dam Safety Unit from two to eight staff members.

Standardizing enforcement practices to ensure consistent oversight.

Creating a $6 million Dam Safety Emergency Action Fund to support urgent repairs. The fund has about $3 million remaining for use before the end of fiscal year 2026.

Launching the Dam Risk Reduction Grant Program (DRRGP), which invested nearly $44 million over three fiscal years to help private owners repair or remove 57 dams statewide.

Urgency remains

Despite these efforts, the threat remains severe, costly problems remain, and the Dam Risk Reduction Grant Program announced its final awards in May 2025.

Many dam owners and local governments lack the financial capacity to address decades of deferred maintenance. In some cases, public pressure to preserve recreational lakes and ponds has delayed necessary safety actions.

Recent orders by EGLE to draw down structurally deficient dams in the Holly and White Cloud have been met with local push back over impacts to the Holly Mill Pond and Lake White Cloud. But the risks of inaction are far greater.

“Boating, fishing, and swimming are part of Michigan’s identity, but public safety must come first,” Trumble said. “We all share the goal of preventing another tragedy.”

Safeguarding dams in Michigan

Many of Michigan's more than 2,500 publicly and privately owned dams are decades past their design life. The state regulates more than 1,000 of them based on height and hazard potential. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates 99 Michigan hydroelectric dams owned by individuals, companies, and local and state governments.

More than 160 state-regulated dams are classified as having high hazard potential, meaning their failure would likely result in loss of life and significant property damage. About 15% of these have been rated in poor condition or do not have a current rating.

EGLE’s Dam Safety Unit focuses on identifying and assessing dams that pose the greatest risks to public safety. The unit ensures that dams are properly built, inspected, and maintained, and that owners are prepared for potential emergencies. Among staff duties, many required by statute, are:

Inspecting, on request, dams owned by the state or local governments.

Reviewing the adequacy of dam construction or reconstruction plans.

Reviewing safety-related reports, including inspection reports.

Performing compliance activities as necessary to enforce the law.

“We urge the Department to require Chemours to re-submit its application with disclosed emissions data,” the Sept. 19 letter states.
Chemours revised and resubmitted that permit application to expand only its production of vinyl ethers last August.
The application, “blacks out emission rates from stack testing, uncontrolled emission factors, hours of operation, maximum hours of operation, historic production, and post-modification production capacity.
In a 20-page letter to DEQ, SELC attorneys argue Chemours questioned the efficacy of thermal destruction technology on PFAS.","Chemours’ air permit application to expand production at its Fayetteville Works plant excludes emissions data that should be disclosed to the public, environmental lawyers say.

The company “improperly withheld vital emission data from the public” in its Aug. 14 application to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Air Quality, according to a letter Southern Environmental Law Center attorneys sent the department last month.

“We urge the Department to require Chemours to re-submit its application with disclosed emissions data,” the Sept. 19 letter states. “North Carolina law clearly states that emission data cannot be kept secret.”

Jess Loizeaux, Chemours’ communications leader, refuted that claim, writing in an email responding to a request for comment, “our permit application fully disclosed the projected emissions associated with the expansion.”

“Certain details included in the application submitted to DAQ – such as production capacity, operating hours, and emissions factors – were redacted from the public version because they are considered confidential business information and, if made public, could harm our competitive position,” Loizeaux said. “Protecting confidential business information is standard practice and does not affect transparency regarding environmental impacts.”

Attorneys for Chemours and its predecessor company DuPont made a similar argument earlier this year when they filed a court motion to keep under seal thousands of pages of documents they say include “non-public facts” that largely pertain to chemical production.

Lawyers representing public utilities and local governments downstream of Chemours’ Bladen County plant submitted 25,000 pages of documents to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina as part of lawsuit those entities brought against the companies in October 2017.

Cape Fear Public Utility Authority, Brunswick County, Lower Cape Fear Water & Sewer Authority, and Wrightsville Beach aim to recover costs and damages associated with the Fayetteville Works’ plant’s discharges of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, for decades into the Cape Fear River. The river is a drinking water source for tens of thousands of residents in the region.

The court had not rendered a decision on Chemours’ request as of this story’s publication.

In 2020, Chemours submitted an application to renew its Title V permit, which applies to major source of air emissions, for its Fayetteville Works plant to the state Division of Air Quality.

Two years later, the company applied for a separate permit to expand its production of vinyl ethers and IXM.

Chemours revised and resubmitted that permit application to expand only its production of vinyl ethers last August. Vinyl ethers are a class of compounds used to create a variety of products used in a range of technologies from semiconductor chips to aviation components.

Vinyl ethers are used to create a wide variety of products, including polymers for adhesives, coatings, and plastics

The expansion would pertain to the plant’s two existing vinyl ethers production units, Loizeaux said.

“As outlined in the revised permit application, additional abatement technology will be installed alongside each expansion and is projected to decrease the site’s overall fluorinated emissions by approximately 15%, despite an increase in production,” she said. “A timeline for the expansions has not yet been set.”

Southern Environmental Law Center attorneys argue in their Sept. 19 letter to DEQ that Chemours is violating provisions within the state law that outlines protection and disclosure rules for confidential information.

The application, “blacks out emission rates from stack testing, uncontrolled emission factors, hours of operation, maximum hours of operation, historic production, and post-modification production capacity. The information is necessary to verify and fully understand the emissions and authorized emissions at the facility and cannot be withheld from the public,” according to the letter.

The letter goes on to state that Chemours previously disclosed similar information in previous submissions to DEQ.

“Chemours’ about-face from its past submissions further confirms that this information cannot be treated as confidential,” the letter states.

Last April, the SELC, on behalf of Cape Fear River Watch, asked DEQ to deny Chemours’ request to expand production at its Bladen County plant, arguing that the company’s air permit application was riddled with flaws.

As part of 2019 consent order with DEQ and Cape Fear River Watch, Chemours installed a thermal oxidizer to capture and destroy PFAS from emitting into the air. The order also requires the company to test tens of thousands of private drinking water wells for PFAS contamination throughout the region.

In a 20-page letter to DEQ, SELC attorneys argue Chemours questioned the efficacy of thermal destruction technology on PFAS.

“Investigating Chemours’ thermal oxidizer specifically, [the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] determined that, due to a lack of data, ‘removal processes for products of incomplete combustion or of destruction of potential compounds not studied … are still unclear.’ In other words, it is possible that the company’s thermal oxidizer does not fully destroy many PFAS. Some may break down into other harmful chemicals, and others may not be destroyed at all,” the letter states.

DEQ Interim Deputy Communications Director Shawn Taylor said in an email earlier this month that while air quality officials deem the latest version of Chemours’ application administratively complete, “the Division may require additional information from the applicant to conduct its technical review.”

“The Division plans to schedule a full public engagement process, including a public comment period and public hearings, to be announced at a later date,” he said.",https://coastalreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Chemours-thermal-oxidizer-Fayetteville.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 12:02:46.107738

EPA Says ""I Do"" to Biden-Era PFAS ""Forever Chemicals"" Rule (For Now)",Not Available,,,,,https://www.williamsmullen.com/insights/news/legal-news/till-waste-do-us-part-epa-says-i-do-biden-era-pfas-forever-chemicals-rule,"In May 2024, the EPA issued a final rule designating Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid (PFOS), two substances under the PFAS umbrella, as Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) hazardous substances.
CERCLA, however, does contain a regulatory requirement that releases into the environment of hazardous substances above an assigned threshold or ""reportable quantity"" be reported.
Chemicals listed as hazardous substances under CERCLA occur in two contexts.
There are over 800 substances listed in this manner as hazardous substances, including lead, epinephrine, chromium, and nitric acid.
EPA’s designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in May 2024 was the very first time EPA relied on this authority and designated hazardous substances through this second mechanism.","In May 2024, the EPA issued a final rule designating Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid (PFOS), two substances under the PFAS umbrella, as Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) hazardous substances.

EPA determined that PFOA and PFOS “may present substantial danger to public health or welfare or the environment” when released into the environment after considering the available scientific and technical information. For example, EPA considered that human exposure to PFOA and/or PFOS may be linked to various adverse health effects, including immune effects (e.g., antibody production and immunity), developmental effects to fetuses during pregnancy or to infants (e.g., low birth weight, accelerated puberty, skeletal variations), and liver effects (e.g., tissue damage). EPA also considered its prior toxicity risk assessment of PFOA and PFOS in the drinking water context, highlighting studies that concluded PFOA and/or PFOS may cause carcinogenic effects in humans and animals. Additionally, EPA noted that the potential health and environmental risks associated with PFOA and PFOS are compounded by the very nature of the substances—these ""forever chemicals"" are highly resistant to breaking down in the environment and can readily move through soil and water once released.

The designation of these chemicals as hazardous substances was ""on the rocks"" after President Trump's election, and many wondered if the Administration would ""divorce"" itself from the rulemaking given the President's executive orders emphasizing regulatory rollback and requiring agencies to consider costs associated with their regulations. Nevertheless, on September 17, 2025, EPA announced its intention to retain the rule.

In 1980, Congress established CERCLA (the ""Superfund"" statute) to ensure that contaminated property is remediated and that those remediation costs are efficiently allocated to responsible parties. In other words, CERCLA's end goal was to shift the cost of remediation from the public to polluters at ""fault"" for the contamination, reflecting a ""polluter pays"" public policy goal. CERCLA, however, is not ""regulatory"" or ""preventative"" in the same sense as other environmental statutes; rather, CERCLA is typically ""enforced"" retroactively (i.e., after contamination has already occurred), through the EPA’s authority to demand cleanup or undertake a cleanup. In the event EPA undertakes cleanup efforts, it also has the authority to demand reimbursement from responsible parties.

CERCLA, however, does contain a regulatory requirement that releases into the environment of hazardous substances above an assigned threshold or ""reportable quantity"" be reported. The purpose of this requirement is to inform the government of a release ""so that the need for response can be evaluated and any necessary response [is] undertaken in a timely fashion."" 48 Fed. Reg. 23552, 23553 (May 25, 1983). To that end, this reporting requirement alerts EPA of releases of hazardous substances that may threaten the environment or public health, and which may warrant immediate remedial action by the responsible party or the EPA. Additionally, many states have incorporated CERCLA's hazardous substances and reportable quantities into their state-level release reporting regulations, such as Louisiana (incorporating by reference CERCLA's reportable quantities), Florida (defining reportable quantity as the amount sets forth in CERCLA's implementing regulations), and Illinois (noting that the reportable quantity varies depending upon the substance involved and is determined under CERCLA's implementing regulations).

Chemicals listed as hazardous substances under CERCLA occur in two contexts. First, if a chemical is designated for regulation under a different environmental law—such as the Clean Air Act—then it is automatically defined as a hazardous substance. There are over 800 substances listed in this manner as hazardous substances, including lead, epinephrine, chromium, and nitric acid. Alternatively, CERCLA grants EPA the authority to ""promulgate and revise as may be appropriate, regulations designating as hazardous substances … such elements, compounds, mixtures, solutions, and substances which, when released into the environment may present substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 9602(a).

EPA’s designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances in May 2024 was the very first time EPA relied on this authority and designated hazardous substances through this second mechanism.

Despite EPA's decision to retain the designation, the agency was also critical of the alleged ""failure"" of the previous administration to provide the ""rules of the road"" (i.e., the criteria for designating a substance as hazardous) prior to designating. To that end, EPA noted it intends to develop a CERCLA Framework Rule; this Framework Rule will provide a uniform approach to guide future hazardous substance designations, including how the agency will consider the costs of proposed designations.

Ultimately, while EPA has said ""I do"" to the rule for now, the agency appears to have left the door open for future changes, noting that it will continue to collect information on the rule’s costs and benefits. Moreover, EPA's response to this PFAS rule is consistent to the agency's overall approach to other Biden-ERA PFAS rules: signaling conditional support for the rules while scrutinizing the costs of compliance. For example, in May 2025, the agency announced it will keep the newly established National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) for PFOA and PFOS but will extend compliance deadlines and establish an exemption framework.",https://www.williamsmullen.com/themes/custom/williams_mullen/images/williams-mullen-finding-yes-logo.png,N,,2025-10-21 12:02:37.497290

Congress approved about $4bn for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (Liheap), after Trump’s proposal to cancel the life-saving heating and cooling scheme in this year’s budget was ultimately unsuccessful.

But with winter fast approaching, lawmakers have failed to reach a funding deal and appropriations remain stalled, which threaten to leave the most vulnerable families without critical energy aid as electricity and gas bills surge.

“No family should be forced to choose between heat and food because of a federal funding delay,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), which represents the state directors of Liheap.

“If the money isn’t released soon, it will cause real harm and people will suffer.”

Liheap is a chronically underfunded bipartisan program that helped almost 6 million households keep on top of energy bills last year, reaching only 17% of those eligible for assistance even before the current chaos.

Due to the seasonal nature of the program, previous administrations have typically allowed 90% of the Liheap funds to be distributed by the end of October – even while lawmakers wrangled over the annual appropriations bill.

This is year is different thanks to Trump’s “department of government efficiency”, or Doge.

Even if the continuing resolution – or short-term spending fix – was to be agreed this week, states and tribes would likely not receive the funds until early December at the earliest due to unprecedented staff shortages.

Earlier this year, the entire staff running the decades-old bipartisan program was fired – as part of the Trump administration’s so-called “efficiency” drive which was overseen by the billionaire Republican donor Elon Musk.

This left no technical staff to apply the funding formula, which determines how much each state and tribe receives, and approve states’ plans on how the money will be allocated to households. The Guardian understands that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, had been using external paid consultants and staff from other programs, some of whom were fired earlier this month.

With no indication that the government shutdown will end any time soon, the NEADA is urging utilities to immediately suspend disconnections for overdue bills – until the federal chaos is resolved and Liheap funds are released.

“Utilities must act in the public interest and pause shutoffs until federal aid is available again,” said Wolfe.

In the first eight months of this year, New York’s monopoly energy provider alone disconnected 111,000 households. The national total is expected to hit 4m shutoffs in 2025 – up from 3m in 2023, according to analysis of utility-reported data.

Trump declared a national energy emergency on his first day back in office, pledging to ramp up fossil-fuel production and slash regulations to bring consumer energy bills down.

In the past year, electricity bills have risen more than 15% in 10 states plus the District of Columbia, with the highest jumps in Illinois (28%), Indiana (25%) and JD Vance’s home state of Ohio (23%). The price hike is mostly down to the rising cost of fossil gas, utilities passing on the cost of investment in transmission and distribution systems to consumers, and the rapid unchecked growth of data centers, which is increasing demand for electricity.

According to NEADA research, the cost of home-heating this winter is expected to rise by an average of 7.6%, increasing from $907 last winter to an estimated $976 this year.

About 21 million households – one in six – are currently behind on their energy bills. Household energy arrears rose by more than 30% from $17.5bn in December 2023 to $23bn by June 2025.

Through the FY 2025 Disaster Supplemental Grant Program (DSGP), the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) has made available $1.45 billion in federal grant money to help communities recover from natural disasters occurring in 2023 and 2024.

The EDA has a long history of supporting disaster recovery, primarily through funding individual construction projects and targeted economic development activities. The 2025 DSGP expanded the EDA’s traditional role in disaster recovery with the introduction of the “Industry Transformation Path,” which is a relatively flexible grant program offering grants of up to $50 million to support coordinated regional industry investments. Accordingly, the 2025 DSGP offers three unique grant programs or “funding paths” to assist in disaster recovery.

Readiness Path: Funding to support capacity building and strategic planning projects (i.e., non-construction) to help prepare for future investments. Eligible projects may include developing recovery strategies, hiring recovery staff, and covering pre-development costs such as permitting, engineering reports, environmental documents, and impact assessments. Award range: $250,000 – $500,000. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.

Implementation Path: Funding for standalone construction and non-construction projects that support long-term recovery and economic growth. Eligible projects may include, for example, infrastructure upgrades, workforce development programs, or other activities that accelerate industry and growth. Award range: $2 –$20 million (or higher in cases of exceptional need) for construction projects and $100,000 – $5 million for non-construction projects. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.

Industry Transformation Path: Funding for coalition-led, multi-project portfolio designed to reshape regional economies through targeted industry development. Each portfolio may include a combination of construction and non-construction projects. Award range: $20 million – $50 million portfolios. Applications are due March 3, 2026, by 5:00 p.m.

Industry Transformation Path: A Closer Look

The new Industry Transformation Path is a unique grant program designed to encourage collaboration between stakeholders in an effort to transform a regional economy through targeted industry development. Key features of the Industry Transformation Path include:

Multi-Project Design: Each application should propose 3–5 coordinated construction and/or non-construction projects that together will help transform a regional economy. For example, to accelerate the regional food processing industry, a project portfolio might include: (1) building a regional food processing facility, (2) acquiring equipment for job training, (3) expanding transportation infrastructure to move goods, and (4) developing a workforce training program.

Coalition Approach: Applications must identify a coalition of key stakeholders, including at least one private sector partner. Not all coalition members must be on the list of eligible applicants, but the application must be submitted by an eligible applicant (see below for list of eligible applicants).

Flexible Use of Funds: The funding may be used to support a variety of construction or non-construction projects, provided the projects satisfy one of the following criteria: (1) mitigate or prevent the impacts of future disasters, (2) replace, repair, or upgrade critical public infrastructure damaged or destroyed by a declared disaster, or (3) diversify and transform local economies through the development or acceleration of industries.

Investment and Policy Commitments: Applicants are required to secure investment and/or policy commitments before applying. These may include direct funding to support component projects (not already counted as a match); in-kind contributions, including staff time, use of lab or office space, or software; or policy commitments, such as an industry commitment to place trained workers, private-sector commitments to recruit in areas damaged by a disaster, data sharing agreements, and more. See Appendix II of the NOFO for an example commitment letter.

Who is an eligible applicant?

To qualify, the proposed project must be located in, primarily serve, or demonstrably benefit one or more communities that received a Major Disaster Declaration for disaster events in 2023 or 2024. Applications for funding must be submitted by an eligible applicant, which includes:

States, counties, cities, or other political subdivisions of a state,

Indian tribes

District organizations

Economic development organizations

Institutions of higher education

Public and private non-profits working in cooperation with local government, and

Public-private partnerships for public infrastructure.

Individuals and for-profit entities are not eligible to apply for funding but may be included in a coalition of stakeholders for projects submitted under the Industry Transformation Path.

Matching Requirements

EDA generally expects to fund up to 80% of eligible project costs. Accordingly, applicants must be prepared to provide a 20% match. For the Readiness and Implementation paths, the EDA may cover up to 100% of eligible costs for Tribal or severely distressed applicants. For the Industry Transformation Path, matching funds may be distributed across projects. Applicants must submit matching share letters (or equivalent documents) that clearly describe the amount, source, and type of all matching share funds proposed under an award. Specific match and documentation requirements are detailed in the program’s FAQs.

Must applicants apply for the Readiness Path first?

No. Applicants are not required to apply for the Readiness Path before applying for the Implementation or Industry Transformation paths. Eligible applicants may apply for the Readiness Path alone or may apply concurrently with different and distinct projects for each funding path. Applicants should not apply for the same project under different funding paths.

Application Deadlines

Readiness and Implementation Paths: Accepted on a rolling basis.

Industry Transformation Path: Due March 3, 2026, at 5:00 p.m.

Due to high demand, the EDA encourages applicants to submit proposals as soon as they are ready.

Applications must be submitted online through EDA’s EDGE portal: Required materials are detailed in Section D.2 of the Notice of Funding Opportunity.

Speaking on a call with analysts after General Motors reported earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations, CFO Paul Jacobson said clean-air regulations were encouraging some of the Detroit automaker's rivals to unload their EVs at bargain-basement prices.

""We had a number of competitors out there that really were selling EVs for whatever they could get for them, because they really wanted to get the credits on the environmental side. So we do think it will be a more stable environment,"" Jacobson said.

Under a regulatory scheme dismantled by the Trump administration earlier this year, automakers faced fines if they failed to generate enough regulatory credits from selling EVs or buy them from electric-only companies like Tesla.

Jacobson said that electric vehicle demand will likely be ""pretty choppy"" for the near future, after the $7,500 federal tax credit for new US-made EVs expired in September.

GM once had ambitious plans to sell only EVs by 2035, but the company took a $1.6 billion charge this quarter following its electric vehicle strategy overhaul.

Like other automakers, the Chevrolet-owner has scaled back its EV plans and invested in combustion-engine vehicles after the Trump administration rolled back federal support for electric cars.

So, while battery engineers, automakers, and other manufacturers can leverage years of battery manufacturing expertise to avoid potential manufacturing pitfalls, it is a bit like starting all over again.
This requires creating electrolytes with advanced materials, materials that are only available in small commercial quantities, or using advanced fabrication techniques not used in Li-ion manufacturing—because creating solid electrolytes is more complex than conventional electrolytes.
New infrastructure needed for ASSBs The material fabrication requirements of ASSBs necessitate new infrastructure investment beyond what is used in Li-ion battery manufacturing today.
This extra cost is also a barrier to ASSBs as it compounds with the extra material costs.","High-powered electronics require high energy storage densities, fast charging requirements, long lifespans, and high safety, all in a battery package that is not cost-prohibitive. Over the years, the demands to improve these properties have only increased, and one battery architecture that has often been mentioned to solve these challenges is all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs).

ASSBs are seen as a safer option to Li-ion batteries in high-power applications because the liquid/gel electrolyte is replaced with a solid material, which is less likely to undergo thermal runaway, catch fire, or explode. ASSBs can also last for longer charge-discharge cycles and possess higher theoretical energy densities than Li-ion batteries. ASSBs being developed today are also lithium-based (commonly using sulfide-based or oxide-based electrolytes), but other materials, such as sodium, could be used in the future as well.

While Li-ion batteries are continually improving, ASSBs potentially offer a way to change the status quo. While it’s not something that will be feasible for all technology systems, smaller ASSB cells are ideal for medical devices. In contrast, larger ASSB battery packs could help to develop longer-range and faster-charging electric vehicles (EVs). EVs are also the biggest target market for ASSBs.

While there are not yet large battery packs in large-scale commercial production, there are some dedicated solid-state battery companies that are producing smaller ASSBs, and many automakers, from BMW to Volkswagen, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, and Tesla are saying that they plan to incorporate ASSBs into their vehicles in the coming years. However, while there are still multiple technical and supply chain challenges that remain before we see widespread adoption, different organizations are looking to try and solve these challenges and bring ASSBs to mass market.

Current challenges of solid-state battery scaling

Despite the potential for ASSBs, there are still many challenges that persist. Li-ion battery manufacturing has been the status quo for so long that it has proven materials mined in such large quantities that costs are now low, manufacturing equipment that is made on large scales, and a dedicated global supply chain. However, ASSBs don’t have this. So, while battery engineers, automakers, and other manufacturers can leverage years of battery manufacturing expertise to avoid potential manufacturing pitfalls, it is a bit like starting all over again.

For ASSBs, new electrolytes need to be developed that are high performing, safe, and cheap enough to manufacture on large scales. This requires creating electrolytes with advanced materials, materials that are only available in small commercial quantities, or using advanced fabrication techniques not used in Li-ion manufacturing—because creating solid electrolytes is more complex than conventional electrolytes. This increases the cost and complexity of ASSB manufacturing. This also has an impact on the scalability of ASSBs, as higher costs and more complexity make it harder to scale to large volumes.

On the material side, there are more processing steps to ensure that the solid electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity, chemical stability, thermal stability and mechanical strength. This is because ASSBs are susceptible to interfacial instability where the electrodes meet the electrolyte. Interfacial instability causes unfavorable reactions to occur at the electrode-electrolyte interface, forming resistive layers. This increases the internal resistance of the cell and reduces the ion transport across the cell. Additionally, any mechanical issues at this interface can cause the solid electrolyte to crack due to the electrode experiencing volumetric changes under normal cycling conditions. So, ensuring that all these potential material issues are not present requires a lot more advanced fabrication techniques that are not used in conventional Li-ion manufacturing.

From a cost perspective, the materials used are currently expensive and not available in large quantities. With higher raw material process scaling, the cost of ASSBs should come down. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration in China recently released a report stating that the cost of sulfide electrolytes is five times that of liquid electrolytes and will require 100,000 metric tons of sulfide production, plus dedicated recycling systems, to bring the costs down. This is roughly in line with what academic researchers are stating, with the material and manufacturing complexities driving up the cost of ASSBs by around 30% compared to Li-ion batteries (based on ‘per kWh’ benchmarks).

New infrastructure needed for ASSBs

The material fabrication requirements of ASSBs necessitate new infrastructure investment beyond what is used in Li-ion battery manufacturing today. This extra cost is also a barrier to ASSBs as it compounds with the extra material costs.

Most solid-state electrolytes are composed of multiple thin film layers, which need to be defect-free to ensure that they have the requisite properties, densification, and interface stability. This takes more time under controlled process conditions—using advanced deposition techniques such as physical vapor deposition (PVD) or atomic layer deposition (ALD), and advanced layer pressing techniques—to ensure that the layers have a specific thickness, uniformity, and purity.

These controlled processes require a lot of extra fabrication equipment to meet these requirements. They also require highly robust quality control processes to ensure product quality using advanced analysis techniques that can effectively assess the quality of the thin solid electrolyte layers.

On top of these requirements, solid-state electrolytes need to be processed in dedicated dry-room facilities, as they are susceptible to moisture contamination that can cause rapid deterioration of the battery. This is another reason that tight process controls need to be in place throughout ASSB manufacturing.

Dry battery electrode (DBE) methods have become a promising approach for ASSBs, as this eliminates the needs for solvents during manufacturing and reduces the chance of solid electrolytes having residual moisture in the cell due to inefficient drying steps. It also has fewer steps and lower energy costs, so it could be more feasible for cutting costs down. It is an approach with a lot of commercial potential and is already being adopted by companies such as Tesla. Looking to the future, it may also be possible to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to optimize material choices and manufacturing parameters, whereas additive manufacturing could potentially become another layer-by-layer manufacturing method for producing complex solid-state electrolytes.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt8fb84bdf380093b9/656781a9b5c873040a464c81/Solid_state_batteries.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-21 12:23:50.325193

LG’s battery plant for the Hyundai Metaplant was disrupted by an immigration raid with several Korean workers deported.
The original Model T certainly transformed vehicle production and introduced the first modern, moving assembly line, since when vehicle production lines have undergone radical evolution and reshaping, e.g.","The application of tariffs has upended long established norms in trade policy and exerted greater influence on which vehicles are being produced and where they are made for the US market, this as the automotive industry continues with the challenging transition to EVs. In addition, the investment and manufacturing trajectory for EVs in the US has also been upended by policies of emanating from the second Trump presidency. Under the Biden administration, numerous policies, embodied in the somewhat misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, encouraged significant investment electric vehicle and battery production. The payback, in terms of increased EV production and sales, was designed to be achieved through tax rebates for consumers at the point of purchase of the EV. Whether the incentives were not enough, or consumers just were not ready to make the switch wholesale to electric powertrains (reflecting US consumers’ love for traditional ICE powertrains), the second Trump presidency has helped bring the switch to EVs if not to a halt, then to a much lower level of market penetration. The current US government has also decided to exempt car companies from fines if they fail to meet emissions rules set by the previous administration; the regulatory push to EVs has, it is clear, stalled.

EV battery production volumes revised

In turn this has begun to impact investment in battery plants, with reduced battery capacity required for the lower number of EVs now expected to be built in the next few years. For example, GM has recently said that it needs only three battery plants, rather than four it had planned. It has sold a site to LG but will retain two joint venture sites with LG, operating under the Ultium brand, as well as continuing with a JV plant with Samsung. LG itself has delayed a new battery plant in Arizona until H1/2026; this US$5.5 billion plant is due to supply Tesla and Rivian. LG’s battery plant for the Hyundai Metaplant was disrupted by an immigration raid with several Korean workers deported. The removal of these skilled workers who were apparently setting up the new production lines will delay the start of battery production there by several months. Meanwhile Ford has put one of three two battery plants it had planned for its Kentucky operations on indefinite hold. Battery factory construction continues in Michigan where Ford is investing US$3 billion to make 20 GWH of lithium iron phosphate batteries, around 40% lower than originally planned.

BMW – or rather its battery partner AESC – has paused construction of a new US$1.6 billion cell factory in South Carolina, although the factory will likely produce cells from other vehicle companies. BMW is understood to be considering sourcing cells from China instead (despite the potential tariff of up to 82% on Chinese cells) but will assemble batteries itself in its own new facility near to the Spartanburg vehicle plant. Further south, in Georgia, Hyundai continues with plans for two battery factories, to be operated by LG, close to the Hyundai Metaplant factory. The two battery plants will each have a capacity for producing enough batteries for 300,000 EVs, with production due to start during the first half of 2026; originally the first plant was due to have started production in late 2025.

The transatlantic carmaker's largest-ever domestic commitment signals a decisive pivot towards US production, promising five new vehicles and 5,000 jobs as it pursues a 50% capacity expansion across the industrial Midwest.

Stellantis has been investing more than US$6 billion in two battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana, in a joint venture with Samsung. The first factory, a 23GWH plant, began production earlier this year; the second bigger 34 GWH plant is due to start production in 2027 but could be delayed. Toyota meanwhile is already producing hybrid batteries in a new factory in Liberty, North Carolina where it is investing US$13.9 billion. This facility will reportedly have 14 assembly lines for producing lithium-ion batteries of BEVs, PHEVs and HEVs. This plant will also supply Lexus models made in Canada and Honda hybrids made in the US. Volkswagen meanwhile is still planning to build a US$7 billion battery factory in Ontario, but production is not due to start until 2027. The first vehicles to be supplied from this plant will likely be the Scout EVs which Volkswagen will make in South Carolina. Another Chinese company, Gotion, was due to build a battery plant in Michigan but this was paused in mid-2025 after the local government withdrew support for the factory.

Ford invests in a new low-cost EV platform

In 2022, Ford set up what it called a “skunks works” in California, with the aim of completely revising how the company produced vehicles as the industry headed into the EV era. The team was charged with designing a cheaper and more flexible manufacturing system compared to prevailing manufacturing orthodoxies. The first results of this programme were announced in August, in the form of the Ford Universal EV Platform (FUEVP). The first vehicle produced off this platform is planned to be an electric pick-up truck at the Louisville Assembly plant in Kentucky, due in 2027. This factory is receiving investment of around US$2 billion. Ford plans for this to retail at US$30,000, while offering more space and utility than the Toyota RAV4 the Ford engineers used as a benchmark. Other body styles for other segments will follow, inside and outside the US.

EVs made on the FUEVP will use LFP batteries, with prismatic cells, which will be made in the new battery factory which Ford is building in Michigan. More significantly, the manufacturing process for FUEVP vehicles at the revamped Louisville Assembly plant will differ from manufacturing set-ups used by Ford until now. In the revamped Louisville layout, the three main parts of the vehicle platform, the front, the rear and the middle (which is where the battery sits), will be made on three individual parallel lines. They will then be brought together in the final stages of the assembly line. Ford claims that the set-up will be shorter than a conventional line, requiring 40% fewer workstations, and will also mean a quicker assembly time, producing vehicles in 15% less time than on a conventional existing line. In fact, some Ford press material suggests that the new vehicles will put together 40% more quickly than the time required for the Escape and Corsair which are currently produce in Louisville.

The new assembly line and factory plans will employ 2,200 workers, versus the current set-up’s 2,800; reportedly there will be no mandatory redundancies, and the 600 otherwise redundant workers will be offered contract buy-outs or comparable positions at the nearby Kentucky Truck plant, also in Louisville.

Blue Oval investment cutback

Tariffs redraw North American auto manufacturing map

From BMW to Nissan, automakers are shifting assembly lines to the US to avoid steep tariffs – while Canadian and Mexican operations face uncertain futures. Here's how tariffs are reshaping the industry's landscape.

While investment at Louisville proceeds, it is worth noting that investment at Ford’s large all-new Blue Oval vehicle plant in Tennessee has been cut back, with the first new vehicles due to be made there now delayed until 2028 at the earliest. The Tennessee factory had been due to receive investment of nearly US$11 billion for both vehicle and battery production and in the surrounding supply chain. The total to be invested here will likely now be lower, although it is not clear by how much it will be reduced. Ford will no doubt hope that the delay until 2028 may be just that, a delay. However, there must be some concern that the general slowdown in EV take-up across the US and the reduction in and withdrawal of incentives for EV adoption which the Biden administration had introduced will mean that more delays and reduced investment in this project are possible.

Returning to the FUEVP, there are some notable numbers surrounding the project. For example, the first vehicle will use wiring harnesses which will be 1.3 kms shorter than in those on current Ford models. The programme has also been designed to require 25% fewer fasteners through the use of large gigacastings for the three core parts. The LFP batteries planned for this programme, and indeed for most future Ford EVs, are expected to be at least 20% cheaper than the nickel-cobalt-manganese batteries which Ford has used until now.

The company has gone as far as to call the new platform something like a modern-day Model T moment. The original Model T certainly transformed vehicle production and introduced the first modern, moving assembly line, since when vehicle production lines have undergone radical evolution and reshaping, e.g. with the Toyota Production System (TPS) or Tesla’s (and others’) adoption of the gigacasting approach. Ford’s approach with the FUEVP takes on board many of the ideas tried by Tesla (which is not surprising given the number of ex-Tesla executives running the programme) and adopt them to the new platform. However, it remains to be seen if the new platform is as transformative as the Model T was when it was launched.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/1597972.jpg?imageId=1597972&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-10-21 11:21:30.388245

Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin yesterday announced that the company, known as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada, will use the facility as a Center of Excellence for Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Small Molecule Manufacturing.

The project will include active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product investment, supporting small-molecule manufacturing and testing. Once completed, the expansion will generate 500 jobs.

The company's new pharmaceutical Center of Excellence will be in addition to the company's existing operations in Elkton, Virginia.

The announcement is a significant increase beyond the original project scope of a $2 billion investment and 300 jobs. Merck recently committed some $70 billion to domestic R&D and capital projects.

Merck has a near 85-year history in the Shenandoah Valley.

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership secured the project with Rockingham County and the Shenandoah Valley Partnership. The governor approved a $5 million Virginia Investment Performance grant, an incentive encouraging continued capital investment from companies operating in the state. Merc will also receive a $4 million grant from the Commonwealth's Opportunity Fund to assist Rockingham County with the project.

Merck will also receive support from the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program. Created by VEDP, the program provides training and recruitment solutions customized to a company's unique operations, equipment, standards and culture. All program services are free to qualified new and expanding companies.

President Donald Trump has previously threatened tariffs of 200% or more on pharmaceuticals to motivate drugmakers to increase the domestic supply chain. Companies have outsourced manufacturing operations to China and India to take advantage of a cheaper labor market as well as Ireland and Switzerland, incentivized by tax breaks in the region.

Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson have also announced significant U.S. expansion plans.

The 25 New York grants that were axed were part of the Department of Energy's cancellation of $7.6 billion in total funding destined for work around the U.S. The department said it was pulling back those 321 grants awarded by the Biden administration after concluding they didn't meet the country's energy needs or weren't ""economically viable.""

Many of the jilted grant recipients in New York were businesses, such as Hudson Valley-based tech giant IBM and a Westchester County company that makes a cement substitute out of ground glass. Others included a pair of government agencies; academic centers like Cornell University and City University of New York; and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in an Oct. 2 statement about the grant revocation. ""Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment.""

Which New York projects lost funding?

Gov. Kathy Hochul later released a list of New York's canceled grants and blasted the Trump administration for the harm she said that lost funding would cause.

“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state's economic progress,"" she said.

The biggest canceled grants by far on Hochul's list were two totaling $147 million for Plug Power, a company that's creating hydrogen fuel cells outside Rochester in West Henrietta. (Another hydrogen business in the same area also lost funding: a $5 million grant promised to Ionomr Innovations, located four miles from Plug Power.)

In a statement to the USA Today Network about the lost grants, Plug Power CEO Andy Marsh said the company was focused ""on the future"" and its growing electrolyzer and fuel cell businesses in Europe, Australia and the U.S. He noted it had just raised $370 million in capital, ""reinforcing our strong financial position.”

""While government support has been helpful along the way, our long-term success is driven by the strong global demand for our solutions,"" Marsh said.

In the Hudson Valley, revoked funding included a $37 million grant for Urban Mining Industries, a New Rochelle-based company that turns recycled glass into a concrete component without the planet-warming gases that are created when making cement. The company had announced in December that the funding would be used to build two new plants for its cement replacement — known as Pozzitive — in Florida and Maryland.

Elsewhere in Westchester, Armonk-based IBM and a group of project partners lost nearly $20 million they were given to explore new ways to track methane leaks from oil and gas pipelines and wells — a big source of greenhouse gases. That grant also was announced in December and was meant to fund work in western states over nearly four years.

Can the funding be restored?

Wright said the Energy Department reviewed ""billions of dollars in financial awards,"" much of it ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.” Some $3.1 billion — about 40% of the revoked funding — was awarded in the two months between when President Donald Trump was elected last November and when he took office in January, the department said.

Recipients whose grants were rescinded have 30 days to appeal the decision, and some already have, federal officials said.

Doreen Harris, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, cast the funding cuts as an economic setback for the state, saying they put ""thousands of good-paying jobs at risk while harming the momentum of New York's clean energy industry.""

In a letter to shareholders, General Motors’ CEO, Mary Barra, said she expects the company to incur future charges related to EVs.
“By acting swiftly and decisively to address overcapacity, we expect to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond,” she said.
“I also want to thank the President and his team for the important tariff updates they made on Friday.
Other automakers, including Hyundai and Stellantis, are offering incentives to slash the prices consumers pay for their EVs.","General Motors lifted its financial outlook for the year and slightly lowered its expected hit from tariffs, as the automaker awaits expected relief on tariffs in the US while confronting a weakening market for electric vehicles.

The company now expects its annual adjusted core profit to be between $12bn and $13bn, compared with its prior estimate of $10bn to $12.5bn. The Detroit automaker said tariffs would hit its bottom line less than anticipated, lowering its updated impact to a range of $3.5bn to $4.5bn, from a previous $4bn to $5bn.

The auto giant earlier this month took a $1.6bn charge from changes to its EV strategy. At the end of September, a $7,500 tax credit on battery-powered models went away, and there has been further loosening of regulations around vehicle emissions.

In a letter to shareholders, General Motors’ CEO, Mary Barra, said she expects the company to incur future charges related to EVs. “By acting swiftly and decisively to address overcapacity, we expect to reduce EV losses in 2026 and beyond,” she said.

Revenue for the quarter ending in September marginally fell to $48.6bn from a year earlier.

US car sales have stayed strong despite uncertainty around the tariffs, rising 6% in the third quarter. While automakers have largely avoided raising sticker prices to offset their tariff costs, American car shoppers have continued to opt for pricier models and added features.

GM said it plans to mitigate 35% of its anticipated tariff hit. There is relief on the horizon for many US automakers, after Donald Trump approved an order to expand credits for US auto and engine production, allowing companies to receive a credit equal to 3.75% of the suggested retail price for US-assembled vehicles through 2030 to offset import tariffs on parts.

“I also want to thank the President and his team for the important tariff updates they made on Friday. The MSRP offset program will help make US-produced vehicles more competitive over the next five years,” Barra said in a letter to shareholders.

Global companies have flagged more than $35bn in costs from US tariffs heading into third-quarter earnings.

Investors are still waiting on trade deals to be ironed out with Mexico and Canada, analysts noted, as well as with South Korea, a major exporter of cars for GM.

Automakers have been ramping up US investments to offset Trump’s levies. GM

announced in June that it would invest $4bn at three US facilities in Michigan, Kansas, and Tennessee. The automaker imports about half of the vehicles it sells in the US, mainly from Mexico and South Korea.

Stellantis earlier this month said it plans to invest $13bn in the US over the next four years.

Barra in 2021 announced the company’s ambition to produce only EVs by 2035, a goal she has since stopped referencing publicly, instead saying customer demand will guide the automaker’s lineup.

Sales of EVs were strong for GM and across the industry in the third quarter as shoppers raced to take advantage of the tax credit, but they still comprised less than 10% of the company’s overall sales.

To spur consumer demand, GM planned to offer a program that would have allowed its dealers to continue offering the tax credit on EV leases. It has since backtracked on the initiative following backlash from lawmakers, including Bernie Moreno, a Republican senator for Ohio and a former car dealer.

Ford also scrapped its program with the same aim. Other automakers, including Hyundai and Stellantis, are offering incentives to slash the prices consumers pay for their EVs.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ded208c9198d23b7cfd3e7eef6000a03aebc2fe/308_0_3818_3054/master/3818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d34ddd424230543858a053955537b47e",N,,2025-10-21 12:03:00.345319

Freetown, 21 October 2025: The Salone Off-Grid Renewable Energy Acceleration (SOGREA) Initiative today officially launched its Investment Support Windows, a crucial mechanism set to catalyse private sector investment in Green Mini-Grids (GMGs).

Funded by the European Union (EU) and implemented by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), with its hosted entity Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), in partnership with the Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL), the initiative features an indicative total of €22 million in catalytic investment support incentivizing private developers/operators to develop, finance, build, own, and operate mini-grids across rural Sierra Leone. This funding is aimed directly at supporting the Government of Sierra Leone’s drive towards financially sustainable electrification of the country’s rural areas by attracting new private investments into the GMG sector.

The SOGREA Milestone-triggered CapEx Investment Support provides partial financial support to private entities to cover a portion of the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) for developing new GMGs and upgrading existing ones. This investment is designed not only to expand connections but also to help reduce electricity tariffs. Thanks to the Government of Sierra Leone’s reforms of the mini-grid sector by introducing state-of-the-art mini-grid regulations and a robust mechanism for tariff setting, SOGREA investment support will simultaneously help to bridge the gap between the tariffs that would be needed to cover the cost of supplying mini-grid energy and the tariffs that households can afford.

The GOSL views this investment as central to creating a conducive, sustainable environment for private sector engagement, emphasising that clear, simple and reliably enforced regulations are critical to attracting both donor and private capital for accelerated electrification.

Dr Kandeh Yumkella, Chairman of the Presidential Initiative on Climate Change, Renewable Energy and Food Security (PI-CREF), and Chairman Energy Governance Coordination Group (EGCG): ""This €22 million investment support marks a pivotal moment in our drive toward universal energy access. It provides the necessary leverage to unlock significant private sector capital. By lowering the investment risk and ultimately reducing the tariff burden on our citizens, we are not just lighting up homes; we are powering economic growth and social development. The GOSL is fully committed to the success of this transparent and impact-focused partnership.""

Ambassador Jacek Jankowski, Head of the EU Delegation in Sierra Leone, said: “The European Union is proud to support the SOGREA Initiative, which aligns perfectly with our commitment to sustainable development, universal energy access, and climate action. The SOGREA Investment Support directly addresses the critical financing gap for green mini-grids, which are crucial for providing energy access in remote and underserved communities. This targeted grant support is a wise investment that will help Sierra Leone develop a resilient, decentralised, and clean energy future for its citizens.”

Crucially, the investment operates under a rigorous reimbursement mechanism. Payments are strictly tied to the achievement of specific, predetermined milestones such as ""Equipment arrives on site,"" ""GMG commissioned,"" and ""GMG certified to operate"", ensuring high standards and accountability. This phased payment approach is supported by verification from reputable third-party service providers and on-site checks, confirming progress before any funds are released.

Silvia Gallo, UNOPS West Africa Multi-Country Office Director, stated: “UNOPS is committed to the transparent and efficient administration of the SOGREA investments. Our system of phased, milestone-triggered payments, alongside robust third-party and on-site verification, promotes accountability and ensures that public funds deliver maximum impact. We are utilising systems, including SEforALL’s UEF web-based IT portal, to monitor progress, verify connections via smart meters, and uphold the integrity and credibility of the entire project.”

The initiative builds on the success of prior projects, highlighting the power of robust public-private partnerships in delivering tangible results, and focuses on both infrastructure development and strengthening the governance and financing of the renewable energy sector.

Anita Otubu, Senior Director of the Universal Energy Facility, Sustainable Energy for All: “Through the integration of the Universal Energy Facility (UEF) funding windows into SOGREA, SEforALL is extending its proven model for accelerating energy access. The UEF's operating procedures and secure IT portal will ensure a streamlined and transparent process for private sector partners. This collaboration is designed to scale up the deployment of quality green mini-grids infrastructure quickly, bringing power to grassroots communities and transforming lives in Sierra Leone.”

Communities and civil society are the critical beneficiaries and stakeholders who ensure inclusivity for youth, women, and vulnerable groups. But the lights won't stay on without capital. Private Sector companies are encouraged to invest now in Sierra Leone's green mini-grids to drive sustainable energy access, unlock rural economic growth, and secure an inclusive, electrified future. Green mini-grid investment is the spark that powers national development.

About The Universal Energy Facility (UEF)

The Universal Energy Facility (UEF), a multi-donor fund managed by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), was established in 2020 to accelerate and scale up energy access across Sub-Saharan Africa and beyond, in line with SDG7 and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The UEF provides incentive payments to clean energy companies deploying energy solutions and providing verified end-user electricity connections (via mini-grids and stand-alone solar systems) and clean cooking solutions based on pre-determined service standards.

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.
Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.
“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.
In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.","A Louisiana judge has tossed out a key permit for a liquefied natural gas facility that won approval from President Donald Trump’s administration, ordering a state review of how the facility’s planet-warming emissions would affect Gulf Coast communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and extreme weather.

Last week, a judge from Louisiana’s 38th Judicial District Court effectively halted construction of Commonwealth LNG by ordering state regulators to analyze the facility’s climate change and environmental justice-related impacts, in conjunction with the broader LNG buildout in southwest Louisiana’s Cameron Parish.

Three of the nation’s eight existing LNG export terminals are located in Cameron Parish, and several more are proposed or under construction there.

Louisiana’s attorney general vowed to appeal the ruling, which vacated the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s coastal use permit for the facility.

“This is the first time any court has vacated a permit for an LNG facility based on the government’s refusal to consider climate change impacts,” said Clay Garside, an attorney representing the Sierra Club and other environmental groups.

Earlier this year, Trump reversed a Biden-era pause on exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of his goal to boost natural gas exports and promote “energy dominance.”

Last year, the Biden administration’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s had warned that “unfettered exports” of liquefied natural gas would increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions — a statement reflecting the findings of a Department of Energy report released in December.

Trump-appointed Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has moved to fast-track the buildout of LNG facilities, including Commonwealth LNG, which received an export authorization within weeks of Trump’s inauguration.

“Cameron Parish is ground zero for the relentless expansion of the gas export industry,” said Anne Rolfes, founder of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, an environmental group involved in the litigation. “We’re going to stop it and this is an important step in that process.”

Lyle Hanna, a Commonwealth LNG spokesperson, said that “we are disappointed with the District Court’s decision, and we are exploring all available legal options.”

A spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy declined to comment, citing the potential of pending litigation. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said that the state planned to appeal.

“Sadly even state court judges are not immune from climate activism,” Murrill said.

Last year, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., had ordered the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reassess Commonwealth LNG’s air pollution, including its greenhouse gas emissions. In June, the commission gave the project a greenlight on the grounds that its construction was in the public interest.

In regulatory filings, the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy said that “climate change is currently beyond the scope” of the state’s regulatory review.

But District Judge Penelope Richard rejected this position, saying state environmental regulators have a duty to consider how the LNG facility, along with others clustered nearby, would impact extreme weather events, storm severity and sea-level rise in a state where a football field-worth of land disappears every 100 minutes.

Richard also ordered state regulators to analyze the facility’s impacts on local communities, especially those living in poverty or relying on fishing for their livelihoods — which she noted was the “defining characteristic” of the parish. While the facility could destroy marshes, harm water quality and displace residents, the judge wrote, “none of it was considered in terms of impacts on environmental justice communities.”

Commercial fisherman Eddie LeJuine, a lifelong Cameron Parish resident, applauded the ruling. He said the buildout of LNG infrastructure, including dredging for shipping channels, has significantly harmed the fishing industry.

“The fishermen are barely hanging on with a thread,” LeJuine said. “These plants are killing the estuary and killing our livelihoods. We’re getting extinct.”

In August, a dredging channel being developed by LNG firm Venture Global leaked into a nearby estuary. Local fishermen like LeJuine say the onslaught of saltwater and sediment will kill off large amounts of oyster, crab and fish.

Venture Global, which is in the process of constructing a second LNG export terminal in the parish, said it is “committed to conservation” and is working with state regulators and the community to respond to the incident.

For too long, parts of the clean energy sector have been a union-free zone.
“We were also interested to see the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, published this week.
“GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions and their members will be at the heart of this.
The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.","Plans to increase the UK clean energy workforce have been launched by the government, which it says will see 860,000 “high quality and well paid” roles filled by 2030.

The sectors to be boosted include renewable energy, nuclear, carbon capture and storage and hydrogen. The government said the new jobs are needed to enable it to deliver on its mission to decarbonise the economy.

It was not immediately clear how much of the public spending proposed in the Clean energy jobs plan, published on 19 October 2025, amounts to new expenditure, but the proposal was supported publicly by a long list of ministers, trade unions, energy companies, trade associations and skills and educational institutions.

Up to 2,499 new civil engineering jobs by 2030

The government said the plan is the “first ever national plan to recruit workers needed for clean energy mission” and identified “31 priority occupations such as plumbers, electricians and welders” which it said are “particularly in deman..”

Government figures showed that it believed the number of people working as “plumbers and heating and ventilating installers and repairers” should increase by between 8,500 and 10,000 from 2023 to 2030.

The number of electricians and electrical fitters should increase by between 7,000 and 8,499 across the same period, whereas there are only up to 2,499 more welders needed.

It said the number of civil engineers should increase by between 1,000 and 2,499 by 2030, which would be more than double the number of civil engineers working in 2023.

£1.2bn per year for skills development and five energy colleges

The jobs plan said that to deliver the proposed uplift in jobs, the government would “align the skills system and employment support to our Industrial Strategy sectors, including clean energy industries”.

“The government is providing an additional £1.2bn per year to support skills development over the course of the parliament, which includes funding for 1.3M 16-19 year-olds to access training, supporting an additional 65,000 learners per year,” it added.

The current parliament could last up to five years from the last general election on 4 July 2024, meaning the government is only initially committing to spending the £1.2bn until as late as July 2029.

The plan also said the government would “invest over £100M into the Engineering Skills Package to support engineering skills in clean energy occupations as well as other priority sectors, including £10M to support the provision of engineering T Levels and Higher Education Providers offering clean energy engineering courses at levels 4-5”.

Another highlighted mechanism for achieving the 400,000 new jobs is by creating “five Clean Energy Technical Excellence Colleges (TECs) to specialise in training skilled clean energy workforces for local and national businesses, in addition to the ten Construction TECs already confirmed”.

The report also said the government has created a new organisation within the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) called the Office for Clean Energy Jobs (OCEJ), despite commitments from ministers to cut down on the number of quangos (quasi-autonomous non-government organisations).

Government pushing for more unionisation of the workforce

In his foreword for the plan, DESNZ secretary of state Ed Miliband said: “Our government is clear that trade unions are an essential part of a modern workplace. For too long, parts of the clean energy sector have been a union-free zone.

“I am delighted that over the last 12 months, workers have won union recognition at employers like EDF power solutions UK and Great British Energy – Nuclear, but there is much further to go—which is why we are committed to promoting union recognition and collective bargaining across the sector.

“This is good for workers and good for businesses, helping to improve job satisfaction, retention and productivity in the workplace.”

The government also said that “across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70% in the mid 90s to around 30% today. Recognising trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.”

Energy giant executives welcome promotion of unionised jobs

Centrica chief executive Chris O’Shea said: “We have committed to creating a new apprenticeship for every day of this decade. These new secure, skilled, well-paid jobs are key to unlocking the economic growth the UK so desperately needs.

“Clean energy isn’t simply about new technology – it’s about renewing purpose and harnessing the skills and infrastructure that have served us for decades to power the next chapter.

“I’m proud Centrica has the largest unionised workforce in UK energy and services, and we are delighted to welcome the government’s Clean Jobs Plan as a vital step in recognising the skills, protections and careers that must underpin the energy transition.”

ScottishPower CEO Keith Anderson said: “Thanks to the clear direction set out by the government’s Clean Power 2030 Mission, we’re investing at record levels in the clean electricity infrastructure the UK needs for energy security and economic growth.

“Our £24bn investment plan is creating thousands of job opportunities. We’re recruiting for good, well-paid skilled jobs at record levels. We’re welcoming 300 new recruits in the last three months of 2025 alone and aim to bring on another 2,000 jobs up to 2027.

“Many of these jobs are in the communities that we serve in Scotland, England and Wales. This is on top of the benefits for local supply chain businesses across the country from our commitment to domestic procurement that currently supports 70,000 jobs in the UK supply chain.”

EDF power solutions UK CEO Matthieu Hue said: “We welcome the plan which brings clarity on the scale of the opportunity for people across the UK to work in high quality jobs which will contribute to our electric future.

“EDF power solutions has 2GW of wind, solar and battery in operation and our goal is to have five times that amount by 2035, so we will need many more skilled people to help us reach our ambition.

“Our partnership with four trade unions, GMB, Prospect, Unison and Unite shows our commitment to working together with them to grow our business.”

National Grid group chief engineer Zac Richardson said: “Secure, affordable and clean energy is essential to unlocking UK economic growth and productivity – ambitions which are underpinned by electricity networks and the unprecedented levels of planned investment in them.

“We welcome the government’s focus on skills and training – especially for technical roles vital to our energy future – and look forward to working together to build a diverse, homegrown workforce that can deliver the grid of tomorrow.”

Jobs plan welcomed by energy industry trade associations

EngineeringUK head of policy and public affairs Beatrice Barleon said: “We are pleased to see the publication of the long-awaited post-16 Education and Skills White Paper.

“We cautiously welcome the announcement of V Levels, designed to work alongside A Levels and T Levels. This signals a promising step towards strengthening work-focused training for young people in key sectors like engineering and technology. Government must ensure that this new qualification is recognised and supported by employers and further and higher education institutions and will lead to meaningful outcomes for both young people and employers. And it is vital that any subsequent changes are followed by a period of stability, with young people, employers and providers alike crying out for some clarity.

“The confirmation of the government ambition for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher level learning by age of 25 is also welcome, as is the data driven approach that will drive investment in education and training in growth sectors. It is vital, however, that the focus on getting more young people trained at Levels 4 and 5 does not distract from the need to increase apprenticeship opportunities for young people at Levels 2 and 3. These serve as important entry routes into the engineering and technology sector.

“We were also interested to see the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, published this week. The plan makes it very clear that the UK needs a coherent strategy as to how to meet growing workforce demand, and the White Paper provides some clarity of direction and the funding available to achieve this. We welcome the confirmation of a £182M investment in engineering sector skills, as well as the funding for construction skills. This is a positive step towards recognising the dependence of the Industrial Strategy growth-driving sectors (IS-8 sectors) on engineering skills and their cross-cutting nature.

“We look forward to working with government to ensure that the system delivers for growth, for young people and for engineering and technology employers alike.”

Energy Networks Association CEO Lawrence Slade said: “This plan is an important step towards accelerating the real economic benefits of the clean energy transition right around the country.

“Today network operators employ around 26,000 people and facilitate 1,500 apprenticeships, in order to maintain the safe, reliable operation of over 500,000 miles of wires and cables.

“Tomorrow, the clean energy transition will underpin new employment opportunities and economic expansion, with tens of thousands of jobs across the country needed to upgrade the grid, not just temporary positions, but long-term careers, from apprenticeships to advanced engineering roles.

“By working together on the Electricity Networks Sector Growth Plan, we will build on existing work and give industry and government the clarity and confidence needed to invest in the workforce, skills and supply chain capacity that will help drive us towards a clean power system.”

Carbon Capture and Storage Association CEO Olivia Powis said: “We welcome the Clean Jobs Plan and its recognition of the vital role CCUS and hydrogen will play in achieving the UK’s growth and decarbonisation goals while keeping industries competitive.

“Developing the necessary skills base is crucial to unlocking these sectors’ full potential and protecting thousands of existing industrial jobs.

“Establishing a dedicated Hydrogen and CCUS Skills Accelerator, in partnership with industry, marks an important step toward creating high-quality employment and ensuring a just transition for skilled workers from the North Sea.

“The CCSA looks forward to collaborating with government and partners to build the workforce powering the clean energy future.”

Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said: “This Jobs Plan shows the huge opportunity clean power offers the UK, and the vital role nuclear will play in delivering it.

“With 100,000 people already working in nuclear in good, skilled jobs across the country, new stations like Sizewell C and a fleet of SMRs will create thousands more — especially for young people — in clean and secure energy.”

‘Whole country can benefit’ from higher unionisation of workforce – unions

TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy – as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.

“Crucially, it puts decent work at the heart of our energy system. And it shows that when the government makes a plan with unions and workers, the whole country can benefit.

“Whether it’s welders in Wrexham or pipefitters on Teesside, the firm commitment to clean energy jobs being good union jobs is one which will improve working lives the country over.

“We now look forward to the government delivering a similarly robust and funded plan for the North Sea transition, which safeguards jobs and livelihoods.”

GMB national officer Charlotte Brumpton-Childs said: “GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs.

“GMB welcomes this roadmap for clean energy jobs and the cast iron expectation unions and their members will be at the heart of this.

“We need fair work agreements and taxpayers’ cash has to be spend where good jobs are going to be created. Today’s plan not only sets out that expectation but crucially, how good jobs can be measured.”

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Well-paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition. Unite members will welcome the commitment to 400,000 green jobs with strong collective bargaining rights.

“The actions set out in this plan are initial steps in what must be an ambitious strategy for tangible jobs, backed by an equally ambitious programme of public investment.”

Prospect senior deputy general secretary Sue Ferns said: “The infrastructure investment required to achieve the government’s clean energy mission must be backed by a major boost to jobs and skills.

“If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development.

“In this context is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.”

Ministers say plan will ‘unlock real opportunities’

Miliband said: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.

“Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Department for Work and Pensions secretary of state Pat McFadden said: “We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry – and will drive growth across the nation.

“Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country’s future, as part of our Plan for Change.”

Wales Office secretary of state Jo Stevens said: “Wales’s growing clean energy industry is delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future.

“Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/clean-energy-workers-wind-farm-engineer-560x315.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 11:20:50.530920

The Irvine Democrat said he is concerned by energy-related policies pushed by the Trump administration and how they impact the American economy. He said he is looking for ways the House can partner in bipartisan ways, including on his effort to reauthorize a program that compiles tools and training to help coastal communities protect their shorelines.

“By eliminating the clean energy tax credits that have spurred hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy investment — including in manufacturing — here in the U.S., President Trump is not simply shifting policy, he is also signaling to investors that they cannot rely on the U.S. government to honor its commitments, and he is effectively conceding this crucially important 21st century economic driver to China, which already far ahead of us in these industry sectors by all accounts,” said Min.

Q: As the government shutdown continues with no end in sight, what are you seeing is the biggest impact on the communities you represent? Is there a short-term fix you’d encourage while the shutdown continues?

A: I think most Americans have not yet felt the effects of the government shutdown yet, which is probably why we have not seen significant movement from President Trump and Congressional leadership on ending the shutdown yet. But federal workers just missed their first paycheck, and essential personnel are still being asked to show up to work.

I’ve talked with various federal employees, including local air traffic controllers at John Wayne Airport, and my sense is that while they are prepared to endure a few weeks of going without pay, they are not in a position to ride this out for much longer than that. I just heard a story of an air traffic controller who was driving for Uber at night to pay his bills. As this goes on, we will see more and more essential personnel stop showing up to work, and this will impact our lives, whether it’s our airline travel or receiving Social Security checks or otherwise.

At the same time, most of the people I’ve heard from are gravely concerned about the impacts of the massive cuts to health care that Republicans have pushed forward this year, including the termination of the ACA enhanced premium tax credits that they are insisting on as a condition of reopening the government. The $900 billion cuts to Medicaid, which will not take effect until 2027, are already wreaking havoc on people’s health care, with significant increases to premiums and copays already starting to be announced as insurers and providers start to account for the effects of having tens of millions more uninsured Americans. The termination of the ACA tax credits will leave an estimated 15 million additional Americans without health insurance, including 30,000 families I represent. Covered California just announced that when these tax credits are ended, the premiums for those purchasing health insurance through exchanges will increase by between 50% and 200%, hundreds or even thousands of dollars a month for the average family. No one except billionaires can afford these types of massive cost increases. Many people will have to choose between health insurance and putting food on the table. That’s wrong.

Q: As negotiations continue, is there a specific area where you see your party could come to a compromise with the other side of the aisle to move the needle closer on ending the shutdown?

A: I have been frankly disappointed by the lack of bipartisanship I’ve seen since I joined Congress. Despite the fact that I represent a very moderate area and have a demonstrated history of working across the aisle from when I was in the California State Senate, where I was known for working with my Republican colleagues, I have not once been contacted by any Republicans looking for my vote on any measures. Instead, we have seen them ram through extreme legislation over and over on a party-line vote.

Bipartisanship is a two-way street, and it requires, first and foremost, dialogue. That’s why I have repeatedly called on Speaker Mike Johnson to reopen the House, get us back to work and begin negotiations with an eye toward restoring health care access for the 15 million Americans who will lose their health care if this Republican budget bill becomes law.

Q: While federal workers don’t get paid during shutdowns, members of Congress do. Many have asked for their pay to be withheld; are you one of those members? Why or why not?

A: I am not being paid during the shutdown. While this action has forced us to start dipping into our savings, I cannot, in good conscience, collect my salary while millions of federal workers are not being paid.

Let’s be honest, members of Congress are responsible for this shutdown, and we should be going through the same pain that others are experiencing because of it. I stand with our federal workers, including TSA staff and air traffic controllers in our district, during this government shutdown.

Q: Your district includes communities that deal with the tangible impacts of climate change, erosion and rising sea levels. While Congress can’t stop climate change completely, what is something you’re pushing in Washington, D.C., to help mitigate those impacts in your district?

A: I just came back from Climate Week in New York City, where the country’s leading experts and advocates on addressing climate change gather each year to discuss next steps. There is great concern right now about the sharp policy reversals that the Trump administration and its Republican allies in Congress have pushed onto our economy.

By eliminating the clean energy tax credits that have spurred hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy investmnent — including in manufacturing — here in the U.S., President Trump is not simply shifting policy, he is also signaling to investors that they cannot rely on the U.S. government to honor its commitments, and he is effectively conceding this crucially important 21st century economic driver to China, which already far ahead of us in these industry sectors by all accounts.

I am actively having conversations with my Republican counterparts about the importance of the clean energy sector — not only for reducing carbon emissions and bending the curve on climate change, but also for economic growth and national security purposes.

At the same time, I am also trying to find areas of common ground with Republicans to try to pass bipartisan bills. I am proud to serve on the House Natural Resources Committee, where I am focused on advancing legislation to mitigate the consequences of the climate crisis for our community. Just this month, my bipartisan, bicameral bill, the Digital Coast Reauthorization Act of 2025, passed unanimously out of the House Natural Resources Committee, which is the final step before this bill can move to the floor for a vote and hopefully, become law. This bill will reauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Digital Coast Program. This program compiles hundreds of open-access datasets, interactive tools, and trainings that are helping coastal communities effectively plan for the future and protect their shoreline. These datasets have far-reaching applications, from allowing California to generate more accurate tsunami models to helping researchers at UC Irvine study coastal flooding risks.

Q: You voted against the massive spending cuts bill that was ultimately signed into law over the summer, citing the cuts it made to Medicaid and Medicare, among other assistance areas. What is some guidance you’re giving local nonprofits and organizations that address health care gaps in your district? In other words, what is a solution to problems you identified with that bill?

A: Unfortunately, this bill is a devastating blow for patients, providers and hospitals. There are no real solutions that can address the massive cuts to Medicaid (which funds Medi-Cal and CalOptima) and the gaps in coverage these will create. That is why congressional Democrats are insisting that any funding packages we approve include measures to offset some of the devastating provisions in the Republicans’ budget package earlier this year, which kick 15 million Americans off their health insurance plans.

The one slight glimmer of hope we have is that these cuts do not take effect until after the 2026 elections (a bit of “bait and switch” by House Republican leadership), and while we will unfortunately see significant increases in our health insurance costs and large cuts to health care services in the meantime as insurance providers and healthcare providers plan out their budgets, if Democrats retake control of Congress in 2027, we may be better positioned to fight for legislation that fully funds Medi-Cal and CalOptima and lowers health care costs for families in Orange County.

Q: There has been a lot of talk about political rhetoric and civil discourse in this country in recent months. How do you define civil discourse? And what is one thing you are doing to be a leader in your community amid calls to tone down rhetoric?

A: I am appalled by the divisiveness in this country and the fact that so many of our political leaders reacted to some of the recent political violence, not by condemning violence and calling for greater dialogue but instead by trying to stoke anger and censor critics of this administration.

When I learned of the assassination of political commentator Charlie Kirk, I immediately condemned it and called for an end to political violence, just as I had done after learning about the attempted assassination of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or the assassination of Minnesota State House Speaker Melissa Hortman. We cannot simply condemn violence when it happens to someone on our own side. We must condemn all political violence equally.

I represent a politically diverse district, and I know that many of my constituents disagree with many of my positions and my votes. But these disagreements should be settled through dialogue or at the ballot box, not through threats of violence or worse. That is why I have held five major town halls since coming to Congress, along with dozens of other public-facing events such as roundtables and office hour sessions. I was not elected to exclusively represent those who voted for me. I represent everyone equally, and I hope to continue having thoughtful and meaningful conversations about the issues that matter most to my constituents.

Q: You are clearly at ideological odds with the conservative leadership of Huntington Beach in your district, but is there an area or issue where you and the city’s councilmembers are working in tandem to address? Please explain your answer.

A: As I have often said to the Huntington Beach councilmembers, I think to a large degree we want the same thing — a safe and prosperous community where children are protected and well educated, and our basic rights are protected. We just often disagree on what problems should be prioritized and how.

I believe the Huntington Beach Council has chosen to take on high-profile culture war issues that don’t actually address the problems our residents are concerned about, while creating an increasingly negative reputational problem. And after recent events, including the very conspicuous omission of Surf City from any of the Olympic events (such as surfing or beach volleyball) that might have brought massive tourism dollars to the region, or the very high-profile march by Ku Klux Klan members through the streets of Huntington Beach, I would hope that the Council is rethinking its approach.

That being said, regardless of who is on the City Council of any of the cities I represent, I take seriously my obligation to try to represent everyone. In Huntington Beach, after having numerous conversations with the City Council and its city manager, I prioritized funding for the Huntington Beach Navigation Center (something I also got funding for when I served in the State Senate) to help deal with the growing homelessness problem and also the Regional Criminal Justice Training Center at Golden West College, which serves as a training ground for police cadets and officers. We are on track to hopefully get significant funding for these projects and many others across the areas I represent, including in Seal Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Costa Mesa, and Irvine.

Q: As a member of the House Oversight Committee, you’ve been pushing for the public release of more information related to Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. Aside from releasing those documents, what is something lawmakers could do to ensure young people in the U.S. are protected from this type of abuse going forward? What about protections for victims of sex trafficking and abuse?

A: First and foremost, we must release the Epstein files. There are young women and girls across the country watching, and we must make clear to them that we will find justice for the survivors of Epstein’s abuse. No matter how wealthy or well-connected you are, you will be held accountable.

At the same time, I have long championed legislation to support victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence. As a state senator, eight of my domestic violence-related bills were signed into law, including a first-in-the-nation bill to designate reproductive coercion as a form of domestic violence. I am continuing to prioritize this work in Congress.

Bonus question: If you are throwing a dinner party, what is the signature dish you would make for your guests?

A: During the summer, I am known for my barbecue chicken (either Korean-style or Kansas City-style). In the winter, I like to break out the smoker and serve up a smoked chicken or duck.",https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-L-QA-MIN-1009.jpg?w=1024&h=754,N,,2025-10-21 12:24:12.716067

New investments expand access to EV charging in Baltimore City, the Eastern Shore, and Western Maryland, provide economic benefits to businesses and drivers

BALTIMORE (October 21, 2025) – The Maryland Department of the Environment today announced more than $5 million in grants to support the installation of electric vehicle charging stations across the state.

The grants will fund reliable, convenient charging stations at 23 workplace sites and 12 locations on transportation corridors. These awards make it easier for Marylanders to drive electric, helping to reduce emissions while supporting green jobs and strengthening local economies.

“These investments are about more than charging stations. They’re about building confidence in Maryland’s clean energy future,” said Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain. “Every charger we install brings us closer to our climate goals, supports our businesses, and improves air quality for our communities.”

The Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) awards include:

$1.2 million to expand fast-charger access on transportation corridors in Western Maryland, including Hagerstown, Grantsville, and Hancock.

$650,000 to expand fast-charger access on the Eastern Shore at key locations in Chestertown, Easton, and Berlin.

$250,000 for Baltimore City to install chargers in nine public parking garages.

$171,000 to WSSC Water for workplace chargers at 10 facilities to support clean commuting for employees.

$27,500 for AstraZeneca to electrify the parking lot of its life sciences manufacturing facility in Frederick.

The installation and maintenance of charging stations will support job creation and ensure long-term job sustainability. Areas hosting charging stations will also experience increased spending and economic activity, while investments in advanced technology infrastructure are likely to contribute to an increase in property values. For electric vehicle owners, benefits include charging convenience and reduced operating costs.

The awards mark the third and final round of funding from a portion of the $75.7 million Maryland received under a settlement between the U.S. Justice Department and Volkswagen for the company’s use of illegal “defeat devices.” This round of funding received more than 130 applications, reflecting Maryland’s growing demand for electric vehicle infrastructure. Awards were determined following a competitive review process.

According to Kelley Blue Book, 437,487 battery-powered units were sold or leased during the third quarter of 2025, which amounts to a record-high 10.5% market share.

While most analysts write the surge off as a rush to showrooms before the $7,500 federal tax credit/rebate on select EVs expired at the end of September, it shows that a growing number of U.S. motorists are willing to go electric, especially if the price is right. Despite the fact that high-end luxury brands have thus far dominated the EV market, the industry is finally embracing the concept of affordably-priced battery-electric rides with gusto.

Nissan recently debuted its latest version of the full-electric Leaf, starting at $31,485, while Chevrolet is planning to roll out a revived version of the Bolt next year with a base price as low as $28,595 (both including their respective mandatory destination charges), to join the already affordable Equinox and Blazer EVs in its current EV stable and additional affordable models planned for future model years.

In the meantime, we found 16 full-electric cars and SUVs leasing this month with payments at under $400, which is about what a typical family – and many individuals – pay to dine out over a 30-day period. Aside from usually obtaining a lower monthly payment than buying and financing an EV outright, leasing an EV is a prudent way to hedge one’s bets with regard to rapidly developing technology – especially with regard to battery cost and capacity – and possible sinking resale values down the road. To that end 50% of all EVs are reportedly leased, rather than purchased outright.

The most-affordable EV lease deal we could find this month was on the 2025 Kia Niro EV in its Wind trim, going for just $229 per month for 24 months with $3,999 due at signing. We even uncovered a pair of BMW and Volvo battery-electric models – the eDrive40 and EX30, respectively – being offered with $399 lease payments.

For those unfamiliar with the process, a new-vehicle lease’s monthly payments are based on the difference between its transaction price (this is called the “capitalized cost” in the contract) and what the vehicle is expected to be worth when the contract expires (its “residual value”), financed at the going rate of interest (referred to as either a “lease rate,” “lease charge” or “money factor”).

While this would tend to favor models having lower sticker prices and/or higher residual values, automakers often apply leasing “bonus cash” to reduce the capitalized cost or down payment, or will subsidize a lower interest rate help move the metal. Plus, a lease deal can be manipulated by juggling the numbers, with a higher down payment resulting in a lower monthly expenditure, and vice versa. Be aware that new-vehicle leases include a set mileage limit, which in the case of the sweetest deals can be as little as 10,000 miles per year before a per-mile penalty of $0.15 or more kicks in.

Since new-vehicle incentive programs often vary from one part of the country to another based on local supply and demand issues, be sure to check an automaker’s website under a “local offers” or “special deals” tab to see what’s being offered locally. And take note that the best leasing deals are typically reserved for “qualified lessees,” which means those having top-tier credit scores and qualifying incomes.

Under Joe Biden, the EPA completed dozens of evaluations and put in place restrictions on the most toxic chemicals.
The Trump EPA has reopened those evaluations, a current EPA employee who did not use their name for fear of retaliation.
“Since when does industry protect their workers?” Industry has a long history of not protecting its workers from toxic exposures.
The EPA employee said the standard includes stipulations that are effectively impossible to meet, so it seems to be “reverse engineered” to invalidate risk evaluations.","A new rule proposed by the Trump administration would dramatically weaken safety reviews for some of the nation’s most toxic chemicals that are already on the market, public health advocates and an EPA employee warn.

Many of the chemicals that would receive less scrutiny are among the nation’s most dangerous substances, including PFAS, formaldehyde, asbestos and dioxins. Each poses serious health risks in consumer goods, or for workers handling the substances, advocates say.

If implemented, the new rule would shorten the time it takes to review chemicals, and alter the methodology used to assess their dangers. It would also prohibit states from banning or restricting dangerous chemicals, and could invalidate hundreds of state-level protections.

“This is a gift to industry wrapped on golden wrapping paper with a big bow on it,” said Kyla Bennett, a former EPA scientist now with the Public Employees For Environmental Responsibility non-profit.

Federal law requires the Environmental Protection Agency to continuously review the safety of toxic chemicals on the market, and that requirement has been an industry target in recent years.

Under Joe Biden, the EPA completed dozens of evaluations and put in place restrictions on the most toxic chemicals. The Trump EPA has reopened those evaluations, a current EPA employee who did not use their name for fear of retaliation. The administration probably aims to reassess the chemicals using the new rule, which would reduce the level of scrutiny and potentially justify lifting restrictions.

In a statement, the EPA said the rule would not change the “basic methodological approach used to conduct the risk evaluations”, though it would streamline and speed up the process.

The new rule “would better protect human health and the environment by amending provisions that may impede the timely completion of risk evaluations, and therefore unnecessarily delay any risk management action that may be necessary to address unreasonable risk”, a spokesperson wrote.

The new rule proposes to eliminate review of some routes of exposure to a chemical from scrutiny. The EPA now puts in place restrictions if it can be “reasonably foreseen” that the public or workers may be exposed to toxic substances in the air, water, orally or dermally. The EPA employee said the Trump administration probably plans to exploit the gray area in that language – it seems poised to change the rule so the agency reasonably foresees fewer exposure routes.

The EPA is also planning to create what Bennett called a “giant loophole” by not restricting the use of some dangerous chemicals as long as those who work with the substances use proper personal protective gear.

The EPA employee said voluminous research shows that workers often choose not to wear the gear, or fail to use it properly. Moreover, if the agency finds there is no risk to workers because it assumes proper use of protective equipment, then it cannot put in place enforceable personal protection equipment requirements. The employee said this “circular argument” increases the likelihood that gear will not be used in situations in which workers are at risk.

“What the EPA is doing in this rule is saying, ‘Trust industry – they’ll protect their workers,’” Bennett said. “Since when does industry protect their workers?”

Industry has a long history of not protecting its workers from toxic exposures. DuPont in the 1960s knew its employees who handled PFAS were being sickened by the chemicals, and internal science showed it caused a range of dangerous health problems, but the company never told the employees.

The proposed rule also includes a requirement that risk assessments meet the Gold Standard Science framework that the Trump administration developed. The EPA employee said the standard includes stipulations that are effectively impossible to meet, so it seems to be “reverse engineered” to invalidate risk evaluations.

For example, the Gold Standard requires that all data used to develop a risk assessment be made public. But much of the research is covered by confidential business information laws or medical privacy laws, so it cannot be made public, the employee said.

“It would pull the rug out from the program and for almost every chemical it would say ‘insufficient information’,” they said. “We wouldn’t be able to regulate.”

In a press release, the American Chemistry Council trade group that represents many chemical makers, applauded the proposed changes. The EPA is “refining its processes in a way that is both protective and practical,” said Kimberly Wise White, an ACC lobbyist.

The rule making process can take about three years and will almost certainly be subjected to legal challenges. The law states that the EPA’s risk evaluations should be done within 3.5 years, but in reality they often take more than five years, and 18 are already open.

The agency’s political appointees are moving more staff into the toxics office, the employee said, probably because it is attempting to prioritize successfully rewriting the rule and redoing the risk evaluations to be more favorable to industry.

Many of the employees that are being re-assigned to do risk evaluations have no experience, so they are less likely to push back on political appointees’ pressure, the employee said.

Even if a Democratic administration that prioritizes stronger chemical safety reviews takes over the agency following the 2028 election, it would have to start a new rule-making process which would take another three years. Industry is satisfied with a tug of war between administrations because it delays regulation, the employee said.

“From a business perspective, every quarter and every year that they slow down the process means they can keep making a profit off of it,” the employee added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749a0c24ee1fc2bf7d9586400e65e20811dab34e/492_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=314303d05c641eaf43025a0e460f025a",N,,2025-10-21 10:00:01.527985

The administration has been slashing green energy incentives, freezing the construction of wind farms and ordering coal-burning power plants to keep running longer than planned. And yet, more American homes and businesses are getting their power from renewable sources than ever before — and in greater amounts.

In June, almost one-quarter of US power generation was green, up from 18% in the year-earlier period, according to data compiled from the US Energy Information Administration. The question now is whether the trend continues with President Donald Trump back in the White House.

The recent growth in renewables usage is almost certainly tied to investments made prior to Trump’s election in November. Under former President Joe Biden, the US backed roughly $100 billion of investments in clean energy. Now, the Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to those efforts by opposing offshore wind farms and eliminating incentives for electric vehicles and solar power.

Still, Texas is a prime example of how the energy markets have changed. In early March, the state’s grid set a record for wind generation; in mid-June, it registered a new peak for electricity produced from renewable resources; and a month later, Texas notched new highs for battery storage and solar generation.

Similar records are popping up across the country on an almost weekly basis, as utilities harvest a windfall from new solar and wind farms that can be built faster and more affordably than fossil fuel-based power plants.

Nearly One-Third

For utilities and folks operating the nation’s power grids, the wave of green energy couldn’t come at a better time because volatile weather, electric vehicles and a rash of AI-focused data centers are all driving up demand.

In April, as grid operators were girding for heat waves, nearly one-third of US power was generated from renewable sources. And the green energy boom is spreading beyond the Sun and Wind belts. The New York grid hit a renewable record on June 24. New England recorded new highs for both wind and solar power this summer and the grid in the Mid-Atlantic states reported a record renewable harvest in late June.

“We’re in an entirely new landscape for load growth, so this is none too soon,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility policy director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “Every solution available will need to be called on.”

What Good Is the Dawn?

If all of the utility-owned solar panels in California were considered one facility, it would have ranked at the end of July as the second-largest power plant in the world. At noon on July 30, solar generation on the state’s CAISO grid hit 21.7 megawatts, second only to the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam on China’s Yangtze River.

For much of that day, the sun accounted for roughly two-thirds of the power Californians were using and the panels fed into batteries that, once the sun went down, juiced nearly one-third of the state.

Charge Baby Charge

The Texas power market is truly the Wild West of electricity.

As a deregulated, wholesale market, the state’s consumers can choose their provider and plants are only paid for what they produce. In this eat-what-you-kill energy world, utilities have turned en masse to a novel tool: big batteries.

These so-called storage facilities let power players sock away electrons when demand (read: prices) are low and discharge the juice when usage peaks. Often, the most economical strategy is storing solar power during the day and releasing it in the evening when the lights and TVs switch on and air conditioners are still humming.

A rash of new storage facilities have been switched on in Texas this year, shoring up the grid with record amounts of reserve power.

A Mighty Wind

In Wyoming, the largest coal-producing state in the US, it’s common for tractor trailers to get blown over onto their sides. Such is the power of the wind on the Great Plains. And it’s steady as well as strong.

On the Southwest Power Pool grid, which stretches from the Dakotas south to Texas, new records for wind power were reached twice in August alone. At one point on Aug. 16, almost two of every three electrons in the system were coming from turbines.

Clicking the Boxes

Good, cheap or fast? Typically, one only gets to choose two of those things. But now, solar, wind and other renewable sources are clicking all three of those boxes when it comes to producing electricity. So-called green energy is currently the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy power generator in the US, even without incentives, according to research from Lazard Inc.

Given recent attacks on green power, the decisions made by utilities have become more fraught than usual and a bit more complicated than just choosing the cheapest plant to build. In May, Gordon van Welie, chief executive officer of the ISO New England grid, told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that his organization was counting on large quantities of offshore wind to meet rising demand. Three months later, the Trump administration ordered crews to stop working on a project off the coast of Rhode Island where 45 of 65 planned turbines have already been installed, a directive that it now has to defend in court.

The facility was expected to power roughly 350,000 homes. Administration officials say solar and wind is unreliable and too connected to China-based supply chains. Trump’s term, however, will likely be over long before any new coal-fired or nuclear plant can be built to replace that capacity.

“We need more electrons in this country and the industry seems to have an agnostic view,” said Lazard Managing Director Samuel Scroggins, referring to where electrons originate. “Practically speaking, renewable energy is ready to build and it remains below the cost of alternatives.”

The grants were expected to support more than 4 GW of solar, serving 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities and reducing customer bills by at least 20%.

EPA competitively awarded Solar for All grants in August 2024 to 49 state-level agencies, six Native American tribes or tribal consortiums, and five multi-state applicants.

But two months ago, said the Washington State Attorney General’s Office in a statement, “EPA abruptly and unlawfully terminated the program and clawed back the vast majority of the money already awarded. That has left the plaintiffs without access to the funds to proceed” with solar deployment.

The lawsuit says that Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July rescinding unobligated funds for the program, but that EPA had obligated all of the $7 billion for the program nearly a year earlier.

The lawsuit alleges that the EPA “unlawfully” froze all Solar for All funds in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution’s Separation of Powers Doctrine.

In its statement, the Attorney General’s Office said that EPA “sent memos to all grant recipients, saying EPA no longer has a ‘statutory basis or dedicated funding’ for the program, even though Congress never directed EPA to cancel funds that had already been awarded. In fact, Congress did the opposite by only rescinding unobligated funds for Solar for All.”

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.

Second lawsuit

The California Public Utilities Commission and other plaintiffs including 15 states have filed a lawsuit against EPA, alleging that EPA, after signing contracts to issue the Solar for All grants, then breached those contracts.

That lawsuit alleges that EPA’s breach of the 60 Solar for All grant agreements caused each plaintiff to suffer damages, and asks the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to award monetary damages to the plaintiffs.

A return to the good times is so desperately needed to lift the spirit of American agriculture.","In the crisis facing agriculture today, one truth is confirmed: American farmers are good at what they do. Since the middle of the 20th Century, U.S. farmers have consistently built yields and increased productivity. Therein lies the problem.

Farm historian Douglas Hurt terms, it “problems of plenty.” In his 2002 book, “Problems of Plenty, The American Farmer in the Twentieth Century,” Hurt explains that rapid advancement in the last century led to stellar productivity gains, which created overproduction and depressed prices aided by government support.

Another truth is also clear: American farmers would prefer turning to the market for a profit. Like all businesses, they want dependable customers. But trade wars and never-ending competition from countries like Brazil and Argentina are challenging.

Farmers in the Carolinas are fortunate because the local hog and poultry sectors are reliable customers for their grain. In North Carolina, local farmers supply less than half of the feed for pigs and hogs, with the rest coming in from the Midwest by rail.

Research conducted by North Carolina State University ag economist Nick Piggott and graduate student John Robinson on the benefits of on-farm grain storage in North Carolina reveals that the state’s livestock industry consumes about 300 million bushels of feed grains (corn, wheat, and sorghum) annually while local corn and wheat production averages between only 110 million bushels to 130 million bushels per year.

“Local feed demand lifts basis in North Carolina’s corn-deficit market. It’s a buffer, not a bailout—smooth rail from the Midwest can cap the premium—and timing matters: basis typically improves after harvest, especially if yields disappoint locally or in the Midwest, making local bushels more valuable,” Piggott explained to me in an email.

Yes, basis helps. But large global supplies of corn forces prices down for all farmers. The United States is expected to produce a record corn crop this year. It’s a problem of plenty, as Hurt would say.

Even with good yields, farmers will be hard pressed to find a profit this year with inflation driving up their production costs. That’s frustrating because farmers, like all of us, want to be financially rewarded for their efforts.

Plenty shouldn’t be a problem. Modern agriculture that creates a cornucopia of food for a hungry world is nothing short of miraculous. Farmers who dedicate their lives to this calling don’t expect to be billionaires like Warren Buffett or Elon Musk, but they do want to be financially rewarded for their efforts.

Agriculture runs in cycles. During hard times, farmers recall the good years with hope that profitability will return. Optimism flows through their bloodstream. A return to the good times is so desperately needed to lift the spirit of American agriculture.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt033c9fce83282762/68efc8c5382bf818070a69cf/Grain_Bins_Blacklands_2025_web.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-21 13:19:59.875544

The company further expects lower gross tariff impact — at $3.5-4.5 billion, which is below the previous $4-5 billion estimates.
According to GM, tariff mitigation actions are expected to offset about 35% of the impact.","General Motors reported on Tuesday its third-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street consensus. Shares jumped by nearly 10% to over $63 immediately after the results were published.

The Detroit automaker posted a total revenue of $48.59 billion, rising quarter over quarter and slightly decreasing from a year ago.

The figures, which were above estimates of $45.27 billion, were largely driven by a surge in demand in the last quarter ahead of the EV tax deadline.

The company delivered 66,501 electric vehicles between July and September, doubling from a year ago.

Overall deliveries stood at 710,347 units, a growth of nearly 8% year-on-year.

GM reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 (above estimates of $2.31) and adjusted Earnings Before Taxes and Interest (EBIT) of $3.38 billion.

The company’s operating income was 24.2% above the Wall Street expectations of $2.72 billion.

However, the net income, which represents the profit left after all expenses are deducted from the revenue, had its margin slashed in half compared to a year ago — from 6.3% to 2.7%.

Last week, GM warned that its third quarter financial results had been impacted by a $1.6 billion loss from its EV strategy change.

The charges were approved by GM‘s board audit committee last week, and were based on the realignment of the company’s electric vehicle production to match consumer demand.

The company estimates a $1.2 billion non-cash impairment, as manufacturing operations were trimmed.

The remaining $400 million represents actual cash costs, mainly from fees and settlements in cancelled contracts with suppliers.

These figures impacted the net income attributable to stockholders, which also halved from a year ago — from $3 billion to $1.3 billion.

In a new shareholder letter published on Tuesday, CEO Mary Barra said that the company is increasing their full-year guidance, “underscoring our confidence in the company’s trajectory.”

GM expects adjusted EBIT of between $12-13 billion (up from $10-12.5) and $9.75-10.50 adjusted EPS (up from $8.25-10).

The company further expects lower gross tariff impact — at $3.5-4.5 billion, which is below the previous $4-5 billion estimates.

The figures are based on tariff rates continuing at their current levels, with material and suppliers indirect tariff costs contributing to the estimates.

According to GM, tariff mitigation actions are expected to offset about 35% of the impact.

In the new letter, Barra thanked President Donald Trump and his team “for the important tariff updates they made on Friday.”

The chief executive was referring to the orders signed late last week, which expand credits for domestic auto and engine production, while expanding the 25% auto tariff to imported medium and heavy-duty trucks and parts from November 1.

“The MSRP offset program will help make US-produced vehicles more competitive over the next five years,” Barra stated.

The CEO added that “GM is very well positioned as we invest to increase our already significant domestic sourcing and manufacturing footprint.”

Woodchuck, the AI-powered climate-tech startup redefining how construction and manufacturing industries handle wood waste, today announces that Barton Malow, a 101-year-old construction enterprise committed to delivering innovative, trust-based solutions, has partnered with Woodchuck to divert wood waste from the Hart Solar Farm project away from landfills and into clean energy production. Together, the companies are not only diverting thousands of tons of wood waste from landfills, but also saving valuable time and resources by streamlining the waste hauling process. The diverted material is processed and delivered to Genesee Power Station, a NorthStar Clean Energy project, where it is repurposed as biomass to generate renewable power.

The collaboration addresses one of the most significant challenges in renewable energy construction: waste management. Traditionally, pallets, cable spools, and miscellaneous wood supports would have been sent to landfills. By working with Woodchuck, Barton Malow is ensuring that these materials find a higher purpose in clean energy production.

“Partnering with Woodchuck gives our project teams a real opportunity to put waste diversion into practice on a large scale,” said Jill Katic, Senior Sustainability Director at Barton Malow. “Not only does this help us reduce environmental impact, but it also provides quantifiable reporting we can use in our greenhouse gas inventories and annual sustainability reports. That level of accountability helps us deliver greater value to our clients.”

For Woodchuck, the partnership reflects its mission to eliminate construction waste from landfills and create renewable energy streams.

“Our work with Barton Malow at the Hart Solar Farm is proof that waste can be an asset,” said Todd Thomas, CEO of Woodchuck. “By coordinating hauling, shredding, and processing on-site, we make the logistics easier for builders while ensuring that every pallet and piece of wood debris is diverted into clean energy production instead of buried in a landfill.”

NorthStar Clean Energy, which utilizes the repurposed biomass, sees the project as a demonstration of how collaboration across industries can drive measurable sustainability outcomes.

“Turning wood waste from a solar construction site into clean, renewable energy is exactly the kind of circular solution our energy future demands,” said Brian Hartmann, President of NorthStar Clean Energy. “Working with Barton Malow and Woodchuck shows how innovative partnerships can scale sustainable practices while delivering reliable energy to Michigan communities.”

The Hart Solar Farm project, which spans more than four square miles, has already diverted nearly 500 tons of wood waste that was converted into 38M BTU, enough energy to power 16 Detroit homes for a month (or equal to 824 tons of CO2e, the equivalent of taking 180 cars off the road for a year). For Barton Malow, the effort underscores its commitment to helping clients meet sustainability goals while advancing renewable energy infrastructure.

Not only does this project support Woodchuck’s mission, but it also proves that the company’s model can be scaled dramatically to support large construction projects. Any construction company struggling to manage waste due to cost or lack of manpower can look to Woodchuck for a proven, scalable solution.

Look up your city. - The Washington Post,"Daniel Wolfe, Naema Ahmed, Daniel Wolfe, Naema Ahmed",,,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2025/meat-beef-climate-impact/,"Researchers have documented for years that eating beef, pork and chicken has a significant environmental impact, especially when it comes to heating the planet.
Many Americans are likely to keep eating meat, even though beef has become more expensive in recent months.
When adjusted for emissions per capita, though, researchers found little connection between how much a town eats and its climate impact.

And even if tackling climate change isn’t a top priority, Goldstein said, rising food prices offer another reason to cut down on beef.","Researchers have documented for years that eating beef, pork and chicken has a significant environmental impact, especially when it comes to heating the planet.

But it’s far from a uniform impact. What you eat, and where you eat it, can have a big effect on how much you’re contributing to climate change, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.

For the first time, researchers calculated the planet-warming pollution emitted from raising the beef, pork and chicken Americans eat — their carbon “hoofprint” — for every town and city in the country.

Across the country, eating beef is the bigger contributor to harmful pollutants. But it’s not as simple as that. Its origins matter. Eating a steak or a burger in Milwaukee, where the meat comes from nearby dairy cows, generates fewer emissions than in Oklahoma City, where beef tends to come from feedlots.

Some cattle operators near McAllen, Texas, store cow manure in open lagoons that release methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. And grazing cattle in Kansas and Nebraska generate more emissions than other livestock, since it takes them longer to gain weight compared with those raised in feedlots.

Joshua Newell, one of the paper’s co-authors and a professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan, helped coin the term “hoofprint” more than 15 years ago when he was a postdoctoral student at University of Southern California. The goal, he said, was “bringing food into the discussion about what makes a city sustainable,” to expand the conversation on reducing carbon emissions.

Many Americans are likely to keep eating meat, even though beef has become more expensive in recent months. Still, the new study offers a road map to determining your diet’s climate impact, including what you can do if you live in a place where it has a greater environmental toll.

Where are hoofprints the largest?

Can you guess the top three emitting cities in this analysis? Hint: They’re where the most mouths to feed are: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. When adjusted for emissions per capita, though, researchers found little connection between how much a town eats and its climate impact.

The new analysis by scientists from the University of Michigan and the University of Minnesota shows that these emissions vary depending on where cities get their meat. Researchers modeled pollutants released at every step of the supply chain, from what it takes to get feed for the animals to the climate impact of raising and butchering them. This allowed them to estimate the hoofprints of more than 3,000 towns and cities.

What raises the hoofprint?

On average, 73 percent of every city’s hoofprint comes down to beef. Not only is it more popular, producing beef generates far more planet-warming pollution compared with raising hogs and chickens. However, raising cattle in feed lots can be more energy efficient, despite its other environmental and ethical costs. And the type of feed a farm uses and how it manages waste can tip these cows’ emissions the other way.

The distance that cattle feed is transported, as well as how far cows travel to be slaughtered, also matters, since this can span thousands of miles.

Newell, however, said transportation is “a small portion of the hoofprint.”

Mario Herrero, who directs Food Systems and Global Change at Cornell University — a interdisciplinary group of academics and entrepreneurs working on sustainable food systems — and who was not involved in the study, said it was significant that it found some cities’ meat consumption was three times as high as others’.

Ben Goldstein, one of the study’s authors and an assistant professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan, said in an interview that when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, “beef is still the main culprit” regardless of how it’s produced.

Mary-Thomas Hart, chief counsel at the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, said the findings on emissions differences along the beef supply chain were not surprising. Hart stressed that compared with other countries, the “United States has the lowest emissions intensity per pound of beef,” citing efforts to lower greenhouse gases through improved grazing and feed management.

What lowers the hoofprint?

“You don’t have to cut out any single meat to have really significant shifts in your hoofprint,” Goldstein said, adding that just swapping half of the beef you eat for other protein can move the needle. The researchers modeled impacts to emissions from simple lifestyle changes that can add up to a 51 percent drop in one’s hoofprint.

“The average American eats five servings of beef a week,” Goldstein said. “So, all right, you can still have two burgers a week.” Goldstein is not a vegetarian, he said, and has a burger once in a while.

“If you’re that dedicated to beef,” Goldstein said, “move to the Upper Midwest … go and eat the culled dairy cattle, which has lower carbon emissions.”

At the end of the day, the supply chain dictates the size of a city’s hoofprint. Research shows that the hoofprint could be reduced by 30 percent through changes in cattle diet, grazing practices and feed lots. Such changes could cut 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide a year and prevent an additional 58 million metric tons from entering the atmosphere each year: Taken together, that’s equivalent to taking 18 million cars off the road.

And even if tackling climate change isn’t a top priority, Goldstein said, rising food prices offer another reason to cut down on beef.

“It’s more affordable to eat chicken, pork or tofu,” he said. “It’s an effective way to curb your carbon footprint and to lower your grocery budget and improve your health.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7VUPD7PMKNDLPLL77DJJRX4K24.jpg&w=1200,N,,2025-10-21 10:00:18.293857

“We did everything we could to keep our federal workers here employed as long as possible.
Nationally, about 1,400 employees were sent home Monday, leaving fewer than 400 to safeguard the U.S. nuclear stockpile.
In Nevada, all 68 federal employees at the Nevada National Security Site were furloughed.
Only four contractors remained working at the Nevada National Security Site.","U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright visited the Nevada National Security Site Monday to highlight the shutdown’s impact on the federal agency tasked with managing and modernizing America’s nuclear weapons.

The U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration, which falls under the Energy Department, furloughed a majority of its workforce on Monday as the government shutdown dragged into its third week. It’s the first time since the agency’s creation in 2000 that workers have been furloughed.

“We did everything we could to keep our federal workers here employed as long as possible. But unfortunately, today is the day our ability to deploy funds to pay those workers ended,” Wright said at a press conference Monday.

Nationally, about 1,400 employees were sent home Monday, leaving fewer than 400 to safeguard the U.S. nuclear stockpile. In Nevada, all 68 federal employees at the Nevada National Security Site were furloughed.

While the agency doesn’t directly handle U.S. nuclear weapons, the department is tasked with improving national security by safeguarding the US nuclear stockpile and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the globe. The agency is also responsible for overseeing the transportation of nuclear weapons and materials.

Wright said NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation, which transports nuclear weapons and materials within the U.S., had enough funding to operate until Oct. 27. Wright also said the agency had enough funding “to keep our contractors employed at least through the end of the month.”

Unlike federal employees, contractors can’t be paid back for the time they spent furloughed. Only four contractors remained working at the Nevada National Security Site.

“If they’re furloughed, they’re not going to get paid. If that continues on for weeks more – they’ve got families to support – they’re going to go get jobs elsewhere. But the federal government, we can’t afford to lose those workers. We need them,” Wright said.

At the press conference, Wright said there was no immediate national security threat as a result of the furloughs and “a certain number of mission critical folks…are still working.”

However, Wright said the furloughed employees are “among the most critical workers in our country.”

“They test, maintain, and ultimately construct a modernized version of our nuclear stock. We need to take that deathly serious. We’ve never had to furlough in this area before. We need to end this as soon as possible,” Wright said.

A press secretary for the Department of Energy said the difference this year from prior federal shutdowns was a reduction in carryover funding by the Biden administration last year before he left office, so there isn’t as much of a financial cushion as in prior shutdowns.

“They instructed them to reduce the carryover funding because they thought it was too large. So that’s why we’re in a different situation,” said Ben Dietderich, press secretary and chief spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy.

Wright blamed Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the continued shutdown, but he also thanked Nevada’s Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto for being one of only two Democrats to vote for a Republican stopgap spending bill that would end the shutdown.

“I thank her for her courage and for standing with our workers here in Nevada and with our country’s national security,” Wright said.

The overwhelming majority of Cortez Masto’s Democratic colleagues in both the Senate and the U.S. House opposed the Republican spending bill because it failed to restore Affordable Care Act subsidies that congressional Republicans and the Trump administration curtailed earlier this year. Health insurance premiums are projected to increase substantially as a result.

Wright called on Democrats to support the Republican-led spending bill, describing it as “a clean spending bill that just continues the spending levels exactly as they were before.”

Earlier this month, Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen said Democrats would have to be “naive” to vote for a Republican funding plan to reopen the government without first obtaining firm commitments that Republicans will reverse course and extend health insurance subsidies so as to prevent skyrocketing premiums.

Wright said Rosen abstaining from a vote to reopen the government earlier this month was a sign that more Democrats may do as Cortez Masto has and vote with the Republicans.

“Last vote she abstained. I think she wants to vote with us. I think she’s going to be part of reopening the government,” Wright said.

A spokesperson for Rosen’s office said Nevada’s junior senator missed the vote because of “significant flight delays outside of her control that led her to miss two votes a couple of weeks ago,” adding that “Rosen would have opposed the Republican resolution that does nothing to fix the health care crisis.”

“Donald Trump and Washington Republicans control Congress and the White House – and it’s on them to end this government shutdown and take action to prevent a spike in health care costs for hardworking families,” Rosen said in a statement Monday.

“The Trump Administration would rather continue this shutdown and furlough federal workers, including at the Nevada National Security Site, than work across party lines to extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits that families rely on to keep their health care affordable,” Rosen said.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted this could become the longest government shutdown in American history as negotiations between Republicans and Democrats remain at an impasse.

The current shutdown has already exceeded the historical average of eight days for government shutdowns dating back to the late 1970s. The longest shutdown on record lasted 35 days during President Donald Trump’s first term, resulting in $11 billion in lost economic productivity, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dsc08012-1024x6831761049302.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=pWKQWL-b,N,,2025-10-21 11:21:13.856265

The largest cancelled grant, at $316 million for Ascend Elements, was intended to support the manufacture of components from recycled electric vehicle batteries at a planned plant in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.
According to Linh Austin, president and CEO of the company, Ascend Elements is sticking to the plan.
American Battery Technology is seeking $57.7 million in funding to build a lithium hydroxide production facility in Nevada.
According to information from E&E News, some of the companies have lodged appeals against the cancellation of their funding.","As reported by Politico’s E&E News portal, the Biden administration had awarded the $718 million to five recipients: battery companies Ascend Elements, American Battery Technology, Anovion and ICL Specialty Products, and glass manufacturer LuxWall. The largest cancelled grant, at $316 million for Ascend Elements, was intended to support the manufacture of components from recycled electric vehicle batteries at a planned plant in Hopkinsville, Kentucky.

But first things first: the Department of Energy told E&E News that it had cancelled the five grants in the second week of October. This was because the projects “had missed milestones, and it was determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement. He did not specify which milestones the projects had missed.

According to E&E News, the cancellation is one of the largest in the battery production sector to date and also affects construction plans for plants in Republican-dominated states such as Kentucky and Missouri. This distinguishes the move from an initial round of cuts under Trump, in which funding for 223 clean energy projects was discontinued at the beginning of the month in order to “save” $7.56 billion. This mainly affected projects in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Moreover, it was less about energy supply chains: only $175 million was revoked by the US Department of Energy’s Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office (MESC), according to reports. The same agency has now cut $718 million.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright had previously led a comprehensive review of the projects based on specific criteria set out in a memo in May. He defended this month’s funding cuts on the grounds that the projects “contain termination clauses,” as reported by E&E News. And: “If they’re not in the interest of the taxpayers, if they’re not a good expenditure of the money, you always have the ability to cancel these projects,” he added.

In response, Democrats accuse the US Department of taking illegal action that is damaging to the economy. Last week, 37 Democratic and independent senators stated in a letter to Wright that “the illegality of your cancellations is the only thing as indisputable as the harm your cancellations will wreak.”

The cancelled grants relate to projects that had been promised millions in funding via the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed in 2021 during the Biden era. ICL Specialty Products was to receive $197.3 million to build a plant in St. Louis that would produce 30,000 tonnes of lithium-ion phosphate powder for the battery industry annually. The $316 million for Ascend Elements mentioned at the beginning was intended for a plant in Kentucky, where components for new batteries were to be manufactured from recycled electric vehicle batteries. According to Linh Austin, president and CEO of the company, Ascend Elements is sticking to the plan. In addition, $206 million of the DOE funding has already been paid out, so the cancellation would affect the remaining $110 million or so.

American Battery Technology is seeking $57.7 million in funding to build a lithium hydroxide production facility in Nevada. Anovion is seeking $117 million to produce synthetic graphite in Alabama. And for the sake of completeness, LuxWall is receiving $31.7 million for a modern glass factory in Detroit. According to information from E&E News, some of the companies have lodged appeals against the cancellation of their funding.

(Trump won 51 percent of the vote in North Carolina last year, beating then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 3.2 points.)
For Democrats to compete in any of the new 11 GOP-leaning North Carolina districts, the national mood would have to resemble 2018, Trump’s first midterm election.
District 11 in Western North Carolina has the GOP’s smallest lean, at 9.7 percentage points.
Take, for example, the 2024 race for North Carolina governor, which might be considered Democrats’ best-case scenario.","State Sen. Ralph Hise didn’t hide Republicans’ reasons for overhauling the state’s congressional map on Monday morning.

“The motivation behind this redraw is simple and singular: Draw a new map that will bring an additional Republican seat to the North Carolina congressional delegation,” Hise said, introducing the bill to the Senate’s elections committee. Hise drew the map and was its sole defender at the hearing.

“Republicans hold a razor-thin margin in the United States House of Representatives, and if Democrats flip four seats in the upcoming midterm elections, they will take control of the House and torpedo President Trump’s agenda,” he said.

The current map contains 10 safe Republican seats, three safe Democratic seats, and one swing district held by a Democrat. The new map turns the battleground 1st District, in Eastern North Carolina, red. It passed the Senate on Monday evening on a party-line vote—after Republicans cleared the gallery amid chants of “Cheaters!”—and will likely be approved by the House by Wednesday morning. Gov. Josh Stein cannot veto redistricting legislation.

Assuming courts don’t intervene, the state’s 2020, 2022, 2024, and 2026 congressional contests will have taken place under different maps.

Democratic Sen. Gladys Robinson of Guilford County asked Hise how many of the districts were competitive under the new map.

“Wherever you set the standards at competitive—if it’s at 56, 57 percent—does that make it a competitive district?” Hise replied. “Then the answer is up to 11 districts that are competitive within the system. If you draw that number to 51, then none of the districts will be considered competitive.”

In other words, none of the districts has a close partisan split. But Hise was suggesting that, while the three urban Democratic districts are overwhelmingly blue—a gerrymandering tactic known as “packing”—the 11 GOP districts will be somewhat competitive because candidates don’t usually get more than 57 percent of the vote.

That’s not quite accurate. Trump would have earned at least 58 percent of the vote in three of the 11 GOP-leaning districts in 2024, had they been in place at the time, according to a legislative analysis. (Trump won 51 percent of the vote in North Carolina last year, beating then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 3.2 points.)

But Hise’s answer also undersells this reality: Absent a political earthquake, none of the new districts are competitive, based on The Assembly’s analysis of election data.

The analysis assessed each new district’s partisan lean by averaging the margins of victory of the presidential contests in 2024 and 2020 and the U.S. Senate race in 2022 within the districts’ boundaries.

It found that the three blue districts—centered in Durham, Raleigh, and Charlotte—have Democratic advantages of 38 to 48 points, making it all but impossible for Republicans to win them. The 11 GOP districts, meanwhile, have advantages ranging from 9.7 points to 19 points. (The state has a Republican lean of about 2.6 points.)

Though smaller, those margins are also nearly insurmountable for Democrats.

Michael Bitzer, a professor of political science at Catawba College and author of Redistricting and Gerrymandering in North Carolina: Battlelines in the Tar Heel State, told The Assembly last week that seats are considered safe, no matter the political headwinds, with a 10-point partisan advantage.

For Democrats to compete in any of the new 11 GOP-leaning North Carolina districts, the national mood would have to resemble 2018, Trump’s first midterm election.

That year, Democratic candidates for the U.S. House won the cumulative national vote by 8.6 points. Replicating their performance in 2026 would mean an 11.1-point swing from 2024, when Republicans won the U.S. House national vote by 2.5 points.

The cumulative congressional vote isn’t evenly distributed across the country, however, and it’s far from certain that a big Democratic night nationally would trickle down to North Carolina. During 2018’s blue wave, a majority of the state’s voters backed Republican U.S. House candidates, and the GOP claimed 10 of 13 seats.

Democratic gains might also be limited by incumbency. District 11 in Western North Carolina has the GOP’s smallest lean, at 9.7 percentage points. But in 2024, U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards ran four points ahead of Trump in his district.

In the 1st District, Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis ran five points ahead of Harris to narrowly win reelection in 2024. But his redrawn district is now about eight points more Republican, giving it a 10.7-point GOP lean. It’s possible he could capitalize on an anti-Trump backlash, but it would be a steep climb.

Further complicating matters, the new map moved Davis’ home into District 3. And U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, who represents District 3, has suggested that he might run in the new District 1. (Members of Congress don’t have to live in the district they represent.)

In the other GOP-held districts, a Republican candidate would have to completely collapse before even a high-quality Democrat could have a chance. Take, for example, the 2024 race for North Carolina governor, which might be considered Democrats’ best-case scenario.

Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson by 14.8 points, the widest margin in a governor’s race since 1980. Robinson’s campaign was derailed by a history of incendiary comments and allegations that the self-styled culture warrior had once frequented porn shops in Greensboro and had called himself a “black NAZI” who liked transgender porn on a porn site’s forum.

With his landslide—outperforming the Democratic presidential candidate by 18 points—Stein would have won 10 of the new map’s 11 Republican strongholds, had the districts been in place at the time. But not by much.

In six of those districts, Stein’s margin would have been less than three points.

These changes stem from the “Big and Beautiful” Act signed by the Trump administration in July.

Originally planned to become the “world’s largest solar power farm,” this decision marks the latest case of the Trump administration frequently halting renewable energy projects, indicating a systematic impact on the U.S. new energy industry.

According to British media reports, the “Esmeralda 7” project covered an area of 185 square miles (close to the size of Las Vegas) and was jointly developed by companies including NextEra Energy. It included seven solar farms and energy storage systems, with a planned capacity of 6.2 GW, enough to power nearly 2 million households. The project initiated its permitting process during the Biden administration but has now been terminated. Patrick Donnelly, Director of the Center for Biological Diversity in Nevada, stated that all solar projects on public lands in the state have stalled.

“Esmeralda 7” is not an isolated case. In August, the Trump administration canceled the “Lava Ridge” wind power project in Idaho, citing “legal flaws.” In the same month, the Department of Transportation cut $679 million in federal funding for 12 offshore wind projects. In May, the administration slashed $3.7 billion in clean energy projects, affecting the hydrogen sector, prompting companies like Australia’s Woodside to subsequently halt their U.S. hydrogen projects. In October, the Department of Energy terminated 223 green energy projects, involving $7.56 billion, many of which were located in states that support the Democratic Party. White House officials described this as ending the “Green New Scam,” while Democrats criticized it as “political retaliation.”

Trump has repeatedly denounced climate change as a “hoax,” claiming that wind and solar energy drive up costs. However, his statements contradict data: the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that wind and solar are the fastest-growing energy sources in the U.S., accounting for 17% of total electricity generation last year. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA), due to U.S. policy adjustments, has nearly halved its renewable energy growth forecast for 2030, expecting new capacity additions from 2025 to 2030 to shrink from 500 GW to 250 GW.

These changes stem from the “Big and Beautiful” Act signed by the Trump administration in July. The act terminates electric vehicle tax credits, ends wind and solar tax incentives ahead of schedule, while favoring fossil fuels by allowing new oil and gas drilling sites and shortening the approval cycle for shale gas projects. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has also ceased support for new energy projects on farmland.

Although some developers still express willingness to cooperate, and a rush to install projects is anticipated, the policy volatility has severely undermined investor confidence. Institutions like McKinsey point out that the U.S. hydrogen market will remain sluggish in the long term, and the country’s competitiveness in the global low-carbon transition is continuously weakening.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 09:59:49.177242

For the quarter ending in September, GM reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.80, exceeding analysts’ expectations of $2.31. However, revenue for the quarter slightly decreased to $48.6 billion. Earlier this month, GM took a $1.6 billion charge related to its changes in EV strategy.

CEO Mary Barra acknowledged that the company might face additional EV-related charges but stated that addressing overcapacity will help reduce losses by 2026.

The EV market still faces challenges, as the $7,500 federal tax credit for battery-powered models expired at the end of September. Despite this, EVs make up less than 10% of GM’s total sales.

Additionally, GM had planned a program allowing dealers to extend tax-credit benefits on EV leases, but canceled the initiative after pushback from lawmakers, including Ohio Republican Senator Bernie Moreno. Other automakers, such as Hyundai and Stellantis, continue offering incentives to lower EV prices for consumers.

Barra has shifted the company’s messaging away from the previous goal of producing only EVs by 2035, emphasizing that future vehicle production will follow customer demand.

When examining the scale of energy requirements, a single aluminium smelter demands approximately 11 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, equivalent to powering metropolitan areas the size of Boston or Nashville for an entire year. This massive power consumption creates a direct correlation between electricity pricing and production economics that shapes the entire industry landscape.

Power Consumption Benchmarks for Smelting Operations

The energy intensity of aluminium manufacturing creates unique challenges for US producers attempting to compete in global markets:

• Electricity costs represent approximately 40% of total production expenses

• Power consumption accounts for roughly 80% of industry carbon emissions

• Single smelter annual consumption equals 11 terawatt-hours

• Production economics depend entirely on securing long-term, low-cost energy contracts

Industry experts emphasise that aluminium smelting requires consistent, uninterrupted power supply to maintain operational efficiency. The energy-intensive nature of the electrolytic process means that even minor fluctuations in electricity costs can dramatically impact profit margins and investment decisions.

What Makes US Electricity Prices Uncompetitive for Aluminium Production?

American industrial electricity rates have created substantial cost disadvantages compared to international competitors, particularly following energy market deregulation that began in 1977. This deregulation process fundamentally transformed the competitive landscape for energy-intensive manufacturing operations.

Current US Industrial Power Pricing Structure

The Aluminum Association reported significant variations in 2023 industrial power costs across states with idled primary aluminium capacity:

State Industrial Electricity Rate (per MWh) Current Smelter Status Kentucky $65.50 Idled capacity Indiana $82.40 Idled capacity South Carolina $70-75* Limited operation Washington $45-55* Active production

*Rates require verification from state utility commission data

International Cost Comparison Analysis

Canadian Competitive Advantage:

Canadian aluminium smelters maintain significant cost advantages through access to abundant hydroelectric power resources. Average purchased electrical costs for Canadian smelters range from $26.50 to $41.00 per megawatt-hour, creating a substantial pricing gap that has reshaped North American aluminium trade flows.

The United States sources nearly two-thirds of its primary aluminium from Canada, highlighting the direct relationship between energy costs and import dependence. This energy cost differential of $24-$56 per MWh below US rates represents a 60-100% cost disadvantage for domestic producers.

Competitive Threshold Requirements:

Industry analysis indicates that viable aluminium smelting operations require electricity prices below $40 per MWh with guaranteed long-term contracts spanning ten years or more. Current US industrial rates of $65-$82 per MWh exceed this viability threshold by 62-105%, making new investment economically challenging without substantial policy intervention.

How Are Data Centers Competing with Smelters for Electricity Supply?

The emergence of artificial intelligence and cloud computing has created unprecedented competition for industrial-scale electricity supply, fundamentally altering power market dynamics and pricing structures across the United States.

Data Center Electricity Demand Growth Projections

According to US Department of Energy reports, data center electricity consumption has experienced explosive growth:

Year Data Center Consumption (TWh) Percentage of US Total Growth Rate 2014 48 1.8%* Baseline 2023 176 4.4% 267% increase 2028 (projected) 325-580 6.7-12% 85-230% additional

*Percentage calculation requires verification

Price Competition Dynamics

The Aluminum Association describes data center electricity demand as price-inelastic, meaning consumption levels remain relatively constant regardless of price fluctuations. This characteristic allows technology companies to outbid traditional industrial electricity consumers significantly.

Critical Price Differential:

• Technology sector pricing tolerance: Up to $115 per MWh

• Aluminium smelter maximum viability: $40 per MWh

• Competitive gap: 188% price differential

• Market impact: Smelters cannot compete with unlimited technology sector budgets

The Constellation Energy agreement with Microsoft to reopen Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania demonstrates how technology companies can secure dedicated power supplies at premium rates, fundamentally reshaping electricity market priorities and availability for traditional industrial users.

As Jensen Huang, President and CEO of Nvidia, has emphasised, energy availability represents the primary constraint on AI technology expansion and profitability. This creates direct competition with traditional industrial electricity consumers, driving up prices and reducing availability for manufacturing operations.

Which Energy Sources Could Revitalise US Aluminium Smelting?

The path toward competitive American aluminium production requires strategic energy portfolio development, balancing cost considerations, reliability requirements, and environmental objectives to create viable long-term solutions. Furthermore, the integration of renewable energy solutions within industrial applications presents both opportunities and challenges.

Natural Gas Expansion Potential

The current administration's energy policy emphasises accelerated natural gas development through streamlined pipeline approval processes. In addition, insights from the US natural gas recovery suggest potential cost benefits for industrial users.

Policy Direction Benefits:

• Accelerated pipeline approvals to increase supply capacity

• Lower fuel costs compared to coal or nuclear alternatives

• Enhanced distribution networks for industrial customers

• Reduced emissions relative to coal-fired generation

However, natural gas expansion faces environmental trade-offs regarding greenhouse gas emissions and long-term sustainability commitments within the aluminium industry's carbon reduction goals.

Nuclear Power Renaissance for Industrial Applications

Small Modular Reactor (SMR) Technology Development:

Small modular reactors represent a potential solution for providing dedicated, baseload power to energy-intensive industrial operations. However, industry experts caution that significant development timelines create challenges for near-term solutions.

Richard Rast, CEO of Highland Materials, indicates that meaningful SMR deployment will require approximately one decade for significant commercial availability. The complexity of nuclear reactor construction means each subsequent facility effectively represents a first-of-its-kind engineering challenge despite standardised designs.

International Nuclear Integration Precedent:

Emirates Global Aluminium announced low-carbon aluminium production powered by the UAE's Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant in early August 2025, demonstrating nuclear power's capability for supporting large-scale smelting operations. This precedent provides a potential model for US industrial nuclear applications.

Nuclear Infrastructure Investment Requirements:

New nuclear facilities require substantial capital investment and extended development timelines. Large-scale nuclear plants demand $5-8 billion in initial investment with construction periods extending 8-12 years for completion.

Renewable Energy Integration Strategies

Solar and Wind Implementation Challenges:

Renewable energy sources face specific challenges for aluminium smelting applications due to the industry's requirement for continuous, uninterrupted power supply. Intermittency concerns create operational difficulties that require grid storage solutions or backup generation capacity.

Policy Uncertainty Impact:

The Trump Administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act rolls back Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives for solar and wind energy development. This policy shift creates uncertainty regarding renewable energy investment economics and long-term project viability for industrial applications.

Renewable Integration Benefits:

Despite implementation challenges, renewable energy integration demonstrates proven capabilities for reducing both emissions and long-term price volatility for manufacturers. Clean power sources can provide substantial pollution reduction benefits whilst supporting community health improvements near production facilities.

What Investment Barriers Prevent New US Smelter Development?

Despite tariff protections and policy support, fundamental economic and infrastructure challenges continue limiting domestic aluminium production expansion and new facility development. Consequently, the mining industry evolution reflects broader challenges facing energy-intensive industries.

Capital Investment Requirements

New aluminium smelter development demands substantial financial commitments and extended timelines that challenge traditional investment models:

Investment Component Cost Range Development Timeline New smelter construction $5 billion* 5 years Power infrastructure development $1-2 billion** 3-5 years** Environmental compliance systems $200-500 million** 2-3 years** Workforce development programmes $50-100 million** 1-2 years**

Current US Smelting Capacity Analysis

Operational Facilities Status (2025):

The United States currently operates four primary aluminium smelters with a combined annual production capacity of 683,500 tonnes. Ownership distribution includes two facilities operated by Century Aluminum and two by Alcoa Corporation.

However, only two smelters currently operate at full capacity, indicating significant underutilisation of existing infrastructure. This operational pattern reflects the ongoing challenges of electricity costs and market competitiveness.

Historical Production Context:

The contrast with historical production levels demonstrates the scale of industry decline:

• 1980 peak production: Over 4.65 million tonnes from 33 sites

• Current capacity: 683,500 tonnes from 4 facilities

• Production decline: 85% reduction over 45 years

• Facility closure: 88% reduction in operating sites

The Aluminum Association identifies electricity price deregulation starting in 1977 as the single most important factor leading to the near total demise of the primary aluminium industry in the United States.

Century Aluminum Investment Example:

Century Aluminum announced a $50 million investment in early August 2025 to restart more than 50,000 tonnes of idled capacity at its Mt. Holly smelter in South Carolina. The company targets full capacity operation by June 30, 2026, demonstrating incremental capacity expansion rather than large-scale new development.

How Do Trade Policies Interact with Energy Costs in Aluminium Markets?

Section 232 tariffs have created market protection for domestic producers, but energy costs remain the determining factor for long-term competitiveness and investment decision-making across the aluminium industry. Moreover, the broader implications of tariffs and investment patterns affect industry development strategies.

Tariff Impact on Market Dynamics

Midwest Premium Evolution:

Fastmarkets assessed the daily aluminium P1020A premium at 74-76 cents per pound on September 29, 2025, reflecting tariff influence on domestic pricing structures. Whilst tariffs have successfully raised the Midwest premium, this protection has not translated into substantial new capacity development.

Industry Investment Response Patterns

Limited Investment Response:

Industry leaders emphasise that government expectations regarding tariff-driven capacity expansion overlook fundamental investment impracticalities. Long-term capital commitments require assurances regarding price stability and input costs, particularly energy expenses representing substantial production components.

William Oplinger, President and CEO of Alcoa, has indicated that long-term investment decisions cannot be justified by tariff protection alone without simultaneous access to long-term, low-cost energy contracts.

Century Aluminum Strategic Approach:

Century Aluminum specifically cited Trump's Section 232 tariff increases for its Mt. Holly smelter restart investment. However, the company continues pursuing additional smelter capacity development, requiring guaranteed access to massive quantities of reliable, uninterrupted, low-cost electricity.

Emirates Global Aluminum US Development:

Emirates Global Aluminium selected the Tulsa Port of Inola in northeastern Oklahoma as the site for its proposed US smelter. The company remains in negotiations with Public Service Company of Oklahoma regarding power contract terms, with investment scale potentially reaching multi-billion dollar commitments.

What Role Will Environmental Regulations Play in Future Smelting Operations?

Climate policies and emissions standards increasingly influence aluminium production strategies, creating both regulatory challenges and competitive opportunities for domestic manufacturers pursuing sustainable operations. Similarly, the broader context of US uranium production illustrates how energy resource development affects industrial competitiveness.

Industry Emissions Profile:

Aluminium production accounts for approximately 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with electricity consumption driving 80% of smelting-related emissions. This emissions profile creates opportunities for substantial pollution reduction through renewable energy integration and technology upgrades.

Environmental Benefits of Energy Transition:

Switching to renewable energy sources and innovative technologies can reduce pollution substantially, providing benefits for environmental protection and community health near production facilities. Clean power integration demonstrates proven capabilities for lowering both emissions and long-term price volatility.

Clean Energy Incentive Programmes

Inflation Reduction Act Implications:

Federal programmes established under the Inflation Reduction Act created opportunities for investments in renewable energy systems and technology upgrades that could reduce costs and emissions simultaneously, potentially improving American aluminium competitiveness in global markets.

However, the Trump Administration's efforts to dismantle these programmes through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act may limit opportunities for clean energy integration and technological advancement within the aluminium sector.

Policy Uncertainty Challenges:

Relying primarily on fossil fuel energy sources creates sustained high pollution levels and exposes manufacturers to volatile power cost fluctuations. Policy uncertainty regarding renewable energy incentives complicates long-term investment planning for sustainable production systems.

Future Outlook for US Aluminium Smelting Energy Economics

The intersection of energy policy, technological advancement, and market dynamics will determine whether American aluminium production can achieve long-term competitiveness in global markets through strategic energy partnerships and infrastructure development. Furthermore, US aluminium smelting and energy costs will continue to be the primary determinant of industry viability.

Strategic Priorities for Industry Development

• Expanding low-cost power generation through diverse energy portfolio development

• Creating innovative financing mechanisms for industrial energy contract structures

• Developing policy frameworks that balance environmental goals with manufacturing competitiveness

• Coordinating stakeholder efforts across government, utilities, and industry participants

Investment Decision Factors

Success in revitalising US aluminium smelting and energy costs competitiveness will require addressing the fundamental energy cost disadvantage that has limited domestic production for decades. Industry participants emphasise that sustained electricity prices below $40 per MWh with guaranteed long-term contracts represent essential prerequisites for viable operations.

Technology Integration Opportunities

Small modular nuclear reactors and renewable energy systems offer potential pathways for achieving competitive energy costs, though implementation timelines and capital requirements create near-term challenges. The UAE's successful integration of nuclear power for aluminium production provides an international precedent for clean energy solutions.

Market Competitiveness Requirements

Domestic aluminium producers must compete simultaneously with low-cost international suppliers and price-inelastic data center electricity demand. This dual competitive pressure requires coordinated policy responses addressing both energy infrastructure development and industrial competitiveness support.

The future of US aluminium smelting and energy costs depends fundamentally on creating sustainable, affordable power supply solutions that can support the energy-intensive requirements of modern aluminium production whilst maintaining global competitiveness and environmental responsibility.

State Rep. Drew Darby, R-San Angelo, represents Texas House District 72 in the Legislature and serves as chairman of the House Committee on Energy Resources.","Texas has long been a powerhouse of American energy leadership. Last year alone, our state generated more than twice as much electricity as the next-largest state, accounting for 13% of all electricity produced nationwide.

We lead the nation in crude oil and natural gas production, wind generation and refining capacity — with our 35 refineries accounting for roughly one-third of U.S. petroleum output. Texans understand energy, and we know what it takes to deliver it reliably and at scale.

But despite our unmatched energy potential, a major obstacle threatens our ability to meet growing national and global demand: the federal permitting process.

Red tape, bureaucratic inefficiencies and outdated laws have turned the system into a maze of delays and uncertainty. The truth is if Congress does not act soon, America will fall behind in energy production, manufacturing and the infrastructure needed to power our future.

As chairman of the Texas House Committee on Energy Resources, I hear regularly from companies ready to invest billions in new energy projects from oil and gas development to data centers and renewable energy infrastructure. These projects face years of environmental reviews, redundant oversight and costly litigation.

To make matters worse, electricity demand is projected to rise by as much as 25% by 2030 while experts warn that without action, power outages could increase by 100 times in that same period. We cannot afford that kind of regulatory paralysis.

Congress must take bold action now.

The National Environmental Policy Act, signed into law over 50 years ago, was designed with good intentions — to ensure responsible stewardship of our natural environment. But over the decades, its implementation has strayed far from its purpose. What began as a tool for accountability has become an instrument of obstruction as frivolous lawsuits and duplicative reviews have delayed countless projects that already meet high environmental standards.

Congress can and must fix this.

Lawmakers should modernize NEPA to provide clear statutory guidance, streamline review timelines and limit endless litigation. These reforms should simply and plainly define the scope of environmental reviews, reduce redundancy between federal agencies and ensure that once a project is approved, it cannot be endlessly re-litigated in court.

These are commonsense steps that would give investors, workers and communities the certainty they deserve.

However, it is important to understand that modernization does not mean abandoning environmental protection. Texas has proven time and time again that cutting edge energy development and environmental stewardship can go hand in hand. These targeted, smart reforms can maintain the high standards Americans expect while ensuring that reviews are efficient, transparent and predictable.

Permitting reform is not a partisan issue; it is an American issue.

Whether your priority is energy security, economic growth or environmental progress, all depend on a permitting process that works and makes sense. Here, Congress has an opportunity — and a responsibility — to unleash the full potential of American energy by cutting through the bureaucracy that stifles it.

Texas stands ready to lead as we always have. Now we need Washington to do its part.

The rule, which restricts American firms from exporting goods and technology to companies partially owned by sanctioned entities, has drawn criticism for its potential to disrupt billions of dollars in U.S. exports. This development has sparked a debate over the balance between national security and economic interests, as well as the broader implications for U.S.-China relations. The response from businesses reflects the urgent need for clarity and resolution in this rapidly evolving situation.

Concerns Over Economic Impact

The National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC), representing firms such as Oracle, Amazon.com, and Exxon Mobil, has voiced strong opposition to the Affiliates Rule. The council argues that the rule undermines efforts to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and expand global exports. In a letter to President Trump, NFTC President Jake Colvin emphasized that the rule has resulted in an “immediate pause of billions in U.S. exports,” thwarting economic objectives.

This pause is particularly concerning for industries that rely heavily on international markets. The rule’s implementation threatens to exclude U.S. companies from critical supply chains, encouraging foreign entities to seek alternatives. This shift could have long-term ramifications, not only for the affected companies but also for the U.S. economy as a whole.

National Security Versus Economic Interests

The Affiliates Rule is part of a broader strategy by China hawks in Washington to limit the access of sanctioned Chinese firms to U.S. technology. The rule targets firms that are at least 50% owned by entities already on the U.S. Entity List, a measure intended to protect national security interests.

However, critics argue that the rule may inadvertently weaken U.S. national security by driving key global players to remove American companies from their supply chains. As China and other countries pivot to non-U.S. goods, the U.S. risks losing its influence and competitive edge in critical industries. This tension highlights the complex interplay between safeguarding national security and fostering economic growth, raising questions about the most effective path forward.

“They Just Put the Internet Underwater”: China’s First Ocean Data Center Is Running on Seawater and It’s Changing Everything

Delays and Bureaucratic Challenges

Compounding the issue, the Commerce Department has faced criticism for its handling of export license applications. The NFTC has accused the department of “significantly” slowing and even temporarily halting the processing of these applications, particularly those involving Chinese customers. This bureaucratic bottleneck has left thousands of licenses, worth billions of dollars, in limbo.

Such delays create uncertainty and strain for businesses that rely on timely export approvals to maintain their operations. The situation underscores the need for efficient and transparent processes within government agencies to support U.S. businesses in navigating complex international trade regulations.

Implications for U.S.-China Relations

The Affiliates Rule has also drawn a strong reaction from China, which has objected to the measure as part of a broader pattern of U.S. actions viewed as adversarial. The rule adds another layer of complexity to the already tense U.S.-China relationship, which has seen increased friction over trade, technology, and geopolitical issues.

This latest development could further strain diplomatic ties and impact negotiations on various fronts. As both countries grapple with these challenges, the potential for escalation remains a concern. The situation calls for careful diplomatic navigation to prevent further deterioration of the bilateral relationship.

The implementation of the Affiliates Rule represents a pivotal moment for U.S. trade policy, highlighting the delicate balance between protecting national security and promoting economic interests. As stakeholders grapple with the rule’s implications, the need for dialogue and cooperation becomes increasingly evident. How will the U.S. navigate these challenges to maintain its economic and strategic leadership in an interconnected world?

We therefore need to bring energy costs down if we are to safeguard Europe’s industrial competitiveness and sustain long-term growth.","Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at Norges Bank’s Climate Conference in Oslo, Norway

It is a pleasure to be at Norges Bank again.

When I last visited the central bank, back in the summer of 2016, the world – and Europe – were in a very different place.

The Paris Agreement, the international treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was not yet one year old, and still enjoyed strong support among all major powers.

A benign geopolitical environment also blurred the risks of Europe’s growing energy dependencies. Nord Stream-2, a new gas pipeline project, had recently been announced, promising to deliver cheap Russian gas to the continent.

Since then, our world has changed dramatically.

We are witnessing a growing denial of the climate crisis and a backlash against green initiatives. The war in Ukraine further exposed Europe’s energy dependencies as strategic vulnerabilities, driving up gas prices after the cut-off of the Russian pipeline supply.

As a result, energy prices have risen sharply, since gas remains the marginal price setter in the EU energy market for most of the time. This has weighed heavily on the competitiveness of European companies and pushed up household bills.

In this new environment, many countries face an increasingly difficult trade-off among three key energy policy goals.

We need energy that is secure – because the geopolitical reality has changed.

We need energy that is sustainable – because the climate reality has not changed.

And we need energy that is affordable for households and businesses alike.

Different countries are approaching this trade-off in different ways.

Some are seeking to lower oil prices and strengthen energy security, even at the expense of the climate. Others are committing to renewables to deliver reliable, clean energy – but are finding the costs of the transition higher than expected.

Ultimately, only clean energy has the potential to deliver on all three goals, as Norway demonstrates. The share of renewables in energy consumption here ranks among the highest in the world , while household energy prices are around two-thirds of the EU average.

But for other countries to achieve the same, they must act more decisively.

The transition to a renewables-based system requires a massive investment push. The faster policymakers can create an environment in which such investment can flourish, the easier and less costly the transition will be.

As the Norwegian poet Olav H. Hauge once wrote, “ Dette er din veg […] Og det er uråd å snu.”, which translates as: “This is your road […] And it is impossible to turn back.”

Today, I will explore how Europe’s road to renewables can deliver powerful benefits, if we unlock the right conditions.

Europe’s energy landscape

Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe had in effect prioritised two goals of energy policy: sustainability and affordability.

As part of its Fit for 55 targets, the EU aimed to raise the share of renewables in its energy consumption to as much as 45% by 2030. At the same time, almost half of its gas imports came from Russia.

This combination kept energy costs contained, facilitating Europe’s competitiveness.

Energy remained relatively cheap for energy-intensive industries, and periods of intermittency – when renewable output was low and gas served as backup – did not lead to significant price volatility.

But we ultimately paid the price for neglecting the third goal: energy security. When the geopolitical context changed, the consequences for our economy were severe – consequences that we, as central bankers, could not ignore.

First, we saw a surge in inflation.

Energy makes up less than one-tenth of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices consumption basket in the euro area. Yet when prices are both high and volatile, energy can have an outsized impact – not only on direct energy costs, but also on all other goods and services that depend on energy as an input.

Energy inflation in the euro area surged to 37% in 2022, pushing headline inflation to a record 8.4% that year. In response, the ECB had to implement the fastest monetary tightening in its history to bring inflation back under control.

Surging energy prices led to a second consequence: a lasting negative impact on our competitiveness.

Although the acute phase of the energy shock has passed, the new geopolitical reality has left an enduring imprint on Europe’s energy costs, weakening its position relative to other regions.

Electricity prices in the EU remain about two and a half times higher than in the United States, and gas prices almost four times higher. This gap is shaping how firms invest and innovate, and even where they choose to locate.

ECB research shows that European firms significantly reduce their capital and R&D expenditures in response to energy shocks – unlike their US counterparts.

There are growing concerns, too, that higher energy prices may even be contributing to deindustrialisation as European firms struggle against foreign competition.

The mistakes of Europe’s past are also creating difficulties for its future.

Higher energy prices may make it harder for Europe to fully embrace the new technologies that will drive future productivity.

Access to cheap, plentiful energy will be crucial if Europe is to make the most of artificial intelligence. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that electricity demand from data centres will more than double by 2030.

We therefore need to bring energy costs down if we are to safeguard Europe’s industrial competitiveness and sustain long-term growth.

Yet we cannot afford to do so by trading off other goals. We must ensure that our energy is secure and that we remain firmly committed to the climate.

The promise and challenges of renewables

The only viable path for Europe to achieve these objectives is to rely more on locally produced clean energy. This path could help meet goals on all three fronts.

First, renewables, alongside other clean technologies for producing electricity, are central to any credible plan to reduce the impact of climate change.

Second, renewables offer a level of energy independence that, given our lack of natural resources, Europe would never reach with imported fossil fuels.

Third, as the marginal cost of renewable electricity is close to zero, a system based largely on renewables should ultimately bring down energy prices.

But there is sometimes scepticism whether such price reductions are possible in Europe over the short to medium term.

The key issue is that building and operating a renewables-based system involves significant additional expenses, known as “system costs”, which are passed on to energy bills.

These costs come from several sources. While some costs are unavoidable, others can be minimised if we are truly ambitious with the transition.

To start with, the transition to renewables requires massive investments in new generation capacity and modernised grids. The European Commission estimates that these will require an annual investment of nearly €150 billion.

But that number may rise further if restrictions on critical raw materials increase input costs or delay projects. The IEA finds that, if we exclude the top supplier, global supply could meet only about two-thirds of global demand for lithium, just over half for nickel and less than half for rare earths by 2035.

Then there are costs related to the inherent intermittency of renewables. This leads to higher price volatility, which ultimately feeds into higher average bills.

We saw this in November last year, when low wind output across much of Europe – especially in Germany – prompted a surge in gas-fired generation to meet demand. Electricity prices jumped in several countries, and the effects were also felt here in Norway.

There are also costs associated with curtailment – that is, when renewable output is deliberately reduced to keep the system balanced – often resulting in payments to providers.

The European Commission estimates that, by 2040, we could lose up to ten times more renewable energy generation than we lose today owing to grid constraints.

But there are three reasons why I see these challenges as surmountable.

First, while we cannot eliminate the costs associated with intermittency – after all, we cannot control the weather – we can substantially reduce them if we push through with the investment in generation capacity, grids and storage.

One recent study estimates that if European countries meet their solar and wind targets, electricity prices could fall by more than a quarter by 2030 – and become less volatile – owing to a weaker link between electricity and gas prices.

Curtailment costs would also fall: further research finds that each euro invested in upgrading the electricity grid translates into over €2 saved in system costs.

Second, infrastructure investment could be particularly effective in Europe owing to our geographic diversity. Southern Europe performs strongly in solar power, while northern and Atlantic coastal regions excel in wind energy.

Deeper energy market integration – for example through more cross-border interconnectors – would let countries share surplus electricity, smooth fluctuations from intermittent sources and use generation and grid capacity more efficiently.

Research underlines the benefits. Deeper cross-border integration is found to cut overall system costs by around 9% – equivalent to €26 billion annually – and reduce electricity prices more than isolated national approaches.

Third, the technology is moving firmly in our favour. Not only are renewable solutions becoming much cheaper, but the ability to store renewable energy through periods of intermittency is also improving fast.

The IEA finds that the cost of clean technologies has fallen by more than half over the past decade , and that battery pack costs are now roughly a tenth of what they were 15 years ago.

With pooling and circular economy strategies, we can also reduce the resource intensity of these technologies. For example, one study estimates that the EU could potentially meet up to two-thirds of its metals demand for clean technologies in 2050 through local recycling.

These points make it clear that the solution to high “system costs” is not to weaken our clean energy targets and delay building new generation and grids. That would put Europe in the worst of both worlds.

In that scenario, our total investment costs would not go down. Instead, we would have a longer period where intermittency keeps our energy prices tied to gas, and where curtailment leads to wasteful payments and energy being squandered.

But if we manage to quickly unlock the investments needed to build a world-class renewables infrastructure, Europe can keep those other costs to a minimum.

Unlocking the potential of clean energy

So how can we unlock that investment? Policymakers must provide two things.

First, the right environment for financing.

If we factor in decarbonising industry, transport and energy supply, the financing needs for the green transition are massive – estimated at €1.2 trillion per year. The private sector will have to account for over two-thirds of this investment.

But even though Europe has ample private savings, current financing arrangements are not channelling supply towards demand. Nearly four in ten European firms see the lack of investor willingness to finance green investment as a very significant obstacle.

The missing link here is capital markets. Debt and equity financing currently rank lowest among the funding sources that firms expect to use for green investment. Deepening and integrating EU capital markets is critical to support the large-scale investments we need.

The good news is that the political momentum behind the capital markets union has never been greater – as underlined by the German Chancellor only a few days ago.

Second, policymakers need to create a predictable environment for investment.

Investors will not step forward if the green transition is clouded by uncertainty – especially if they also see growing pushback against green initiatives in other parts of the world.

Creating the right environment begins with credibility: following through on existing green targets and maintaining a stable carbon price. Wavering on those commitments would risk chilling investment just when it is most needed.

Credibility must also be matched by speed. Across Europe, investors face slow and fragmented permitting procedures that delay progress.

In some Member States, completing the permitting process can take up to five years for utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects and up to nine years for onshore wind. These timelines must be shortened if the EU is to meet its green goals.

Finally, policymakers must build confidence in future electricity demand.

For instance, in Europe, electricity still faces higher taxes than gas, discouraging electrification. While this gap will narrow as carbon pricing is extended to heating fuels, governments can already act by lowering electricity taxes.

Collectively, Europe has the resources to succeed. What it now needs are deeper capital markets and steadfast policies to turn its green ambitions into reality. The goal, ultimately, is to make progress towards a true energy union.

Conclusion

Let me conclude.

Europe’s recent energy crisis has revealed a hard truth: our dependence on imported fossil fuels is no longer sustainable. An accelerating climate crisis makes this lesson even clearer.

Renewables offer the clearest path to minimise the trade-offs between the energy policy goals of security, sustainability and affordability.

We know the road that Europe must take – and it is a path that citizens support. Nearly nine in ten Europeans want the EU to expand renewable energy.

Some of the costs associated with the transition, such as the required investment, will be unavoidable. But if we create the ideal conditions in which that investment can flourish, we can ensure that the transition remains cost-effective.

The anthropologist Jane Goodall, who sadly passed away this month, reminded us: “What you do makes a difference. And you have to decide what difference you want to make.”

Europe must now decide. Either we remain with an unsustainable and expensive status quo, or we create an environment that can unlock the investment needed for sustainable, secure and affordable energy.

I am confident Europe will choose wisely.

In some exciting news for fans of rampant deforestation and degradation of Australia’s environment (and the broader environment in general), the new Environmental Protection Agency looks set to be another toothless tiger.

This comes as the government looks set to push through changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act), which will leave the EPA with as much real power as the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC).

Made popular during the 2022 election by a raft of Teals and Independents, the NACC was heralded as a big scary anti-corruption body that would punish all of the dodgy shit that goes on in politics.

However, years on from its implementation, it’s proved as tough and scary as a morbidly obese security guard at a suburban shopping centre who could not give a single shit about his job.

And it looks like the country might have another ineffective body to enforce rules filled with loopholes.

“Yeah it should keep us humming as the deforestation capital of the world,” said Ernest Green, a local Environmental Law Professor at South Betoota Polytechnic.

“It’s a title our leaders seem to quietly wear with pride, so bringing in an EPA that will have its hands tied on deforestation should keep us in our unrightful place.”

“But hey, being able to say they introduced an Environmental Protection Agency sounds really nice for our government.”

“Who knows, hopefully they actually decide to close the loopholes in our current environment laws that allow rampant logging and bulldozing of forest and bushland.”

WILLACY COUNTY — Scattered across the acres of open fields, dozens of wind turbines stood tall one morning last month, some moved their blades with the wind as designed. Others didn’t move at all.

The inactivity at the Las Majadas Wind project was by design. This set of windmills in the Rio Grande Valley were generating more power than could be used. Now one company has a plan to bring those turbines to life.

Soluna Holdings, a data center developer focused on using renewable energy, broke ground on its data center here that will be used to manage data for Bitcoin hosting and artificial intelligence. Data centers have sprung up across the state, housing servers and infrastructure that store and process our online activity. Their growth has been spurred, in part, by the growing use of AI.

As data centers face scrutiny over the energy required to power these facilities, as well as the water needed for their cooling systems, this facility is meant to circumvent waste by utilizing energy that would otherwise go unused.

“It became clear to us that there’s lots of energy out there. Lots of it is wasted,” Belizaire said. “And if you tap into that wasted energy, you actually can power this next revolution without materially reshaping the trajectory of our climate.”

Power is wasted, or “stranded,” largely because of insufficient infrastructure, according to Jeff Clark, president and CEO of Advanced Power Alliance, a group that advocates for renewable energy.

Clark said the state’s grid hasn’t kept pace with where new generation is being built. In particular, there aren’t enough transmission lines to deliver power to high demand areas, especially power generated in rural Texas

“Until new transmission lines are built to connect the two, the power that could be generated in those regions often has nowhere to go,” Clark said.

This new data center, Project Kati, is an example of what’s referred to as a flexible load — a facility that can ramp up or down its power use based on grid conditions. And its location near where power is being generated means it won’t require the use of long-distance transmission lines.

At peak capacity, the data center will use 166 mega watts of energy — about 16 times the estimated use of AT&T Stadium on game day, according to a 2013 report. The first phase will be built to deliver 83 megawatts of computing capacity for Bitcoin. The second 83 megawatt expansion will support artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

Soluna hopes to have part of the facility running in December with plans to complete the first phase in June or July.

Las Majadas Wind project, the farm that will power the datacenter, is co-owned by EDF Renewables North America and Masdar, a renewable energy company based in the United Arab Emirates.

Las Majadas is one of a handful of wind energy projects located in Willacy County, a county of little more than 20,000 people on the northeast corner of the Rio Grande Valley. Its largely rural landscape with wide open fields makes it an ideal location for such projects which include the Los Vientos wind farm, one of the largest wind projects in the country.

Willacy County Judge Aurelio “Keter” Guerra said securing these projects is an every day effort to allow their small county to prosper.

Soluna estimates the project will create 18 permanent, direct jobs within the first two to three years during the first phase. They expect an additional 75 jobs during the construction phase.

Regardless of the number of jobs created, Guerra said those positions will be high-paying. And, the most important benefit, he said, is the taxable value that it will bring to the county.

“Value is how counties survive,” he said. “Unlike cities that depend more on sales (taxes), counties depend more on value, and so these types of projects bring in value.”

He added, “For a small county like ours that operates on a $9 million budget, I think it’s great.”

Texas is uniquely positioned to see more of these types of projects.

Eric Gimon, a senior fellow with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank, said using “stranded” renewable energy is much easier to do in Texas because of favorable rules set by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Such policies include netting, which allows data centers to consume energy directly from the power generator, avoiding fees from ERCOT for using power from the grid.

Texas also allows “sleeving” which is when an intermediary retailer sells renewable energy from the generator to the buyer for a fee, allowing buyers to purchase energy at a negotiated price.

The benefit of cost stability is significant for data centers to secure the energy they need at a price they can afford through a long-term, predictable contract even in times of high market volatility.

Those benefits could play a role in drawing more data centers to the state that could make use of stranded energy.

Clark said electricity demand is expected to double over the next 10 years all across the country. To meet that demand, he said it will take collaboration among solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear, and energy storage technologies.

“The vision we have is an ‘all-of-the-above’ power mix — every resource working together to meet growing electricity demand,” Clark said. “Projects like this one in Willacy County are just the beginning of how flexible, innovative solutions can strengthen our grid and grow local economies.”

Gimon also expects to see more partnerships as more data centers take advantage of wind farms that are being underutilized.

“It is definitely a signal of things to come,” Gimon said. “There is not enough power to power up all the data centers that want to get built; you can’t build it fast enough.”

The conference was held at an important juncture for the river. This summer, a 308-mile stretch of the Ohio that runs past Louisville and Southern Indiana was named a National Water Trail. Meanwhile, the alliance and other groups are finalizing an ambitious ecological restoration plan for the Ohio River Basin, with a bipartisan effort underway to win federal support for it.

The Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting has been covering these developments and recently hosted a community conversation about the river.

Chris Lorentz, chair of the Ohio River Basin Alliance, told conference-goers their collaboration exemplifies the “movement” to protect and restore the Ohio River and its surrounding basin.

Lorentz told KyCIR the alliance, which includes members from 200-plus organizations, wants Congress to pass legislation – sponsored by Democratic U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville and Republican U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin of Salem, Indiana – to create a federal office to guide the restoration plan, paired with an initial investment of $350 million annually for five years.

“This is a game changer, once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-generation, opportunity,” he said. “We're asking for this now, and we're going to show that it's worth the investment.”

If they can get the restoration program rolling and then demonstrate its early effectiveness through measurable impacts and outcomes, he said they hope the U.S. government will keep investing in it indefinitely.

With the new national trail and the restoration plan, many people at the summit talked about the Ohio River Basin’s environmental future with a positive sense of possibility.

But they also discussed the challenges that lie ahead, from persistent pollution to a new president who has slashed funding for many environmental initiatives, such as an air pollution study in west Louisville.

The Ohio River Basin Restoration and Protection Plan focuses on how to improve the health of the networks of streams, rivers and wetlands that fill the basin that fans out across 14 states. The waterways are affected by many of the same issues, from invasive species to floods.

However, many Kentucky waters will be affected by a unique challenge: A new state law that greatly reduced restrictions on pollution.

For 50-plus years, Kentucky afforded state-level protections against pollution to basically all its surface waters and groundwater by defining them as “waters of the commonwealth.”

Earlier this year, however, the state’s Republican-run legislature passed Senate Bill 89, which reduced the scope of that definition to apply to fewer types of waters. That removed key pollution protections for much of the state’s groundwater, plus many headwater and ephemeral streams.

That cuts the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet’s authority to step in and take action if, for example, someone is fouling up a stream that is no longer subject to government restrictions on pollution, said Audrey Ernstberger, associate attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council. This leaves Kentuckians affected by such pollution with fewer remedies.

At a panel on SB 89, Ernstberger and representatives of other environmental groups noted that they worked together to mobilize thousands of Kentuckians against Senate Bill 89.

The vocal opposition didn’t stop the Republican-run legislature from passing the law, but panelists said lawmakers did take notice of the grassroots energy. Now, they’re working to keep people who participated in that legislative fight engaged in other efforts to protect Kentucky’s waters.

“We can tap them into Watershed Watch. We can tap them into permit watching – teaching people how to look at permits,” said Julia Finch, director of the Sierra Club’s Kentucky chapter. “We're all doing a little bit of democracy work here, because each time we do this and each time we go to the legislature, we're showing people how to be involved in the process.”

They also expressed hope that lawmakers will consider amending the new law and restore state protections for groundwater when the General Assembly reconvenes next year.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4f6484/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa6%2F6e%2Fd1db4811458d883eff3d8018df93%2Fimg-6141.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 07:59:08.570090

Data centers have sprung up across the state, housing servers and infrastructure that store and process our online activity. Their growth has been spurred, in part, by the growing use of AI.

As data centers face scrutiny over the energy required to power these facilities, as well as the water needed for their cooling systems, this facility is meant to circumvent waste by utilizing energy that would otherwise go unused.

“It became clear to us that there’s lots of energy out there. Lots of it is wasted,” Belizaire said. “And if you tap into that wasted energy, you actually can power this next revolution without materially reshaping the trajectory of our climate.”

Power is wasted, or “stranded,” largely because of insufficient infrastructure, according to Jeff Clark, president and CEO of Advanced Power Alliance, a group that advocates for renewable energy.

Clark said the state’s grid hasn’t kept pace with where new generation is being built. In particular, there aren’t enough transmission lines to deliver power to high demand areas, especially power generated in rural Texas

“Until new transmission lines are built to connect the two, the power that could be generated in those regions often has nowhere to go,” Clark said.

This new data center, Project Kati, is an example of what’s referred to as a flexible load — a facility that can ramp up or down its power use based on grid conditions. And its location near where power is being generated means it won’t require the use of long-distance transmission lines.

At peak capacity, the data center will use 166 mega watts of energy — about 16 times the estimated use of AT&T Stadium on game day, according to a 2013 report. The first phase will be built to deliver 83 megawatts of computing capacity for Bitcoin. The second 83 megawatt expansion will support artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.

Soluna hopes to have part of the facility running in December with plans to complete the first phase in June or July.

Las Majadas Wind project, the farm that will power the datacenter, is co-owned by EDF Renewables North America and Masdar, a renewable energy company based in the United Arab Emirates.

Las Majadas is one of a handful of wind energy projects located in Willacy County, a county of little more than 20,000 people on the northeast corner of the Rio Grande Valley. Its largely rural landscape with wide open fields makes it an ideal location for such projects which include the Los Vientos wind farm, one of the largest wind projects in the country.

Willacy County Judge Aurelio “Keter” Guerra said securing these projects is an every day effort to allow their small county to prosper.

Soluna estimates the project will create 18 permanent, direct jobs within the first two to three years during the first phase. They expect an additional 75 jobs during the construction phase.

Regardless of the number of jobs created, Guerra said those positions will be high-paying. And, the most important benefit, he said, is the taxable value that it will bring to the county.

“Value is how counties survive,” he said. “Unlike cities that depend more on sales (taxes), counties depend more on value, and so these types of projects bring in value.”

He added, “For a small county like ours that operates on a $9 million budget, I think it’s great.”

Texas is uniquely positioned to see more of these types of projects.

Eric Gimon, a senior fellow with Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank, said using “stranded” renewable energy is much easier to do in Texas because of favorable rules set by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Such policies include netting, which allows data centers to consume energy directly from the power generator, avoiding fees from ERCOT for using power from the grid.

Texas also allows “sleeving” which is when an intermediary retailer sells renewable energy from the generator to the buyer for a fee, allowing buyers to purchase energy at a negotiated price.

The benefit of cost stability is significant for data centers to secure the energy they need at a price they can afford through a long-term, predictable contract even in times of high market volatility.

Those benefits could play a role in drawing more data centers to the state that could make use of stranded energy.

Clark said electricity demand is expected to double over the next 10 years all across the country. To meet that demand, he said it will take collaboration among solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear, and energy storage technologies.

“The vision we have is an ‘all-of-the-above’ power mix — every resource working together to meet growing electricity demand,” Clark said. “Projects like this one in Willacy County are just the beginning of how flexible, innovative solutions can strengthen our grid and grow local economies.”

Gimon also expects to see more partnerships as more data centers take advantage of wind farms that are being underutilized.

“It is definitely a signal of things to come,” Gimon said. “There is not enough power to power up all the data centers that want to get built; you can’t build it fast enough.”

,Louisiana Environment,2025-10-21 09:28:31+00:00,News From The States,University students seek to safeguard Arkansas' natural resources through ballot initiative,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/university-students-seek-safeguard-arkansas-natural-resources-through-ballot-initiative,"Inspired by peers in Montana, four University of Arkansas students are working to protect the Natural State’s environment through a proposed constitutional amendment.
“One constitutional amendment in Arkansas isn’t going to fix everything, but it’ll fix part of it, and doing something’s better than nothing,” he said.
The students have been revising their proposal after Attorney General Tim Griffin rejected their initial submission on Oct. 3.
Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives such as the students’ proposed amendment, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The four students are continuing to work with Standerfer to revise their amendment and plan to submit their proposal as soon as possible.","Inspired by peers in Montana, four University of Arkansas students are working to protect the Natural State’s environment through a proposed constitutional amendment.

The Amendment to Keep Arkansas Natural would preserve the state’s outdoors and natural resources for recreation, economy and public health, and give Arkansans “the fundamental right to a clean and healthy environment.”

The proposed ballot measure would require the Legislature to enact laws to “protect wildlife and natural resources from unreasonable misuse,” and allow Arkansans to sue the state for violating the measure.

Kevin Durden, a UA sophomore and one of the drafters of the measure, said he and UA juniors Wyatt Rice, Sydney Stewart and Muskan Taori, are taking action because time is running out to address the climate crisis.

“One constitutional amendment in Arkansas isn’t going to fix everything, but it’ll fix part of it, and doing something’s better than nothing,” he said.

Durden decided to investigate what protections existed for Arkansas’ environment earlier this year after reading about sixteen Montana youth who filed a lawsuit in 2020 that challenged fossil-fuel based provisions of state laws. The plaintiffs, ages 2 to 18, argued the laws contributed to climate change, which violated their right to a clean and healthy environment guaranteed in the state’s constitution.

A judge ruled in favor of the young Montanans in 2023, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld the decision in December. Last month, a judge awarded $3 million in attorney’s fees in the case, and the Montana Attorney General’s Office said it would likely appeal, according to the Daily Montanan.

Several of the Montana plaintiffs joined other young Americans in filing a separate lawsuit in May against the federal government over a series of climate and energy policies.

Though climate discussions can be divisive nationally, Rice said what he appreciates about the text of the amendment, which is inspired by Montana’s constitution, is that it’s not specifically about “climate change.” Arkansans generally interact with their environment through recreation and leisure, important things that aren’t “nearly as controversial as some people like to make climate change out to be,” Rice said.

“That’s something that really works in our favor,” he said. “I don’t know anybody that doesn’t want their kids and their grandkids to have access to the beautiful environment that we have in Arkansas, and so I think that’s really what we’re trying to protect.”

The students, who drafted most of the proposal on their own, are receiving pro bono services from Jennifer Waymack Standerfer, a Bentonville attorney who’s worked on other Arkansas ballot measures.

“It’s cool language, it’s a cool group of kids who came up with it on their own, and I couldn’t say no to helping them,” Standerfer said.

The students have been revising their proposal after Attorney General Tim Griffin rejected their initial submission on Oct. 3. According to an opinion prepared by Assistant Attorney General William Olson, problems with the proposed amendment’s text prevented the attorney general from ensuring the ballot title was not misleading or substituting a more appropriate ballot title. Cited issues included the lack of definition of “environment,” the inclusion of “partisan coloring” language and grammatical errors.

After submitting their first draft, the students had a meeting with the attorney general’s office to learn more about the ballot initiative process and were surprised when Griffin joined for part of it.

“It was a pleasure to meet with this group of students and see their interest in learning about the political process,” Griffin said. “Being civically engaged at all stages of life is a wonderful thing and is something we should all encourage.”

Stewart, who joined the in-person meeting over Zoom, was grateful for the feedback.

“I was just really appreciative that they approached it in a way that we want to see this be as successful as possible,” she said.

Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives such as the students’ proposed amendment, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The direct democracy process allows Arkansans to propose constitutional amendments and state laws and put them to a statewide vote.

The process, particularly the petition-gathering phase, will see several changes during the 2026 election cycle due to laws passed during the legislative session this spring. While supporters say the statutes, a number of which are being challenged in court, will protect the integrity of the direct democracy process, opponents have argued it will make it more difficult for Arkansans to propose their own laws.

Judge delays decision in lawsuit affecting Arkansas direct democracy

Durden paused his work on the amendment this spring after realizing “the rules were changing in real time” during the legislative session. When Durden resumed the project this summer, he felt a sense of urgency because he realized the process could face more restrictions in the future.

“I think most people like being the Natural State. I don’t think anyone wants to see that go away, and getting to use that power for us to bring initiatives, especially at a time when we see a lot of laws trying to restrict that, I thought was really cool,” he said.

If the attorney general eventually certifies their proposal’s language, the students must then collect nearly 91,000 signatures from registered voters in at least 50 counties. Durden said he wants to avoid paid canvassers and plans to develop a broad network of volunteers at other colleges and environmentally-related groups to help collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot.

While “there’s a lot of pessimism in politics” and people often see younger generations as “disengaged” and “disaffected,” Rice is hopeful their work will demonstrate that’s not the case.

“No matter what happens, I think it’s important for people to see that young people do care about what happens in their government and what happens in their future,” he said. “And so I think that’s another reason why we want to build this as a large, broad-based movement of younger people, is to get that out there.”

Stewart said she has “felt very empowered by this process” because it’s something she can do, and she hopes it demonstrates how others can take action too. Durden agreed.

“I have a lot of anxiety about a lot of things, but being able to channel that anxiety into something that is productive and that I care about in this initiative has kind of helped mitigate that,” he said.

“It’s not necessarily all energy.” Grand said that in highly competitive Texas, V&E risks losing partners to competitors.","Vinson & Elkins leads all law firms in M&A energy work in Texas, even as much bigger global rivals gain footholds in the state.

The firm guided $30.3 billion worth of energy deals through the third quarter, edging out top rivals Kirkland & Ellis and White & Case in Texas, Bloomberg data shows. For example, it is helping Sunoco LP acquire Canadian fuel distributor Parkland Corp. for $9.1 billion, and Plains All American Pipeline LP to buy the gas liquids business of Keyera Corp. for $3.75 billion.

“Energy is never something we’re going to move away from,” John Grand, who co-leads M&A and private equity for the firm in Dallas, said in an interview. “Given that it’s such a large part of the economy in Texas, a large percentage of our partners will dabble in it in different ways.”

The data shows that the firm founded in Houston when Woodrow Wilson was president is holding its own—at least for now—against major interlopers with deeper pockets who got their starts in cities such as New York and Chicago. Texas has been a magnet this century for international law firms hungry to grab transactions in the booming energy business, and the growth plan for artificial intelligence data centers has intensified the competition.

Vinson & Elkins is counting on its roster of clients built over decades to stay ahead of the pack, said Theodore Borrego, an attorney and professor at the University of Houston Law Center. “But we’re seeing outside firms also starting to compete,” he said.

Kirkland did $29.9 billion worth of energy deals in the first three quarters in the state, just $200 million behind V&E, followed by White & Case at $28.5 billion, Sullivan & Cromwell at $23.7 billion, and Milbank at $22 billion, Bloomberg data shows.

Among those rivals’ big deals, Kirkland in April advised TG Natural Resources when it acquired a 70% interest in the East Texas gas assets of a Chevron Corp. subsidiary for $525 million. In August, White & Case advised NRG Energy Inc. on its loan agreement with the Public Utility Commission of Texas and initial funding for two natural gas units.

For more than a century, Vinson & Elkins, Baker Botts, and Fulbright & Jaworski—the Houston-founded firms known locally as “The Big Three""—built reputations as energy dealmakers in Texas. V&E’s energy ties to the state go back to 1920, when A.E. Humphreys, its first major energy client, struck oil near Mexia, Texas.

A century later, Houston’s legal market is competing globally. V&E partners credit Latham & Watkins’ opening of a Houston office in 2010 as the first national firm to penetrate the Texas legal market. Jaworski merged with Norton Rose in 2013, and Kirkland & Ellis arrived in the state in 2014 with the launch of a Houston office.

V&E held its own against the onslaught by working with alternative asset managers such as Apollo, Blackstone and TPG, which started making significant investments in traditional energy in the 2000s, said Grand. The firm invested earlier than its competitors “in places where a lot of the deal flow was going to come from, in terms of private capital clients, and kind of building up that practice,” said Lande Spottswood, a partner leading M&A and capital markets for V&E in Houston.

The firm is carving a place for itself in the energy M&A pecking order globally. Kirkland & Ellis topped global energy transactions worth about $48 billion in the first three quarters of this year, followed by Latham ($41.8 billion), Norton Rose ($38.7 billion), and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett ($35.7 billion), according to Bloomberg data. V&E advised on international energy transactions worth nearly $34.5 billion during the same time period.

Some partners believe it’s now grown beyond its origins in traditional oil and gas practice areas. The firm joined the race to capture a piece of the AI data center market in a state that offers available land, low-cost energy, and welcoming government regulations. It has also maintained a “robust” presence in the financing and tax credit market for renewables, said Kaam Sahely, a V&E partner based in Austin.

The firm’s “bread and butter” is “anything that you can touch and has some sort of revenue—a stable revenue—and it’s a real asset, including real estate,” Sahely said. “It’s not necessarily all energy.”

Grand said that in highly competitive Texas, V&E risks losing partners to competitors. Kirkland and other firms have tried to “pick off key partners,” he said, adding that he repeatedly refuses calls from firms seeking to open practices in Dallas.

“We’ve got a culture that’s unlike any other: we have fun,” Grand said. “You want to work with your friends, and you’re willing to ignore calls from other firms on a daily basis for sometimes double your compensation to move over because people are happy with who they work with.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/184a71f/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F09%2Fb3%2F15d11b4f4fb9977f21d24d76dd4d%2Foctober-1-2025-league-tables-g1-lead-art-1-1-1.png,N,,2025-10-21 10:19:17.201882

Public Citizen is supporting Proposition Q because funding our local government is essential for maintaining quality of life in Austin and to enable our city to live up to our stated values. Even as the federal government turns its back on working people and abandons responsibility for addressing the climate crisis, we can choose a different path. Instead of allowing a budget deficit caused by factors mostly out of local leaders’ control to force program cuts and layoffs, we can pool our resources and provide the necessary funding. We can show that we’re still a community that is committed to funding social services and taking action to reduce climate pollution and improve resilience.

Federal grants and other funds that were intended to help Austin and other cities fight and adapt to climate change have been illegally revoked. We can either step up to fill those gaps or we can stick our heads in the sand and hope someone else does the hard work. Without Prop Q City efforts to make energy savings improvements to city facilities, make purchasing more sustainable, prevent wildfires, transition to clean electric equipment, and protect and maintain parks and open spaces are in jeopardy.

It’s not easy to ask everyone to support a tax increase. We know that just as costs have increased for the city, so have they for residents and businesses. When resources are scarce, it can be tempting to hold on to what we have for ourselves, but we can do more collectively than we can as individuals. That’s the beauty of taxes and government – they should represent us working together to solve our problems. I hope Austinites will remember that as they head to the polls in a few weeks.

With our federal government being dismantled, collective action at the local level is more important than ever. The Trump administration can stop federal employees from saying the word emissions, but the climate crisis will continue. It won’t stop and wait for politics to change. We must take action at the local level. Let’s pass Prop Q and keep our city working for all Austinites.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 07:59:05.233753

Over the last decade, activists and organizations pushed Democratic politicians to take climate change seriously.
They eventually succeeded in helping to elevate climate change in the party’s platform.
“They had not changed their views and concerns about climate change at all,” Leiserowitz said.
“What has changed is elite discourse about it.” It’s not just Democratic politicians who are talking about climate change less.","Nearly a year after the 2024 election, Democrats are still trying to figure out what went wrong. In the midst of this soul-searching, a new piece of advice has appeared: “Don’t say climate change.”

That’s the takeaway from a recent poll by the Searchlight Institute, a new Democratic think tank. Americans said they see climate change as a problem, but it’s rarely one of their top issues — voters in battleground states are more concerned with affordability and health care. But when asked which issue they think the Democratic Party prioritizes, climate change was number one.

This mismatch might explain, at least in part, why Democrats often get portrayed as out of touch. “Advocates and elected officials should understand that their messages are actively weakened by a focus on ‘climate’ over affordability and low energy prices, and that voters are looking for immediate help with rising costs rather than solutions to abstract problems,” Searchlight’s post about the polling said.

The results didn’t surprise Representative Sean Casten, an Illinois Democrat and longtime climate champion who’s been making the case that clean energy can lower electricity bills. Casten recently unveiled draft legislation called the Cheap Energy Agenda, along with Representative Mike Levin, a California Democrat.

“There’s no obvious electoral upside in being really smart on energy and climate policy,” Casten said. But he’s still talking about climate change all the time. “Polling doesn’t tell you what you talk about,” he said. “It tells you how you talk about it.”

Advocacy groups are on board, too, with the League of Conservation Voters, Climate Power, and others running an ad blitz this summer blaming Republicans for increasing energy costs.

Over the last decade, activists and organizations pushed Democratic politicians to take climate change seriously. The youth-led Sunrise Movement rose to prominence as a force in climate politics in 2018, when activists stormed into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, demanding a Green New Deal. They eventually succeeded in helping to elevate climate change in the party’s platform. Democrats even passed the country’s most ambitious climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, in 2022 to accelerate the adoption of clean energy through tax credits and incentives — a sweeping effort dismantled by Republicans this year.

Searchlight’s pragmatic, follow-the-polls approach has been interpreted by some Democrats as a push to abandon what they believe in. Tré Easton, vice president for public policy at Searchlight, sees it differently. “It’s not that Democrats should just jettison their long-held policy beliefs and their values,” he said. “It’s that there needs to be a recalibration of how they make those pitches to voters. Because clearly, I think the results of the 2024 election would demonstrate that something’s not working.”

In fact, it appears that climate change had already started to vanish from the national conversation, well before Searchlight’s poll came out. Media coverage of the topic has dropped roughly in half since 2023, according to Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. His group’s polling has found that compared to previous years, Americans say they are hearing less about climate change in the news, on social media, and from people they know. They’re not seeking out as much information on their own, either: There’s been a sharp decline in Google News searches for “climate change” since 2023.

“The fact is that we talk about the things that we collectively say are important,” Leiserowitz said. “The conclusion most people then will draw is that if nobody’s talking about climate change, then it can’t be that important.” It’s out of sight, out of mind.

Leiserowitz argues that the 2024 election was not a referendum on climate change. Most Americans are still worried about global warming, according to the Yale program’s most recent polling. “They had not changed their views and concerns about climate change at all,” Leiserowitz said. “What has changed is elite discourse about it.”

It’s not just Democratic politicians who are talking about climate change less. The progressive left is also turning its attention to other pressing concerns. The Sunrise Movement, for example, has switched its focus from climate change to fighting for the right to free speech and protest under President Donald Trump, training its members in nonviolent resistance tactics. Progressive activists are pushing back against the administration’s crackdown on immigration, protesting outside ICE facilities, and the deployment of the National Guard in cities such as Chicago, Portland, and Washington, D.C. Over the weekend, an estimated 7 million people participated in “No Kings” protests against the Trump administration, according to the organizers.

“At least for us — and I don’t know how many others are thinking the exact same way — but it’s like the terrain of authoritarianism, the terrain of fascism, is the thing that we are trying to address, so that we can actually be able to fight for everything else that we’re trying to fight for,” said Aru Shiney-Ajay, Sunrise’s executive director. Still, she said, it’s important not to lose sight of their signature issue.

“Nobody wants to walk away from the issue of climate change,” Shiney-Ajay said. “I think everyone is pretty clear-eyed that we need to constantly be reminding people that we are doing this because we are young people fighting for a livable future.”

Leiserowitz said that Searchlight’s advice (“How to Talk about Climate Change: Don’t”) fails to distinguish between climate advocates and Democrats running for office in swing states. It might make sense for a politician in a tight race to tailor their message to the polls, but climate organizations have different goals besides getting Democrats elected, he said. “If your goal is to get overall societal action on climate change, it’s crazy not to talk about it.”

Searchlight and others dispute the idea that Democrats have to talk about climate change to get political action on it, arguing that it’s easier to pass legislation on an issue that hasn’t been dragged into a polarizing national discussion. “There’s a lot of action that was very important for climate change, for example, that happened in what’s been called ‘secret’ or ‘quiet Congress,’ behind the scenes,” said Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way. He pointed to the growth of bipartisan support for nuclear power legislation as an example. Last year, members of Congress from both parties overwhelmingly backed the ADVANCE Act, which was signed into law by President Joe Biden, aimed at speeding up the development of new reactors.

There’s increasing recognition that the way politicians have talked about climate change, full of jargon and abstract language, is also part of the problem. “The way to victory is to talk about price,” said Senator Brian Schatz, a Hawai‘i Democrat who has been a vocal advocate for climate action, at a recent New York Times event. “You could talk about the planetary emergency and mitigation and adaptation, and you could throw in some environmental justice rhetoric, and by the time you’re done talking, people think you don’t care about them.”

While the “cheap energy” argument is in vogue, not everyone is convinced it’s resonating with voters. “Voters can tell when affordability is an afterthought, and it doesn’t neutralize the toxicity of the term ‘climate,’” Searchlight’s post says.

“We framed it in a particularly provocative way to sort of get conversation going,” Easton said. But he thinks there’s still room for Democrats to talk about the subject. “If you have an issue that’s as important as climate change, but it’s become polarized, you have to think creatively about how you address it from a policy perspective.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1021_QuietClimate.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-21 05:57:33.678666

“Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta are quietly draining the South—economically and environmentally,” write research specialist Jai Dulani and economist Samuel Rosado Zaidi, in a recent Media Justice report. “Just as petrochemical plants created ‘sacrifice zones’ of poisoned air, contaminated water, and abandoned communities, data centres are now layering a new wave of extraction on top of that history.”

The report draws parallels with “Cancer Alley,” a corridor of land along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, where Black and low-income communities have long suffered from the emissions of over 200 petrochemical and fossil fuel plants. Cancer risks in the area are up to 11 times higher than U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates, finds a recent John Hopkins University study. The EPA model is based on industry-reported data.

“What our results really highlight is that we can’t rely on self-reported emissions data from facilities to estimate the health risks from air pollutants,” said lead researcher Peter Decarlo, a Johns Hopkins environmental health and engineering professor.

Media Justice argues that big tech companies deliberately site data centres in the South, “banking on disempowered cities and towns with large Black populations to not have the local power to fight back.” As of August 2025, the group says, more than US$200 billion have been committed to medium and large data centres in North Carolina, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee, by a conservative estimate.

The report links the rapid growth to a belief among tech elites that the Earth is a lost cause. It cites Elon Musk’s desire to colonize Mars, Mark Zuckerberg’s Hawaii bunker, and Sam Altman’s admission in 2015 that “AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there’ll be great companies.”

The race to build infrastructure and secure larger tax breaks comes as investors and analysts raise concerns about an AI bubble. The latest warnings come from the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England, which says, “The risk of a sharp market correction has increased.”

It’s not only the market facing a sharp correction. Communities are focusing in on the fact that data centres may be a threat to their air, water, and farmland. Opposition is growing even where Media Justice says some governments have promoted low unionization rates as a “key advantage” for data centre companies. Many Deep South states have unionization rates well below [pdf] the U.S. national average, but there are at least 142 activist groups across 24 states organizing to block data centre expansion, according to a Data Center Watch report.

Between May 2024 and March 2025, $64 billion of data centre projects were blocked or delayed by local opposition.

“From Bessemer, Alabama, to Memphis, Tennessee, local communities are showing up to call out the public health, environmental, and economic harms of data centres and the bulldozing of democratic processes to greenlight them,” writes Media Justice, warning that unencumbered data centre growth will lead to “a completely extracted South” with more water shortages, more pollution, and higher rates of cancer.

Electricity costs in the southern U.S. have already risen 33.6% since 2020, while tech companies are given discounted rates, as utilities expand fossil fuel infrastructure to meet data centre demand. Emissions-intensive gas pipelines, nuclear reactors, and coal plants are expected to grow.

The Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), which is tracking the new methane gas projects proposed in the region, recently intervened in regulatory proceedings to oppose an expanded pipeline across Georgia, Alabama, and part of Mississippi.

With nearly 44,000 megawatts of new gas-fired capacity planned by 2038—enough to power over 25 million homes—SELC said “utilities are doubling down on dirty fossil fuels for an unprecedented amount of energy.”

The gas pipelines pose serious risks to the communities they cut through, SELC says.

“Here in Alabama’s Blackbelt, we’ve seen firsthand the disruption and harm they can cause our community through explosion risks and other public health concerns,” Portia Shepherd, executive director of Blackbelt Women Rising, said in a release.

In Memphis, Tennessee, The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and SELC are suing Elon Musk’s xAI company alleging Clean Air Act violations after it built “the world’s biggest supercomputer” powered by methane gas turbines, without obtaining the proper permits. In Richland Parish, Meta is building its biggest data centre yet on fertile farmland in Louisiana, near another historically Black community and next to the Haynesville Shale formation which brought a boom to the town of Delhi in the 1940s. The $10-billion data centre was approved, but a Louisiana Public Service commissioner who voted against it told the Lens, “not all economic development is good economic development. We need community benefit agreements.”

“This is not just about building warehouses full of computers,” said Davante Lewis. “The real health risks come from the utilities rushing to build more gas plants and delaying renewable energy commitments,” locking communities into “decades of pollution and higher bills.”

An energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) warned the state’s residents could end up paying “hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars” in costs associated with powering the Richland Parish data centre.

Nigeria’s renewable energy sector has entered a new phase as Sun King and the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to expand local manufacturing and clean energy access. The signing, held during the Nigeria Renewable Energy Innovation Forum (NREIF) in Abuja, marks stronger public-private cooperation toward the nation’s clean energy goals.

The MoU was witnessed by Nigeria’s Vice President, Kashim Shettima, and Sun King’s Co-Founder and CEO, Patrick Walsh. With government backing, Sun King plans to set up local manufacturing plants that could replace $150 million in solar imports within five years. This move is expected to boost domestic production and create more jobs.

Sun King, a global off-grid solar leader, sells over 330,000 solar kits monthly across Africa. In Nigeria, sales have risen sharply—from 3,000 kits in 2020 to 75,000 per month today. The company plans to triple that number soon, showing growing demand for affordable solar power.

Sun King also designs smartphones and energy-efficient appliances like televisions and freezers that work seamlessly with its solar systems. These products improve living standards and support small businesses.

The MoU outlines three main priorities. First, it promotes local manufacturing under the government’s Nigeria First policy. Both organisations will assemble solar components locally, creating jobs and strengthening the renewable energy value chain.

Second, the partnership aims to deepen technical cooperation and knowledge sharing. By improving data analysis and market intelligence, both parties will enhance key programmes such as the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP) and Distributed Access through Renewable Energy Scale-Up (DARES). This step will help Nigeria meet its growing energy needs efficiently.

Finally, the MoU supports joint advocacy to raise awareness of standalone solar systems as tools for national progress. Sun King and REA will push for policies and financing that make solar energy more accessible and affordable.

REA’s Managing Director, Abba Aliyu, said the partnership builds on past successes under the Nigeria Electrification Programme. He noted that it links energy access with industrial development. Meanwhile, Walsh stated that the agreement aligns with Mission 300, a global initiative to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030.

'The Clean Energy Jobs Plan sets out the scale of the massive opportunity which the UK has to create tens of thousands of new jobs in renewables all over the country. It includes practical measures which will enable Government and industry to work even closer together to maximise this, such as opening new Technical Excellence Colleges, building on Britain’s current success as a global leader in clean power. This long-awaited plan delivers on employers’ calls for a coherent Government workforce strategy for clean energy and we look forward to working with Ministers to realise its ambitions.

'The wind industry alone already supports 55,000 jobs throughout the UK and this is set to grow to over 110,000 by 2030. To fill these posts, clean energy companies are offering apprenticeships to young people from a diverse range of backgrounds to become wind turbine technicians and recruiting graduates to design wind farms. We’re reaching out to other industries like oil and gas to attract workers into the clean energy sector, as they have valuable experience to offer. Renewable power companies are also proactively recruiting former members of the armed forces, as they too have excellent transferable skills to bring to the innovative industries we represent. Most of these jobs are in places outside London and the south east – they’re in Grimsby, Hartlepool, Hull, Lowestoft, the Moray Firth, across south Wales and in Belfast to name just a few, creating fresh opportunities in communities which need economic regeneration. The Clean Energy Jobs Plan will enable Government and industry to accelerate this transformative work, ensuring we continue to provide high quality jobs with good terms and conditions in our rapidly expanding sector'.

STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc., a healthcare company of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, announced today that long-term efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 DeFi trial of OGSIVEO ® (nirogacestat), an oral gamma secretase inhibitor for the treatment of adults with progressing desmoid tumors who require systemic treatment, were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO). The long-term follow-up data from DeFi, which was a global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, were previously presented at the 2024 Connective Tissue Oncology Society Meeting. The new results published in JCO utilized a December 2024 data cutoff date (the final data cut of the clinical trial) and showed that longer-term treatment with OGSIVEO was associated with further reductions in tumor size, an increase in objective response rate (ORR) with additional partial responses (PRs) and complete responses (CRs), sustained improvement in patient reported outcomes, and a consistent safety profile compared to the April 2022 data cut off utilized for the primary analysis of the trial. The JCO e-publication can be accessed at the following link: https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO-25-00582 .

“Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive and complex tumors whose unpredictable growth can cause significant pain, functional impairment, and emotional distress. For many patients, these tumors disrupt daily life in ways that are often underestimated, so advancing treatment options that offer durable symptom relief and tumor control can make a meaningful difference for patients,” said Ravin Ratan, M.D., M.Ed., Associate Professor, Department of Sarcoma Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and lead author of the JCO publication. “While the optimal duration of therapy may vary for many patients and is best decided between individual patients and their physicians, the new data published in the JCO provide physicians with additional information regarding the long-term safety and efficacy of nirogacestat, and will help inform treatment decisions and improve patient care.”

In the Phase 3 DeFi trial primary analysis, which was previously published in the New England Journal of Medicine , OGSIVEO showed significant improvement versus placebo in progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors (DT; median [range] exposure: 20.6 [0.3-33.6] months). 1 In the JCO publication, long-term efficacy and safety were evaluated in patients randomized to OGSIVEO and followed through the final data-cutoff date of December 2024. The median duration of OGSIVEO treatment in these patients was 33.6 (0.3 to 61.8) months.

Objective response rates (ORR) improved with long-term OGSIVEO treatment. While ORR was 34.3% (n = 24) in year 1, it increased to 45.7% (n = 32) in patients who received OGSIVEO for up to 4 years, with three additional complete responses (CRs) and three additional partial responses (PRs) since the primary analysis and yielding 24 (34.3%) PRs and 8 (11.4%) CRs in total. The median best percent reduction from baseline in target tumor size by RECIST 1.1 with continuous OGSIVEO treatment was −32.3% at year one (n=46) and −75.8% (n=15) for patients completing at least four years of treatment. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of pain, desmoid tumor-specific symptom severity, desmoid tumor-specific physical functioning, global health status/quality of life and role functioning occurred early (as early as Cycle 2, the first post-treatment timepoint evaluated as disclosed at the primary analysis) and were sustained with up to 45 months of treatment with OGSIVEO.

Overall, the incidence and severity of frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) decreased through years two, three and four of treatment. The most common adverse events ( > 15%) reported in patients receiving OGSIVEO were diarrhea, ovarian toxicity, rash, nausea, fatigue, stomatitis, headache, abdominal pain, cough, alopecia, upper respiratory tract infection, and dyspnea. Please see Important Safety Information below, including Warnings & Precautions relating to diarrhea, ovarian toxicity, hepatotoxicity, non-melanoma skin cancers, electrolyte abnormalities, and embryo-fetal toxicity. 2

“We are pleased that long-term continuous nirogacestat treatment for up to four years was associated with additional late responses and further tumor size reductions,” said Uche Iloeje, M.D., Senior Vice President, Global Head of Medical Affairs at SpringWorks Therapeutics. “These data represent the largest prospective analysis from a randomized controlled clinical trial of long-term exposure to any systemic agent for desmoid tumors and provide valuable insights on the benefits of OGSIVEO for patients with desmoid tumors.”

About the DeFi Trial

DeFi ( NCT03785964 ) was a global, randomized (1:1), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial that evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nirogacestat in adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors. The double-blind phase of the study randomized 142 patients (nirogacestat, n=70; placebo n=72) to receive 150 mg of nirogacestat or placebo twice daily. Key eligibility criteria included tumor progression by ≥20% as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) within 12 months prior to screening. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded independent central review, or death by any cause. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included safety and tolerability measures, objective response rate, duration of response, changes in tumor volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and changes in patient-reported outcomes. DeFi also included an open-label extension phase.

About Desmoid Tumors

Desmoid tumors are rare, locally aggressive tumors of the soft tissues that can be serious, debilitating, and, in rare cases when vital structures are impacted, life-threatening. 3 ,4

Desmoid tumors are most commonly diagnosed in patients between the ages of 20 and 44 years, with a two-to-three times higher prevalence in females. 5,6 In the U.S., up to 1650 people are diagnosed with desmoid tumors every year. 5,7,8

Although desmoid tumors do not metastasize, they can be associated with recurrence rates of up to 77% after surgical resection. 6,9 Desmoid tumor experts and treatment guidelines now recommend systemic therapies as first-line intervention for most tumor locations requiring treatment. 10,11

About OGSIVEO ® (nirogacestat)

OGSIVEO ® (nirogacestat) is an oral, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitor approved in the United States and European Union as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors who require systemic treatment.

The FDA and the EMA have granted Orphan Drug designation for OGSIVEO for the treatment of desmoid tumors.

Ovarian Toxicity: Female reproductive function and fertility may be impaired in patients treated with OGSIVEO. Impact on fertility may depend on factors like duration of therapy and state of gonadal function at time of treatment. Long-term effects on fertility have not been established. Advise patients on the potential risks for ovarian toxicity before initiating treatment. Monitor patients for changes in menstrual cycle regularity or the development of symptoms of estrogen deficiency, including hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.

Hepatotoxicity: ALT or AST elevations occurred in 30% and 33% of patients, respectively. Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations (>5 × ULN) occurred in 6% and 2.9% of patients. Monitor liver function tests regularly and modify dose as recommended.

Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers: New cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma occurred in 2.9% and 1.4% of patients, respectively. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of OGSIVEO and routinely during treatment.

Electrolyte Abnormalities: Decreased phosphate (65%) and potassium (22%) occurred in OGSIVEO-treated patients. Phosphate <2 mg/dL occurred in 20% of patients. Grade 3 decreased potassium occurred in 1.4% of patients. Monitor phosphate and potassium levels regularly and supplement as necessary. Modify dose as recommended.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Oral administration of nirogacestat to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal exposures below human exposure at the recommended dose of 150 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OGSIVEO and for 1 week after the last dose.

Complicated UTIs represent an important health issue, with an estimated 2.9 million cases of cUTIs treated annually in the U.S. alone. 2 These infections are often caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens 3 and carry serious risks including organ failure, sepsis, and even death. 3-5 They also result in significant emergency department visits and hospitalizations, contributing to over $6 billion per year in healthcare costs. 6 Current standard of care includes carbapenem antibiotics in cases of sepsis or resistance to other antibiotics, but they are only available for intravenous administration. 7, 8

The trial, which was stopped early for efficacy in May this year, demonstrated non-inferiority of tebipenem HBr compared to intravenous imipenem-cilastatin in hospitalized patients with cUTI, including pyelonephritis, based on the overall response (composite of clinical cure plus microbiological eradication of the bacteria causing the infection) at the test of cure visit. Tebipenem HBr (oral, 600 mg) achieved a 58.5% overall success rate (261/446 participants) compared to 60.2% overall success rate (291/483 participants) for imipenem-cilastatin (intravenous, 500 mg) (adjusted treatment difference: −1.3%; 95% CI: −7.5%, 4.8%). The safety profile of tebipenem HBr was generally similar to that of other carbapenem antibiotics. The most frequently reported adverse events (in ≥3% of patients who received tebipenem HBr) were diarrhea and headache; these events were all mild or moderate and non-serious.

Tony Wood, Chief Scientific Officer, GSK, said : “Complicated UTIs can have serious consequences for patients, including organ failure and sepsis, and oral options for drug-resistant infections are limited. These ground-breaking data show for the first time that cUTIs, including pyelonephritis, can be treated with an oral carbapenem antibiotic as effectively as with an intravenous one. We have a long-standing commitment to delivering novel anti-infectives and are delighted to offer the potential of tebipenem HBr as an effective oral alternative that could be taken at home.”

Esther Rajavelu, Chief Executive Officer, Spero Therapeutics , said: “These data presented at IDWeek represent the culmination of years of dedicated work by our team in close collaboration with GSK. We are deeply grateful to the physicians, researchers, support staff, and, most importantly, to the patients who made this study, and the ones before it, possible. Along with GSK, we are now focused on advancing tebipenem HBr toward FDA submission and bringing this important therapy to patients in need.”

Dr George Sakoulas, Infectious Disease specialist, Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego, commented: “Increasing antibiotic resistance among community-acquired bacteria that cause complicated urinary tract infections is greatly amplifying the burden of treatment for patients, clinicians, and payers. The therapeutic flexibility of a new oral antibiotic may reduce the need for intravenous antibiotics to treat cUTI, providing benefit to patients and improving treatment options.”

Secondary endpoints also show:

Clinical cure (i.e. absence of symptoms) rates at test of cure visit were 93.5% in the tebipenem HBr group (417/446) compared to 95.2% in the imipenem-cilastatin group (460/483) with adjusted treatment difference: −1.6% (95% CI: −4.7%, 1.4%)

Microbiological response rates at test of cure visit were 60.3% in the tebipenem HBr group (269/446) compared to 61.3% in the imipenem-cilastatin group (296/483) with adjusted treatment difference: −0.8% (95% CI: −6.9%, 5.3%)

Overall, clinical and microbiological response rates at test of cure in participants with infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacterales were consistent with the respective response rates in the primary analysis population.

Spero has licensed tebipenem HBr to GSK for development and commercialization in all markets except certain Asian territories. GSK plans to work with US regulatory authorities to include the data as part of a filing in Q4 2025. If approved, tebipenem HBr would be the first oral carbapenem antibiotic in the US for patients who suffer from cUTIs, adding to GSK’s growing anti-infectives portfolio and helping address the challenges of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

The development of tebipenem HBr is supported in part with federal funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), under contract number HHSO100201800015C.

About tebipenem HBr

Tebipenem pivoxil as hydrobromide salt (Tebipenem HBr) is a late-stage development asset developed in collaboration with Spero Therapeutics. Tebipenem HBr is being developed to treat cUTIs, including pyelonephritis. In September 2022, GSK entered into an exclusive license agreement with Spero Therapeutics for the development and commercialization of tebipenem HBr in all markets, except certain Asian territories. Under this agreement GSK has sub-licensed back to Spero Therapeutics the rights and responsibility to conduct certain development work including the PIVOT-PO Phase 3 study, after which sponsorship of the new drug application (NDA) will be transferred to GSK from Spero Therapeutics. Tebipenem HBr has received Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

About the PIVOT-PO trial

PIVOT-PO was a global, randomized, double-blind, pivotal, non-inferiority (NI margin: -10%) Phase 3 clinical trial of oral tebipenem HBr compared to IV imipenem-cilastatin, in hospitalized adult patients with cUTI including pyelonephritis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive tebipenem pivoxil (600 mg) orally every six hours, or imipenem-cilastatin (500 mg) IV every six hours, for a total of seven to ten days. Matching placebos were used to maintain blinding. The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response (composite of clinical cure plus microbiological eradication) at the test-of-cure visit (about 17 days from first dose administration of study drug) in patients with qualifying pathogens susceptible to imipenem. The trial enrolled a total of 1,690 patients, with randomization stratified by age, baseline diagnosis (cUTI or pyelonephritis), and the presence or absence of urinary tract instrumentation. For further details on the trial, refer to clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT06059846.

About complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs)

cUTIs are broadly described as any UTI that carries an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. 3 Definitions of cUTIs are not currently uniform among international societies and regulatory agencies. 5, 9 cUTIs encompass a heterogeneous patient population due to the wide range of host factors, comorbidities and urological abnormalities associated with cUTIs. 5, 9 Risk factors for cUTI include indwelling catheters, ureteric stents, neurogenic bladder, obstructive uropathy, urinary retention, urinary diversion, kidney stones, diabetes mellitus, immune deficiency, urinary tract modification, and UTIs in renal transplant patients. 3, 10-13

– Long-term continuous OGSIVEO treatment for up to 4 years was associated with further tumor size reductions, increase in objective response rate, sustained improvement in desmoid tumor symptoms and consistent safety profile –

STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc., a healthcare company of Merck, announced today that long-term efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 DeFi trial of OGSIVEO ® (nirogacestat), an oral gamma secretase inhibitor for the treatment of adults with progressing desmoid tumors who require systemic treatment, were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO). The long-term follow-up data from DeFi, which was a global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, were previously presented at the 2024 Connective Tissue Oncology Society Meeting. The new results published in JCO utilized a December 2024 data cutoff date (the final data cut of the clinical trial) and showed that longer-term treatment with OGSIVEO was associated with further reductions in tumor size, an increase in objective response rate (ORR) with additional partial responses (PRs) and complete responses (CRs), sustained improvement in patient reported outcomes, and a consistent safety profile compared to the April 2022 data cut off utilized for the primary analysis of the trial. The JCO e-publication can be accessed at the following link: https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO-25-00582 .

“Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive and complex tumors whose unpredictable growth can cause significant pain, functional impairment, and emotional distress. For many patients, these tumors disrupt daily life in ways that are often underestimated, so advancing treatment options that offer durable symptom relief and tumor control can make a meaningful difference for patients,” said Ravin Ratan, M.D., M.Ed., Associate Professor, Department of Sarcoma Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and lead author of the JCO publication. “While the optimal duration of therapy may vary for many patients and is best decided between individual patients and their physicians, the new data published in the JCO provide physicians with additional information regarding the long-term safety and efficacy of nirogacestat, and will help inform treatment decisions and improve patient care.”

In the Phase 3 DeFi trial primary analysis, which was previously published in the New England Journal of Medicine , OGSIVEO showed significant improvement versus placebo in progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors (DT; median [range] exposure: 20.6 [0.3-33.6] months). 1 In the JCO publication, long-term efficacy and safety were evaluated in patients randomized to OGSIVEO and followed through the final data-cutoff date of December 2024. The median duration of OGSIVEO treatment in these patients was 33.6 (0.3 to 61.8) months.

Objective response rates (ORR) improved with long-term OGSIVEO treatment. While ORR was 34.3% (n = 24) in year 1, it increased to 45.7% (n = 32) in patients who received OGSIVEO for up to 4 years, with three additional complete responses (CRs) and three additional partial responses (PRs) since the primary analysis and yielding 24 (34.3%) PRs and 8 (11.4%) CRs in total. The median best percent reduction from baseline in target tumor size by RECIST 1.1 with continuous OGSIVEO treatment was −32.3% at year one (n=46) and −75.8% (n=15) for patients completing at least four years of treatment. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of pain, desmoid tumor-specific symptom severity, desmoid tumor-specific physical functioning, global health status/quality of life and role functioning occurred early (as early as Cycle 2, the first post-treatment timepoint evaluated as disclosed at the primary analysis) and were sustained with up to 45 months of treatment with OGSIVEO.

Overall, the incidence and severity of frequently reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) decreased through years two, three and four of treatment. The most common adverse events ( > 15%) reported in patients receiving OGSIVEO were diarrhea, ovarian toxicity, rash, nausea, fatigue, stomatitis, headache, abdominal pain, cough, alopecia, upper respiratory tract infection, and dyspnea. Please see Important Safety Information below, including Warnings & Precautions relating to diarrhea, ovarian toxicity, hepatotoxicity, non-melanoma skin cancers, electrolyte abnormalities, and embryo-fetal toxicity. 2

“We are pleased that long-term continuous nirogacestat treatment for up to four years was associated with additional late responses and further tumor size reductions,” said Uche Iloeje, M.D., Senior Vice President, Global Head of Medical Affairs at SpringWorks Therapeutics. “These data represent the largest prospective analysis from a randomized controlled clinical trial of long-term exposure to any systemic agent for desmoid tumors and provide valuable insights on the benefits of OGSIVEO for patients with desmoid tumors.”

About the DeFi Trial

DeFi ( NCT03785964 ) was a global, randomized (1:1), multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 3 trial that evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of nirogacestat in adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors. The double-blind phase of the study randomized 142 patients (nirogacestat, n=70; placebo n=72) to receive 150 mg of nirogacestat or placebo twice daily. Key eligibility criteria included tumor progression by ≥20% as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) within 12 months prior to screening. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded independent central review, or death by any cause. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included safety and tolerability measures, objective response rate, duration of response, changes in tumor volume assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and changes in patient-reported outcomes. DeFi also included an open-label extension phase.

About Desmoid Tumors

Desmoid tumors are rare, locally aggressive tumors of the soft tissues that can be serious, debilitating, and, in rare cases when vital structures are impacted, life-threatening. 3 ,4

Desmoid tumors are most commonly diagnosed in patients between the ages of 20 and 44 years, with a two-to-three times higher prevalence in females. 5,6 In the U.S., up to 1650 people are diagnosed with desmoid tumors every year. 5,7,8

Although desmoid tumors do not metastasize, they can be associated with recurrence rates of up to 77% after surgical resection. 6,9 Desmoid tumor experts and treatment guidelines now recommend systemic therapies as first-line intervention for most tumor locations requiring treatment. 10,11

About OGSIVEO ® (nirogacestat)

OGSIVEO ® (nirogacestat) is an oral, selective, small molecule gamma secretase inhibitor approved in the United States and European Union as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors who require systemic treatment.

The FDA and the EMA have granted Orphan Drug designation for OGSIVEO for the treatment of desmoid tumors.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Diarrhea: Diarrhea occurred in 84% of patients treated with OGSIVEO. Grade 3 events occurred in 16% of patients. Monitor patients and manage using antidiarrheal medications. Modify dose as recommended.

Ovarian Toxicity: Female reproductive function and fertility may be impaired in patients treated with OGSIVEO. Impact on fertility may depend on factors like duration of therapy and state of gonadal function at time of treatment. Long-term effects on fertility have not been established. Advise patients on the potential risks for ovarian toxicity before initiating treatment. Monitor patients for changes in menstrual cycle regularity or the development of symptoms of estrogen deficiency, including hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness.

Hepatotoxicity: ALT or AST elevations occurred in 30% and 33% of patients, respectively. Grade 3 ALT or AST elevations (>5 × ULN) occurred in 6% and 2.9% of patients. Monitor liver function tests regularly and modify dose as recommended.

Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers: New cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma occurred in 2.9% and 1.4% of patients, respectively. Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of OGSIVEO and routinely during treatment.

Electrolyte Abnormalities: Decreased phosphate (65%) and potassium (22%) occurred in OGSIVEO-treated patients. Phosphate <2 mg/dL occurred in 20% of patients. Grade 3 decreased potassium occurred in 1.4% of patients. Monitor phosphate and potassium levels regularly and supplement as necessary. Modify dose as recommended.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Oral administration of nirogacestat to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal exposures below human exposure at the recommended dose of 150 mg twice daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with OGSIVEO and for 1 week after the last dose.

Strong attendance signals strong demand for financial guidance amid economic uncertainty

The Seedly x SingSaver Personal Finance Festival featured over 6 5 speakers, including Acting Minister for Transport and Senior Minister of State for Finance Jeffrey Siow

SINGAPORE, Oct. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MoneyHero Limited (NASDAQ: MNY ) (“MoneyHero” or the “Company”), a leading personal finance aggregation and comparison platform and a digital insurance brokerage provider in Greater Southeast Asia, today announced the successful conclusion of the Seedly x SingSaver Personal Finance Festival (PFF), which attracted more than 3,800 attendees at the Marina Bay Sands Expo & Convention Centre. Now in its sixth year, the Seedly Personal Finance Festival broadened its reach through the integration with SingSaver to create a richer, more interactive experience for participants.

Festival Highlights: Brand Reach, Monetisation & Community Engagement

This year’s Festival brought together more than 3,800 attendees focused on building financial resilience and empowerment. Under the theme “Explore Singapore!” and in celebration of the SG60 national milestone, the Festival provided a forum for attendees to reflect on Singapore’s achievements and enduring spirit of innovation, while inspiring them to plan with confidence for their financial futures.

The Festival emphasised three priorities: financial resilience, strategic wealth building, and adapting to a rapidly changing global economy. Across 16 hours of curated talks, workshops, and interactive sessions, more than 65 distinguished speakers and panellists shared practical strategies and actionable insights to help individuals navigate today’s economic environment.

Beyond the main stage, 19 sponsors and partners activated immersive brand experiences across the venue, transforming the Festival into a dynamic marketplace of ideas and opportunities. These activations enabled direct engagement with the unified Seedly and SingSaver community, helping participants make informed decisions and deepen their financial knowledge.

Minister Siow Underscores Importance of Long-Term Financial Discipline

The Festival featured a headline fireside chat between Jeffrey Siow, Acting Minister for Transport and Senior Minister of State for Finance, and Rohith Murthy, Chief Executive Officer of MoneyHero Group, titled “Growing Together with Singapore?”.

Minister Siow noted that the global landscape is now more complex, fragmented and uncertain. He emphasised the need for long-term financial discipline and readiness for external shocks. He also encouraged Singaporeans to invest in their skills and network. Minister Siow reflected that the fundamental principles of personal finance have stood the test of time – discipline, prudent planning and long-term thinking. These same principles guide how Singapore manages its national finances.

MoneyHero Reaffirms Commitment to Collaborative Growth

Reflecting on the Festival’s success and the concurrent celebration of the Company’s second year anniversary as a Nasdaq-listed company, the Festival reinforced the Company’s commitment to innovation and partnership across its ecosystem.

Rohith Murthy, Chief Executive Officer of MoneyHero Group , said, “The spirit of this event, gathering 3,800 Singaporeans seeking practical financial knowledge underscores not only the strong need for the tools and guidance that help people make sound financial decisions, but also the importance of collaborative innovation and operational efficiency in delivering high‑quality financial products to meet that demand. Leveraging AI, we are working to enhance the end‑to‑end digital journey for Singaporeans, including personalised product insights that will benefit users while improving conversion and unit economics for our financial institution partners, supported by our large, engaged, and growing audience. As we mark our second anniversary on Nasdaq, our vision of guiding everyone toward a resilient financial future is a shared commitment. Through our growing partnership ecosystem, we will continue to innovate and deliver value for our customers and stakeholders.”

The Seedly x SingSaver Personal Finance Festival provided Singaporeans with practical tools and strategies aligned with the national priority of long-term planning, positioning attendees to strengthen their financial resilience in the face of increased volatility.

Revenues (3Q25 vs. 3Q24)

Aeronautical services revenues increased by Ps. 846.4 million, or 18.3%.

Non-aeronautical services revenues increased by Ps. 327.6 million, or 15.6%.

Revenues from improvements to concession assets increased by Ps. 169.9 million, or 11.3%.

Total revenues increased by Ps. 1,343.9 million, or 16.3%.

The change in aeronautical services revenues was primarily due to the following factors:

Revenues at the Mexican airports increased by Ps. 789.6 million, or 20.5%, compared to 3Q24, mainly due to a Ps. 693.3 million, or 21.5%, increase in the passenger fee revenue. This increase was driven by the new airport maximum tariffs approved for the 2025–2029 regulatory period, effective as of March 2025, as well as a 2.1% increase in passenger traffic during the quarter.

Revenues at the Jamaican airports increased by Ps. 56.8 million, or 7.3%, compared to 3Q24, mainly due to a 6.1% increase in passenger traffic during the quarter and an increase in U.S. dollar revenue of USD$2.6 million, or 3.5%. This effect was partially offset by the appreciation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar, which went from an average exchange rate of Ps. 18.9229 in 3Q24 to Ps. 18.6456 in 3Q25, representing an appreciation of 1.5%. This exchange rate effect reduced the revenue reported in pesos.

The change in non-aeronautical services revenues was primarily driven by the following factors:

Revenues at Mexican airports increased by Ps. 301.2 million, or 16.4%, compared to 3Q24. Revenues from businesses operated directly by us increased by Ps. 270.9 million, or 30.5%, mainly driven by the consolidation of revenues from the cargo and bonded warehouse business, which contributed Ps. 168.9 million, or 47.7%, to this growth. Revenues from businesses operated by third parties increased Ps. 31.9 million, or 3.5%, primarily driven by the opening of new commercial spaces and the renegotiation of commercial contracts. The fastest-growing business lines were food and beverage, retail stores, duty-free, ground transportation, and timeshares, which together increased by Ps. 41.5 million, or 7.0%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in leasing of space revenues, which declined Ps. 18.0 million, or 23.5%.

Revenues at the Jamaican airports increased by Ps. 26.4 million, or 9.8%, compared to 3Q24. In U.S. dollar terms, revenues increased by USD$1.6 million, or 11.4%, which was partially offset by the 1.5% appreciation of the peso against the average exchange rate of 3Q24.

Figures expressed in thousands of Mexican pesos.

‐ Revenues from improvements to concession assets 1

Revenues from improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12) increased by Ps. 169.9 million, or 11.3%, compared to 3Q24. The change was composed of:

Improvements to concession assets at the Company’s Mexican airports, which increased by Ps. 115.4 million, or 8.6%, following investments under the Master Development Program for the 2025-2029 period.

Improvements to concession assets at the Company’s Jamaican airports, which increased Ps. 54.4 million, or 33.1%.

1 Revenues from improvements to concession assets are recognized in accordance with International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee 12 “Service Concession Arrangements” (IFRIC 12). However, this recognition does not have a cash impact or impact on the Company’s operating results. Amounts included as a result of the recognition of IFRIC 12 are related to construction of infrastructure in each quarter to which the Company has committed. This is in accordance with the Company’s Master Development Programs in Mexico and Capital Development Programs in Jamaica. All margins and ratios calculated using “Total Revenues” include revenues from improvements to concession assets (IFRIC 12), and, consequently, such margins and ratios may not be comparable to other ratios and margins, such as EBITDA margin, operating margin or other similar ratios that are calculated based on those results of the Company that do have a cash impact.

Total operating costs increased by Ps. 914.3 million, or 20.3% , compared to 3Q24, mainly due to higher technical assistance and concession fees, which together increased Ps. 391.6 million, or 49.0%; a Ps. 201.8 million, or 14.1%, increase in the cost of services; a Ps. 169.9 million increase in the cost of improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12); and a Ps. 148.4 million, or 18.9%, increase in depreciation and amortization, derived from the recognition of the fair values of the cargo and bonded warehouse business. Excluding the cost of improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12), operating costs increased by Ps. 744.5 million, or 24.7%, compared to 3Q24.

This increase in total operating costs was primarily due to the following factors:

Mexican airports:

Operating costs increased by Ps. 723.3 million, or 19.8% , compared to 3Q24, mainly due to higher technical assistance and concession fees, which together increased Ps. 256.7 million, or 53.4%; a Ps. 207.8 million, or 17.3%, increase in the cost of services; a Ps. 141.6 million, or 21.7%, increase in depreciation and amortization; and a Ps. 115.4 million, or 8.6%, increase in the cost of improvements to the concession assets (IFRIC-12). the cost of improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12), operating costs increased by Ps. 607.9 million, or 26.2%.

The change in the cost of services at our Mexican airports during 3Q25 was mainly due to:

Maintenance increased by Ps. 89.8 million, or 52.3%, due to the opening of new operational areas, airfield maintenance, and the operation of jet bridges by Ps. 47.6 million.

Employee costs increased by Ps. 60.2 million, or 11.7%, mainly due to salary adjustments and amendments to the Federal Labor Law.

Safety, security and insurance increased by Ps. 21.4 million, or 13.2%, driven by an increase in security personnel, minimum wage adjustments, changes to the Federal Labor Law, and the opening of additional operational areas.

Utilities increased by Ps. 20.0 million, or 17.6%, compared to 3Q24.

Jamaican Airports:

Operating costs increased by Ps. 190.9 million, or 22.3%, compared to 3Q24, mainly due to an increase in concession fees of Ps. 134.8 million, or 42.4%; an increase in the cost of improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12) of Ps. 54.4 million, or 33.1%; and an increase in depreciation and amortization of Ps. 6.8 million, or 5.0%. These effects were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of services of Ps. 6.0 million, or 2.6%.

Operating income margin decreased from 45.2% in 3Q24 to 43.3% in 3Q25. Excluding the effects of IFRIC-12, the operating income margin declined from 55.3% in 3Q24 to 52.5% in 3Q25.

The region’s summer peak load is projected to increase by 16 GW by 2028 and by 30 GW by 2032.
By 2032, an additional 10.5 GW of new gas capacity could come online if supply conditions improve.
In the longer term, as renewable energy deployment expands, the value of storage will continue to increase through enhanced energy arbitrage and operational flexibility.
By 2045, PJM is projected to rely on around 43 GW of battery storage, 40 GW of new gas capacity, and expanded renewable generation to maintain reliability and meet policy targets.","The Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection must deploy at least 16 GW of energy storage by 2032 and 23 GW by 2040 to ensure system reliability, according to a new report from the U.S. Energy Storage Coalition.

The report finds that energy storage will be essential for addressing tight supply conditions, mitigating reliability risks during extreme weather, and supporting the integration of renewable generation resources.

The PJM Interconnection is a regional transmission organization in the U.S. It is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

The report states that PJM faces a period of significant strain as peak electricity demand is forecast to grow by 19% between 2025 and 2030.

The region’s summer peak load is projected to increase by 16 GW by 2028 and by 30 GW by 2032.

Over the next decade, total summer and winter peaks are expected to rise by about 56 GW and 62 GW, respectively, driven largely by data center expansion and electrification of heating and transportation.

Interconnection queue backlogs constrain PJM’s ability to add new supply, lengthy approval timelines for new gas capacity, and trade barriers affecting renewable and storage equipment.

Demand for gas turbines currently exceeds manufacturing capacity, and project delays could further restrict resource adequacy.

The report assumes that by 2028, up to 7.4 GW of new gas capacity, 10 GW of battery storage, 3 GW of wind, and 20 GW of solar could be deployed from the current queue. By 2032, an additional 10.5 GW of new gas capacity could come online if supply conditions improve.

The report indicates that PJM must also delay most planned fossil retirements until between 2033 and 2036 to accommodate load growth. Even with these delays, both new gas generation and storage are required to prevent capacity shortages.

The report identifies four-hour duration storage as the only cost-effective option under PJM’s projected conditions, with six-hour and eight-hour storage found to be uneconomical at less than 50% renewable penetration.

The cost of four-hour lithium-ion battery systems could decline from $334/kWh in 2024 to as low as $108/kWh or remain as high as $307/kWh by 2050.

Without battery storage, the analysis shows that PJM would experience large-scale reliability violations and forced load shedding, especially during winter cold snaps similar to Winter Storm Elliott.

The study estimates that without 16 GW of storage, PJM could face up to 14,000 MWh of load shedding over a three-day cold event in 2032, resulting in costs between $400 million and $1.2 billion.

In contrast, storage deployment can prevent up to 15 GW of load shed risk in 2032 and maintain compliance with PJM’s resource adequacy standards.

The report also finds that customer costs would be about 30% higher between 2028 and 2045 if storage is not available. The calculation excludes transmission and distribution impacts, which currently amount to under $50 billion per year in PJM.

Without storage, PJM would have to rely on more expensive or insufficient alternatives, leading to a higher dependence on alternative compliance payments to meet state renewable portfolio standards.

The report assumes that PJM’s states will continue to pursue renewable and clean energy mandates, resulting in growing shares of wind, solar, and nuclear generation.

By 2045, renewables and nuclear together are projected to provide about 50% of PJM’s total generation, with solar, wind, and nuclear each contributing roughly one-third of the clean energy mix. The remaining 50% of generation is expected to come from fossil fuels.

The report further notes that battery storage can generate between $20/kW and $65/kW annually in real-time energy and ancillary service revenues, primarily from synchronized reserves.

In the longer term, as renewable energy deployment expands, the value of storage will continue to increase through enhanced energy arbitrage and operational flexibility. By 2045, PJM is projected to rely on around 43 GW of battery storage, 40 GW of new gas capacity, and expanded renewable generation to maintain reliability and meet policy targets.

The report recommends reforms to PJM’s interconnection queue process, improvements in capacity accreditation for storage, and the establishment of clear procurement goals to support timely storage deployment.

US company Last Energy has announced the installation of a pilot microreactor at the Texas A&M-RELLIS campus, an applied research and technology facility in Bryan, Texas. The project, fully financed with private capital, will use the PWR-5 model—a 5-megawatt scaled version of its commercial PWR-20 reactor. It will first demonstrate safe low-power operations before entering a later phase aimed at grid electricity generation.

Backed by Washington and ready for deployment

The reactor is part of the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program, which aims to accelerate testing and authorisation of advanced reactor technologies outside the national laboratory system. The agreement signed between Last Energy and the DOE falls under the Other Transaction Agreement framework, designed to support non-traditional technology partnerships. The developer has already secured a full core load of nuclear fuel and initiated regulatory licensing procedures.

This microreactor will be the company’s first installation in the United States. Last Energy, which relocated its headquarters to Austin in May, has obtained a lease at the Texas A&M-RELLIS campus and plans to use the site as a showcase for its standardised modular model.

Despite their heavy reliance on fossil fuels, all three are investing substantially in clean energy.

Texas is by far the top oil-and-gas producing and energy-consuming state in the United States. Its political leadership closely aligns with the Donald Trump administration’s pro-fossil fuel hostility to renewables. And yet, the Lone Star state produces more renewable energy and battery capacity than any other state—nearly 80% more.

Texas this year has set numerous records for renewable electrical power—in the spring, for wind generation and in June, for electricity from all renewable resources.

Related Story: Texas Moves on Renewables While Alberta’s Oil Ties Hold Firm

July saw a new high for battery storage and solar generation. Through June, wind and solar have produced 40.2% of the electricity generated for ERCOT, the grid operator serving 90% of the demand in Texas, according to the nonpartisan Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Wind power provided the largest percentage of ERCOT’s renewable generation, in ERCOT, and almost 27% of ERCOT’s total power generation in the first six months of this year, second only to gas.

‘Watch What We Do, Not What We Say‘

Texas is so bullish on renewable energy for business, not ideological reasons, that three anti-renewables bills recently failed in the infamously pro-oil, anti-progressive Texas legislature. The proposed laws would have created new obstacles for new and existing renewable power plants.

“A broad coalition of Texas stakeholders”—including oil and gas producers, power operators and some large-load customers—said the bills “could have dramatically reduced investment in the state’s rapidly growing power system,” Utility Dive reported. Instead of aligning with the Trump Administration—its favourite term for enforcing compliance with MAGA policies—Texas lawmakers instead voted “yes” for renewables—for now. That’s money talking.

The World’s Second Biggest Oil Producer Goes Solar

Saudi Arabia, the world’s second biggest oil producer, has inked plans to more than triple solar capacity from 2023 levels, commissioning five enormous solar plants in 2024 and awarding contracts for five more plants, to meet its goal of sourcing half its power from clean energy by 2030. Its target of 130 gigawatts of new renewables capacity is part of the country’s long-term economic modernization plan for new tourism, factories, and AI data centers, with far-reaching implications for global geopolitics and energy markets.

“Today, solar is the cheapest, the fastest, the simplest, and the most secure source of energy that you can install,” said Marco Arcelli, chief executive of ACWA Power, the company managing the revision of Saudi Arabia’s power grid. Developing renewable energy also frees up oil that can be sold in international markets.

The 90% drop in solar and battery costs, and 70% drop in wind costs, over the past decade continue driving these shifts, in spite of the Trump Administration’s resistance. Since the start of this year, prices for Chinese polysilicon, the building block of solar panels, are down 50% and for panels, down 40%. A recent price rise of 5%, prompted by the government’s worry about a glut, still leaves pricing for solar components—wafers, cells, and panels—well below that of the boilers, turbines, and generators required for fossil fuel power plants, let alone expensive nuclear and hydrogen. When you include the engineering expertise required to build and operate fossil fuel facilities, the bottom-line favors renewables, even in an oil giant such as Saudi Arabia.

Ethiopia Chooses Hydropower

Then there’s Ethiopia. The strategically located but impoverished country has banned imports of combustion engine cars in a drive to electrify transportation for both economic and environmental reasons. Importing fossil fuels costs Ethiopia $4.5 billion annually, and the price of gas has doubled in the past three years, while clean hydropower provides 96% of the country’s electricity.

How will this work in a country where today, one-half of its 126 million population has no access to electricity, and where power outages are frequent? One answer is the recently opened Ethiopian Grand Renaissance Dam, which will double current electricity output.

“We have massive potential in renewables,” Bareo Hassen, state minister for transport told The Guardian. He says the decision to ban imports of diesel and petrol vehicles is part of Ethiopia’s push to promote a green economy and reduce the pollution that chokes the capital during rush hour. The transport ministry wants to more than quadruple the number of EVs. That number is targeted to increase to 500,000 by 2030.

Global Renewables Investment Accelerates

These developments are taking place in an ongoing, world-wide movement to invest in clean energy. Since January, $470 billion in clean energy finance has been announced, Zero Carbon Analytics reports. Finance for onshore and offshore wind increased about 25% in the first half of 2025, topping $168 billion. “The sector still has momentum and underlying strength,” analyst Joanne Bentley-McKune said.

Even the U.S., where renewables are being punished by the Trump Administration, is seeing new records for renewables. The first half of 2025 saw 63 clean energy deals in the US worth $34 billion, versus 57 deals worth about $7 billion in the second half of 2024, KPMG reported. US developers say half of new electric capacity this year will come from solar. Over 25% of U.S. power generation in June was green, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s an increase from 18% in the same time period last year.

The Time to Act Is Now

“Rapid data center growth, a rebounding American industrial sector and residential electrification are all increasing demand for electricity at a rate not seen for decades,” the World Resources Institute reports. Heatwaves, the building of power-hungry AI data centers, and growing numbers of EVs are driving demand for more capacity in power generation. The national five-year forecast for electricity load was 5 times higher in 2024 than 2022 predictions.

“If left unaddressed, this new demand spike could increase greenhouse gas emissions, inflate consumers’ bills and make the U.S. grid less reliable,” WRI said. “Acting quickly is imperative,”—as fossil fuel-rich Texas, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia are demonstrating.

The Freight Marketplace has operated in Europe since 2023 through Trimble’s Transporeon platform. P&G joins a network of more than 400 carriers now using the North American version.

How Freight Marketplace Works

Trimble said Freight Marketplace serves as a centralized digital procurement platform for shippers and carriers of all sizes. According to the company, it enables users to expand transportation networks, find reliable partners, and access competitive rates through automated bidding for spot and strategic freight opportunities.

The platform simplifies contract negotiations through tailored mini bids, designed for single lanes with defined timeframes and volume commitments. Built-in AI tools verify carrier identity and insurance information, replacing manual checks to enhance security and accuracy.

Customer and Industry Perspectives

“We are thrilled to welcome P&G to the Freight Marketplace as we roll it out across North America,” said Michael Kornhauser, sector vice president of transportation and logistics at Trimble. “P&G’s adoption underscores our commitment to building a connected ecosystem that addresses the complexities of today’s supply chain and procurement process.”

“For a company of our scale, managing numerous mini bids is a complex and time-consuming endeavor,” said Emily Conner, senior director of transportation purchases, North America market operations at Procter & Gamble. “Freight Marketplace helps to simplify and support our bidding processes. The platform saves us time while enabling us to discover new carrier partners and strengthen relationships with existing ones.”

Expansion from Europe to North America

The Freight Marketplace was first introduced in Europe in 2023 by Transporeon, which Trimble acquired the same year. The company added that over 7,000 carriers, shippers, and brokers have joined the platform in Europe since its debut.

Trimble said this launch in North America expands its marketplace model to a new audience, offering shippers and carriers automated bidding tools and AI-based validation within a single digital network.",https://s18391.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Trimble_Launches_Freight_Marketplace___P_G_First_Customer-600.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 02:57:48.655898

It helps our squads be more prepared on accident scenes and able to rescue accident victims more efficiently and quickly.”","Community Collision of Leesburg, Fla., recently hosted 15 first responders from the Lake County and Leesburg Fire Departments for a hands-on learning experience teaching them how to rescue accident victims from late-model vehicles – life-saving skills that are critical when minutes matter most. The event was part of the National Auto Body Council’s (NABC) First Responder Emergency Extraction (F.R.E.E.) event, and other parties responsible for successfully executing the event included Hurst Jaws of Life®, Municipal Emergency Services and Chubb Insurance (which donated the vehicles).

“We want to be a good member of the community and help drivers be safer on the road,” said Larry Jaskowiak, owner of Community Collision. “By partnering with our local fire departments, we, along with Hurst Jaws of Life, can provide the advanced training these first responders need to quickly and efficiently rescue someone from an accident scene. The NABC is an amazing organization that helps us help others. We look forward to being part of the NABC F.R.E.E. program and holding our first NABC Recycled Rides program soon to provide a local family in need with reliable transportation.”

Today’s vehicles are equipped with numerous airbags, advanced technology and innovative safety systems that keep drivers safer in case of an accident. But these same safety advantages make it harder for first responders to rescue those drivers and passengers. Add to that the potential challenge presented by electric and hybrid engines, and first responders need a whole new arsenal of rescue tools and procedures.

“Training like this is invaluable for our first responders,” said Lieutenant Chris Kuharske of the Leesburg Fire Department. “It’s hard for us to get cars to train on — much less late-model cars like we have here today. It’s great to learn about new rescue techniques, car construction and car materials. It helps our squads be more prepared on accident scenes and able to rescue accident victims more efficiently and quickly.”",https://s19525.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nabc-free-community.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 01:57:51.125276

That's a quote from none other than Nissan-Renault megaboss Carlos Ghosn back in the 2010s, before his highly-publicized fall from grace and when the pioneering Nissan Leaf was still in its first generation. The Leaf seldom gets credit for what it was trying to be: an affordable, mass-market electric vehicle, priced at the same level as a comparable gas car.

That is no easy task when EV battery costs remain high, and very few carmakers are even able to pull it off today. Making a great $30,000 car is never as easy as making a great $100,000 one; add in battery power, and you're looking at a lot of red ink.

(Full Disclosure: Nissan loaned me a Leaf for a week of testing.)

I'm the third InsideEVs staffer to test the new-for-2026 Nissan Leaf. Deputy Editor Mack Hogan called it ""the perfect electric reset for a brand desperately in need of a win."" Staff Writer Suvrat Kothari called it surprisingly great, plus or minus a few annoying quirks. I'd agree with both assessments. I was genuinely shocked at how much I liked the Leaf—more than its humble specs might imply.

Those specs include a new 75 kilowatt-hour battery, 214 horsepower and 262 pound-feet of torque, an Android Automotive OS suite with Google Built-In, a Tesla-style North American Charging Standard plug, and up to 303 miles of range.

Then again: are those specs even really ""humble""? That actually sounds like a pretty solid modern EV setup, if I do say so myself. And especially at the Leaf's $29,990 starting price. In today's over-inflated new car market, it can be tough to find anything worth driving at $30,000 or less, let alone something electric. And yet, here's the new Leaf, doing all that and more. It also does all this with some fun colors, like my Seabreeze Blue Pearl tester.

The biggest surprise to me was just how well the thing drives. Sure, it's front-wheel-drive, a setup I don't love for EVs because all that instant electric power can lead to some prodigious torque steer. But the Leaf handles it well. It's not going to tear your face off the way a Tesla can, but it errs almost on the side of being a hot hatchback. I never once held anyone up on the highway in it.

And then there's the size. America's EV market can feel like a depressing sea of big SUVs, hefty crossovers and oversized trucks. But the Leaf remains small. It's taller overall, but not really any bigger than my gas-powered Mazda 3 hatchback, and that's a size I love because it's easy to park and live with day-to-day.

The Leaf has been somewhat derided for its odd choice of charging ports: on one side of the vehicle, a Tesla NACS plug for fast-charging only, and on the other side, a standard J1772 plug for slower, Level 2 charging only. Sure, it's a bit goofy. But it all works just fine. You charge on one side at home, most of the time, and fast-charge on the other side. I had no complaints about this setup.

As for charging, it's nothing mind-blowing with a 150-kilowatt max speed. But this is kind of a medium-sized battery, so it'll go from 10% to 80% in an estimated 35 minutes. The old Leaf would do this in 45 minutes with a smaller, 60 kWh battery. This is progress.

Want blazing-fast charging speeds? Get a more expensive car. The Leaf is in line with the new Chevy Bolt EV, and both beat the also-affordable and supposedly still-forthcoming Kia EV3 and EV4.

It also looks and feels better inside than you'd think. Sure, there are some hard plastics and clear examples of cost-cutting, like those unsightly buttons for selecting a gear. But at least in my tester's Platinum+ trim, it's not bad at all. The two-tone upholstery is nice and the dashboard accents add a premium-ish touch.

Above all, I give credit to Nissan for going with Google Built-In, which is becoming probably the best all-around EV software system you can find these days. Native Google Maps for navigation will have you not wanting to go back to anything else, that's for sure.

And Nissan deserves props for the extensive EV-related options, like its menus for charging management and scheduling. Things like showing the time to charge to 80%, or your total max charging speeds at any given battery level, or the time to achieve the optimal battery temperature for fast-charging.

This feels like an EV made by people who have done this before—because they have. That's a rare thing. I am just now starting to get that from the Volkswagen Group or General Motors. I have yet to from Toyota, at all. Honda? It's too busy copying GM's homework to even know. The Leaf makes me wonder what would've been possible if Nissan hadn't dropped the ball on EV development, until recently, anyway.

There are some caveats here, of course. That $29,990 entry price does get you a lot of range for cheap. It also means cloth seats, no Google Built-In, and no option for a battery heater, for potentially slower DC charging.

Realistically, the trim level you want is the mid-range SV+ at $34,320. My top Platinum+ tester, loaded with all the options, came in at $41,930. I have a hard time recommending it at that price, but in the mid-$30,000 range, the Leaf is kind of a steal.

I walked away from my time in the Leaf with very few complaints and a strong desire to drive one again, and soon. And if I ever wanted to pull the trigger on one someday, it won't break the bank. That's a remarkable achievement for Nissan, and great progress toward the goal of more affordable EVs for all.

Whether it will be a hit remains to be seen, of course. There's the challenge of tariffs now, since the Leaf is made in Japan. And it goes on sale in America without the aid of tax credits that would've sweetened ˆts value proposition. Even Nissan is kind of warning that its rollout could be limited to the more EV-friendly states, making it less likely to be some high-volume Tesla Model Y challenger, potentially.

But the new Nissan Leaf deserves to be a hit. And I hope the rest of the car industry follows its example. It may be hard to make a great $30,000 EV, but this certainly proves that it can be done.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal government agency that is the nation’s largest power company, in September announced it would buy electricity from 6 GW of small modular reactors (SMRs) built by NuScale, with the press release emphasizing that TVA will not take any construction risk. Southern Company said the same thing when they started building Plant Vogtle and Westinghouse went bankrupt as a result. ( Do the parties taking the risk have the resources to bear it?) We should note that the few SMRs built to date have come in wildly over budget, including NuScale’s previous effort. In short, we doubt that the SMRs will produce power at a cost less than conventional or renewable resources, but the deal does provide a test ground for a new type of reactor which might provide needed power if electricity demand rises as expected. And the builders get a form of government support that does not require explicit approval of Congress.

4. The price of oil in October dropped to $62 (Brent) and $58 (WTI). Trump’s energy policy is emphasizing the supply side: open up to leasing, drill baby, drill, but more supply without more demand means lower prices, and prices have dropped to a level that may preclude profitable drilling, in part due to weak demand and in part because our friends in the Middle East have kept up their production in order to protect market share. The administration cannot boost demand for oil or gas any more than it can boost demand for steam coal but could it exercise some muscle to persuade our friends in the Middle East to let up (“Listen MBS you want our fighter planes, then stop selling cheap oil”) but that would raise gasoline prices and push up inflation, so forget that idea.

Peter Drucker, the legendary management consultant, advised firms to direct their resources to their winning lines of business rather than to shoring up the losers.

“We've got to make the case to people about why we're doing this in the long run, and tie it up to things people care about.","Energy secretary Ed Miliband last night called on sustainability professionals to embrace their responsibility as “narrators of hope” and described clean energy as the “economic opportunity of the 21st century”.

21/10/2025

Speaking at the Institute of Sustainability and Environmental Professionals (ISEP) and Broadway Initiative’s annual reception in London, Miliband stressed that the green transition must be “fair for families today, and fair for families in the future.”

He received a rousing applause after congratulating the organisers, before hailing the “incredible diversity” of the climate movement as he addressed over 100 representatives from government, business, finance, and civil society; adding: “We are in the better-lives-today business, not just the disaster-avoidance-tomorrow business.”

""Some of our opponents want to cast us back, and say it's too expensive to act – we have to take on this story of despair,"" he continued. ""Martin Luther King Jr didn’t say ‘I have a nightmare’, he said ‘I have a dream’. People respond to hope and a vision of a better future, and this is the economic opportunity of the 21st century.

“We are the generation that has this unique responsibility and unique opportunity, and I believe in this extraordinary coalition, which is far, far wider than we might think.”

Speaking directly to business leaders, he added: “What you are doing is a brilliant antidote to that story of despair, creating jobs and showing the opportunity of the clean energy economy, because people can see what is actually happening in their local town or city.

“There's nothing more inspiring for me than seeing young apprentices embracing the clean energy revolution, or what's happening on Teesside with net zero. Bringing these tangible benefits to people is absolutely crucial.""

The event marked the publication of Sector Transition Plan guidance from the Net Zero Council, which provides a blueprint for each major sector to co-create a shared vision and pathway to net zero, supported by finance and policy frameworks.

Miliband said: “We welcome this guidance which will help businesses and investors identify what needs to be done, where investment is needed, and how we can work together to make the British people better off through homegrown, clean power.""

ISEP CEO Sarah Mukherjee MBE explained how the plans will ensure the UK is taking a “coordinated, whole-economy approach to the challenge of achieving net zero”.

She continued: “We need to focus on capacity building throughout the workforce in every sector, so we have the skills to drive the net-zero transition across the whole economy.

“Our ambition should be to weave green competences throughout the workforce and make ‘all jobs greener’ – much in the way digital skills spread across entire organisations in previous decades.

“Moreover, workers from existing sectors such as oil and gas can bring huge value in terms of their transferable skills, to ensure a just and efficient net-zero transition.”

Climate Change Committee CEO Emma Pinchbeck and Confederation of British Industry CEO Rain Newton-Smith also spoke at the event, with the latter stressing that green energy is the “greatest job creation opportunity in a generation”.

On communicating climate action with the general public, Pinchbeck told Transform: “What we're seeing in politics is people reflecting that they're worried about the cost of living; they're worried about energy prices.

“We've got to make the case to people about why we're doing this in the long run, and tie it up to things people care about. But we should do it in the least-cost, most-efficient, fairest way possible, and that's one of the reasons we say cheap electricity should be the number one target for government.""",https://www.isepglobal.org/images/favicon/android-icon-192x192.png,N,,2025-10-21 01:17:31.359810

Not only can solar energy help lower your monthly electricity bill, but it can also make using other money-saving electric appliances, like heat pumps, even cheaper to run.","In late September, Iraq opened up its first-ever large-scale solar farm. The project is just one of many designed to help address electricity shortages in the country.

As reported by Tech Xplore, officials in Iraq have completed a solar plant that will be capable of producing up to 300 megawatts of electricity at its peak. Located in the desert in the Karbala province, the solar plant represents the start of a new era of energy production in the country.

""This is the first project of its type in Iraq that has this capacity,"" said Safaa Hussein, executive director of the solar facility. Outside of setting a new precedent, Hussein also noted that the plant will ""supply the national network with electricity, and reduce the fuel consumption especially during the daytime peak load, in addition to reducing the negative environmental impact of gas emissions.""

According to Nasser Karim al-Sudani, head of solar energy projects at the Prime Minister's Office, the country has a number of other solar projects in the pipeline that will quickly follow the solar plant in Karbala. This includes a plant currently under construction in the Babil province capable of producing 225 megawatts of electricity. In the Basra province, crews will soon begin work on another solar facility that will boast an energy capacity of 1,000 megawatts.

With a key goal of establishing energy independence and diversification away from dirty fuels, Iraq is inching closer to achieving sustainable energy development. Iraq deputy minister of electricity Adel Karim revealed that the country's current solar projects could eventually produce up to 12,500 megawatts once all is said and done. This would supply 15-20% of Iraq's total electricity demand.

""All the companies we have contracted with, or are still negotiating with, will sell us electricity at very attractive prices, and we will in turn sell it to consumers,"" Karim said.

Solar energy production can be one of the most effective ways to reduce our planet's reliance on dirty fuels while also delivering cost-effective energy production. At home, the installation of solar panels can become the ultimate energy hack because it can bring your cost of energy down to or near $0. EnergySage provides a free service that makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and helps save you up to $10,000 on solar installations.

These grants will fund the purchase and installation of modern equipment that supports career technical education and training aligned with high-demand industries, such as advanced manufacturing, clean energy, health care, and biotechnology.

“Massachusetts leads the nation because we invest in ideas—through our schools, our colleges, and our people,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Our success in innovation and education is no accident—it’s the result of strategic investments. To stay competitive, we need to keep building the best environments for learning and research, and that’s exactly what Skills Capital Grants are doing. They’re how we prepare our students to lead and how we keep Massachusetts leading the world. Our BRIGHT Act dedicates $100 million to Skills Capital Grants to ensure that every community has access to the tools and training that drive opportunity and innovation.”

“As a proud graduate of Salem State University, I know how transformative public higher education can be when students have access to modern, engaging spaces,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “From classrooms to labs, these are the places where curiosity turns into confidence and careers. STEM Week celebrates that journey—showing students across Massachusetts that innovation starts with them. Through Skills Capital Grants, we’re continuing to invest in the environments that make that possible and ensure every student can see themselves in our state’s innovation story.”

With this new round of Skills Capital Grants, the Healey Driscoll administration has made over 90 grant awards, investing nearly $45 million in the Skills Capital Grant Program to modernize classrooms, labs, and training centers in high schools, colleges, and educational or workforce organizations statewide since 2023. The program is administered by the Workforce Skills Cabinet, which brings together Executive Office of Education, the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development, the Executive Office of Economic Development, and the Executive Office of Health and Human Services.

“STEM starts now—in every classroom, lab, and after-school program where students are encouraged to ask questions, explore, and create,” said Education Secretary Dr. Patrick Tutwiler. “The McAuliffe Center at Framingham State University is a perfect example of what Skills Capital Grants make possible—modern, engaging spaces that inspire curiosity and discovery. These grants help provide the updated spaces and tools our students deserve, ensuring that every learner in Massachusetts has the opportunity to prepare for and succeed in our innovation-driven economy.”

“The Skills Capital Grants help to ensure students and adult learners access modernized infrastructure, equipment, and technologies—critical to fueling our future talent throughout the Commonwealth’s innovation economy,” said Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Lauren Jones. “Building a strong, skilled workforce includes expanding hands-on learning opportunities and leveraging investments through these grants to empower future workers and, in turn, drive the state’s economic competitiveness.”

Today’s announcement took place at Framingham State University’s McAuliffe Center which was updated through Skills Capital Grants, where the administration officially launched STEM Week 2025 under the theme “STEM Starts Now.” The kickoff event reinforced the message that STEM learning can start at any age and plays a crucial role in shaping the Commonwealth’s innovation economy. The weeklong celebration highlights how programs like the Skills Capital Grant initiative are giving students—from early education through higher education—the tools, experiences, and confidence to pursue rewarding careers that fuel the state’s economic growth and competitiveness.

“We want students to graduate with the skills and experience needed launch their careers, and equipment is essential to that preparation,” said Commissioner of Higher Education Noe Ortega. “These investments strengthen the high-quality education that our public higher education students receive, while fueling a skilled workforce for the Commonwealth.”

“In order for students to succeed in in-demand fields, they need access to modern and engaging learning facilities,” said Elementary and Secondary Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez. “These funds help make that possible and show the state’s investment in students.”

“STEM learning sparks curiosity and confidence as students discover how their skills can shape the world around them,” said Commissioner of Early Education and Care Amy Kershaw. “The Skills Capital Grants open doors to hands-on learning and provides the tools to explore, create, and imagine what’s possible.”

The Healey-Driscoll administration has been expanding access to career-connected education in a variety of ways through their Reimagining High School initiative. Governor Healey’s BRIGHT Act includes $100 million for Skills Capital grants. Over the past two and a half years, the administration has approved 49 new Career Technical Education (CTE) programs and recently opened applications for $60 million in CTE program capital grants to add over 2,000 new CTE seats. These efforts build on expansions the administration has made to Early College programs, Innovation Career Pathways, work-based learning opportunities and My Career and Academic Plan (MyCAP). Together, these efforts reflect a shared commitment to creating learning environments that strengthen Massachusetts’ talent pipeline and sustain the state’s position as a national leader in innovation and workforce readiness.

“Massachusetts didn’t become a STEM hub by accident,” said Senate President Karen E. Spilka (D-Ashland). “We got here by emphasizing education early on, investing in outstanding institutions like Framingham State University, and welcoming major industry leaders to our communities. These investments pay off with good-paying jobs for our students, a robust economy, and advances in healthcare. I’m glad the Healey-Driscoll Administration is prioritizing STEM, and proud to see these investments being made right here in MetroWest.”

“The Legislature is committed to supporting vocational and technical education for students across Massachusetts,” said Senator Jason Lewis, Senate Chair of the Joint Committee on Education. “These grants will help schools and other organizations obtain the equipment they need to give students the skills and training necessary to work in high-demand industries and help prepare them for their careers.”

“We are deeply grateful to Governor Healey, Lieutenant Governor Driscoll, and the entire administration for their continued investment in public higher education,” said Framingham State University President Nancy S. Niemi. “This Skills Capital Grant will allow us to expand hands-on learning opportunities for our Nursing students through advanced simulation technology—ensuring that they graduate ready to meet the Commonwealth’s critical healthcare needs. These funds strengthen our ability to prepare highly skilled professionals who will make a lasting difference in their communities and across Massachusetts.”

Framingham State University is among the recipients of this round of Skills Capital Grants. The university’s Nursing program was awarded $155,000 to purchase advanced patient simulator equipment that will expand applied learning opportunities and strengthen clinical preparation for students. FSU’s Nursing program maintains strong partnerships with leading health care providers across the region, including Newton-Wellesley Hospital, the Mass General Brigham and UMass systems, MetroWest Medical Center, Milford Regional Medical Center, Emerson Hospital, and Boston Children’s Hospital—ensuring that students gain hands-on experience in diverse, high-quality care settings.

Tesla Investment Narrative Recap

To own Tesla shares today, you need to believe not just in the company’s vision for autonomous driving and AI-enabled mobility, but also in its ability to execute amid fierce competition and volatility in demand. This week’s record vehicle deliveries, largely fueled by customers acting before the expiry of the US$7,500 EV tax credit, provided short-term momentum but don’t materially change the biggest near-term catalyst: Tesla’s ongoing rollout of autonomous robotaxi services. The overriding risk remains whether Tesla can sustain U.S. demand as consumer incentives end and profit margins tighten.

The most relevant recent announcement is the launch of more affordable “Standard Range” Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. While this move broadens Tesla’s accessible product lineup ahead of an uncertain post-incentive market, investor reaction was muted over concerns the lower prices could pressure gross margins and signal waning pricing power, factors closely tied to Tesla’s ability to fund its AI and autonomous ambitions.

But beneath the strong sales headlines, investors should also be watching for growing debate around CEO governance and how it might impact...

Tesla's outlook anticipates $148.1 billion in revenue and $15.4 billion in earnings by 2028. This projection assumes a 16.9% annual revenue growth rate and a $9.5 billion increase in earnings from the current $5.9 billion.

The project, first envisioned for ICL’s campus in the Carondolet area in south St. Louis, was relocated to an industrial area in the north Riverfront.
So we’ll be meeting with them, we’ll be meeting with the department of energy and we’ll see where this goes,” Wagner said.
“Jobs, especially anywhere in the St. Louis city area are really important right now, so we’re going to do what we can to try to figure out if there’s another path,” Kehoe said.
The grant was announced in August 2023 by the Biden administration, funded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure law.","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.—The Trump administration’s decision to pull roughly $200 million in federal grant funding for a proposed battery materials manufacturing project in North St. Louis may not be the final word on the facility.

ICL Group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing earlier this month that the Department of Energy’s decision “was made as part of a comprehensive review that led to the discontinuation of the funding eligibility for a number of projects that were previously approved for grants in the renewable energy sector and other sectors, with the objective of aligning such grants with the Congressional budget framework and, among other considerations, in response to the anticipated increase in the Project’s costs.”

The company said in the filing that it was reviewing the decision and whether to go forward with the project. It also warned investors of a possible write-off of $40 million in its financial statements. The project, first envisioned for ICL’s campus in the Carondolet area in south St. Louis, was relocated to an industrial area in the north Riverfront. It would bring 150 jobs, not including construction positions necessary to build it.

On Monday, both Congresswoman Ann Wagner and Gov. Mike Kehoe said they hoped this wasn’t the end for the project.

“We’ve just begun our discussions with the company. The company couldn’t even discuss anything with us until early this week. So we’ll be meeting with them, we’ll be meeting with the department of energy and we’ll see where this goes,” Wagner said.

“Jobs, especially anywhere in the St. Louis city area are really important right now, so we’re going to do what we can to try to figure out if there’s another path,” Kehoe said.

Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents the district where the project would be located, called the decision to pull the grant a ""slap in the face to St. Louis workers and families who were counting on good-paying jobs and new investment in our city.""

""Even if this project finds a way to move forward, the Trump administration’s message is clear: they’d rather score cheap political points by attacking clean energy than support real jobs and growth in communities like ours,” he said.

The grant was announced in August 2023 by the Biden administration, funded through the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure law. In May, with the Trump administration in office, Energy Secretary Chris Wright brought a new policy that asked awardees to give more information about their projects and be reviewed on a case by case basis.

“Using this review process, DOE evaluated each of these awards and determined that they did not meet the economic, national security or energy security standards necessary to justify continued investment,” a DOE statement said earlier this month, announcing the withdrawal of 321 awards totaling roughly $7.5 billion.

These actions are creating good-paying jobs for Americans, enhancing American economic power and energy security, and reducing reliance on foreign powers that don’t share our interests.
Unlike the Desert Southwest Pipeline, this project would transport refined products rather than natural gas.
If we rise to meet the energy challenges of our moment, this future is not far off.
Yet, despite the regulatory and infrastructure challenges we currently face, projects like Desert Southwest offer a blueprint for how the U.S. can achieve our energy potential.","America stands at the threshold of a new economic era, one that promises greater prosperity, security, and connectivity. Yet for communities across the Sunbelt and the nation, the energy required to power a 21st-century economy is outpacing supply, threatening a daily reality of frequent blackouts and sky-high energy prices.

At the same time, the very forces driving this strain – technology, population growth, and infrastructure – also hold the keys to America’s future. Harnessed effectively, they can create jobs, fuel economic growth, and strengthen national security. If policymakers and private-sector leaders embrace this moment with an ambitious, pro-infrastructure, all-of-the-above energy strategy, the nation can turn today’s challenges into lasting energy security and independence.

Arizona offers a window into the country’s broader energy struggles. Arizona is now home to 162 AI data centers, which place enormous demands on the state’s electric grid, far beyond what traditional infrastructure was designed to handle. The state has also seen a population boom in the last 25 years, increasing by 2.5 million people since 2000. Combined with the extreme heat of desert summers, population growth has led to increased energy demand for homes, transportation, and businesses. As if these challenges weren’t enough, electricity generators plan to retire 12.3 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in 2025. While this represents a large portion of the nation’s existing grid, replacement plans remain inadequate.

The good news is that solutions are within reach, and while new technologies may be part of the problem, they also offer exciting opportunities to unlock our nation’s energy potential. Since January, the Trump Administration has been leading the charge, easing access for American companies to produce oil and natural gas and reducing red tape to support the construction of critical energy infrastructure. President Trump also announced Stargate LLC, a $500 billion public-private partnership with leading technology companies to build the physical and digital infrastructure necessary to power next-generation artificial intelligence. These actions are creating good-paying jobs for Americans, enhancing American economic power and energy security, and reducing reliance on foreign powers that don’t share our interests.

The private sector is also stepping up. Two recently announced projects in the Sun Belt show what’s possible when companies are empowered to act. Energy Transfer’s planned expansion of the Desert Southwest Pipeline will carry natural gas from the Permian Basin to markets in the Southwest, adding 1.5 billion cubic feet per day for communities in Arizona and New Mexico with growing demand. Arizona’s two largest utility companies have already signed agreements to secure capacity from the pipeline, which will support new gas-fired power plants and reduce strain on the state’s energy grid. Though completion is not expected until 2029, construction alone will create 5,000 jobs, with Energy Transfer pledging to prioritize local and union workers.

ONEOK’s proposed Sun Belt Connector Pipeline offers another example of infrastructure investment tailored to real-world energy needs. Unlike the Desert Southwest Pipeline, this project would transport refined products rather than natural gas. When operational in 2029, it will extend from El Paso to the Phoenix area, supplying refined fuels, including jet fuel, to one of the nation’s fastest-growing transportation hubs.

Projects like Desert Southwest and the Sun Belt Connector Pipeline should not be exceptions but instead serve as models of what America can achieve with the right policies in place: creating jobs, strengthening infrastructure, and meeting the demands of a growing economy.

Far from the grim possibilities of rolling blackouts and sky-high energy prices, these energy projects help us to imagine a future where families enjoy lower energy bills, where workers find job opportunities building the infrastructure of tomorrow, and where America leads the world in both innovation and security. If we rise to meet the energy challenges of our moment, this future is not far off.

Achieving this future will take an aggressive, all-of-the-above strategy combining natural gas, oil, nuclear, renewables, and emerging technologies. Policymakers from the federal and state levels must also work together with private sector partners instead of trying to score cheap political points. Yet, despite the regulatory and infrastructure challenges we currently face, projects like Desert Southwest offer a blueprint for how the U.S. can achieve our energy potential.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_center_square_articles_912/9642bc202bc384232889e472635600be,N,,2025-10-20 22:00:18.983762

China's overwhelming control of critical mineral supply chains has created strategic vulnerabilities that the US-Australia critical minerals framework directly addresses through coordinated Western response initiatives.
Several specific minerals targeted by the US-Australia critical minerals framework offer transformative potential for global supply chain independence and strategic security applications.
Despite ambitious timelines and substantial financial commitments, the US-Australia critical minerals framework faces several implementation challenges that could affect project development schedules and success rates.
The US-Australia critical minerals framework promises substantial economic transformation across multiple sectors while creating new industrial capabilities and export opportunities for Australia.","The US-Australia critical minerals framework represents a groundbreaking bilateral partnership designed to fundamentally reshape global supply chains for materials essential to defense, technology, and renewable energy sectors. This strategic agreement aims to establish mineral security independence while directly challenging existing market monopolies that threaten Western economic and defense interests.

Critical minerals encompass rare earth elements, lithium, graphite, titanium, and other materials essential for manufacturing semiconductors, military equipment, electric vehicle batteries, and renewable energy infrastructure. These resources power everything from smartphone circuits to missile guidance systems, making their reliable supply crucial for national security and economic competitiveness. Furthermore, the importance of a critical minerals energy transition cannot be understated in today's geopolitical landscape.

According to ABC News, the framework enables mining companies to apply for financing for projects producing materials needed for weapons, electronics, renewable technologies and more. The partnership establishes a unique ownership structure where both governments will acquire equity positions in funded facilities while securing right of offtake agreements, essentially guaranteeing supply access for both nations.

Prime Minister Albanese emphasised that this framework represents taking the Australia-US relationship to that next level, focusing not merely on resource extraction but on investment across the supply chains to ensure value-added processing rather than solely digging things up and exporting them. This approach marks a significant shift from traditional resource export models toward integrated supply chain development.

How Much Investment Will the Framework Generate?

The US-Australia critical minerals framework commits to deploying $3 billion USD within six months of implementation, representing one of the largest bilateral mineral investment initiatives in recent history. This rapid deployment schedule demonstrates the extraordinary urgency both nations place on supply chain diversification and strategic independence.

Investment Timeline and Scale:

• Immediate Investment Phase: $3 billion USD within six months

• Total Framework Pipeline: Up to $8.5 billion across multiple projects

• Geographic Coverage: Projects spanning nearly every Australian state and territory

The market responded immediately to the announcement, with critical mineral stocks rallying in early trading following the framework's unveiling. This positive market reaction indicates investor confidence in the partnership's potential to transform supply chain dynamics and create profitable opportunities in the critical minerals sector.

President Trump projected ambitious production outcomes, suggesting that about a year from now there would be abundant critical minerals and rare earths available. However, industry experts note that bringing new mining and processing facilities online typically requires significantly longer timeframes than political projections might suggest.

The framework's financial structure includes government ownership stakes alongside private investment, creating a hybrid model that balances public strategic interests with private sector efficiency. This approach aims to ensure projects remain commercially viable while meeting national security objectives for both countries.

Which Australian Projects Will Receive Priority Funding?

The framework prioritises several flagship projects across multiple Australian states, each targeting specific critical minerals with strategic importance for defence and technology applications.

Western Australia's Gallium Production Hub

The Alcoa-Sojitz gallium refinery represents the framework's inaugural project, with financing announced from both Australian and US government sources. This facility targets 100 tonnes annual production capacity, which would supply approximately 13-14% of global demand based on current worldwide consumption of 700-750 tonnes yearly.

This project directly addresses China's position as the world's biggest supplier of gallium, a computer chip material essential for semiconductor manufacturing. The refinery's development will significantly shift global dependence patterns away from Chinese-controlled supply chains.

Northern Territory's Defence Applications Focus

The Nolans Project concentrates on neodymium production specifically for military applications including night vision devices and guided missiles. This facility addresses critical defence supply vulnerabilities while establishing domestic processing capabilities for materials essential to precision weaponry and surveillance equipment.

Multi-State Strategic Mineral Development

Priority Projects by Region and Applications:

Location Primary Minerals Strategic Applications Global Significance Western Australia Gallium, Heavy Rare Earths Computer chips, EV magnets 13-14% of global gallium demand Northern Territory Neodymium Military optics, guidance systems Defence supply security Queensland Graphite Battery anodes, steel production World's third-largest deposit Victoria/NSW Titanium, Zircon Aerospace, medical devices Multi-state coordination

The Iluka Eneabba refinery in Western Australia, which has already secured $1.75 billion in Commonwealth loans, could produce a quarter of the world's global heavy rare earths supply. These materials provide essential components for magnets in electric vehicles, military aircraft parts, and industrial equipment.

Queensland's graphite development sits on the world's third-largest known deposit, positioning this project to significantly impact global battery supply chains. Natural graphite serves as a crucial component in lithium-ion battery anodes, making this development essential for electric vehicle manufacturing independence. Moreover, this aligns with Australia's broader critical minerals strategic reserve initiatives.

Why Is China's Market Dominance Driving This Partnership?

China's overwhelming control of critical mineral supply chains has created strategic vulnerabilities that the US-Australia critical minerals framework directly addresses through coordinated Western response initiatives.

Understanding China's Strategic Market Position

China currently maintains control of approximately 90 percent of the refining market for critical minerals while simultaneously operating as the world's biggest supplier of key materials like gallium. This dominant position extends beyond simple market share into strategic leverage over Western technology and defence industries.

Recent escalations in Chinese export control policies have demonstrated how mineral dependencies can become geopolitical pressure points. Earlier this month, China further tightened export controls on critical mineral technologies by requiring exporters to obtain government permission before shipping rare-earth mining and smelting equipment to foreign buyers.

Economic Pressure Through Subsidised Production

China's approach involves heavily subsidising its critical minerals sector while aggressively ramping up production to drive global prices down. This calculated strategy has led to price falls that other international producers cannot compete with, effectively using economic pressure to maintain market dominance. Additionally, the ongoing US-China trade war impacts have intensified these supply chain concerns.

This subsidised production model has put Australian and other foreign facilities under extreme pressure, making it economically challenging for Western nations to maintain competitive processing capabilities without strategic government intervention.

Key Market Control Mechanisms:

• Refining Dominance: 90% control of global refining capacity

• Price Manipulation: Subsidised production driving down global prices

• Export Controls: Government permission required for technology transfers

• Supply Chain Integration: Vertical control from mining through processing

The framework represents a coordinated Western response to these market distortions, using government financing and strategic reserves to create economically viable alternatives to Chinese-controlled supply chains.

How Will This Framework Reshape Global Supply Chains?

The US-Australia critical minerals framework has potential to fundamentally alter global market dynamics through strategic capacity development and coordinated supply chain diversification initiatives.

Production Capacity Transformations

Several framework projects could create substantial shifts in global supply patterns. The Eneabba refinery expansion alone could produce 25% of worldwide heavy rare earth demand, while Queensland's graphite development leverages the world's third-largest known deposit to influence battery supply chains.

These capacity additions will create alternative supply sources for materials that currently flow predominantly through Chinese-controlled processing facilities. The strategic significance extends beyond simple diversification into genuine supply security for Western technology and defence industries. Similarly, the European CRM facility developments demonstrate a coordinated Western response to supply chain vulnerabilities.

Strategic Reserve Integration and Price Stability

Australia's planned critical minerals strategic reserve will work alongside the framework to provide price stability through floor pricing mechanisms. This strategic reserve could remove investment risks by setting minimum price levels for priority minerals, protecting private investors from artificial price manipulation.

A government taskforce is currently considering potential price support mechanisms and determining which specific minerals will receive strategic reserve protection. The reserve system is scheduled to become operational by the end of next year, creating a comprehensive support structure for framework projects.

Supply Chain Impact Areas:

• Heavy Rare Earths: 25% of global supply from Australian facilities

• Graphite Processing: Alternative to Chinese battery-grade material

• Defence Materials: Secure supply chains for military applications

• Technology Inputs: Semiconductor and electronics supply diversification

The framework's integration with strategic reserve systems creates a model that other democratic allies may replicate, potentially establishing coordinated alternative supply networks that reduce collective dependence on Chinese-controlled resources.

What Are the Defence and Security Implications?

The framework directly addresses critical vulnerabilities in defence supply chains, with explicit connections between mineral access and national security capabilities across multiple application areas.

Military Technology Dependencies

President Trump explicitly linked the agreement to military applications including ships, vehicles, guns and ammunition, highlighting how mineral access intersects with defence manufacturing capabilities. The Nolans Project's focus on neodymium production specifically targets materials used in night vision devices and guided missiles. This complements the recent US mineral production order focusing on national security applications.

Financing for initial projects includes support from the US War Department, demonstrating direct military investment in securing strategic material supplies. This military involvement underscores the defence establishment's recognition that mineral supply security represents a fundamental national security requirement.

Allied Supply Chain Coordination

Beyond bilateral benefits, the framework establishes a precedent for allied cooperation in strategic resource development. This approach could influence similar partnerships with other democratic allies facing comparable supply chain vulnerabilities from Chinese market dominance.

Defence Applications by Material:

• Neodymium: Night vision equipment, precision guidance systems

• Gallium: Military electronics, radar systems

• Heavy Rare Earths: Military aircraft components, advanced weaponry

• Titanium: Aerospace applications, naval vessels

The geographic distribution of projects across nearly every Australian state and territory creates resilient supply networks that reduce single-point-of-failure risks in defence material procurement.

Which Minerals Will Drive the Biggest Impact?

Several specific minerals targeted by the US-Australia critical minerals framework offer transformative potential for global supply chain independence and strategic security applications.

Rare Earth Elements for Advanced Technologies

Heavy rare earth elements from Australian facilities will supply magnet production for electric vehicles, military aircraft components, and industrial equipment. These materials are essential for high-performance applications where suitable substitutes simply do not exist.

The Eneabba refinery's potential to supply 25% of global heavy rare earth demand represents a fundamental shift in market dynamics, particularly for materials used in magnets for electric vehicles and military aircraft parts.

Strategic Materials for Defence and Technology

Critical Minerals Applications and Strategic Importance:

Mineral Primary Applications Strategic Value Global Context Gallium Computer chips, semiconductor manufacturing Essential for all electronics 700-750 tonnes global demand Neodymium Permanent magnets, military optics Defence applications critical No suitable substitutes Graphite Battery anodes, steel production EV supply chain independence World's 3rd largest deposit Titanium Aerospace, medical implants High-performance applications Multi-state development

Battery Material Supply Chain Independence

Queensland's graphite development addresses electric vehicle battery supply chains while reducing dependence on processed materials from China. Natural graphite requires extensive processing to meet battery-grade specifications, making domestic processing capabilities essential for supply chain security.

The world's third-largest graphite deposit in Queensland positions this project to significantly impact global battery manufacturing independence, particularly as electric vehicle adoption accelerates worldwide.

Strategic Material Priorities:

• Immediate Impact: Gallium for semiconductor manufacturing

• Defence Critical: Neodymium for military applications

• Future Growth: Graphite for battery technology expansion

• Industrial Applications: Titanium and zircon for aerospace and medical sectors

How Will Market Prices Respond to Increased Supply?

Market price dynamics under the US-Australia critical minerals framework will likely experience complex interactions between increased Western supply capacity and existing Chinese pricing strategies.

Immediate Market Reactions

Critical mineral stocks rallied in early trading following the framework announcement, indicating investor confidence in the partnership's commercial viability. This positive market response suggests financial markets recognise the framework's potential to create profitable opportunities while addressing supply chain vulnerabilities.

President Trump projected dramatic price changes, suggesting abundant critical minerals and rare earths would be available within a year, potentially driving prices to extremely low levels. However, industry analysts note that bringing new mining and processing facilities online typically requires longer development timelines than political projections might indicate.

Strategic Reserve Price Support Mechanisms

The framework's integration with Australia's strategic reserve system aims to establish price floors for priority minerals. This mechanism protects investors from artificial price manipulation while ensuring supply availability during geopolitical tensions.

A government taskforce is actively considering potential price support mechanisms and determining which minerals will receive strategic protection. These decisions will significantly influence investment patterns and project viability across the framework's development timeline.

Price Impact Factors:

• Strategic Reserves: Floor pricing to protect investments

• Competition Effects: Pressure on Chinese subsidised pricing

• Market Confidence: Investor response to supply security

• Development Timelines: Actual production versus projected schedules

The strategic reserve's price floor mechanism could encourage private investment by reducing downside risks while maintaining competitive market dynamics for efficient resource allocation.

What Challenges Could Slow Framework Implementation?

Despite ambitious timelines and substantial financial commitments, the US-Australia critical minerals framework faces several implementation challenges that could affect project development schedules and success rates.

Regulatory Approval and Permitting Delays

Opposition Leader Sussan Ley highlighted that it takes years and years to get approval for mining projects in Australia, suggesting approval process delays represent a significant barrier to meeting framework timelines. She noted concerns that Australia's investment pipeline was drying up due to regulatory inefficiencies.

Ley criticised government approaches, stating it feels as if there is a government that is anti-business and doesn't understand that once investment pipelines dry up, significant economic troubles follow. These regulatory concerns could significantly impact the framework's ambitious six-month deployment schedule.

Technical Processing and Infrastructure Requirements

Developing refining and processing capabilities requires specialised expertise and infrastructure investments that extend far beyond raw material extraction. Building these capabilities from scratch presents substantial technical challenges and workforce development requirements.

Australia has some of the world's most abundant reserves of critical minerals, but price instability and high costs of processing and refining onshore have historically slowed investment. The framework must address these underlying economic challenges to achieve sustainable development outcomes.

Implementation Challenge Areas:

• Regulatory Timelines: Years-long approval processes for mining projects

• Technical Expertise: Specialised refining and processing capabilities

• Infrastructure Development: New facilities requiring substantial capital investment

• Price Volatility: Market instability affecting project economics

Market Competition and Economic Viability

China's heavily subsidised production has created artificial price environments that make competing facilities economically challenging. The framework must overcome these market distortions through strategic financing and price support mechanisms.

The strategic reserve system's delayed implementation until the end of next year creates a gap where projects may face continued price pressures from Chinese subsidised production during critical development phases.

How Does This Compare to Other International Partnerships?

The US-Australia critical minerals framework represents one of the most comprehensive bilateral mineral agreements in terms of financial scale, strategic scope, and integrated supply chain development approach.

Scale and Strategic Integration

With $3 billion in immediate six-month deployment and up to $8.5 billion in total pipeline value, this partnership exceeds most previous bilateral resource agreements in both financial commitment and implementation urgency. According to the US-Australia Framework for Securing Supply, President Trump noted they had been working on the framework for quite a while, indicating extensive negotiations and strategic planning.

Unlike traditional trade agreements focused on resource extraction and export, this framework encompasses entire supply chain development from mining through processing and strategic reserve integration. This comprehensive approach distinguishes it from conventional bilateral resource partnerships.

Allied Cooperation Model

The framework builds upon existing security relationships while extending cooperation into economic and industrial domains. This integration demonstrates how security alliances can evolve to address economic vulnerabilities that affect national defence capabilities. Furthermore, as noted in the Prime Minister's statement, this represents a historic step in bilateral cooperation.

Partnership Distinction Factors:

• Financial Scale: $8.5 billion pipeline exceeds most bilateral agreements

• Implementation Speed: Six-month deployment timeline demonstrates urgency

• Supply Chain Integration: Complete processing capability development

• Strategic Reserve Coordination: Price support and supply security mechanisms

The framework's emphasis on government ownership stakes combined with right of offtake guarantees creates a hybrid public-private model that balances strategic control with commercial efficiency.

What Are the Long-term Economic Implications?

The US-Australia critical minerals framework promises substantial economic transformation across multiple sectors while creating new industrial capabilities and export opportunities for Australia.

Industrial Development and Employment Creation

Framework investments will generate employment opportunities across multiple Australian states while developing advanced manufacturing capabilities that extend beyond traditional mining operations. These positions span from extraction operations through sophisticated processing facilities requiring specialised technical expertise.

The geographic distribution across nearly every state and territory ensures broad economic benefits while creating new industrial centres in regional areas. This distributed approach strengthens economic resilience while revitalising communities dependent on mining sector activity.

Value-Added Export Revenue Transformation

Successful framework implementation positions Australia as a major supplier of processed critical minerals rather than merely raw material exports. Prime Minister Albanese emphasised the importance of investment across supply chains, ensuring value addition through processing rather than simply digging things up and exporting them.

This transition from commodity exports to value-added processing dramatically increases potential export revenues while building domestic industrial capacity. The shift represents a fundamental change in Australia's resource sector economic model.

Economic Impact Areas:

• Employment Generation: High-skill processing jobs across multiple states

• Export Revenue Growth: Value-added processing versus raw material sales

• Industrial Capability: Advanced manufacturing expertise development

• Regional Development: Economic revitalisation in mining communities

Strategic Economic Independence

The framework creates economic alternatives to Chinese-dominated supply chains while establishing Australia as a reliable partner for Western technology and defence industries. This positioning offers substantial long-term economic advantages as global supply chain diversification accelerates.

Integration with strategic reserve systems provides price stability mechanisms that encourage continued investment while protecting against market manipulation. This economic security framework supports sustained industrial development beyond initial government financing phases.

The partnership establishes Australia as a critical link in secure supply chains for democratic allies, creating durable economic relationships that extend beyond traditional resource exports into strategic industrial partnerships.

This is the view of U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar. He praised the North American Development for making the two rehabilitation projects - Colector Ribereño and the Colector Donato Guerra - happen.

NADBank is providing $8 million dollars in grants from the Bank's Border Environment Infrastructure Fund (BEIF), which is funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The money will rehabilitate the Colector Ribereño and the Colector Donato Guerra.

“This project is vital for border communities and for the downstream communities that rely on the Rio Grande. When we invest in cross-border infrastructure, we protect American families who depend on the river for drinking water,” Cuellar said.

Cuellar said he is a “strong supporter” of NADBank and the critical projects that it helps develop.

“That is why I helped increase its capital reauthorization through the USMCA and have worked, through my role on the Appropriations Committee, to secure critical federal funding for infrastructure projects along the border,” Cuellar said.

USMCA stands for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

“As a senior appropriator, I will continue to secure critical funding for projects that support our local communities,” Cuellar added.

Recently, NADBank held a groundbreaking ceremony for the rehabilitation of the Colector Ribereño and the Colector Donato Guerra wastewater sewer mains. The bank is working alongside the Municipality of Nuevo Laredo, the State of Tamaulipas, Mexico’s National Water Commission (CONAGUA), and the local water utility Comision de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Nuevo Laredo (COMAPA) on the projects.

According to COMAPA, approximately 98% of homes in its service area are connected to the wastewater collection system and consist of approximately 407 km (253 miles) of wastewater lines that mainly operate by gravity. The city also has 12 lift stations and 9.5 km (5.9 miles) of force mains to convey the sanitary sewer to the Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP).

The total project cost amounts to approximately US$81.2 million, financed through a successful combination of BEIF funds, a commercial loan of up to US$6 million and Mexican federal, state, and local funds of $52.2 million representing 64.7% of the total project cost. The International Boundary Water Commission also participated with part of the financing.

Salvador López Córdova, NADBank's chief environmental officer, said the two projects are part of a Comprehensive Wastewater Collection and Treatment Project that will benefit more than 400,000 residents.

“NADBank is proud to be part of this vital undertaking for the citywide rehabilitation of Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater system,” López said.“NADBank played a key role in structuring the infrastructure financing plan and coordinating with the different agencies that are collaborating to bring this project to reality. Over the next three years, the project will significantly reduce transboundary wastewater flows into the Rio Grande, which is essential for the long-term regional well-being & embody the very purpose for which NADBank was established.”

López said the Comprehensive Wastewater Collection and Treatment project will rehabilitate and expand the wastewater collection system for more than 120, 000 residential connections and double the treatment capacity of two of the three existing WWTPs, which will decrease system failure and prevent discharge of approximately 12.6 million gallons per day of untreated wastewater into groundwater and surface water, including the Rio Grande. The downstream communities on both sides of the border that rely on the river for their drinking water supply will also benefit.

For several years, NADBank has worked closely with the City and COMAPA in structuring the investment and financing plan for the project, López explained, providing more than US$650,000 in technical assistance, with resources from both the Bank and EPA, to support studies, assessments and preliminary designs underpinning this transformation.

Work to rehabilitate the wastewater collection system began in 2019 with investments from the municipal government and federal funding through Conagua.

In addition to López, the event included participation from Nuevo Laredo Mayor Carmen Lilia Canturosas Villareal, Tamaulipas Secretary of Water Resources for Social Development Raul Quiroga Alvarez, and CONAGUA’s Regional Director of the Río Grande watershed, Luis Carlos Alatorre, along with representatives from COMAPA.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/riogrande/original/20251020-202345-279-251020-NADBank_4.jpeg,N,,2025-10-20 22:00:09.673143

PLUG and FuelCell Energy, Inc. FCEL are both familiar names operating in the fuel cell technology market. As rivals, both companies are engaged in manufacturing innovative fuel cell product solutions and electrolysis platforms in the United States and abroad.

Both companies have been enjoying significant growth opportunities in the green hydrogen market on account of growing demand for clean energy solutions and government initiatives to decarbonize several sectors. Let’s take a closer look at their fundamentals, growth prospects and challenges.

The Case for Plug Power

Plug Power’s results have been showing signs of recovery of late. After witnessing growth of 11% in the first quarter, PLUG’s revenues increased 21% year over year in the second quarter. The revenues were driven by solid demand for its GenEco proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers across the industrial and energy sectors. In the second quarter, revenues from the electrolyzer product line surged approximately 200% on a year-over-year basis.

The company is expected to continue benefiting from strong electrolyzer demand in Europe, where government investments and faster project timelines are promoting the use of green hydrogen. In October 2025, Plug Power delivered a 10-megawatt (MW) GenEco electrolyzer to Galp’s Portugal-based Sines Refinery, which is one of Europe’s largest PEM hydrogen project. The company secured an order to install a total of 10 arrays of GenEco electrolyzers with Hydrogen Processing Units by early 2026.

Also, in June 2025, PLUG expanded its partnership with Allied Green Ammonia with a new two-gigawatt electrolyzer project in Uzbekistan. This deal builds on their existing three GW project in Australia and strengthens the company’s position as a leading provider of large-scale hydrogen solutions worldwide.

Plug Power remains focused on scaling up its business and investing in hydrogen plants, given the long-term growth potential of the green hydrogen energy market. PLUG intends to capitalize on the opportunity with increased green hydrogen production at its new plant in Georgia, as well as its joint venture with Olin Corporation OLN in Louisiana.

PLUG launched Project Quantum Leap to improve its margin, cash flow and reduce the cash burn rate. As part of the project, it expects to benefit from sales growth, pricing actions, better inventory and capex management, and increased leverage of its hydrogen production platform. PLUG expects the project to generate more than $200 million in annualized savings.

However, PLUG’s inability to generate positive gross margins and weak liquidity position might affect its profitability in the near term.

The Case for FuelCell Energy

FCEL has been benefiting from strong orders from its customers who need a 24/7 clean energy supply to efficiently run their operations. In July 2025, the company clinched an order from CGN-Yulchon to deliver eight advanced carbonate fuel cell modules and maintenance services at the latter’s Gwangyang facility. The seven-year deal, with an option of extending the initial term, will allow FuelCell Energy to expand its presence in one of the most advanced fuel cell markets in Asia.

Earlier this year, FCEL also received a contract to build a 7.4 MW fuel cell power plant in Hartford, CT. The project is expected to add more than $160 million of future revenues to FuelCell Energy’s generation backlog. The backlog at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended July 2025) was $1.24 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4%.

FuelCell Energy’s strategic partnership with Inuverse, Diversied Energy and TESIAC Corp. is also expected to accelerate its entry into the data center market and expand its penetration in deployed microgrid applications.

FCEL remains well-poised to capitalize on the growing opportunities created by the increased power demand from data centers. The company expects to witness solid demand for its modular power block solutions, which are specially designed to cater to this growing demand across the data center market.

Also, the company implemented a restructuring program, particularly in the United States, Canada and Germany, in June. This initiative is helping it to lower operating costs, realign resources toward advancing the company’s core carbonate technologies and strengthen its position in the clean energy market.

Despite this, FCEL has been subject to high operating costs and negative gross margins, which are expected to hurt its near-term profitability.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Tokyo Gas will sell all of its subsidiaries’ holdings in the Eagle Ford shale gas project in Texas.
Tokyo Gas, which is Japan’s largest utility, has been under Elliott’s scrutiny since last year, when the company stated it held a 5% stake in Tokyo Gas.
Akin noted that by pulling out of the sector, Tokyo Gas can instead focus on its other assets in the US energy sector.","The global energy market is awash with companies assessing their portfolios. Echoing that cautious approach is the recent news that Tokyo Gas will divest its U.S. shale stake, rebalancing its focus toward its other midstream assets. The US energy market is a volatile and unpredictable environment for companies to operate in, mostly due to the fact that the current administration in the United States is as unpredictable as a toddler on a sugar rush. Tokyo Gas has selected one of its compatriots as the buyer for its U.S. shale stake.

Tokyo Gas will sell off all of its holdings in the US shale stake as the sector faces uncertainty due to Donald Trump

Since coming into office for the second time, Donald Trump has treated the American economy with about as much care as a rollercoaster maintenance technician. The market has seen significant ups and downs in recent months. But as ever, the US economy will bounce back as the largest economy in the world.

Due to the uncertain nature of the economy, many nations have opted out of the US market, citing the volatile tariffs and increasing inflation as a major contributor to the exodus.

That exodus has reached the Japanese companies operating an interest in the US energy sector. Tokyo Gas has announced, following extensive consultation with a law firm, that it is bending the knee to activist shareholder Elliott Investment Management, which has called for the company to streamline its portfolio.

Tokyo Gas will sell all of its subsidiaries’ holdings in the Eagle Ford shale gas project in Texas. The company stated that it will sell its stake to compatriot and fellow energy company, Shizuoka Gas Co., for $130 million. Tokyo Gas, which is Japan’s largest utility, has been under Elliott’s scrutiny since last year, when the company stated it held a 5% stake in Tokyo Gas.

Elliot then proceeded to insist that Tokyo Gas sell off the stake in the Eagle Ford shale gas project, instead opting to focus on assets it acquired through the purchase of Rockcliff Energy in 2023 in East Texas and North Louisiana.

Tokyo Gas consulted with a huge law firm before opting to sell its stake in the US shale industry

The company has noted that it consulted with Akin, a leading international law firm with more than 900 lawyers across the US, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Akin advised the company to sell its stake in the Eagle Ford shale gas project in South Texas.

The Akin team was led by several extensively experienced lawyers who advised the company to align with Elliott Investment Management’s mandate to sell the stake in the project. While the US energy market remains unpredictable, the UAE has invested in the midstream and downstream sectors.

Akin noted that by pulling out of the sector, Tokyo Gas can instead focus on its other assets in the US energy sector. As the company is Japan’s largest gas company, its assets are spread across a wide range of projects.

If the amendments are approved, the state would make up the difference for the revenue school districts lose from property taxes through a process called ""compression.""
Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire.
""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""
McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself.","Monday marks the start of early voting in Texas' Nov. 4 general election. The only statewide contests this year are ballot propositions to amend the state constitution — 17 of them, to be exact.

More than half of the constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall deal with taxation, while others pertain to bail practices, dementia research and the state’s water supply.

Arguably, the most significant measures would raise homestead exemptions. They determine how much of a home's property value can be taxed to pay for public schools.

Proposition 13 would lift the homestead exemption for all Texas homeowners from $100,000 to $140,000.

""Now that will save all those 5.7 million homeowners $484 per year,"" said Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt of Houston, author of the measure. ""Once the voters approve of a homestead exemption for schools, it follows you, no matter where you go. That $140,000 exemption means it’s whatever your primary homestead is, and it doesn’t matter if it’s year one or year 50, that’s going to be there. So that’s a substantial lifetime benefit.""

Bettencourt is also the author of Proposition 11, which would lift the additional homestead exemption for homeowners who are over age 65 or disabled from $10,000 to $60,000. In other words, if both Propositions 11 and 13 pass, those homeowners would have a homestead exemption of $200,000.

""Now you may ask, ‘Why do more for over-65 and disabled homeowners?'"" Bettencourt said. ""They’re generally on fixed income, and they need the most help staying in their home. And in the case of seniors, you [can] argue that they already paid a lifetime of taxes and probably don’t have any current students in the public education system.""

The combined benefits, and burdens, of tax breaks

Taken together with amendments to reduce property taxes passed in earlier elections, maintaining these reductions will cost the state roughly $51 billion.

“A lot of those have been funded out of surplus money, and surplus money is one-time revenue,"" said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""It’s not recurring revenue. So, when the surplus ends, you have to find another way to finance these reductions.""

If the amendments are approved, the state would make up the difference for the revenue school districts lose from property taxes through a process called ""compression."" But unlike the homestead exemptions, the compressions would not be written into the constitution.

""There’s a big difference between the homestead exemptions, which are constitutionally passed and so guaranteed forever, but the compressions can be taken away just like that,"" Diamond said, snapping his fingers. ""Those are not protected.""

And that could lead to deep cuts in public education funding in lean budget years, much as Texas saw 20 years ago.

Some of the other tax measures are highly targeted. Proposition 7 would provide a full or partial homestead exemption to the surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a disease or medical condition related to their service. Proposition 17 would provide property tax relief for homeowners whose property has been affected by the installation or construction of border security infrastructure along the Mexican border.

Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire. That's another of Bettencourt's measures.

""And so we decided, fine, we’ll give them the same coverage that we do for tornadoes and hurricanes,"" Bettencourt said. “Because if your home’s burned down, you shouldn’t have to pay for all the whole full value.""

University of Houston economist Steven Craig said all those exemptions add up.

""Our heart can go out to all kinds of people, and then the question is, ‘Is this the way to help them, or is there a better way to help them?'"" Craig said. ""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""

Then there are a series of measures that would ban the state from collecting certain kinds of taxes altogether. Proposition 2 would ban capital gains taxes. Proposition 6 would ban taxes on securities transactions. That's ahead of Texas establishing its own stock exchange. And Proposition 8 would ban inheritance taxes.

Texas doesn't collect any of these at present, but Diamond said ruling them out limits the state's options when revenues from other sources fall.

""Sales taxes, I could definitely see those flattening out as the consumers' resilience finally fades,"" Diamond said, ""and then federal transfers almost certainly are going to fall and could fall significantly. That is a huge chunk of the Texas budget.""

Felony bail changes

At least three ballot measures that don't relate to taxation have potentially widespread ramifications for the state. Take Proposition 3, which would amend the constitution to allow judges to deny bail to people charged with certain felonies. Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman of Houston has been trying to get this passed since 2019.

""A judge would have to determine that either the person was going to be a threat in some way to the safety of the community or to law enforcement and/or a likelihood that the person would not return to court,"" Huffman said.

The amendment would apply only to the most serious offenses — capital murder, murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and continuous human trafficking.

""This doesn’t take away any of the other rights that they would have for a trial, for the state to have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Huffman said. ""It’s just reserved for those that would be held pending trial. And I will say that many states have this exact same type of system, and the federal system operates this way for violent offenders.""

Prop 3 would affect a relatively small number of cases in the Texas justice system, about 40,000 out of more than 800,000 arrests made in Texas every year. That's according to Nick Hudson, senior manager of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of Texas. But Hudson said he has serious concerns that the measure would worsen overcrowding in Texas jails.

""I think this is very likely to pass. Our focus has been on trying to mitigate the harm it will cause,"" Hudson said. “We, along with many other people and many House and Senate negotiators, worked to ensure that there was access to lawyers baked into this proposal to blunt some of the potential negative impacts. We are happy to see that provision in, but we are really concerned that this will accelerate pretrial detention.""

Hudson argued that the measure could wind up violating one of the most basic rights of the accused.

""They have not been convicted,"" Hudson said. ""They are presumed innocent [until proven guilty], waiting for trial behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of about $1.2 billion a year.""

Investments in water infrastructure and dementia prevention

One ballot measure with a similar price tag, but less controversial, is Proposition 4. This amendment would dedicate up to $1 billion per year from existing state sales tax revenue to the Texas Water Fund for the next 20 years. The money would be used to fix some of the state's most pressing water infrastructure needs.

Sarah Rountree Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation, estimated the state's total needs for new water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as to replace aging infrastructure, at $150 billion, far above the maximum of $20 billion that Prop 4 would provide.

""Is it enough? No, it’s not enough to meet everything,"" Schlessinger said. ""Is it a significant move towards funding water infrastructure in Texas? Yes, significantly so.""

Schlessinger said the total amount of money the amendment would commit is less significant than the fact that the amendment provides for a dedicated and ongoing source of funds — allowing the state to better plan for long-term needs, like combatting droughts worsening in the face of climate change.

Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at the public policy think tank Texas 2036, said Houston and other major cities have a lot riding on the passage of Prop 4.

""First, they need to expand and diversify their water supply portfolio for a dynamic, growing region,"" Mazur said. ""And second, there’s also this issue of aging, deteriorating, leaking water systems within the Houston metropolitan area that really need to be resolved sometime soon. These are systems that annoy everyday families and businesses through inadequate or leaking service, causing boil water notices or even service interruptions.""

Then there's Proposition 14, which would create a state institute for fighting dementia, formally the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT), similar to one Texas has already established to target cancer (CPRIT). The amendment would provide an initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue to a fund dedicated to finding medical breakthroughs, cures and prevention.

""It would be a breakthrough,"" said Ashley McPhail, chief external affairs and administration officer at the Texas Medical Center. ""It really would make a huge difference in sort of the path and trajectory that we are on for dementia and other related diseases within this space. If you look across funding, this would be sort of the second-largest funding for something like this, for brain health outside of the [National Institutes of Health] in the United States.""

McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself. It could lure hundreds of researchers to the state and spark the creation of dozens of companies dedicated to fighting Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, much as CPRIT has done already with cancer research. And that doesn't even touch the savings in residents' medical bills.

""Currently, over 400,000 Texans are living with Alzheimer’s, which costs families over $20 billion per year,"" McPhail said. ""Texas ranks third in the nation for the number of Alzheimer’s cases and second in the number of Alzheimer’s deaths. So, the need here in Texas is also very acute and specific from that side, and I would say it’s a $3.9 billion cost for Alzheimer’s to the Texas Medicaid program every year.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a18451b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6528x3427+0+925/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fc3%2F3a38110545b19739a953b1d4c7b2%2Felection-day-7-52486517839-o.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 22:00:22.623739

Any fossil fuel infrastructure built today will keep running for decades – at a time when fossil fuel use needs to taper off sharply to hold climate change under 2°C.","The price of partnership with the United States has changed. Washington is now using assurances of defence and trade access to pressure allies in Europe and Asia to buy more of its fossil fuels under decades-long contracts.

The scale is immense. The European Union intends to import up to A$1.15 trillion of US energy – mostly liquefied natural gas (LNG) – by 2028. That would be more than four times its current imports, though analysts are sceptical it will eventuate.

Indonesia has signed up for $24 billion in US energy imports and Japan is exploring a similar option.

These deals aren’t based on free trade. They represent the Trump administration’s geopolitical play using trade and security carrots and sticks to lock in long-term fossil fuel profitability and dominance. The goal: prop up energy sources facing cost pressures from clean technology, strengthen US control of the energy flows, and shut out China, the world’s top manufacturer of clean tech.

As Prime Minister Anthony Albanese meets US President Donald Trump this week, he will face pressure to boost US fortunes – complicated by the fact that Australia is itself a major LNG exporter.

(Buy) America First

For decades, the US has relied on energy imports as its own oil production slowed. But the fracking boom changed everything. By 2019, the US had gone from importer to net exporter. In 2023, it became the top LNG exporter, passing Qatar and Australia.

The Trump administration’s efforts to force its allies to buy more and more fossil fuels draws on a straightforward “America First” logic. Here are three reasons for the push:

1. Preserving business

The US now produces 22% of the world’s oil and 25% of its gas – well ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. But fossil fuels are projected to begin declining by 2030. The Trump administration wants to convert a risky commodity market facing long-term decline into a stable, decades-long “subscription model”. New gas plants or import terminals will only be viable if intended for long-term use.

2. Maintaining dominance

US dominance has long rested on control of global energy flows, both by protecting shipping lanes and by providing the currency to settle oil trades. Decentralised renewables and clean technologies such as batteries and electric vehicles weakens that grip. By tying allies to US gas, Washington wants to keep its ability to use energy as leverage.

3. Kneecapping China

China controls more than 70% of the world’s global solar, wind and battery manufacturing, positioning itself as the emerging energy superpower. Under Trump, the US has switched from competing on clean tech to defending fossil fuels, rejecting the transition and cancelling major domestic renewable projects. By forcing allies to buy gas, Washington seeks to delay the green shift and block China from gaining influence over energy. A related strategy is to vilify China over human rights abuses in its green supply chain.

Gas lock-in will cost US allies dearly

The consequences will be profound.

These unfair deals will make US allies less competitive. The main use for LNG is to burn it to produce electricity. But for almost a decade, solar and and wind have been the cheapest way to produce power, consistently outcompeting all fossil fuels.

As the cost of grid-scale batteries plummets, renewables are becoming even more competitive as daytime solar can be stored for the evening peak. Gas-dependent economies will face higher and more volatile energy costs, undermining competitiveness.

Worse, these deals threaten national security. That’s because relying on external suppliers for fuels reduces energy sovereignty. For instance, nations such as Nepal are embracing EVs to cut reliance on unreliable fossil fuel suppliers.

But the most critical issue is climate. Any fossil fuel infrastructure built today will keep running for decades – at a time when fossil fuel use needs to taper off sharply to hold climate change under 2°C. The billions spent on new LNG facilities are billions that can’t be spent on clean tech.

Australia embodies the contradiction, as a competing LNG exporter and one of the nations expected to be worst hit by climate change. The annual cost of climate-related disasters is projected to rise almost tenfold from $4.5 billion to $41 billion by 2050 – roughly the value of current gas exports. If Australia aligns with the US pro-gas agenda, it will mean favouring short-term profits for a few over national economic stability and climate security.

Which con job?

Trump last month declared climate change a “con job” in a speech at the United Nations. But this was a strategic distraction.

The real issue is his administration’s pressure on partners to sacrifice their long-term economic future and climate goals for the benefit of US fossil fuel interests.

It’s not inevitable. Asian economies and Australia can respond by accelerating their own green transitions, thereby securing cheaper power, greater energy independence and a long-term economic advantage.

Australia and Indonesia have large lithium and nickel resources, while China, Korea, Vietnam and others have the industrial might. This could anchor a regional supply chain for batteries, EVs and renewables.

Australia’s huge solar and wind potential can power large-scale green hydrogen and ammonia production useful in making low-carbon iron and steel. Cross-border electricity trade would further strengthen the system.

Linking Asia’s regional grids would smooth intermittency, lower power costs and boost mutual energy security. Early steps such as Laos ramping up hydropower exports to Vietnam point to how integration can work.

America’s goals are not the world’s goals

The current US administration wants to protect fossil fuel profits, slow the clean energy transition and curb China’s influence — whatever the cost to allies or the climate.

City, state and federal officials, including New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell and U.S. Congressman Bill Keating, said local organizations will receive funding for high-priority environmental projects.

The money and assistance stem from the Southeast New England Program (SNEP), which is funded by Congress and managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). SNEP aims to restore clean water, protect ecosystems and promote sustainability across Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts.

A total of $1.3 million will be divided among eight Massachusetts organizations for “large-scale environmental restoration projects” through SNEP Watershed Implementation

One of the grants will provide $50,000 to the city of New Bedford for the restoration of a historic salt marsh at Riverside Park.

“Riverside Park is an important recreational asset in the Near North End and the lynchpin of the

Riverwalk, which is being designed now. This project will improve the park’s ecological health

and expand recreational opportunities,” Mitchell said. “I want to thank our federal

delegation for their continued support of initiatives like this.”

More than $53,000 will go toward adapting to sea level rise at Mason Street Conservation Area in Rehoboth and $105,000 will support the Cole River dam removal concept design in Swansea.

Jeff Landry this week signed an Executive Order declaring a moratorium on review of new permit applications for Class VI underground injection wells in the state and directing prioritized review of several pending applications seeking to construct Class VI wells in connection with proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities across the state to proceed.

The order directs the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) to suspend review of any new applications to construct a Class VI well submitted after its effective date and to spend the next 45 days reevaluating the status of the approximately 33 pending permit applications already received. The order prioritizes review of five specified applications for CCS projects in Point Coupee, Vernon, Calcasieu, Cameron, Caldwell and Ascension parishes.

Class VI wells are one of the core components of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) facilities, which capture and liquefy carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial sources such as power generation and manufacturing plants for reuse or disposal. The construction of a Class VI well allows CCS facilities to permanently remove their captured CO2emissions from the atmosphere by injecting the liquid CO2into underground geological formations. The resulting reduction in emissions can then be used or sold in carbon markets worldwide to offset emissions increases associated with expanding industrial activities under federal and foreign air permitting regimes.

Louisiana, one of the first states to be granted authority to regulate its own Class VI injection wells by the Environmental Protection Agency in late 2023, is a particularly attractive option for proposed CCS hubs due to its close proximity to manufacturing and energy corridors across the Southeast and its favorable subsurface geology, which features deep saline aquifers and porous rock reservoirs offering ample pore space.

Gov. Landry’s order notes that some projections have found that announced CCS projects alone have the potential to generate 17,000 new jobs and $76 billion dollars in capital investments across the state. However, many of these projects have not yet submitted applications to construct the Class VI injection wells necessary for CO2storage. The order could pause the development of these and any new CCS projects in Louisiana indefinitely.

CCS projects in the state have faced increasing scrutiny from parish governments and local community groups, and the order acknowledges the concerns of “citizens and communities” while citing recent state legislation requiring the LDENR to give “substantial consideration” to local governments’ comments on permit applications and other CCS-related actions. The order also points to President Donald Trump’s support of “energy innovation by advancing technologies” such as CCS and several national executive orders regarding energy, which it finds “necessitate constant evaluation of Louisiana’s own energy policies and laws.” Although CCS technology may “provide an opportunity to lift citizens of Louisiana out of poverty,” the order says this must be balanced against the State’s “vital obligation to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens and the environment.”

Keep in mind, the order does not provide for an automatic end to the new review moratorium after the LDENR’s 45-day review period for pending applications ends. It remains unclear when consideration of new Class VI permit application may resume. In the meantime, the order and related LDENR memoranda make it clear that even pending permits will not be prioritized for review until they have been determined to be complete and compliant with regulatory procedures.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16379_2152.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 19:04:18.844015

Boulet announced Monday continued progress on Lafayette Consolidated Government’s (LCG) Johnston Street and Louisiana Avenue Revitalization Initiative, following the selection of four engineering firms to lead design and engineering along the corridor.

The multi-phase project represents one of the Boulet administration’s top infrastructure priorities—a comprehensive plan to modernize one of Lafayette’s busiest and most economically important corridors.

Since taking office in early 2024, Mayor-President Boulet has worked to move this long-discussed project from concept to action, building on years of study and public conversation. With engineering teams now on board, the project is entering its next phase—improving drainage and utilities, developing designs, and engaging the community throughout the process, according to Boulet's Office.

“Johnston Street has been a cornerstone of Lafayette’s history, and it’s time to revitalize it as we continue to grow and mature,” said Mayor-President Monique B. Boulet. “As our city evolves, we have an opportunity to breathe new life into this area. This project is about more than updating a roadway—it’s about reinstilling pride in our community and creating a corridor that reflects who we are and where we’re going.”

Reimagining a Vital Corridor

Stretching through the heart of Lafayette, Johnston Street and Louisiana Avenue connect key destinations including Downtown Lafayette, the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, and Moncus Park. Despite its importance, the corridor has faced persistent challenges with traffic congestion, outdated utilities, limited pedestrian and bicycle access, and in many areas, no modern drainage at all, according to LCG.

The Revitalization Initiative aims to change that—modernizing infrastructure, expanding drainage capacity, improving mobility, and creating a more attractive, functional corridor that supports long-term investment.

Key Features

Comprehensive drainage improvements, introducing modern stormwater infrastructure where none currently exists

Upgraded utilities, including undergrounding telecommunications and replacing aging poles to reduce visual clutter

Safer, more efficient intersections and traffic flow

Improved connectivity with sidewalks, bike lanes, and multi-use paths

Placemaking through native landscaping and design improvements

Building Momentum

This progress follows more than a year of groundwork to position the project for success. In May 2025, the Lafayette City Council approved City Ordinance #CO-037-2025, transferring ownership of U.S. 167 (Johnston Street) from the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) to LCG—a major step that put the corridor’s future under local control.

A public drainage meeting in September helped shape early design priorities for Downtown, Midtown, and Freetown areas where stormwater systems are lacking. And on October 10, LCG’s Professional Services Review Committee recommended four engineering firms to guide the 8.5-mile redesign, beginning with the Evangeline Thruway to Doucet Road segment.

Nearly $28.5 million from local, state, and federal sources is already available to support design and early improvements, with additional funding expected through grants, state approvals, and future allocations in LCG’s Capital Improvement Program Budget.

What’s Next

The selected firms will work collaboratively to advance design and engineering, addressing transportation, drainage, land use, and environmental sustainability. Public input will continue to play a key role throughout the process, ensuring that residents and businesses help shape the corridor’s future.

We favor a coherent, forward looking national energy policy. One that limits our dependence on foreign resources for reasons of national security, encourages economical use of affordable energy, and helps build a financially strong energy industry that can compete in world markets. Let’s concentrate on these adjectives: “coherent,” “forward looking”and “financially strong” because they go together. Investors want a consistent and forward looking policy. They do not want to tie up money in assets that are uncompetitive or subject to contract revisions at the whim of the government. So, let’s consider four news items that say a lot about current energy policy.

1. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) launched possibly the biggest coal sale in decades, a lease on a Montana property containing 167 million tons of coal. In October, the BLM rejected the one bid it received, $187,000 from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co., which had a mine adjacent to the property. We didn’t misplace any zeroes. It works out to 1.1 cents per ton. (The previous accepted bid was $1.10 back in 2012.) The BLM rejected the bid, as it did for two other Western coal auctions. Bids didn't reflect “market value.” The government blamed the low bid on “the lingering impact”of the Obama-Biden “war on coal.” (As an aside, the volume of coal used for electric generation grew 0.6% per annum in the George W. Bush years, declined 5.5% per year in the Obama era, declined 9.5% per year in the first Trump administration and 3.5% per year in Biden’s ) The last coal fired plant went into service over a decade ago in Texas, and no new ones have been ordered. The main question nowadays is more like, “When will coal plant owners retire their units?” rather than “When will they build new ones?” Coal simply can no longer compete with other energy sources like natural gas. Did the BLM really expect enthusiastic bidding for the property? Do they really believe in the war on coal? If publicly solicited bids don’t represent market value, what does?

2. The administration halted work on the Revolution offshore wind project in September on “security” grounds. The project, being built by Danish company Oersted, is about 80% complete. (The administration halted another project on the grounds that the paperwork was “deficient”.) Oersted went to court, stayed the order, and will complete Revolution, after which who knows what will happen (maybe swap Greenland for Revolution?). There is more at stake than the project, though, because offshore wind requires service vessels, manufacturing facilities and shipyards which are industrial activities that would further the administration’s desire to revive the U.S. maritime industry. Was there a strategic purpose in closing down a project that will produce much needed energy that overrides the damage done to our reputation as a safe place to invest?

3. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal government agency that is the nation’s largest power company, in September announced it would buy electricity from 6 GW of small modular reactors (SMRs) built by NuScale, with the press release emphasizing that TVA will not take any construction risk. Southern Company said the same thing when they started building Plant Vogtle and Westinghouse went bankrupt as a result. ( Do the parties taking the risk have the resources to bear it?) We should note that the few SMRs built to date have come in wildly over budget, including NuScale’s previous effort. In short, we doubt that the SMRs will produce power at a cost less than conventional or renewable resources, but the deal does provide a test ground for a new type of reactor which might provide needed power if electricity demand rises as expected. And the builders get a form of government support that does not require explicit approval of Congress.

4. The price of oil in October dropped to $62 (Brent) and $58 (WTI). Trump’s energy policy is emphasizing the supply side: open up to leasing, drill baby, drill, but more supply without more demand means lower prices, and prices have dropped to a level that may preclude profitable drilling, in part due to weak demand and in part because our friends in the Middle East have kept up their production in order to protect market share. The administration cannot boost demand for oil or gas any more than it can boost demand for steam coal but could it exercise some muscle to persuade our friends in the Middle East to let up (“Listen MBS you want our fighter planes, then stop selling cheap oil”) but that would raise gasoline prices and push up inflation, so forget that idea.

Peter Drucker, the legendary management consultant, advised firms to direct their resources to their winning lines of business rather than to shoring up the losers. The energy business, we would argue, is in the midst of a wave of creative destruction, as new energy technologies supplant old ones. Trump’s energy policy seems to be a combination of determined opposition to new ideas and ineffective support for the old. We asked a Washington insider to explain what theme dominates the administration’s energy policy. He was puzzled, then said, “Possibly a visceral hatred of renewable energy except for geothermal.” Is that the basis for an investable energy policy?

Germany’s government subsidises electricity transmission grid costs with 6.5 billion euros next year, which could reduce the fees by an average of 16 percent for household consumers. Grid fees are a key component of the electricity price in Germany.

For a three-person household with an annual electricity consumption of 4,000 kilowatt hours (kWh), this would result in an average saving of 82 euros next year, Verivox said. Potential savings depend on the region, with the biggest reductions expected in the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (average grid fee reduction of 23%), and the lowest in the state of Bremen (8%).

“Between 2020 and 2025, electricity grid fees for households in Germany rose by around 47 percent. The current reduction is therefore a positive development for private households,” said Verivox’s energy expert Thorsten Storck.

Meanwhile, gas grid fees are set to rise by an average of around 11 percent from next year, according to Verivox. A household with a gas consumption of 20,000 kWh per year can expect to pay around 61 euros more as a result. However, the abolition of Germany's gas storage levy could offset the average increase in gas costs for households, Verivox added. The gas storage levy, which is meant to help finance the filling of the country's storage facilities and is currently paid by consumers with their gas bills, is set to be abolished from the start of 2026.

The Chevy Equinox EV has become the best selling non-Tesla EV in the United States.
The Equinox EV starts at $33,600, while the gasoline Equinox starts at $28,700.
But there are the matters of production volumes and how much auto dealers will push or even have available the Equinox EV.
Overall, in net, what can we expect from the 6 best selling electric vehicles in the US in coming quarters?","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

So, we’re here. The US tax credit for electric vehicles is gone. Objectively, many electric vehicle models still compete very well with the gas-powered competition. However, the stimulus of a tax credit means fewer people will be told “hey, you should consider an EV — you can get a tax credit from it,” something that people with personal or business accountants were often told. And, of course, EVs do now cost more than they did a month ago. But there are also some positive things.

As I wrote previously, the surge in EV purchases that resulted from the tax credit getting killed raised overall awareness about EVs, increased the number of happy EV owners who will rave about their cars to family and friends, and could lead to a lot more word-of-mouth sales. Or not. Who knows?

Naturally, this is a topic I keep wondering about. What happens in the US electric vehicle market now? What will the next several quarters look like? Of course, a large portion of EV sales — the vast majority — are from just a handful of top selling models. So, to consider the overall question, I figured it made some sense to explore the question with these models. I picked out the 6 models that had more than 20,000 sales in the last quarter.

Tesla Model Y: Unfortunately for the Tesla Model Y, this electric crossover has been fighting a decline in sales for the past couple of years. More and more entrants in its class, the sales effect of Elon Musk’s political activities, and the model simply getting older and older have typically meant year-over-year sales declines from the peaks the Model Y reached when it was the top selling vehicle model in the world. For example, in the US, sales of the Model Y went from 96,729 in Q1 2024 to 64,051 in Q1 2025, and went from 101,301 in Q2 2024 to 86,120 in Q2 2025. The Model Y was recently upgraded with a new look, better tech, and an overall refresh that was supposed to make it seem like a new model again. Though, that was at the beginning of the year, so the boost in sales from the refresh has likely worn off by now.

On the positive side, there’s a new cheaper trim of the model. It is actually more expensive than the (better) base model was before the tax credits were eliminated, but on the surface — looking at the upfront price — it looks like a lower entry point for shoppers. Like I said above, other electric crossovers have come onto the scene in recent years and taken some of the Model Y’s sales, but perhaps these other models will be pushed less as legacy automakers step off the electric pedal (after all, fuel economy standards have also been all but eliminated by the Trump administration), making it easier for Tesla to find more customers again?

All things considered, I’m having a hard time seeing Tesla’s trends reversing. Even as the overall US EV market was up significantly, Tesla sales were down, so I do expect the Model Y could continue drifting downward in the next few quarters. Could it get down to just 50,000 sales a quarter? Even lower? The last time it was down in that territory was in the 3rd quarter of 2021 when about 49,900 units were sold in the USA.

Tesla Model 3: The Model 3 is facing many of the same issues as the Model Y, except it’s even older than the Model 3, its refresh happened last year, and most people who used to buy sedans now buy crossovers. On the other hand, there isn’t a lot of competition in the sedan market in the US. In the past year, the Model 3 has gotten around 50,000–60,000 sales a quarter. Can it sustain that? I’m skeptical. If it can’t, are we talking about a drop down to around 30,000, like its Q1 2024 total, or could it go down to 20,000–25,000 sales a quarter, like in the first half of 2021?

Chevrolet Equinox EV: This is an interesting one. The Chevy Equinox EV has become the best selling non-Tesla EV in the United States. It reached 25,085 sales in Q3 2025, well above its previous record from Q4 2024 of 18,089 sales and Q2 2025’s 17,420 sales. Of course, it was boosted by the expiring tax credits, but it has only been on the market since Q2 2024, it quickly got to a pretty decent volume and awareness of the EV has surely risen a great deal, and it competes quite well with its gas-powered twin!

The Equinox EV starts at $33,600, while the gasoline Equinox starts at $28,700. And the Equinox EV stands out with a larger infotainment screen (17.7 inches versus 11.3 inches) and a sharper, more futuristic or modern frontend. Throw in the convenience and cost savings from home charging as well as the nicer driving experience, and it’s easy to see why even many mainstream buyers would choose the Equinox EV over the sort of boring and stale gas-powered Equinox. You have to move up to the $33,600 RS or Activ trim just to get some design tweaks and a bit more character, which happens to be right where that higher tech Equinox EV starts.

But there are the matters of production volumes and how much auto dealers will push or even have available the Equinox EV. I tend to think, though, that the model has reached high enough sales levels that many in the old-school auto world will be compelled to keep moving units. As with all of these models, there are a lot of factors and it’s anyone’s guess. My thought is that after a moderate dip in sales for two quarters, the Equinox EV could come surging back and actually have a strong 2026. Although … there is another wildcard that just hit me. The Equinox EV is no longer the cheapest EV on the market. Chevrolet itself just revived the Bolt at a much lower price, and the new Nissan LEAF is also a few thousand dollars cheaper. So, someone looking for the lowest priced new EV now has other options that are significantly cheaper. Hmm … the Equinox EV could be in for an interesting ride.

Honda Prologue: The Honda Prologue is definitely an interesting one. It is basically a GM vehicle underneath, but it gets a lot of sales from people who just swear by Honda, trust Honda, and think it’s 100% a Honda. The company has a very loyal customer base, and it seems that there are many people who held off on buying an EV until Honda had one out — and now they are happily driving around in Prologues. You see them routinely, and Honda sold 22,236 of them in the 3rd quarter. That said, this was a huge increase from its usual quarterly numbers — 9,561 in the 1st quarter and 6,756 in the 2nd quarter, or even 18,838 in the 4th quarter of 2024.

My concern/hunch is that Honda will struggle to reach 20,000 sales a quarter again with the Prologue. Also, here’s the kicker: the Prologue starts at $47,400, and there are a handful of electric alternatives in this size that seem like a much better deal. That said, for the Honda loyal, the midsize Prologue competes well against the midsize Passport ($44,750) and midsize Pilot ($40,200), and Honda buyers do typically appreciate fuel efficiency — which the Prologue wins in hands down. So, maybe with 20,000+ more of these out on the road, many more mainstream Honda buyers will notice, get intrigued, and go electric. This may be the hardest model of all from this list to conjecture about.

Hyundai IONIQ 5: The IONIQ 5 absolutely stormed the shores in the 3rd quarter, nearly doubling its sales. It went from 10,481 sales in the 2nd quarter to 21,999 sales in the 3rd quarter, well above its previous record of 14,082 sales in the 4th quarter of 2024 (when people first thought the EV tax credit might be killed). Now, the IONIQ 5 stands out, as Hyundai is currently offering and promoting up to $11,000 in retail bonus cash or $0 APR for up to 72 months. The company took the end of the tax credit to mind and went a huge leap forward in offering this financial incentive. So, one would think the IONIQ 5’s sales will continue booming in the 4th quarter. However, these incentives are supposed to end in November, so who knows how far they will go? And what comes after that?

The IONIQ 5 is so unique looking that you can also see buyers gravitating to it naturally just from seeing it on the road, not necessarily because it’s electric. And when you get in the vehicle, it feels a little bit like an “Apple car.” Will that combined with all the extra units out on the road and also combined with all of the natural benefits of electric cars help to move a lot of medal quarter after quarter? Who knows? I’m leaning toward optimistic on the IONIQ 5. I think/hope Hyundai will follow up the $11,000 retail bonus cash with other incentives or a big price cut, and I think the visual appeal, tech, and happy owner chatter of the IONIQ 5 will keep pulling in buyers, especially in EV-happy California where many buyers are now looking for an alternative to Tesla.

Ford Mustang Mach-E: Last but not least, we have the Ford Mustang Mach-E. Similar to the Hyundai IONIQ 5, the Mustang Mach-E nearly doubled its sales in the 3rd quarter, going from 10,178 the quarter before to 20,177. Also like the IONIQ 5, one of the Mustang Mach-E’s big selling points is its unique, attractive design. As Mustangs always have, the Mustang Mach-E stands out on the road, is extra cool and sporty looking, and is just going to win some base number of sales on its smile. It’s also surprisingly cheap — starting at just $37,995. Okay, not cheap, but well below the average new car price and a good territory for a midsize SUV with flair. I’m hopeful that the Mustang Mach-E can return to 20,000 quarterly sales within a year. If Ford gets a little more aggressive on pricing or comes out with some updates — external and/or internal — perhaps it could even stimulate another sales surge.

Overall, in net, what can we expect from the 6 best selling electric vehicles in the US in coming quarters? It’s hard to guess, but … I’m cautiously optimistic. These are strong contenders in the market even against top gas-powered vehicles. There’s also the possibility that they could get more cost competitive in coming months and quarters as trends in the market evolve.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tesla-Model-3-Highland-new.jpeg,N,,2025-10-20 19:22:38.774034

Congress and the public must demand the restoration of OSEP’s capacity.
The right to a free appropriate public education is not discretionary; it is the law of the land.","The recent layoffs at the U.S. Department of Education have done more than eliminate jobs — they have stripped away the very machinery that enforces one of America’s most important civil rights laws: the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), which Congress established to ensure states comply with IDEA (20 U.S.C. § 1416), is being hollowed out. The loss of staff responsible for monitoring, investigation, and technical assistance means that federal oversight — the safeguard that ensures students with disabilities receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE) — is vanishing.

Under IDEA, every child with a disability is entitled to FAPE in the least restrictive environment (34 C.F.R. § 300.101 and § 300.114). Those are not suggestions; they are binding federal mandates. The U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed this in Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District (2017), holding that schools must offer programs “reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child’s circumstances.” That standard is enforceable only if OSEP has the personnel and authority to ensure compliance.

These rights were not granted lightly. They were won through decades of advocacy and precedent. In PARC v. Pennsylvania (1971) and Mills v. Board of Education (1972), federal courts held that children with disabilities cannot be excluded from public education — decisions grounded in Brown v. Board of Education’s guarantee that separate or unequal schooling violates equal protection. Congress codified those principles when it enacted what became IDEA, expressly finding that “disability is a natural part of the human experience” and that “improving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity” (20 U.S.C. § 1400 (c)(1)).

By dismantling OSEP, the administration is not simply downsizing a bureaucracy; it is undermining civil rights enforcement. Without active federal monitoring, states and districts may quietly erode their obligations under IDEA. The law will remain on paper but lose its power in practice — and children with disabilities will be left without meaningful recourse.

Congress and the public must demand the restoration of OSEP’s capacity. The right to a free appropriate public education is not discretionary; it is the law of the land. We owe it to every child — and to the Constitution’s promise of equal protection — to ensure it is fully enforced.

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources.
The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials.
“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months.
That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent’s rich rare-earth resources when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.

The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.

“In about a year from now we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won’t know what to do with them,” said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. “They’ll be worth $2.”

Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship “to the next level.”

Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.

“Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we’re seeing from the Chinese,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump’s meeting with Albanese.

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.

A push for more mines

The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years — if not decades — to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce their dominance.

Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.

For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.

“Taking away that arrow of China’s to be able to manipulate pricing is a crucial first step for Australia and the West to be able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our demands,” said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China’s influence.

“China is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. “They are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.”

The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.

“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

But Althaus cautioned that Australia can’t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.

“Keep in mind, China has almost a 40-year head start on us,” Althaus said. “We have at least a couple of decades to catch up to China in terms of being able to meet our own supply chain processes.”

Albanese’s visit comes just before Trump is planning to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.

The security partnership

Another topic of discussion was AUKUS, a security pact with Australia, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that was signed during U.S. President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration.

Trump noted Monday that AUKUS was established “a while ago” but that the agreement now is “moving along very rapidly, very well.” Albanese said that “our defense and security partnership with AUKUS is so important for us.”

John Phelan, the Navy secretary, said that the U.S. wants to take the original AUKUS framework and improve it for the three signatory countries while clarifying “some of the ambiguity” in it.

“So it should be a win-win for everybody,” Phelan said.

The center-left Albanese was reelected in May and suggested shortly after his win that his party increased its majority by not modeling itself on Trumpism.

“Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,” Albanese told supporters during his victory speech.

The conversion costs around Rs 5 lakh for two-wheeler stations and Rs 8 lakh for car stations, he added.","Bengaluru: Riding on the success of the electric two- and three-wheeler revolution, Karnataka is now accelerating efforts to electrify heavy vehicles, particularly buses and trucks. The govt is preparing to submit a detailed proposal under the Centre's PM E-Drive scheme to establish 1,500 high-capacity EV charging stations across the state, each supporting fast charging in the 60kW to 240kW range — sufficient to power heavy vehicles for long-distance operations. The move marks the next phase in Karnataka's electric mobility expansion as it looks beyond lighter vehicles to include e-buses and e-trucks in its electrification drive. With over 6,000 public charging stations already operational, Karnataka leads the country in EV charging infrastructure. As part of the new plan, the energy department will identify strategic locations — such as bus depots, national and state highways, freight corridors, and logistics hubs — to set up these high-capacity charging facilities. According to officials, the financial burden on the state will be minimal, thanks to the central subsidy component, which ranges from 80% to 100% for various parts of the project. The initiative aligns with the objectives of the PM E-Drive scheme launched in Oct 2024, aimed at accelerating EV adoption, strengthening charging networks, and promoting local manufacturing of EV components. Karnataka's proposal dovetails the scheme's goals, and the state has already sought central support for deploying a fleet of e-buses under the same initiative. N Shivashankara, managing director of Bescom, told TOI a formal proposal would be submitted to the Union ministry of heavy industries shortly. Bescom has been designated as the nodal agency for implementing EV charging infrastructure across the state. ""The scheme provides 100% subsidy for upstream components such as transmission lines, transformers, and conductors, while other equipment will receive up to 70% subsidy,"" he explained. As of Aug 2025, India had around 29,000 EV charging stations, of which Karnataka accounted for 6,097 — the highest in the country. Earlier this year, the state held discussions with the Union minister for heavy industries and steel, HD Kumaraswamy, seeking enhanced central assistance and allocation of 4,500 e-buses for Karnataka's transport corporations under the PM E-Drive scheme. While electric cars typically require chargers of 60-120 kW capacity, heavy-duty vehicles such as buses and trucks need 240kW chargers. Bescom has also partnered with major oil companies such as IOCL, HPCL, and BPCL to install about 400 EV charging points at their petrol stations across the state. Slow to fast chargers In a significant development, Karnataka is also upgrading its existing slow-charging infrastructure to fast-charging systems to accelerate EV adoption. ""Slow chargers typically take 3-4 hours to fully charge a vehicle, whereas fast chargers can do it within 30-45 minutes. To reduce waiting time and improve convenience, we've begun converting slow-charging booths into fast-charging stations,"" Shivashankara said. Of the 209 slow-charging stations in Bescom's jurisdiction, 184 have already been upgraded. The conversion costs around Rs 5 lakh for two-wheeler stations and Rs 8 lakh for car stations, he added.

“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months.
That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a critical-minerals deal at the White House on Monday as the U.S. eyes the continent’s rich rare-earth resources when China is imposing tougher rules on exporting its own critical minerals abroad.

The two leaders described the agreement as an $8.5 billion deal between the allies. Trump said it had been negotiated over several months.

“In about a year from now we’ll have so much critical mineral and rare earth that you won’t know what to do with them,” said Trump, a Republican, boasting about the deal. “They’ll be worth $2.”

Albanese added that the agreement takes the U.S.-Australia relationship “to the next level.”

Earlier this month, Beijing announced that it will require foreign companies to get approval from the Chinese government to export magnets containing even trace amounts of rare-earth materials that originated from China or were produced with Chinese technology. The Trump administration says this gives China broad power over the global economy by controlling the tech supply chain.

“Australia is really, really going to be helpful in the effort to take the global economy and make it less risky, less exposed to the kind of rare earth extortion that we’re seeing from the Chinese,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters Monday morning ahead of Trump’s meeting with Albanese.

Hassett noted that Australia has one of the best mining economies in the world, while praising its refiners and its abundance of rare earth resources. Among the Australian officials accompanying Albanese are ministers overseeing resources and industry and science, and Australia has dozens of critical minerals sought by the U.S. because they are needed in everything from fighter jets and electric vehicles to laptops and phones.

A push for more mines

The agreement could have an immediate impact on rare earth supplies in the United States if American companies can secure some of what Australian mines are already producing, although it will take years — if not decades — to develop enough of a supply of rare earths outside of China to reduce their dominance.

Pini Althaus, who founded USA Rare Earth back in 2019 and is now working to develop new mines in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as CEO of Cove Capital, said it will be crucial that the contracts to buy materials from Australian mines include price floors, similar to what the U.S. government promised MP Materials this summer, to protect against China manipulating prices.

For decades, China has used the tactic of dumping excess critical minerals onto the market to drive prices down to force mining companies in the rest of the world out of business to eliminate any competition.

“Taking away that arrow of China’s to be able to manipulate pricing is a crucial first step for Australia and the West to be able to develop critical minerals projects to meet our demands,” said Althaus, who has spent nearly a quarter-century in the mining business.

The agreement underscores how the U.S. is using its global allies to counter China, especially as it weaponizes its traditional dominance in rare earth materials. Top Trump officials have used the tactics from Beijing as a rallying cry for the U.S. and its allies to work together to try to minimize China’s influence.

“China is a command-and-control economy, and we and our allies will neither be commanded nor controlled,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week. “They are a state economy and we are not going to let a group of bureaucrats in Beijing try to manage the global supply chains.”

The level of investment outlined in the agreement shows how serious the two nations are about addressing the problem.

“The U.S. and Australia will invest over $3 billion in joint critical minerals projects within six months. That’s a somewhat unprecedented speed of capital injection,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

But Althaus cautioned that Australia can’t supply everything the United States needs, so it is crucial that American continues to invest in the long-term effort to develop other mining and processing projects both at home and in friendly nations. He said central Asia might be one of the most promising places to invest because the region has significant rare earth reserves, and the Soviet Union already did some of the initial development work when it controlled that territory. That could cut years off the time it will take to build a new mine there.

“Keep in mind, China has almost a 40-year head start on us,” Althaus said. “We have at least a couple of decades to catch up to China in terms of being able to meet our own supply chain processes.”

Albanese’s visit comes just before Trump is planning to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month.

The security partnership

Another topic of discussion was AUKUS, a security pact with Australia, the U.S. and the United Kingdom that was signed during U.S. President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration.

Trump noted Monday that AUKUS was established “a while ago” but that the agreement now is “moving along very rapidly, very well.” Albanese said that “our defense and security partnership with AUKUS is so important for us.”

John Phelan, the Navy secretary, said that the U.S. wants to take the original AUKUS framework and improve it for the three signatory countries while clarifying “some of the ambiguity” in it.

“So it should be a win-win for everybody,” Phelan said.

The center-left Albanese was reelected in May and suggested shortly after his win that his party increased its majority by not modeling itself on Trumpism.

“Australians have chosen to face global challenges the Australian way, looking after each other while building for the future,” Albanese told supporters during his victory speech.

Of three California bills Sonoma Clean Power had been backing in the recently ended session to speed GeoZone projects, only one became law.
Gavin Newsom signed AB 531, which allows geothermal projects of all sizes to be permitted through the California Energy Commission, rather than the current 50-megawatt threshold.
Last year, that amounted to nearly 1.9 gigawatts, which was 70% utility-scale geothermal power and 4% of total statewide electricity generation.
California Energy Commission last year called for doubling the geothermal output by 2035, reaching at least 3 gigawatts by 2030.","Sonoma County has been awarded state money to study where envisioned next-generation power plants could go in the North Coast’s sprawling Geysers geothermal field with the least impacts and potentially the fastest project timelines.

The $1.36 million commitment, unveiled Sept. 29, was one of three totaling $4.56 million from the California Energy Commission’s Geothermal Grant and Loan Program. The funds are expected to be awarded in January, according to John Mack, who manages Permit Sonoma’s Natural Resources Division.

“We’re going to proactively look at the landscape across Lake, Mendocino and Sonoma counties for the best areas for geothermal with the least cultural and environmental impacts and best siting,” Mack said.

The grant period is three years. The plan includes working with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop a cutting-edge three-dimensional model of what’s underground, map what’s above ground via LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data, figure out what sites might be the most compatible with geothermal development, visit the sites to confirm results, conduct community-engagement meetings and work with tribes on monitoring high-potential geothermal sites.

“Hopefully, that will give us a lot of information for projects going forward,” Mack said. That information is set to guide future updates to the county’s zoning and general plan.

The signing of Assembly Bill 1359 last year allows geothermal project applicants to opt for county handling of review, replacing a previous law that required a county to have an approved geothermal general plan element to do so. The California Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM) is still developing regulations for that new law.

Grant partners are Mendocino County and Sonoma Clean Power, which is working with Mendocino and Sonoma counties on the Geysers-focused geothermal opportunity zone, or GeoZone. Chevron New Energies, Eavor Technologies and Ormat Technologies have floated low-water-use, closed-loop ideas for GeoZone projects, but there haven’t been related applications for exploratory or use permits in recent years, Mack said.

The Geysers field includes Lake County, but it’s not participating in the grant, Mack said. Sonoma Clean Power has been making a pitch to Lake County, Clearlake and Lakeport officials about joining the GeoZone effort along with being supplied by the alternative provider of electricity. Clearlake City Council voted to not join at this time, partly because the majority wanted more time to understand the geothermal effort and opt-out process. Lake County Board of Supervisors and Lakeport City Council are set to vote Oct. 21.

Mack told the Journal in March that this grant would be part of Sonoma County’s more forward-thinking approach to geothermal in recent years, recognizing the need for 24/7 renewable energy to meet climate goals.

Of three California bills Sonoma Clean Power had been backing in the recently ended session to speed GeoZone projects, only one became law. AB 526, which would have created a statewide geothermal strategy, like the one for wind power, died in committee. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 531, which allows geothermal projects of all sizes to be permitted through the California Energy Commission, rather than the current 50-megawatt threshold. However, Newsom vetoed AB 527, writing that would have delayed AB 1359 regulations in progress and added fees for exploration projects.

“Following enactment of AB 1359, the federal government created a categorical exemption for NEPA for geothermal exploration,” Sonoma Clean Power CEO Geof Syphers wrote in an email, referring to the federal environmental protection law. “This made geothermal exploration far easier on federal lands and specifically geothermal prospects in states like Nevada and Utah. AB 527 sought to offer a similar streamlined approach to projects in California to make the state competitive for developers considering where to site projects. With AB 527’s veto, the GeoZone and the rest of California will have to work harder to attract investment.”

California produces the most electricity from geothermal in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Last year, that amounted to nearly 1.9 gigawatts, which was 70% utility-scale geothermal power and 4% of total statewide electricity generation.

California Energy Commission last year called for doubling the geothermal output by 2035, reaching at least 3 gigawatts by 2030. The GeoZone concepts call for adding 600 megawatts to the 725 megawatts currently produced from The Geysers. Calpine, the largest producer at that field, has been bringing online a new 25 megawatt plant, starting with 7 megawatts this summer.

“The extreme weather events that crippled Texas in recent years made it clear this investment was overdue,” said Texas State Representative Ana Hernandez, who serves on the Texas Backup Power Package Advisory Committee.
“We felt that it would be interesting to include water outages for that reason.
To boost energy resilience, Texas lawmakers approved $1.8 billion in 2025 for the Texas Backup Power Package.
“Now there’s funding available to help with these backup power sources, like the Texas Backup Power Package.","A growing body of research warns that climate disasters are disproportionately dangerous for older adults, especially those in long-term care settings who rely on others for essential support. Those risks are often compounded in rural areas, where resources are scarce and emergency support is slower to arrive.

As temperatures plummeted and power went out across Texas during the February 2021 Winter Storm Uri, a record-breaking winter storm that brought unprecedented cold and ice, staff at Gainesville Nursing and Rehabilitation, a nursing home in the rural North Texas town of Gainesville, made a desperate call: evacuate all 36 residents. The nursing home had lost both power and water and the facility’s backup systems had failed.

Fire-rescue crews scrambled to borrow school buses to move everyone to a temporary shelter at a nearby college. “We had two buses, and it probably took us four hours to move those 36 residents,” Gainesville Fire-Rescue Chief Twiner told the Gainesville Daily Register in 2021. “We had to take some of their beds—there were beds at [the shelter], but it wasn’t enough.”

Research indicates that extreme weather disproportionately affects rural areas, which also have limited capacity to respond to weather events and the prolonged utility outages that often follow.

A 2025 report from the Federation of American Scientists found that rural communities faced heightened risks from extreme heat, with residents more likely to have pre-existing health conditions, limited healthcare access, and older or substandard housing. In rural areas, heat waves disrupted work, strained local businesses, and exposed weaknesses in aging energy infrastructure, revealing a pressing need for targeted investments in health systems and resilient energy.

A 2025 study published in Natural Hazards Review further found that rural communities hit by natural disasters faced significantly longer power outage recovery times than urban areas, highlighting how limited infrastructure and resources can leave rural populations disproportionately vulnerable.

Power Outages Can Lead to Death

New research is beginning to explain the toll that Winter Storm Uri had on older populations in rural areas. The chaos in Gainesville was just one of hundreds of stories that unfolded across Texas in February 2021. Now, a 2025 study has confirmed the human toll of the severe weather event on these communities. Long-term nursing home residents whose facilities lost power or water during the storm faced significantly higher death rates than those in facilities that remained operational.

The peer-reviewed study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), found that utility failures were the driving factor behind the rise in mortality.

“We can estimate that [the outages] would contribute to about 11 or 12 excess deaths, had those nursing homes not experienced a utility outage,” said Brian Downer, PhD, associate professor in the School of Public and Population Health(SPPH) at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and one of the article’s authors. “To better contextualize those 11 excess deaths, the state of Texas was able to attribute about 150 deaths among adults aged 60 and older…to Winter Storm Uri.”

A 2022 study in Nature found that rural communities faced greater challenges during Winter Storm Uri. Limited resources and slower emergency support made outages harder to manage. Residents in these areas were also less prepared for prolonged power loss, highlighting vulnerabilities in infrastructure and disaster response.

“It is the rural communities that are being disproportionately affected by the power outages,” Downer said about the Nature study.

New Texas Legislation Helps Essential Services Adapt to Severe Weather

In response to such risks, the Texas Legislature authorized $1.8 billion this year for the Texas Backup Power Package, an initiative aimed at strengthening energy resilience through backup power systems and microgrids in critical facilities, including those in rural areas. The program, funded through the broaderTexas Energy Fund, was designed to ensure that essential services like nursing homes, hospitals, and water systems are better equipped to remain operational during future grid emergencies.

“The extreme weather events that crippled Texas in recent years made it clear this investment was overdue,” said Texas State Representative Ana Hernandez, who serves on the Texas Backup Power Package Advisory Committee. “These backup systems allow vital facilities to keep operating even if the main grid goes down.”

The Texas Backup Power Package was passed in 2023, but didn’t receive funding until the 2025 legislative session. It will provide grants and loans for generators, battery storage, and solar systems.

State Representative Hernandez said the program rules will be drafted later this year and applications are expected online by spring 2026, with installations starting that summer. Final eligibility is still being decided, but critical facilities will be prioritized.

“By providing multi-day, stand-alone backup systems, the program ensures that vital services don’t go dark when the grid fails. Health centers, senior living facilities, emergency responders, and other critical operations will be able to stay open and serve the public,” Hernandez said. “In short, it helps communities hold steady in the face of long outages and strengthens overall resilience.”

Outages Deepened Health Risks for Older Adults

During Winter Storm Uri, Texas experienced historically low temperatures and sweeping power failures as the state’s electric grid struggled to meet surging demand.

According to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, 578 of the state’s 1,212 nursing homes, nearly half, reported at least one incident during the storm, including 139 that lost power, 327 that had to boil water, and 121 that suffered burst pipes, water shortages, or complete water loss.

An estimated 39,000 residents, about half of all nursing home residents in the state, lived in facilities that reported such incidents, according to data compiled by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

For residents, those outages were more than an inconvenience. They intensified existing health risks and exposed the particular dangers that extreme temperatures pose to older adults.

Andrea Earl, associate state director of advocacy and outreach at AARP Texas, said older adults in care facilities faced heightened risks during extreme temperatures because their bodies struggle to regulate heat and cold. Many residents also have mobility issues, chronic health conditions, or cognitive impairments that limit self-care. Medication, medical equipment needs, and social isolation further increased vulnerability to extreme temperatures, according to Earl. But some nursing facilities lacked staff expertise to recognize early signs of heat or cold stress, making reliable utilities critical for protecting residents’ health.

Some of the effects of extreme weather and utility outages are not immediately detectable.

“In extreme cold, your blood starts to thicken, especially if you’re older, and that increases the risk of blood clots and other cardiovascular incidents. And I think the hard part about both is these things don’t come on right away,” Earl said.

In the JAMA study, researchers captured these longer term effects by reviewing outcomes over the course of the weeks following the storm.

“We really need to start paying attention to these more delayed effects that are coming up,” said Alex Holland, a doctoral student in population health sciences at UTMB and a co-author of the JAMA article. “In our study, we didn’t really see that difference in mortality until three weeks after winter storm Uri, so there’s somewhat of a delayed effect.”

New Backup Systems Target Future Outages

The Texas Backup Power Package aims to strengthen the state’s energy infrastructure by installing generators, microgrids, and batteries at critical facilities across the state that could run independently when there are grid failures.

Winter Storm Uri caused economic losses upwards of $80 billion. The state’s power grid faced an unprecedented surge in electricity demand and critical parts of the system failed.

To prevent a total collapse that could have taken weeks or even months to recover from, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which manages most of Texas’s electric grid, implemented emergency blackouts.

Some of the water shortages were directly tied to ERCOT emergency directives, which required utilities to reduce power consumption to stabilize the electric grid.

In Medina County, a rural area west of San Antonio, water was unavailable during Winter Storm Uri, even for essential needs like drinking, bathing, and flushing toilets. Nursing homes in the county were among those affected, facing dangerous conditions as power and water systems failed.

As part of their research, Downer and Holland spoke with nurse practitioners at UTMB who conduct home visits to nursing homes in the area. They said the access to water can be critical to mitigate health risks and manage hygiene.

“[The nurse practitioners] were really emphasizing how both physical and oral hygiene can be really important, not only to just general quality of life and a person’s comfort, but also, too, from an infection risk, especially when it comes to oral health,” Downer said. “We felt that it would be interesting to include water outages for that reason. And then also, too, since power and water outages tend to occur together.”

Those health risks are amplified in rural areas, where limited infrastructure and slower emergency response make outages harder to manage.

Although this utility collapse was widely attributed to frozen power plants, a University of Texas study highlighted the need for better energy efficiency measures to reduce strain on the grid and protect vulnerable populations during extreme weather events.

“There’s a whole host of reasons why extreme weather events can result in lower supply,” said Joshua Rhodes, PhD, a research scientist at the University of Texas and one of the report’s authors. “[During Winter Storm Uri,] we saw [that] every single kind of power plant didn’t perform as well as we would have liked it to perform. We saw power plants freeze, be they coal, natural gas or nuclear, wind. We saw snow on top of solar panels. But we also saw the natural gas sector freeze…we lost the ability to produce about 80% of the natural gas in the Permian Basin, and so we weren’t able to move as much natural gas. We also had a bunch of power plants that just couldn’t get fuel.”

Winter Storm Uri brought the state’s energy sector to a standstill and future extreme weather threatens to do the same.

“Texas is seeing more disasters as more people live in areas where we have hurricanes, and as, just generally, more people are around, and we rely on more things for electricity,” Rhodes said.

To boost energy resilience, Texas lawmakers approved $1.8 billion in 2025 for the Texas Backup Power Package.

“We’re recognizing that there are thousands of facilities across the state, many in rural areas, but some also in urban areas, that provide vital community services, like water treatment facilities, fresh water facilities, assisted living centers and other medical facilities…,” said Texas Senator Nathan Johnson, who led legislation to create and fund the Texas Backup Power Package. “So in order to make that more affordable, what we wanted to do is just put some state money behind it.”

“Modern life runs on electricity,” Rhodes said. “I think it’s good that we’re at least keeping the critical parts of that life, of that livelihood, up and running whenever we run into issues.”

An Uncertain Pathway Forward

Researchers and advocates said that while the Texas Backup Power Package has potential to serve long-term care residents, it is not a guaranteed fix.

During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers failed to pass SB 481, which would have required nursing and assisted living facilities in Texas to maintain safe temperatures during emergencies with backup power systems. Without such state regulations, Earl expressed concern that many facilities may be unaware of the Texas Backup Power Package program or lack the capacity to apply for it.

“A lot of these places are understaffed…so any extra administrative processes might be a hindrance to why they would apply,” Earl said. “We’re hopeful that facilities out there are paying attention to [the backup power package], but I think that’s another thing too. How well is this fund going to be marketed? Are we going to see these facilities know firsthand that they can apply for this? How are they going to find out about it?”

Holland said that the successful implementation of backup power also depends on training and education for effective emergency preparedness.

“Now there’s funding available to help with these backup power sources, like the Texas Backup Power Package. But then the question becomes like, well, then what? These facilities might not know, what is the best power supply backup for us? Where should we put them?” Holland said. “We see sometimes that generators end up getting put on the floor and ground level in areas that are prone to flooding or nursing home staff aren’t trained on how to use this emergency backup equipment.”

Without proper guidance and preparation, the funding alone cannot guarantee that facilities will be ready when disaster strikes.

“Disaster preparedness is for everybody,” Holland said. “I think especially that’s something that lends itself very strongly to rural communities [where] you kind of have that ‘everybody knows everybody’ feel. And so taking that into the disaster preparedness side of things, and knowing how your city or your county is preparing for some of these events, or, what are the resources in place, kind of at that local level, also definitely come into mind.”

Earl emphasized that emergency preparedness shouldn’t wait for tragedy.

“We don’t think death should be the underlying reason for, or the catalyst for, doing backup power and requiring a certain level of power in these facilities,” Earl said. “We think that there’s a lot of dignity with this stage of life and where you’re at and that that should be preserved, especially if you are paying to be in a facility and putting your hard earned dollars and assuming and expecting a certain level of care.”

The documents were published in response to a temporary restraining order issued by a judge that temporarily bars the Trump administration from issuing and/or enforcing layoff notices — called Reductions in Force, or RIFs — to unionized employees during the ongoing federal shutdown.

The cuts would include 770 jobs at the Office of the Secretary, 474 jobs at the Bureau of Land Management, 330 jobs at the U.S. Geological Survey, 142 jobs at the Fish and Wildlife Service, and 270 jobs at the National Park Service.

In response, Athan Manuel, director of Sierra Club’s Lands Protection Program, released the following statement:

“The American people will ultimately pay the price for these planned layoffs at Interior. Gutting the staff who protect our public lands and wildlife is not fiscal responsibility, it’s sabotage. From national parks to wildlife refuges, staff at agencies like the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service protect and preserve our shared natural heritage.

What’s even more frustrating for Sloop and other U.S. soybean farmers is that Brazil is rapidly expanding its land devoted to soybean production, while U.S. soybean acreage is declining.
Investigating Brazil On July 15, the U.S. Trade Representative initiated an investigation against Brazil that includes illegal deforestation.
Hall said an added challenge for North Carolina soybean farmers is the lack of crush plants to create soybean meal for livestock.
Nobody has built a new crush plant in the Southeast for 15 years and for North Carolina, 50 years.","For Rowan County, N.C. farmer Philip Sloop, the most frustrating part of the ongoing trade war between the United States and China and the growing competition from Brazil is the fact that U.S. farmers are known to produce better quality soybeans than Brazilian farmers.

“We are held to a lot higher standard than Brazil,” said Sloop, the president of North Carolina Soybean Producers Association. Sloop produces corn and soybeans near Mount Ulla, 40 miles north of Charlotte.

What’s even more frustrating for Sloop and other U.S. soybean farmers is that Brazil is rapidly expanding its land devoted to soybean production, while U.S. soybean acreage is declining. The fact that Brazil is cutting down the Amazon Rainforest to boost its crop and livestock production bothers Sloop.

“That is clearly something we would never do in the United States. Our farmland is decreasing, not increasing. This is clearly an unfair trade practice by Brazil,” Sloop said.

Investigating Brazil

On July 15, the U.S. Trade Representative initiated an investigation against Brazil that includes illegal deforestation. The trade representative’s complaint cites Brazil’s lack enforcement of its environmental laws and regulations that have contributed to illegal deforestation for crop and livestock production.

The topic was front and center at the NC Chamber’s Ag Allies Conference Sept. 30 at the NC State University McKimmon Center in Raleigh, where Deputy Agriculture Secretary Stephen Vaden said unfair competition from Brazil presents a long-term threat to U.S. soybean farmers.

“Obviously, that is not a production practice that we have here in the United States. We are producing more with less land because we are losing farmland every year, and we are asked to compete against a country that is literally destroying one of our world’s great ecological treasures to up its agricultural footprint. That’s unfair. That is quite frankly immoral,” Vaden told the conference of North Carolina agribusiness leaders.

Solutions needed

In a press conference following his remarks, Vaden noted that even if China begins immediately purchasing U.S. soybeans, it won’t remove Brazil’s production from the world market. He said solutions across the board are needed to address the dire economic situation of low commodity prices and high production costs.

Vaden said both greater trade access for U.S. corn and soybeans and increased domestic use through biofuels are needed in addition to dealing with unfair competitors like Brazil. “We in the United States are obviously not going to be burning down forestland in order to expand our agricultural footprint.”

According to the U.S. Trade Representative complaint, agricultural production, particularly for soy plantations and cattle ranches, has been one of the main drivers of deforestation in Brazil. The complaint said deforestation reached a 15-year high in 2021.

The complaint notes that deforestation has declined in recent years, but deforestation rates were estimated at 3,403 hectares (8.409 acres) per day in 2024. The complaint said evidence indicates that 91% of the deforestation could be illegal.

For Sloop, the trade war is frustrating. Building markets and moving supply is the only way to push up commodity prices. He acknowledged the basis and the pork and poultry sectors in North Carolina were the only reason corn and soybeans can be competitively grown across the Carolinas. “We can’t get the yields they get in the Midwest.”

North Carolina is still a grain-deficit state. Charles Hall, CEO of the North Carolina Soybean Producers Association, estimates that about half of the soybeans used by North Carolina’s livestock sector are provided by local farmers, with the rest coming from the Midwest.

“We are not directly dependent very much on the China channel. Our biggest customers are right here in our backyard. This creates local demand, and the supply chain is very short,” Hall said.

Cautious optimism

Sloop said he is “praying for the best and planning for the worst” in the current environment of low commodity prices and high production costs. Targeted management is the only way to succeed.

“We’re only spending money on what’s necessary. We’ve been fortunate that we’ve had decent rain for the most part. We have an average crop of corn and soybeans. We used less expensive weed control this year and cut back on our seed costs. We’re already using variable rate technology on everything,” he said.

Sloop said the goal is to aim for profit, not big yields.

“Pushing yields doesn’t help anybody if we can’t use the beans. We have to diversify when it comes to exporting our soybeans. If the beans aren’t going to be used domestically, they have to be diversified where they go. We can’t put all of our eggs in that China basket anymore. Any time a trade war pops up, it seems soybeans are the first thing to suffer,” Sloop said.

Hall said the first U.S. trade war with China in 2018 incentivized Brazil to ramp up its soybean production to meet Chinese demand.

“When we got into that trade dispute with China, it incentivized Brazil to put more virgin land into soybean production. Brazil produces 40% of the world’s soybeans. The unintended consequence of our trade dispute with China and the dispute right now is that it encourages Brazil to do even more of that expansion. We can’t make new farmland in the United States. We are losing farmland in the United States,” he said.

Hall said an added challenge for North Carolina soybean farmers is the lack of crush plants to create soybean meal for livestock. “There are not many crush plants in the East. Nobody has built a new crush plant in the Southeast for 15 years and for North Carolina, 50 years. No one is going to build a new crush plant here. The Midwest has plenty of crush capacity.”

This spring, Archer-Daniels Midland shuttered its Kershaw, S.C. soybean processing plant citing cost cutting and consolidation. In 2014, Cargill closed its soybean crush plant in Raleigh citing decreased demand and variable and seasonally driven processing needs. Currently, the only two crush plants are the Cargill facility in Fayetteville and the East Carolina Oilseed Processing Plant in Pantego.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt157c4e6072fa225b/68f29ac30d67655311835eb5/IMG_1380_web.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-20 17:19:09.345457

The REA and GEAA have signed Heads of Terms for the acquisition, under which GEAA’s membership and expertise will be integrated into the REA. The move reflects growing confidence in geothermal as a clean, reliable source of heat and power.

Trevor Hutchings, Chief Executive of the REA, said: “This move establishes a powerful new platform to help unlock the UK’s exciting geothermal potential. Whether that’s for clean sources of heat for homes and businesses, or new low carbon power generation – geothermal has an important and currently under-valued role to play.

“I am determined that by the REA and GEAA coming together in this way we can ensure that geothermal energy plays a key role in the UK’s journey to greater energy security, energy sovereignty, local jobs and lower emissions.”

Karl Farrow, Founder and Chief Executive of CeraPhi Energy and Chair of GEAA, reflected on the organisation’s journey: “We started GEAA over a kitchen table in the midst of Covid nearly 5 years ago. We now need a bigger table and evolving GEAA into the geothermal arm of the REA as the Geothermal Energy Forum is a natural next step for GEAA and its members.”

Industry leaders welcomed the move as a sign of sectoral maturity.

That word comes from GM president Mark Reuss, who joined an InsideEVs podcast to discuss the Bolt and other electrification questions in an episode that aired last Friday. Reuss says that ""a family of things that [are] low-priced"" is on the way after the Bolt, expanding on a previous mention of a ""family of Bolts"" stated at an investor event a year ago.

One telltale sign that you are reading or listening to something that is not giving you the full story will be the language used.
If the language is expansive and nuanced, there's a better chance that what you are reading or listening to will have some value.","In George Orwell's novel, 1984, a totalitarian regime now rules the homeland and operates by three slogans: 1) War is peace, 2) freedom is slavery and 3) ignorance is strength. In 1984, the term ""Newspeak"" refers to what is essentially a mandatory style guide for using the English language under that regime by substituting Newspeak formulations for common words and phrases so as to make public discourse conform to the ruling party's orthodoxy. (For a list of Newspeak words and phrases, check here.)

Not surprisingly, failure to conform to this style in written and oral communications is considered a crime. In fact, to think thoughts contrary to those expressed in Newspeak terms is considered a ""thoughtcrime"" because it implies one's personal values are not in harmony with official party dogma. Even having a facial expression that appears to imply disagreement with that dogma is a ""facecrime.""

Every modern regime tries to regulate the language used by its citizens (or subjects, as the case may be). As I have written previously, ""If you want to corrupt a people, corrupt the language."" So, it's not particularly surprising that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), now controlled by an oil industry insider, has put out its own Newspeak-like manual in the form of an email to department employees, which is focused on subtracting words and phrases according to Politico. In the email, the DOE is doing to the vocabulary of its personnel what the Trump administration is doing to the government, namely, cutting it.

The latest announcement appears to apply to those working for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and adds to a list that was started some time ago. The list of ""words to avoid"" now includes the following:

clean or dirty energy

carbon/CO2 footprint

climate change

decarbonization

emissions

energy transition

green

sustainability/sustainable

tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies

Of course, this off-limits list seems ludicrous since all of these topics have been widely discussed in publications that fill library shelves and online repositories of scholarly work, journalism, and policy papers. How could this directive actually enforce the kind of rigorous elimination of ideas and words, á la 1984, which are ""misaligned with the Administration’s perspectives and priorities"" as the email puts it? Of course, it cannot.

However, DOE employees will henceforth not be allowed to use such words, and that will have definite effects on policy discussions for the simple reason that none of the ideas associated with those words will be contemplated in those discussions.

As social psychologist Eric Fromm explains in an afterword to the edition of 1984 that I have, the goal is not simply to force people to say the opposite of what they think. Fromm writes: ""[I]n a successful manipulation of the mind the person is no longer saying the opposite of what he thinks, but he thinks the opposite of what it true.""

There is a lot of that going around these days thanks to social media. People often only have discourse with those with whom they agree and agree to facts which they cannot personally verify and which may be the opposite of what they are told. If this were merely a benign process—say, revolving around the best way to make a Bundt cake—we'd have little to worry about. But it involves the very essence of how we will govern ourselves and how we will face a future of increasingly dangerous climate change and resource depletion.

In 1984 the main character, Winston, works for the Ministry of Truth where he helps to rewrite history to conform to the ideological views of the single political party that controls his country. Since the party changes its ideas and policies not infrequently, there are many people like Winston at the ministry rewriting history on a daily basis.

I am reminded of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. In 1953 following the arrest and execution of Lavrentiy Beria, former head of the interior ministry and secret police, the publishers sent out three pages to owners of the encyclopedia on the topics of the Bering Sea and Bishop Berkeley (an Irish philosopher and clergyman), and asked owners to cut out the three pages which covered the life of Beria and replace them with these new pages.

As the DOE tries to turn the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy into a mini ministry of truth, we should remember that forces representing the full spectrum of ideological beliefs are constantly putting out versions of history and versions of the present to advance their goals. Some may be accurate, some may merely be selective—no one can write a history of everything or cover the entire span of current events—and some may be flat-out lies.

One telltale sign that you are reading or listening to something that is not giving you the full story will be the language used. If the vocabulary is limited, repetitive, and/or sounds like sloganeering, you would do well to be skeptical of the writer or speaker. If the language is expansive and nuanced, there's a better chance that what you are reading or listening to will have some value.

Miliband hinted the 5% VAT charge on bills could be removed in next month’s budget, which would cost the government £2.5bn.
Many of us have been pointing out for ages that clean energy is not a free lunch (certainly not by 2030), but the experts’ numbers were revealing in their precision.
Equally, though, Miliband’s claim that the “sprint” to clean energy by 2030 will – of itself – cut £300 from household bills now seems fanciful.
Last week’s warning from suppliers on bills ought to mark a turning point: the clean energy plan needs an injection of cold-headed pragmatism.","“I know my job is to get bills down by £300,” said Ed Miliband, the energy security secretary, in his BBC interview at the weekend, acknowledging that the government is on the hook for its pre-election promise to reduce energy bills by 2030.

The problem, though, is that the bill-cutting task also seems to be falling by default to Rachel Reeves, the chancellor. It is beginning to look as if the only sure way to make energy bills fall by £300 by 2030 is to shuffle a chunk of the expense into general taxation. Miliband hinted the 5% VAT charge on bills could be removed in next month’s budget, which would cost the government £2.5bn.

To put it mildly, Reeves is unlikely to be delighted by this prospect but she, like everyone else, will have heard the high-powered crew of retail energy bosses set out the arithmetic on bills in stark terms to a Commons select committee last week.

Many of us have been pointing out for ages that clean energy is not a free lunch (certainly not by 2030), but the experts’ numbers were revealing in their precision. “If we continue on the path we are on, in all likelihood electricity prices are going to be 20% higher even if wholesale prices halve,” said Rachel Fletcher of Octopus Energy. “Non-commodity costs are adding about £300 [a year] of pressure,” she added, referring to everything from the costs of maintaining and upgrading the gas and electricity transmission networks to funding the rollout of renewable and nuclear generating capacity. Chris Norbury, the chief executive of E.On UK, and Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF UK’s energy business, said much the same.

Far from being “speculation” – as Miliband’s department dismissed it – the bosses’ analysis flows from granular details. One can see, for example, the subsidies for wind and solar capacity under construction or likely to be commissioned; the multiyear charge for the Sizewell C nuclear power station; and the rates of return that the regulator Ofgem will allow the three big electricity transmission companies to earn as they build the £80bn new grid.

Note that the criticisms are not coming from opponents of the ambition of switching to cleaner energy, or from net zero sceptics. All that is really being asked is an examination of tradeoffs, sequencing, who should pay and what options exist for doing things more cheaply. “There is no budgetary control of this,” Fletcher said. Rossi noted that electricity demand is 9% lower today than in 2019. Norbury said policymakers should look at the extent to which “incentives being offered to build infrastructure are necessary”.

Miliband can argue, as he did in a speech last week, that his job is harder because of “the legacy of decades of underinvestment in energy in this country”. Absolutely true. The grid is old, as are most of the nuclear and gas-fired plants. Even if the UK were not decarbonising and electrifying, there would be a large catchup bill. New gas stations, the Tories’ preferred short-term option, aren’t free either.

Equally, though, Miliband’s claim that the “sprint” to clean energy by 2030 will – of itself – cut £300 from household bills now seems fanciful. Sir Dieter Helm, a leading energy economist, put it bluntly in a recent Bloomberg podcast: “We have hit the reality wall. It isn’t going to be £300 cheaper – unless the gas price falls very sharply … The problem for the government, I think, is that half the government understands that and half the government doesn’t.”

What should be done? Step one would be to recognise that the 2030 deadline for clean power, defined as 95% low-carbon generation, was always arbitrary and that trying to hit it almost certainly adds expense because speed is being prioritised over cost. Would the UK’s long-term decarbonisation and electrification strategy really be imperilled if, say, only 80% was achieved by 2032? Hardly.

Once that mental hurdle is cleared, options open up. One of the energy suppliers’ complaints, in essence, is that grid capacity is being commissioned to arrive before it is needed (and customers will have to pay for it) and that smarter energy-using solutions may be more effective. They may have a point. So concentrate above all else on minimising “constraint” costs, the maddening payments to windfarms (usually in Scotland) to turn off when it’s too windy, plus incentives to other generators (usually gas-fired plants in the south of England) to fire up on the other side of a bottleneck. Such payments are still projected to hit £4bn by the end of decade, and threaten to become an electoral liability in 2029.

Or slow the rollout of renewables, especially offshore wind, where the big cost variable is developers’ borrowing costs. If there is a reasonable expectation that interest rates will be lower in future (not impossible), why not wait for cheaper “strike” prices in future auction rounds? As things stand today, the government has said it will pay up to £113 a megawatt hour for offshore wind capacity in this year’s auction, AR7, far above the gas-dictated wholesale price of £83 MWh over the past 12 months.

“We won’t buy at any price and if specific technologies aren’t competitive, we will look elsewhere,” Miliband also said last week about AR7. If he means it, he could show seriousness by ordering, say, only 4 gigawatts of offshore wind this year, rather than 8-plus the industry is expecting.

In Reeves’s shoes, you’d be insisting on such cost-cutting thinking. Last week’s warning from suppliers on bills ought to mark a turning point: the clean energy plan needs an injection of cold-headed pragmatism.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0d0eb209b6e7ebb5dabbdbf0decca0239075a9/370_0_4552_3642/master/4552.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7db236aeec39cf404bf3ee58a2723d7a",N,,2025-10-20 16:19:32.159569

Factors limiting US natural gas exports to Mexico include constraints in Mexico's pipeline infrastructure, including new pipeline construction and permitting delays, and limited natural gas storage capacity in the country.
In 2024, pipeline exports from West and South Texas collectively accounted for 91% of US natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico.
Natural gas from the Permian basin in West Texas primarily serves northwestern, central, and southwestern Mexico through various natural gas systems in Mexico, EIA said.

The record comes as Mexico’s demand for natural gas, particularly in the electric power sector, increases, EIA said.

US natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico, on an annual basis, averaged 6.4 bcfd in 2024, a 25% increase compared with 2019, and the highest on record in data going back as early as 1975, EIA said.

During the same timeframe, total natural gas consumption in Mexico increased to 8.6 bcfd from 7.7 bcfd, with most growth concentrated in Mexico’s electric power sector.

Natural gas exports from the US enter Mexico along four main corridors—South Texas, West Texas, Arizona, and California—with a combined capacity of about 14.8 bcfd and an approximate utilization rate of 43% in 2024.

Factors limiting US natural gas exports to Mexico include constraints in Mexico's pipeline infrastructure, including new pipeline construction and permitting delays, and limited natural gas storage capacity in the country.

In 2024, pipeline exports from West and South Texas collectively accounted for 91% of US natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico. The South Texas corridor connects from the Agua Dulce Hub into northeastern Mexico. Natural gas from the Permian basin in West Texas primarily serves northwestern, central, and southwestern Mexico through various natural gas systems in Mexico, EIA said.

Exports from West Texas increased to 1.8 bcfd in 2024 from 0.6 bcfd in 2019, facilitated by the commissioning of additional connecting pipelines in central and southwestern Mexico in recent years.

The country is continuing plans to expand its domestic pipeline network to meet potential demand growth. Natural gas imported from the South Texas corridor through the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline has access to LNG terminals, power plants, and other uses of demand, and the pipeline connects with the Gasoducto Puerta al Sureste (Southeast Gateway Gas pipeline), an offshore pipeline completed in 2025 and designed to supply natural gas to new power plants in the Yucatan Peninsula.

In 2022, sections of the Tula–Villa de Reyes and Tuxpan–Tula pipelines began partial operation, with full service anticipated this year. The Energia Mayakan pipeline is expected to expand natural gas infrastructure on the Yucatán Peninsula by 2025. Developers of the Centauro del Norte pipeline, which will provide additional pipeline capacity to northwestern Mexico's combined-cycle power plants, began construction in 2025.

LNG was first exported from Mexico in August 2024 from the Fast LNG Altamira Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) 1. Two additional LNG export projects, Fast LNG Altamira FLNG 2 and Energía Costa Azul, are currently under construction with a combined capacity of 0.6 bcfd, drawing supply from US natural gas imports, EIA noted.

This gas plant, which will be located across the street from Woodland Elementary School in Person County, will expose Duke customers to significant rate increases and expensive fossil gas costs for decades and drive significant pollution, including greenhouse emissions. That the approval of this plant was issued the day after the Commission concluded a two-day Large Load Technical Conference in which several experts provided data demonstrating that Duke’s projected load forecast likely overestimates the amount of large customer load that will come online in the coming years is especially disappointing.

During the hearing on July 22, SACE witness Lucy Metz of Synapse presented testimony that highlighted significant concerns with this proposed gas plant. Witness Metz testified that “DEP has not demonstrated that the Proposed Facility is lower cost than a portfolio of dispatchable capacity (e.g. battery storage or even combustion turbines) paired with solar and wind.” She recommended that the Commission deny Duke’s request or, at a minimum, require Duke to issue an all-source request for proposals prior to ruling on the request to determine if there are indeed resources available to provide both the capacity and the energy needed to serve future load growth. Even the Public Staff testified that the second CC may not be the least cost solution.

In the order approving the plant, the Commission notes that modeling in Duke’s 2023 CPIRP establishes a “need” for the second CC. But this modeling from almost two years ago does not reflect the current rising costs associated with power plant construction and firm gas transportation contracts. The estimated cost of this plant at the time of filing is confidential, but Duke Energy has proposed building a similar gas plant in Indiana that is only 100 MW larger at a cost of $3.33 billion. What if the cost of Duke’s second Roxboro gas plant balloons to this amount? Would it still have been selected by the modeling in the 2023 CPIRP proceeding as the least-cost resource to meet the forecasted need? I think that’s highly unlikely.

And what about the associated pipeline costs that will be incurred to supply both Roxboro CCs at the Person County site 47 miles away from the nearest interstate gas transmission pipeline? This plant (along with the first CC approved last December) will require not-yet built pipeline capacity from an expansion project on the Williams Transco pipeline and/or a not-yet built Mountain Valley Pipeline expansion as well as redelivery along the not-yet built 55-mile Enbridge T15 pipeline. Duke has contracted for firm pipeline capacity on all three of these projects, but as with the cost of the plants, these pipeline contracts are confidential too. SACE has done a deep dive on escalating pipeline costs in the Southeast, and we have determined that these costs are becoming so significant that their net present value should be evaluated as part of the total cost of the plant. The North Carolina Public Staff and the Commission Staff can both get access to these confidential pipeline contracts as a part of the Commission’s review of Duke’s proposed gas plant, and they can calculate the net present value themselves to understand just how significant they are (potentially a quarter of the cost of the plant itself or higher). And unlike the cost of the plant, which will face additional scrutiny in an upcoming rate case, the cost of firm pipeline transportation is passed straight through to ratepayers. Duke has no skin in the game and no incentive to negotiate in the ratepayers’ interest on what is essentially a fixed asset (pipeline capacity) that could run the lifetime of the plant itself.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-20 17:04:45.511531

The “Rocky Mountain Gas Roadmap & Implementation Playbook,” developed under the Western States and Tribal Nations Energy (WSTN) Initiative, identifies key infrastructure pathways to connect responsibly produced natural gas from the Rockies to growing domestic and international markets. The roadmap was released during the New Mexico and Wyoming Advanced Energy Roundtable, where Governor Lujan Grisham, Governor Gordon, and Japanese Ambassador Shigeo Yamada discussed energy and technology partnerships.

The roadmap outlines two main routes—the Pacific Northwest Pathway and the Southwest Pathway—that leverage existing infrastructure and rights-of-way to efficiently move Rocky Mountain natural gas to expanding U.S. markets, while also offering the quickest and most affordable connections to Asian markets without relying on the Panama Canal.

“New Mexico is ready to lead the way in unlocking the Rocky Mountain’s potential to create jobs and opportunity, strengthen international collaboration, and write the next chapter in global energy,” said Governor Lujan Grisham. “Putting the Rockies’ abundant energy to work benefits red and blue states by fueling our economies and the transition to clean energy.”

“Both Wyoming and New Mexico have led the country in producing certified gas meeting UN standards, and Japan is particularly interested in that opportunity for cooperation and investment,” said Governor Mark Gordon. “We can provide natural gas resources very near-term—almost immediately—and this is just good business. It’s about moving into a future that meets climate concerns while making sure energy is there as demand continues to grow enormously.”

“This is a very informative and detailed introduction to the potential of Rocky Mountain natural gas, and it is very much appreciated by the Japanese,” said Japanese Ambassador Shigeo Yamada. “I hope today’s meeting will lead to further cooperation and economic partnership between Japan and the State of New Mexico.”

“This playbook is the culmination of years of work and is designed as a tool to help policymakers and commercial actors seize the major opportunities that Rockies gas present to domestic markets seeking lower-carbon gas and the Asian nations that will drive global demand in the coming decades,” said WSTN Chairman Jason Sandel. “We have the gas and the cleanest molecules of it. This playbook shows the way to the markets that need it.”

The roadmap builds on Lujan Grisham’s April trade mission to Asia, where she met with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to strengthen cooperation between Japan and the American West on energy and technology partnerships.

Rocky Mountain gas offers competitive advantages: cost-effective production with breakeven costs between $3.10 and $3.90 per MMBtu, low-carbon certified gas from producers who have achieved significant methane emissions reductions, and 277 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable reserves capable of serving both regional and international demand.

The two pathways: the Pacific Northwest Pathway serves power markets in Utah, Idaho, and the Pacific Northwest, and the Southwest Pathway expands supplies to the Desert Southwest and Mexico. The Southwest route reduces shipping times to Asia by approximately 50 percent compared to Gulf Coast routes through the Panama Canal. Both pathways target growing demand from data centers, manufacturing, and electrification.

Euralarm has published the recording of its recent webinar on fire safety for electric vehicles (EVs) in indoor parking and charging facilities.

The session aimed to clarify common misconceptions about EV fire risks and present practical approaches to fire protection in mixed-vehicle parking environments.

The European association said the webinar, hosted by its Extinguishing Section, provided factual comparisons between electric and combustion vehicle fire behaviour.

Speakers discussed the fire load of modern vehicles, thermal runaway in battery cells, and specific risks associated with charging infrastructure.

The event featured contributions from Kurt Hilen, Vice Chair of Euralarm’s Extinguishing Section, who helped develop the association’s guidance paper on EV fire safety in parking and charging facilities.

Myths and facts on EV fire risk

According to Euralarm, public perception often overstates the likelihood of EV fires compared with traditional vehicles.

The association presented data showing hybrid vehicles experience the highest fire frequency, while battery electric vehicles have a lower fire incident rate than combustion-engine vehicles.

Euralarm explained that total vehicle fire load depends largely on plastics and tyres rather than power source, with both electric and conventional vehicles presenting comparable fire loads.

Hilen said: “Battery electric vehicles do not catch fire more often than vehicles with internal combustion engines.”

He added that EV fires are extinguishable but require adapted methods due to battery design and positioning.

Fire safety challenges in parking environments

Euralarm highlighted that increasing vehicle size, plastic content and limited access in multi-storey or underground car parks complicate firefighting operations.

The association noted that confined ventilation and closely parked vehicles can accelerate fire spread and obstruct evacuation.

It described phenomena such as thermal runaway, toxic gas release and stranded energy as unique challenges that demand longer firefighting efforts and higher water volumes.

During charging, faulty installations, damaged cables or inadequate maintenance can act as ignition sources.

Euralarm said charging zones should therefore be prioritised for proactive fire protection and regular inspection.

Recommended protection measures and design priorities

The webinar outlined that the primary objectives in parking facility fire safety remain life protection, safe evacuation and structural stability.

A holistic strategy combining preventive, technical and organisational measures was presented.

These include correct installation and maintenance of charging systems, automatic fire detection, water-based suppression, emergency shut-offs and smoke extraction systems.

Hilen explained that automatic detection and suppression systems, when integrated, can prevent spread between vehicles and support firefighter access.

He said: “Each of these elements plays an important role, but only their integration provides truly effective fire protection.”

Focus areas for future implementation

Euralarm concluded that fire protection requirements for parking areas are evolving as vehicle technology advances.

The organisation advised that automatic fire detection should be considered a basic standard in every parking garage.

Resources, it said, should be prioritised for charging areas where vehicle density and electrical risk are greatest.

The full webinar recording and Euralarm’s guidance paper on fire safety for electric vehicles in parking and charging facilities are now available online.

Relevance for fire and safety professionals

This development is relevant for fire engineers, building designers, facility managers, fire protection contractors and regulatory authorities.

The findings address design and operational issues specific to mixed-vehicle parking environments, particularly in enclosed or multi-storey structures.

The guidance supports updated risk assessments, system integration and compliance planning for facilities incorporating EV charging infrastructure.

It also reinforces the need for regular maintenance and inspection of charging installations to prevent electrical faults.

For system specifiers and installers, the emphasis on early detection, water-based suppression and integrated safety controls provides actionable reference points for upgrading protection systems.

Other post-tax credit lease price changes

BMW has held steady with its EV lease prices. CarsDirect pointed out that the 2025 BMW i4 is now cheaper to lease than a 2026 Tesla Model 3 despite the former having an MSRP that’s $20,000 higher than the latter.

The 2024 Acura ZDX used to be one of the best EV lease deals around, but Acura discontinued lease offers on the EV more than a month ago. That’s likely because the company is dropping the model for the foreseeable future and it’s pretty much sold out.

Tesla’s most affordable EV, the 2026 Tesla Model 3 sedan, is up to 36% more expensive to lease than before. The new entry-level Standard Model 3 and Model Y trims can’t be leased.

VW leases lost up to $12,000 in discounts after the federal tax credits were killed off. CarsDirect found that 2025 VW ID.4 lease prices went from an effective cost of a little over $230 a month to an eye-watering $800 a month.

While Duke Energy customers will fund these new gas-burning power plants through increases on their monthly utility bills, the electricity generated will largely go to power-hungry large-load customers, like data centers, for multi-billion dollar tech companies.

Around 100 people spoke out in opposition to the project through online comments and two public hearings on the project. The NCUC did not require Duke to consider alternative options for power generation at the site, even though the state’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal remains the law.

Recent independent analysis concludes that North Carolina utility customers could pay an additional $23 billion by 2050 based on planned gas plants, just in fuel costs alone. Separate independent analysis concludes that the price of both new and used gas plants is quickly increasing due to a surge in demand and lack of supply, and these cost increases are outpacing inflation and likely to persist.

Earlier this month, Duke Energy released its updated long-range energy plan, which calls for burning coal longer at existing power plants and building even more new gas-burning power plants. Duke Energy is also slashing renewable energy investments, limiting potential cost-savings to customers by placing artificial caps on benefits. Last week, the NCUC heard from a variety of stakeholders about the merits of potential large load tariffs intended to protect existing customers from the multi-billion dollar costs of building new power plants, substations, transmission lines and other infrastructure to serve the needs of new data centers and other new customers who require significant electricity. What comes next is up to state utility regulators.

Statement from Steph Gans, Assistant Director at Clean Water for North Carolina:

“Local residents, expert witnesses, and even a county economic development leader identified this gas plant as being important for serving big industrial customers, like data centers. The area nearby already lives with contaminated ground water from Duke Energy’s coal ash and is still recovering from Tropical Storm Chantal. Why should regular customers pay for this?”

Statement from Olive Burress, North Carolina Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer with the Sierra Club:

“New power plants being built based on the needs of new data centers should not be subsidized via increased monthly utility bills for hard-working North Carolina families and businesses. It is absolutely critical that the NCUC supports strong safeguards for existing customers as new customers drastically increase demand for electricity.”

DALLAS – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 6 Administrator Scott Mason penned a Letter to the Editor in the Tangi Times outlining the agency’s cleanup efforts in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana following the Smitty’s Supply Inc. fire in August. For almost two months, over 450 EPA personnel and contractors worked around the clock to clean up the Tangipahoa River, nearby ponds, and Smitty’s Supply, including removing more than 11 million gallons of oily material. From day one, the Trump EPA worked in partnership with the community—who showed remarkable cooperation and resilience—in restoring their land, water, and way of life.

On October 15, 2025, EPA entered into a consent order with Smitty’s Supply Inc., requiring the company to take responsibility for cleanup and to pay certain response costs incurred by the United States. The agency issued a Pollution Removal Funding Authorization to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to continue cleanup of the Tangipahoa River and nearby ponds. EPA will continue to serve as a federal partner, continuing strict oversight as the cleanup progresses.

Read what Regional Administrator Scott Mason had to say:

“The fire at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in August disrupted life in Tangipahoa Parish. Families temporarily left their homes, Highway 51 closed to through traffic, and concerns arose about potential impacts to the Tangipahoa River—a treasured resource for your Sportsman’s Paradise. The weeks following the incident brought understandable questions and concerns for the community.

“Through it all, the people of Tangipahoa Parish have responded with remarkable cooperation and resilience, demonstrating the strength of Louisiana communities when they come together.

“From the moment the fire broke out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been your partner. Our emergency responders arrived immediately, working alongside local firefighters to extinguish the flames and stabilize the facility. As the scope of the environmental impact became clear, EPA transitioned to lead the cleanup efforts—and Tangipahoa Parish welcomed us with open arms. Neighbors like Nancy Clement and Miss Charlene opened their properties as staging areas for river operations. Parish President Miller and local officials coordinated tirelessly with our federal teams. This spirit of cooperation has been the foundation of every gallon recovered, and every mile of river restored.

“The progress has been substantial. Working around the clock with over 450 EPA personnel and contractors, we've recovered more than 11 million gallons of oily material—with over 7 million gallons already removed for disposal. Cleanup is complete for nearly 16 miles of the Tangipahoa River, representing over 30% of the impacted area. Daily recovery rates have more than doubled, from 85,000 to 175,000 gallons per day, thanks to new equipment including drum skimmers, rope skimmers, and marsh excavators. 22,400 feet of containment boom and nearly 5,000 bales of sorbent material line the waterways, capturing contamination before it can spread.

“Perhaps most importantly, when recent heavy rains tested our response systems, our stormwater controls worked.

“EPA is announcing a clear path forward that ensures accountability and continued progress. We have entered into a consent order with Smitty's Supply requiring the company to clean up the facility, properly dispose of contaminated materials, and prevent further releases. EPA will maintain close oversight of this work. At the same time, we are issuing a Pollution Removal Funding Authorization to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to continue cleanup of the Tangipahoa River and nearby ponds, with EPA remaining as the federal on-scene coordinator and funding support coming from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.

“This coordinated approach, with Smitty’s handling the facility, the state leading river and pond cleanup under our oversight, and Tangipahoa Parish serving as local coordinator, ensures the work continues efficiently while holding the responsible party accountable.

“EPA brings proven expertise to this challenge. Earlier this year, we completed the largest wildfire cleanup in our agency’s history after the Los Angeles fires, clearing over 13,000 properties of hazardous material in under 30 days. Following Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, EPA managed the safe recovery and recycling of 20,000 gallons of oil and contaminated fluids. That same determination and innovation is being applied right here in Roseland.

“The road ahead requires continued partnership. Our crews are managing the recent sheen reported near Lee’s Landing —waiting for conditions to improve after dangerous rainfall before resuming river operations in coordination with the Coast Guard. Ongoing water and sediment sampling will guide our next steps. Highway 51 must remain closed near the facility for everyone's safety as heavy equipment continues moving materials offsite, but we are working aggressively with the responsible party—Smitty’s Supply—and the parish on completing the cleanup work needed for the highway to reopen.

“Make no mistake, EPA is committed to remaining a partner throughout cleanup efforts. We will continue finding innovative ways to accelerate cleanup. We will continue our community office hours where we've already met with more than 2,200 residents. And we will continue protecting what makes Tangipahoa Parish special—your land, your water, and your way of life.

“This is more than a federal cleanup operation. It's a promise to restore what was damaged and a partnership that will endure long after the last gallon is recovered. The people of Tangipahoa Parish have been exceptional partners from day one. EPA will continue to be yours.”",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 16:19:53.714908

Applying Zero Trust to the Power Grid Implementing Zero Trust in a utility environment doesn’t mean replacing every router or rebuilding every subnet.","The North American grid powers nearly every aspect of life across the continent.

But this interconnectedness, and the reliance that businesses, governments, and households have upon it, also creates an attack surface that cyber actors can target for disruption or ransomware. This attack surface is becoming increasingly complex as the electric sector continues to modernize through digital transformation.

In response to the growing threats, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has recently approved NERC CIP-015-1, a new cybersecurity standard designed to mitigate risks associated with communications networks used in bulk electric system (BES) operations. This move recognizes that perimeter-based security models alone do not protect these critical systems from cyber threats. One solution utilities can adopt is a Zero Trust security architecture to secure their data and operations.

The Expanding Threat Landscape for Power Utilities

Power companies face a unique combination of technical and security challenges. Most notably, many operational technology systems are decades old and don’t have modern security controls. These legacy devices often lack native authentication or encryption features and were never intended to be exposed to the internet or enterprise IT networks. However, digital transformation, cloud environments, and smart grid technologies have increased the pathways into these systems.

Compounding the problem is the growing reliance on third-party systems and service providers, all of whom require access to systems and data. Each new connection increases the attack surface, so just one misconfigured remote session or stolen credential can provide an attacker with a foothold deep within a critical system.

Aligning with NERC CIP-015-1 with Zero Trust

The FERC’s adoption of CIP-015-1 is a significant step forward for power grid cybersecurity. The CIP-015-1 standard emphasizes protecting communications networks used for Bulk Electric System (BES) operations, including identifying and securing external connectivity, monitoring network traffic for anomalies, and ensuring segmentation between critical and non-critical systems.

For many utilities, achieving compliance will require a careful balance between modernizing infrastructure and maintaining reliability. Simply isolating networks will not be practical, as operational data still needs to flow for visibility and decision-making purposes. Instead, a more nuanced approach that integrates security controls around the assets themselves can help utilities comply without overhauling existing architectures.

This is where Zero Trust principles align naturally with the FERC's regulatory goals. Rather than assuming trust within a network, Zero Trust enforces continuous verification for every user, device, and data flow, regardless of origin. By embedding these principles into the network architecture, utilities can strengthen their cybersecurity posture while meeting or exceeding compliance mandates.

Applying Zero Trust to the Power Grid

Implementing Zero Trust in a utility environment doesn’t mean replacing every router or rebuilding every subnet. Instead, it’s about introducing logical segmentation and ""least privilege"" access controls for each application at the data layer. This implementation approach allows utilities to virtually compartmentalize critical systems, enforce strict internal network boundaries, and protect assets, all without disrupting existing networks.

Once implemented, a Zero Trust security architecture gives a utility provider:

Micro-segmentation of critical assets: The creation of secure, isolated “zones of trust” or “virtual DMZs” around essential assets, such as substations and SCADA applications, ensures that even if an attacker breaches into one segment, they cannot easily move to others.

Identity-based access control: Network-level access is replaced with continuous user- and device-level authentication based on specific roles and needs.

Encrypted communications: Encryption and continuous policy enforcement secure traffic between IT and OT systems as well as between utilities and third parties.

Real-time anomaly detection: Continuous monitoring of network patterns can help detect suspicious behavior early, such as abnormal remote logins.

With these measures, even if an attacker compromises one endpoint, they encounter immediate barriers.

Securing the Grid Without Renetworking

Adopting a Zero Trust approach does not require a complete network redesign. Modern network overlays enable utilities to enforce access policies across geographically distributed assets, such as power plants and remote substations, without requiring costly overhauls of networking equipment.

By applying software-defined controls at a segmented network edge or the application layer, utilities can incrementally implement Zero Trust protections around their critical digital assets, even with redundant deployment models. This modular approach minimizes operational disruption while mitigating the risk that an initially successful attack can spread.

Take a More Resilient Path

Cyber threats to the power grid will continue to evolve, meaning the security architectures that utility companies utilize must also be capable of adapting to these changes. FERC’s new standards and the Zero Trust security architecture that supports them provide a set of proactive and layered protections that utilities can utilize to rise to the challenge.

However, adopting Zero Trust principles is not merely a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic shift toward resilience. By compartmentalizing critical assets, enforcing identity-based access controls, and encrypting key communications, the power sector can establish a more secure and reliable foundation for the nation’s energy future.","https://img.tdworld.com/files/base/ebm/tdworld/image/2025/10/68f00c21dd16226ba81e0115-dreamstime_m_382523726.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-20 16:19:41.515475

Indianapolis, IN – Indiana officials are reminding residents this week that burning fall leaves is not only outdated but harmful to air quality and community health.

According to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), open burning releases pollutants that can worsen respiratory issues and contribute to poor air quality statewide. The agency is encouraging Hoosiers to choose cleaner, more sustainable methods to manage yard waste this fall.

Instead of burning, IDEM recommends residents “leave the leaves” in place to decompose naturally or use a mulching mower to return nutrients to the soil. Composting is another option — combining yard and food waste to create nutrient-rich compost for gardens.

Residents can also take advantage of local yard waste pickup programs or drop leaves at designated compost sites, including the Valparaiso Compost Site, which accepts yard debris from Porter County residents.

Instead, the next conflict will more likely be a “cold start” for the United States military and the companies that service and equip it.","The US Army general in charge of ammunition is “laser focused on artillery” as the service is just now yielding fruits from years of investment in the form of new factories opening up. General John Reim told Association of the United States Army (AUSA) attendees that he has done nine ribbon cutting ceremonies in the past year alone for more modern facilities.

The Army’s organic industrial base is old, with the overwhelming majority of its buildings dating to World War II.

This chronic malnourishment of defense infrastructure means it is a challenge for depots and yards to maintain complex, modern weapons systems inside facilities that were designed for less complex equipment.

Geriatric buildings often cannot accommodate advanced or additive manufacturing nor the ability to incorporate smart tools like AI. This means the Army isn’t just getting new infrastructure. Along with the much needed additional capacity comes the ability to design and build differently inside more flexible structures.

The future has finally arrived for the armed forces as private capital pours into startups poised to become manufacturing primes. Need 155s today but need 120 mm tank rounds tomorrow?

No problem. There’s a factory being built to flex according to the changing nature of war on a few weeks’ notice.

According to General Reim, the Army needs “modular, flexible production capability that can support a surge” at any time and pivot between what weapons are cranking out of them.

Facilities alone, however, are not enough. All the services have found the decades-long push toward optimization drove key manufacturing capabilities offshore—everything from heavy machinery to gunpowder.

The Army ammo boss reminded reporters that “We just don’t make a lot of stuff in the U.S. anymore. When we look at the equipment that goes in these facilities that’s not sitting in a shelf at Costco, right? They’re long-lead items.”

This is one reason why the Army’s 15-year industrial base modernization plan is taking years to bear fruit. So, while the service is on a path to reversing its manufacturing decline, leaders must not take their foot off the gas now.

There will be no long lead up to the next big war. No time for America to move its mighty Iron Mountain to forward staging and operating bases before going all in.

But they’re already pretty low, so they probably won’t drop too much more.” Why are used EV prices so low?
“So we may see some of the used EV prices start to come down, and that will help sales of those vehicles.
“And so the used EV prices were lower than a comparable gas vehicle.
“The used EV market is very small right now,” said Cox Automotive spokesperson Mark Schirmer in an email, “but certainly growing as the new EV market grows.","Heavy discounts on new electric vehicles and buyer skepticism about their durability continue to push down used EV prices, which experts say has opened up a traditionally pricey market to more U.S. drivers.

While new EVs on average cost $9,000 more than similar gas models, prices on used EVs now are competitive with their internal combustion counterparts at about $680 higher on average, Cox Automotive EV analyst Stephanie Valdez Streaty said: The used market “is one area where you can find affordable EVs.”

In September, the average transaction price for a new EV was $58,124, while the average listing price for a used EV was $34,575, according to Cox Automotive. The lower price tags could be key to winning over an unenthusiastic U.S. market, which has been further dampened by the Trump administration’s move to roll back greenhouse gas regulations and end federal EV tax credits.

“It’s important, because one of the biggest barriers for adoption is price,” Valdez Streaty said.

Retired Naples, Florida, resident Jon Peter Vollmer, 65, owns two used Chevrolet Bolts, including a 2020 model he bought earlier this year for $7,500. At the time of purchase, Vollmer said the Bolt had been driven 45,000 miles.

For comparison, Kelley Blue Book values a used 2020 Honda Civic sedan at about $14,000 and a 2020 Toyota Camry at roughly $15,000.

“The cost was so incredible,” Vollmer said. “They were much more cost-effective.”

It’s unclear how the loss of $7,500 tax credits for new EV buyers and lessees will impact new vehicle prices, and in turn used EV prices, analysts said. A credit of up-to-$4,000 for used EV purchases also expired Sept. 30, but other factors so far have meant steep depreciation for used battery-powered models.

“Some of the prices on used EVs are just nuts,” said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry. “And so there are some really good deals to be had up there, and they may get a little bit better in the coming months. But they’re already pretty low, so they probably won’t drop too much more.”

Why are used EV prices so low?

Discounts on new EVs, the draw of new tech featured in new models, and lack of consumer confidence in the lifespan of EV batteries are top factors driving used values down, Valdez Streaty said in an emaill.

“Automakers are cutting prices and offering substantial lease incentives to stay competitive,” she said. “In many cases, a new EV — after discounts — costs less than a used one, which puts downward pressure on resale values.”

Issues with early model EV batteries also have lingered in buyers’ minds, analysts said, hurting used sales in particular. First-generation Nissan Leaf batteries degraded more quickly because they lacked pricier battery coolers, Abuelsamid said. He said 2026 Leaf models will have updated cooling systems — which many other EV brands have offered for years — that should help battery lifespan.

“Pretty much all of the other EVs, after 10 years they typically have at least around 90% of their original capacity,” Abuelsamid said. “Manufacturers, apart from Nissan with the first Leaf, they have been very careful with the thermal management of the battery, because what causes the battery degradation most of the time is overheating the battery.”

Battery life is “not really something that consumers should be worried about,” Abuelsamid said.

Consumer confidence in the durability of EVs and the longevity of their batteries — by far the most expensive component — likely will grow with time, Valdez Streaty said.

“When we’re able to show these batteries are really good and are going to last a long time, that’s going to help also with the depreciations of EVs,” she said.

How long will prices stay low?

Prices on used EVs will increase or decrease depending on demand and how new EVs are priced, analysts said. Demand rose in recent months, spurred by pull-ahead sales from buyers and lessees hoping to take advantage of the EV tax credit before it expired.

Used EV sales so far this year were up 76% as of September compared to the same time period last year, according to Valdez Streaty.

In response, used EV values also grew more than 6% in September compared to the same time last year, according to wholesale used vehicle auctioneer Manheim. Gas-powered vehicles saw a 1% hike in appreciation during the same period.

“The expiration of federal tax credits created a short-term demand spike that helped stabilize values,” Valdez Streaty said in an email.

“Consumers kept the pace of new and used EV purchases high over the quarter, prior to the expiration of the tax incentive,” said Jeremy Robb, deputy chief economist for Cox Automotive. “This heightened demand pushed EV wholesale values higher again (in September), making EVs the strongest-performing segment in year-over-year value appreciation.”

Moving forward, used EV prices will “depend a lot on how much automakers put prices on new EVs,” Abuelsamid said.

“If we see a bunch of price cuts, especially on existing models, that will hurt residual values,” Abuelsamid said. “So we may see some of the used EV prices start to come down, and that will help sales of those vehicles. EVs have always had, up until now, a lot of depreciation anyway, in part because the tax credits went to the new car buyers. Until the (Inflation Reduction Act) came along, there were no incentives for buying a used EV.

“And so the used EV prices were lower than a comparable gas vehicle. We may see those prices come down even a little bit more in the coming months if we see more price cuts on new EVs, but it probably won’t go down too much more than it is now,” Abuelsamid said.

Another dip in prices could be coming in a few years. More drivers opted to lease EVs beginning in 2023, when the Inflation Reduction Act made tax incentives available to lessees regardless of income. U.S. drivers have leased roughly 1.1 million EVs since 2023, Valdez Streaty said. As lease terms end in the next several years, those vehicles will flood the used market.

“The used EV market is very small right now,” said Cox Automotive spokesperson Mark Schirmer in an email, “but certainly growing as the new EV market grows. The real acceleration is coming, in 2027 and 2028, when a heavy load of leased EVs come back to market, something we will be watching carefully.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-Z-EV-prices-01.jpg?w=1024&h=646,N,,2025-10-20 15:19:49.000882

Today, Sens. Ossoff and Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA) introduced the bipartisan American Energy SecurityAct to help cities and localities strengthen energy infrastructure and lower energy costs for families.

The bipartisan bill would formally authorize the Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure and Safety Modernization grant program, which provides Federal grant funding to help communities replace and upgrade critical infrastructure, improving the safe and reliable transportation of fuel to families and businesses.

The Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure and Safety Modernization grant program was created through the bipartisan infrastructure law but is set to expire. The bipartisan American Energy Security Act would formally authorize the grant program through 2029.

Sen. Ossoff has successfully delivered Federal funding through this grant program to communities across Georgia — including an historic $8.4 million grantThis is an external link to the City of Toccoa last year to replace aged, leaking natural gas pipes to lower energy costs and improve the reliability of services for small businesses and residents in the area — and to the cities of Lawrenceville, Hawkinsville, Buford, Winder, Hartwell, Tifton, Eatonton, Perry, and Thomasville.

“This legislation will strengthen Georgia’s energy security by helping our cities modernize infrastructure. I am leading this bipartisan legislation with Sen. Cassidy to protect families, support growth, and ensure reliable, safe energy for years to come,” Sen. Ossoff said.

“America and the world run on Louisiana natural gas,” said Dr. Cassidy. “We strengthen our country by strengthening our pipeline system.”

“The City of Toccoa was the recipient of an $8.5 million dollar grant award from the Bipartisan NGDISM Grant. This award allows our city to repair and replace aging gas lines providing a huge layer of protection for our community. We reached out to Senator Ossoff, and he led the way for our success in receiving the award. He understands the needs of small communities that have no resources for budgeting projects that are mandated by the federal government. This grant affects every citizen in our community by providing safety and enhancing quality of life,” said Gail Fry, former Mayor of Toccoa, GA. “The American Energy Security Act will provide opportunities for more communities to provide reliable and safe avenues for aging infrastructure.”

“Our 85 municipal gas utilities, and the communities they serve, are grateful for Senators Ossoff and Cassidy introducing the bipartisan, American Energy Security Act to authorize funding the very successful Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization (NGDISM) grant program. This important legislation provides needed investment in the modernization of existing public gas distribution pipelines across the nation ensuring the safety and longevity of existing pipeline infrastructure. Funding programs such as NGDISM create even more opportunities for jobs, improve pipeline safety, and reduce emissions,” said Arthur Corbin, President & CEO of the Gas Authority.

Dive Brief:

The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced Thursday they will no longer provide climate-related financial risk guidance to large banks and lenders.

The decision to rescind the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions comes after the OCC withdrew its participation from the framework in March. The guidance aimed to help banks managing over $100 billion in total assets identify and manage monetary risks related to climate change.

In a joint statement, the regulators said they do not believe the framework is necessary and expressed concerns that “such principles could distract from the management of other potential risks identified and addressed by financial institutions’ existing risk management processes and the agencies’ other risk management rules and guidance.”

Dive Insight:

The Fed, FDIC and OCC said their existing standards require supervised financial institutions to have an effective risk management process in place that is on par with the “size, complexity, and risk of their activities.” These standards, according to the agencies, already establish the expectation for banks to “consider and appropriately address all material risks in their operating environment … including emerging risks.”

The principles are no longer available on the websites of all three agencies as of Oct. 16.

The agencies established the principles in October 2023, under the Biden administration. At the time, the agencies said they aimed to provide banks with a “high-level framework for climate-related financial risk management consistent with the agencies’ existing rules and guidance.”

The decision to rescind the framework comes a few months after the banking regulators departed the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System. TheOCC left the global coalition that aims to mobilize green finance and develop recommendations for climate-risk management in the financial sector in February, following in the footsteps of the Federal Reserve,FDIC and the Treasury Department, who exited NGFS in January, around the time of President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Several climate and sustainability advocates have criticized the federal agencies’ decision to abandon the principles.

In an emailed statement sent to ESG Dive on Friday, Sarah Bloom Raskin — former deputy secretary of the Treasury, former Federal Reserve governor and current senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute — said the agencies’ backtracking “threatens the soundness of the country’s banks and [their] financial stability.”

“Pretending that climate change does not pose widespread financial consequences will not make their effects disappear. This decision leaves homeowners, businesses, and communities vulnerable as extreme weather events increase,” she added.

Sierra Club Sustainable Finance Campaign Adviser Jessye Waxman echoed the sentiment, noting in a Friday statement that “climate change poses a destabilizing, systemic threat to the financial system.”

“The science hasn’t changed, the risks have only worsened, and the best practices for banks are clearer than ever,” Waxman added. “The only relevant change is the administration in power, which shows that this reversal is a purely political move.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/VqNVw4tIfRY5gNXi-wGg7TYvFsTXRE1gdYt9fPgHxaE/g:nowe:0:62/c:1024:578/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy04Njk0ODc0MzYuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-20 20:03:56.319788

What’s going underneath the campus, however, has heads turning over geothermal technology and building energy use.

A series of geothermal pumps conditions the Epic campus almost entirely on their own, with a geothermal network running as deep as 500 feet and containing thousands of miles of piping. Many pipes only transport water, while gas infrastructure is used for a few special heating applications.

Epic said it has one of the largest geothermal systems in the world, and the campus serves as a case study for the U.S. Department of Energy.

The campus, located in Verona, Wis., has around 40 connected buildings and has around 9 million square feet of building space, DOE officials said. The campus is around 1,670 acres and has enough auditorium space to seat around 18,000 people, a campus fact sheet showed.

The geothermal system includes four bore fields with more than 6,000 wells, a stormwater lake and a quarry lake to trap heat, and cooling support for a 3.5-megawatt data center. Salas O’Brien, a national engineering firm, designed and implemented the renewable energy system more than a decade ago. The system project is ongoing, according to the engineering firm.

The geothermal system is complemented by heat reduction through rooftop gardens, wind turbines, solar photovoltaics and energy-efficient building envelopes, DOE officials said. With those elements combined, campus buildings consume around 25% less energy than other commercial buildings in the same climate, they added.

“Beyond the energy savings, the geothermal system has resulted in goodwill from the local community and the worldwide healthcare network. It also resonates with the talent Epic seeks to recruit,” said Derek Schnabel, facilities director at Epic, in a statement.

Epic develops medical record software used by 305 million patients across the U.S. Serving healthcare patients requires around-the-clock operations, and the company said its geothermal systems helps meet that standard of reliability.

The University of Wisconsin-Madison has monitored Epic’s geothermal system since it was installed in 2012. Researchers track air and soil temperatures, subsurface water flow and water levels in the quarry pond to understand system performance, DOE officials said.

The company hopes the knowledge will be shared and used to improve geothermal technology, officials added.",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/10/Epic_page-1-photo_8-21-23-085.png,N,,2025-10-20 15:20:41.781490

The 80-page document says that the government wants to create a new generation of skilled jobs that are located in every corner of the country, with decent pay and the very best workers’ rights.

""Someone is going to win the global race for the clean energy jobs of the future and we are determined that it should be the UK. The job opportunities on offer are huge"", it reads, saying that by 2030 the UK will be a global leader in clean energy sector talent.

However, it conceded that the UK has fallen behind. Germany, Sweden and Denmark have three-to-five times as many renewable energy jobs per capita, the Jobs Plan says, based on data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The report also suggested the UK has seen ""significant underinvestment"" in the sector compared with European peers.

Key deliverables: delivering a skilled worker pipeline

To deliver the pipeline of skilled workers, the government says it will align the skills system and employment support to its Industrial Strategy sectors, including Clean Power 2030. That includes an additional £1.2 billion per year to support skills development over the course of the parliament, including over £100 million into the Engineering Skills Package.

It will also establish five Clean Energy Technical Excellence Colleges (TECs) to specialise in training skilled clean energy workforces for local and national businesses, which is on top of the ten Construction TECs already confirmed.

The UK already has a large energy workforce but this is largely focused on the oil and gas sectors in the North Sea. The government will provide up to £20 million of funding from UK and Scottish government to aid the transition of North Sea workers into clean energy sectors.

It will also deliver up to £2.5 million in funding across 2025-26 for regional skills interventions in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire to support those looking to move into the clean energy sector. All three are counties with a lot of large-scale solar PV development activity.

It will also work with trade bodies RenewableUK and Offshore Energies UK to expand the Energy Skills Passport, develop and promote new pathways for veterans into clean energy and work with the Department for Work and Pensions to encourage reforms to the employment system to deliver for the clean energy sector.

Ensuring ‘clean energy jobs are always good jobs’

To ensure jobs are well-paid with good workers rights, the government will support greater trade union recognition and promote collective bargaining across the clean energy sector.

That includes developing a fair work charter with the wind sector and trade unions, and embedding the role of trade unions within policy-making through various forums and partnerships.

It will also look to improve the inclusivity and visibility of clean energy job opportunities through a new Social Inclusion Forum and an industry-led public awareness campaign.

Delivering regional equity

The Jobs Plan also says the government will deliver funding—although it didn’t say how much—to Local Net Zero Hubs to build a regional picture of clean energy skills and jobs with local authorities.

It will co-develop guidance addressing the Clean Energy Superpower Mission and clean energy skills to support the next cycle of Local Skills Improvement Plans, and establish a Skills Forum and a Net Zero Network to bring together representatives of Industrial Strategy Zones across the UK.

The government will also work closely with Local Growth Plans and utilise the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s (DESNZ's) Local Net Zero Delivery Group and Mayoral Roundtables to identify opportunities for collaboration and alignment between central and regional government.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt864e32313783fe03/blt0e6c457654397d34/68f6165a78a7fc7bae1f752a/Screenshot_2025-10-20_115956.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-20 15:19:53.218094

A majority of the nine universities invited by the Trump administration to sign the so-called Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education had so far rejected the offer as of Monday morning. The compact promised universities preferential access to federal funds in exchange for commitments to a range of operating principles, including maintaining “institutional neutrality.” The Trump administration asked institutions to respond to the offer by Oct. 20.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brown University, the University of Southern California, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Virginia and Dartmouth University have all so far rejected the offer. MIT President Sally Kornbluth was the first to decline, telling Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a letter that “fundamentally, the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone.” Others echoed this sentiment, reaffirming their commitments to core institutional values such as academic freedom and fair admissions processes.

On Oct. 12, President Trump opened up the offer to all higher education institutions in a Truth Social post. The institutions included in the original offer that had not yet rejected it were reportedly invited to a meeting on Friday afternoon. The meeting invite was also extended to Arizona State University, the University of Kansas, and Washington University in St. Louis.

At the time of publication, no university had yet agreed to the compact, though there are indications the University of Texas at Austin was considering it, with Chairman of the UT System Board of Regents, Kevin Eltife, saying he was “honored” that the institution had been selected for potential funding advantages. UT faculty and students have expressed opposition to the university joining the compact.

Judge halts shutdown RIFs

A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting a mass firing of federal employees during the government shutdown. Judge Susan Illston sided with labor unions representing federal employees last week, saying the administration’s use of reduction-in-force notices during a shutdown is transparently politically motivated and likely a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration has issued more than 4,000 RIF notices to federal employees since the shutdown began on Oct. 1.

For now, the administration may not enforce any RIFs to programs that employ union members or issue more such RIFs. Defendants were given two business days to disclose details on all “actual or imminent” RIFs, which are now available in the court docket. A hearing on the case is scheduled to take place on Oct. 28.

In her written opinion, Illston stated it is “far from normal for an administration to fire line-level civilian employees during a government shutdown as a way to punish the opposing political party. But that is precisely what President Trump has announced he is doing.”

Meanwhile in Congress, the Senate failed to pass a continuing resolution bill to temporarily fund the government for the tenth time last week. Senate Democrats also voted Thursday to block the fiscal year 2026 defense appropriations bill, instead pushing for a broader deal to resolve the shutdown.

Also last week, the Pentagon reportedly filled its $8 billion payroll for troops by tapping into unspecified R&D funds following an order from President Trump. The Senate is scheduled to meet this week to vote on legislation to keep paying the military and other federal workers who are required to keep working during the shutdown.

Harvard research funding restored

Harvard University has now recovered most of its federal research grants that were cancelled by the Trump administration, The Boston Globe reports. Earlier this year, the Trump administration froze more than $2.6 billion dollars in research grants to Harvard, citing concerns that the institution had failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus — a charge the university has denied. A federal judge ruled on Sept. 3 that the funding freeze was illegal and ordered the Trump administration to restore the funding. It was unclear how long the reinstatement of funds would take given the government shutdown.

While most of Harvard’s research grants have now been reinstated, Harvard School of Public Health Dean Andrea Baccarelli sent an email last week urging faculty to remain cautious about hiring “given continued uncertainty and the potential for funds to be disrupted again,” according to reporting by The Harvard Crimson. Harvard last week reported an operating loss of $113 million in fiscal year 2025 as of June, with University President Alan Garber reportedly describing the year as “extraordinarily challenging, with political and economic disruption affecting many sectors, including higher education.”

Background

The original text of the preparatory plans was contained within a 360-page document submitted on October 8 by General Electric Company (GE). The company was charged with remediating the Housatonic River after decades of depositing now-banned toxic chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), into the waterway from its Pittsfield plant. The Superfund project for the Rest of River—the cleanup of the Housatonic River from its east and west confluence in Pittsfield to Connecticut—stems from a 2020 agreement between the EPA, GE, and five affected towns. The settlement provides that the materials dredged from the waterway with the highest toxicity will be routed out of the area while the remaining lesser-contaminated dredged soil and sediment will be transported to a to-be-constructed upland disposal facility (UDF) in Lee, near October Mountain. The measure has long been opposed by Lee residents as a health hazard to the town’s citizens and way of life.

The EPA is tasked with reviewing and approving all documents submitted in conjunction with the project, including the October 8 Upland Disposal Facility Site Preparation Supplemental Information Package (SIP) submission. A copy of the submission can be found here.

Although GE’s revised Final Design Plan and Operation, Monitoring, and Maintenance Plan for the UDF was conditionally approved by the EPA in March, the agency nixed a formal public comment period on the October 8 plan to prepare that site for construction, with the preparation project set to begin in early November.

Explaining the timeline

In its October 16 statement, the EPA extended the deadline for it to submit agency comments to the SIP, or UDF preparation plan, to October 31, to “allow more time for the public to provide input.”

According to the EPA, the UDF site preparation work will begin on November 3 as preparation items are moved to the area, erosion controls are created, and trees cleared. The required asbestos abatement and removal of associated waste in existing house structures on the property will occur before those buildings are demolished, followed by the installation of two temporary construction entrances, tree-clearing activities, fencing work, utility additions, and waterline action.

The project’s tree-clearing activities is at the crux of the timeline issue since those actions are governed by the date bats roost in the area.

Drafted by EPA Community Involvement Coordinator Olivia Lopez, the clarification offered the agency’s reasoning for the short timeline as being “necessary to ensure that the remedial schedule remains on time and that the potential rare bat species are not affected by the site preparation work.”

“In collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Fish and Wildlife, all tree clearing activities must be completed between November 1st and March 31st to avoid adverse impacts to potential roosting rare bats,” the statement provided. “To allow for sufficient time to complete the tree felling in 2025 as outlined in the SIP, GE must begin its work in November.”

The agency reiterated that the upcoming work “is not for the overall construction of the UDF and does not involve the handling of any contaminated material.” Additionally, the preparatory project will not change any components of the overall UDF design and an upcoming SIP detailing the UDF construction “will be available for public input.”

The preparation project is scheduled to end by January 2, but that date is subject to change due to weather and other factors.",https://berkshireedge-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-20-at-1.56.15%E2%80%AFPM.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:19:06.600643

This story was originally published by Canary Media.

A new law in Ohio will fast-track energy projects in places that are hard to argue with: former coal mines and brownfields.

But how much the legislation benefits clean energy will depend on the final rules for its implementation, which the state is working out now.

Ohio has more than 567,000 acres of mine lands and about 50,000 acres of brownfields that are potentially suitable for renewable-energy development, according to a 2024 report from The Nature Conservancy. Federal funding to clean up abandoned mine lands has continued so far under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, so yet more sites may become available. Overall, remediating documented hazards at Ohio’s abandoned mine lands is estimated to cost nearly $586 million, said spokesperson Karina Cheung at the state Department of Natural Resources.

The debate over HB 15 rules

Advocates and industry groups generally applaud the new law but want tweaks to the Power Siting Board’s proposed rules.

A big concern is making sure the board will allow wind and solar developments on mine lands and brownfields throughout Ohio, regardless of which county they’re in. Roughly one-third of Ohio’s 88 counties ban wind, solar, or both in all or a significant part of their jurisdiction. This authority was granted to them by a 2021 law, Senate Bill 52.

However, the language and legislative history of HB 15 make clear that it ​“was meant to be technology-neutral,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy.

HB 15 even states that its terms for permitting energy projects in priority investment areas apply ​“notwithstanding” some other parts of Ohio law.

“That clause is meant to bypass some of the typical Ohio Power Siting Board procedures — including the procedures for siting in restricted areas” under SB 52, wrote Bill Stanley, Ohio director for The Nature Conservancy, in comments filed with the board.

But the exemption provided by the ​“notwithstanding” clause is narrow, Mellino added, because local government authorities must ask for a priority investment area designation. That means, for example, that in a county with a solar and wind ban in place, officials would need to choose to request that a former coal mine or brownfield become a priority investment area.

The Nature Conservancy has asked the Power Siting Board to add language making it crystal-clear that renewable-energy projects can be built on any land marked a priority investment area — even if a solar and wind ban otherwise exists in a county.

Industry groups are pushing for additional clarifications to make sure the Power Siting Board meets the permitting deadlines set by the new law, both for expedited and standard projects.

For example, Open Road Renewables, which builds large-scale solar and battery storage, said in comments that, in order to align with HB 15, the board’s rules should require energy developers to notify the public of an application when it is filed, rather than after it is deemed complete.

Separate comments from the American Clean Power Association, MAREC Action, and the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio ask for tweaks to provisions regarding notices on public hearings and for clarifications on application fees. The board should also promptly issue certificates for projects that are automatically approved, say comments by Robert Brundrett, president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.

The Department of Development hopes to finish draft standards and invite public comments on them soon, Waldvogel said. Meanwhile, the department has received its first request to designate a priority investment area. The ask comes from Jefferson County’s board of commissioners, which did not specify the type of energy that may be built in the area.

That request deals with land where FirstEnergy’s former Sammis coal plant is undergoing demolition, as well as the Hollow Rock Landfill, which received waste from the site. HB 15 gives the department 90 days to act on designation requests.

The Ohio Power Siting Board, for its part, is expected to finalize its rules within the next couple of months. Ultimately, said Cherry of MAREC Action, the law ​“clears the path for developers to bring energy projects online quickly and affordably, something Ohio’s consumers and businesses desperately need.”

A total of 31 skilled trades have been designated as recruitment priorities, with heating, ventilation, and plumbing roles expected to see the highest demand. The government is also investing in five new technical excellence colleges and regional skills pilots, backed by £2.5 million, to support training and career development.

Additional programmes will help match veterans and other jobseekers with opportunities in solar panel installation, wind turbine production, nuclear power, and other clean energy sectors. Existing oil and gas workers will also benefit from bespoke upskilling programmes supported by up to £20 million from the UK and Scottish governments.

Unions, including Unite and GMB have welcomed the plan, emphasising the importance of well-paid, secure work and strong collective bargaining rights in supporting the green transition.

Following the lead of Barra of GM, Ford announced in 2018 that it planned to nearly triple its investments in electric and hybrid vehicles by 2022, with plans for 40 new such models…

But a series of challenges — cost concerns, sluggish adoption and the reversal in support in Washington — has left the U.S. auto industry with greater uncertainty about its EV future.

“Penetration has stalled,” said David Whiston, a senior analyst at Morningstar investment research company who covers autos. (NBC News)

We saw evidence of the slowdown last week, when General Motors said it will incur a $1.6 billion loss to scale back its electric vehicle (EV) operations, citing weaker expected demand due to recent US policy changes, including the end of federal EV tax credits and loosened emissions rules. (Zero Hedge)

On Sept. 30, the federal EV tax credit expired as part of a broader anti-EV mandate by the Trump administration. The credit started in 2008 and was expanded under the Biden administration. It had been a key driver of EV sales in the US.

In Bécancour, Quebec, the planned expansion of a battery facility was put on hold. The first phase of the project, called Ultium CAM, a partnership between General Motors and Korean steel manufacturer POSCO, is under construction, with the $600 million facility due to open in 2026.

But according to Energy Now, A spokesperson for General Motors Canada said Thursday that the company is pausing the second phase of a project to produce cathode active materials for electric-vehicle batteries… The decision was made “in light of evolving market dynamics,” according to spokesperson Marie Binette.

As a result of that decision, Brazilian mining giant Vale SA has scrapped plans for a nickel sulfate plant that would have supplied the second phase of the Ultium CAM project. In a statement, Vale Base Metals said GM “will not need nickel sulfate in Quebec at this time.”

As my Oilprice colleague Irina Slav wrote on Oct. 14, US EV sales surged a record 40% in the third quarter, driven by a rush to buy before the $7,500 federal tax credit expired on Sept. 30.

The push to buy EVs ahead of subsidy expiry followed a dismal second quarter, when new EV sales declined by 6.3% year on year, according to Cox Automotive, which said the growth trajectory for EVs “has been curbed.”

The end of subsidies threatens the EV industry’s profitability, with Ford, GM, and Stellantis all losing money on electric models.

BloombergNEF says 14 million fewer EVs could be sold by 2030 under current policies.

“Demand has grown more slowly than expected, and that’s likely to continue given the elimination of consumer incentives and regulatory changes,” said James Cain, executive director for finance and sales communications at GM, quoted by Rob Wile, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist at NBC News.

He notes that even before Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” ended the EV subsidy, signs of EV fatigue among US consumers had begun to show:

A survey published in August 2024 by Edmunds automotive information group showed concerns about finding charging stations and charging times, availability and reliability as the top reasons consumers would not purchase EVs…

Ford CEO Jim Farley said this month that EV sales could fall by around 50% after the EV tax credits expire…

The entire U.S. auto market also remains challenged by affordability issues. The average price of a new car surpassed $50,000 for the first time last month, Kelley Blue Book reported Tuesday…

EVs currently cost about $7,000 more, according to Kelley Blue Book data.

In a recent article, RBC Capital Markets argued the EV slowdown in the US is mainly driven by the wide price gap between new and used EVs, with more buyers incentivized to choose used cars over newer models.

“There's a lot of attention on the culture wars and range anxiety, but what we think is really happening is used EV prices have come down so much that consumers in the U.S. are essentially not buying new EVs,” says Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst for Global Autos, RBC Capital Markets.

Used battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are now priced at around USD$30,000, making them price-equivalent to used internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.

Narayan says US tariffs could force EV makers to raise prices on new vehicles, expanding the gap between the prices of new versus used EVs.

RBC has cut its 2030 forecast for EV adoption in the US in half, from 35 percent to 17 percent, saying that the main constraint is the lack of public charging infrastructure — especially fast Level 3 chargers.

According to consulting firm EY’s September 2025 “EY Mobility Lens Forecaster,” an AI-powered modeling tool developed to predict electric vehicle adoption timelines in the key US, China and EU markets through 2050, via Wards Auto, the timeline to reach 50% EV adoption won’t happen now until 2039 — five years later than previously forecast.

The forecasting model found that Elimination of buyer incentives combined with regulatory uncertainty is expected to slow domestic electric vehicle adoption as the technology advances in other global markets.

Indeed, the US EV slowdown has not been duplicated in Europe and China.

While EV penetration forecasts in Europe have dropped from 50 percent to 40 percent, unlike in the United States, regulatory mandates require a certain share of EV sales.

China continues to lead the EV race with a major cost advantage in battery production and market penetration rates two to three times higher than in the US, according to RBC.

In September, global EV sales reached 2.1 million, hitting a monthly record. China alone accounted for 1.3 million sales.

The withdrawal of federal grants is likely to set back environmental justice efforts in Rhode Island by years.","PROVIDENCE — More than half a year after the Trump administration canceled or rescinded billions of dollars in federal grants, some environmental justice efforts continue to stall in Rhode Island as a result.

The Environmental Protection Agency in the last year of the Biden administration awarded about $22 million to six different state agencies and local nonprofits to fund, among other things, the state’s compost capacity, to build awareness of lead service pipes transporting drinking water, and to study asthma in Rhode Island.

Much of the funding came from two signature legislative achievements of the Biden administration: the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Build Back Better Act.

Those two pieces of legislation ensured billions in federal funding began flowing to Rhode Island for a number of environmental-related projects that never had federal funding before.

But the Trump administration this past spring embarked on a campaign of slashing or rolling back much of the spending from the Biden acts, including money for environmental justice grants.

The federal freeze hit close to home.

The Rhode Island Food Policy Council, which last year was awarded an $18.7 million environmental justice community grant from the EPA, laid off three staff members due to the Trump administration rescinding federal money.

“The work of the Rhode Island Food Policy Council depends in part on federal grants which are now frozen,” wrote the Providence-based nonprofit in an April newsletter announcing the layoffs. “As a result, and with heavy hearts, we made the difficult decision to cut three valuable staff positions.”

Farm Fresh Rhode Island, the state’s chief food incubator hub since 2004, has seen the brunt of federal funding cuts firsthand: 40% of its budget comes from the federal government, and it’s the designated administrative entity for a number of U.S. Department of Agriculture grants and programs.

Delite Primus, advancement director for Farm Fresh, said two USDA-funded programs were cut early in March: the Local Food Purchasing Agreement and the Local Food for Schools program, both of which facilitate procurement of locally grown produce for use in food pantries and school meal programs.

Primus said Farm Fresh expected to get another $3 million total for both programs; around $1.7 million for the school purchasing program and another $1.25 million for the local food purchasing agreement. A portion of the money set aside to buy local food for schools was designated for early childhood education centers, a new expansion to the program Primus said was added last fall.

“A lot of the local fruit and vegetable farmers, the fisheries, the food producers around the state, a lot of them are smaller farmers that were benefiting from this,” Primus said. “They have really been able to grow their operations because of these markets, and the funding that was available to support these purchases.”

As a result of the USDA cuts, Primus said Farm Fresh had to lay off four people related to the local purchasing grants, an unusual move in the nonprofit space, where it’s rare for funding that had been previously awarded to get cut.

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management received a $944,618 Environmental Justice Government-to-Government grant, which the agency was going to use to support local nonprofits engaged in environmental justice initiatives. The EPA notified DEM on March 31 that the federal agency would be terminating the remainder of the grant.

A spokesperson for DEM told ecoRI News the agency submitted a letter disputing the withdrawal of funds, but the EPA ultimately denied the dispute letter on Oct. 2, writing that “it is within the Agency’s discretion to determine that a given grant award no longer effectuates the program goals of Agency priorities and to terminate the award.”

“Before the grant was terminated, DEM was able to spend $355,101.57 in grant awards,” said Kim Keough, DEM’s chief of public affairs.

That grant money was going to DEM’s Community Conversations initiative, where agency staff held public presentations and workshops about some of the legacy pollution lingering in the state’s air, land, and water.

The original grants were a big boost for local efforts for environmental justice issues in Rhode Island. In the past few years DEM has issued its own environmental justice policy and definitions, including a map of identified environmental justice areas around the state, but regulations with teeth and the force of law remain elusive.

Efforts in the General Assembly to enact environmental justice legislation have gone nowhere. The Environmental Justice Act, introduced annually by lawmakers in the House and Senate, would allow departments like DEM and the Coastal Resources Management Council to consider cumulative impacts when siting industrial projects.

Industrial and polluted areas, such as the Port of Providence, tend to exist in a positive-feedback loop. Once a single industrial or pollution-intensive industry sets up shop somewhere — typically a POC neighborhood, whose community members have little political power — it becomes much easier for like-minded industries to locate nearby.

The Environmental Justice Act would give another layer of authority to state agencies, allowing them to weigh the cumulative impact each new permit application will have on the surrounding area in tandem with existing businesses. Currently, DEM is only allowed to examine the impact a singular project will have on the area; anything more is likely to be overturned by the courts.

The withdrawal of federal grants is likely to set back environmental justice efforts in Rhode Island by years. Without federal dollars, many of the planned projects are unlikely to happen.

The Nature Conservancy of Rhode Island received $500,000 to address tree canopy inequities in and around the Providence area. The grant was rescinded by the Trump administration earlier this year, and The Nature Conservancy has filed no lawsuit in District Court to get the funds back.

A spokesperson for The Nature Conservancy declined to provide comment or details on the grant.",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SocialJustice.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:19:11.640742

The 18-month project, named Môr Neidr — Welsh for “sea snake” — builds on two years of in-house innovation and will strengthen Southwest Wales’ position as a hub for marine renewable energy.

Working with Swansea University, CGEN Engineering, the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult and Wave Venture, the initiative will deliver new hardware, testing and research infrastructure to advance the Anaconda’s readiness for sea trials at the Welsh Marine Energy Test Area (META).

Checkmate director Paul Auston said: “This grant allows us to accelerate the Anaconda’s development and build on the innovation our team has already delivered, with a clear path toward future sea trials. It’s an exciting step forward, not just for Checkmate, but for the future of wave energy in Wales and the Celtic Sea, where we see enormous potential to deliver clean, predictable power at scale.”

The Anaconda captures wave energy through a patented bulge-tube design comprising a reinforced natural rubber outer tube and hundreds of internal tendons made from high-performance rubber.

As waves travel along the flexible structure, they generate pressure bulges that move toward a power take-off system at the end of the tube, converting energy into electricity. The internal wave speed can be adjusted to maximise power production or survivability in rough conditions.

Dr Brian Mathew, MP and member of the Marine Energy All-Party Parliamentary Group, said: “I welcome this exciting news, and I’m pleased to see innovative solutions on renewable energy like this being well supported and funded. It’s testament to the incredible expertise we have here in Wiltshire, and I will be watching on keenly in the coming months and years to see how the Anaconda develops.”

Vice Admiral Sir Adrian Johns, KCB, CBE, KStJ, DL, said: “As a former seafarer, I am fully aware of the power of the sea and the as yet untapped potential for harnessing wave energy. Having followed Anaconda’s progress over many years from the earliest scale model water tank trials, I am delighted that this truly innovative project will now be able to take the next big step towards delivering clean, renewable energy at full scale.”

Over the next 18 months, the project will combine advanced numerical modelling with tank trials, materials testing and construction of a 1:4-scale prototype section.

Checkmate said the work will refine and validate the Anaconda’s design and create new resources for the wider wave energy sector.

The Democratic lawmakers asked that the department respond to their letter by Thursday.","Senior Democratic members of the Senate and House Appropriations committees are demanding the Trump administration provide details on plans to fire scores of employees from the Department of Energy, warning that mass layoffs “will hurt communities across the country.”

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations panel, and Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), the ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, called on the Trump administration in a Friday letter to “halt” all planned reductions in force and give them “detailed information” on potential layoffs.

“We write with outrage over the Department of Energy’s decision to move forward with reductions in force (RIFs) across critical program offices during the government shutdown in a clear act of political retribution that will hurt communities across the country,” Murray and Kaptur wrote in a letter to Energy Secretary Christopher Wright.

Murray is also ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.

They said the move, which will affect 179 employees, is part of a broader effort to “implement the administration’s budget request without congressional approval — circumventing the appropriations process and undermining congressional intent.”

The pair warned the layoffs would raise energy prices by disrupting the implementation of programs to increase supplies and reduce costs.

Murray and Kaptur said they were “alarmed” about how “mass firings might allow waste, fraud, and abuse as you eliminate key staff conducting oversight of programs.”

They wrote that the Energy Department has so far “refused to provide information” about the distribution of layoffs in offices such as the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Office of State Community Energy Programs and the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.

Employees at those offices have been notified of impending terminations but have not been provided dates for when their jobs would end, creating “confusion and uncertainty throughout the department,” they noted.

“These RIFs would effectively dismantle the very offices responsible for lowering energy costs for American families and communities” and could jeopardize work to distribute $366 million per year through the Weatherization Assistance Program, which saves participating households an estimated $372 per year, they argued.

Murray and Kaptur warned the firings would end research and development programs in solar, wind and hydrogen technologies, undermining the affordability of clean energy programs.

“We demand you immediately halt all RIF actions and provide the committee with detailed information about the scope, timing and justification of these reductions,” they wrote, adding that they would like to see the department’s plan for implanting and overseeing programs managed by the offices targeted by the layoffs.

Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Congressman Steven Horsford (D-Nev.-04), Senator Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Congresswoman Dina Titus (D-Nev.-01) and Congresswoman Susie Lee (D-Nev.-03) sent a letter to U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Doug Burgum raising concerns that the Department’s new policy is placing additional scrutiny on only certain renewable energy sources. This action could put the stability of the energy grid at risk and raise utility rates in states that rely on solar power, like Nevada.

“This July 15th memo establishes that ‘all decisions, actions, consultations, and other undertakings … related to wind and solar energy facilities shall require submission to the Office of the Executive Secretariat and Regulatory Affairs, subsequent review by the Office of the Deputy Secretary, and final review by the Office of the Secretary.’

“We are concerned this memo is meant to intentionally hinder the deployment of renewable energy projects on our public lands, and we question its necessity, especially considering this memo only applies to wind and solar energy facilities rather than all forms of energy production. We are also concerned that the impacts of this memo extend beyond federal lands to any private project that requires approvals at the federal level, such as for transmission right-of-way permits, thus placing even more projects potentially at risk of either being delayed or cancelled altogether,” wrote the members.

As DOI implements this new policy, residential electricity rates have spiked across the United States – more than 30 percent on average since 2020 and almost double the rate of inflation in the past year. At the same time President Trump ended or delayed 80,500 clean energy jobs, cancelled $24 billion for energy projects since May, and announced the termination of nearly $8 billion in clean energy investments in states that did not vote for Trump. Additional projects, including in Nevada, face increased uncertainty due to the Administration’s decisions.

“[B]y adding new permitting hurdles, the Department risks choking this progress and ceding global energy dominance to China, whose ‘all of the above’ strategy has allowed their economy to grow rapidly. By the end of 2024, China added 277 gigawatts of solar, 79 gigawatts of wind, and 40 gigawatts of energy storage compared to roughly 60 gigawatts total across all energy generation types in the United States,” continued the Members.

“The United States is facing an impending energy crisis. Electricity demand is rising rapidly, yet the energy grid is unprepared. DOI’s July 15th memo does not “unleash energy dominance;” it weaponizes the permitting process against it. If the Department is serious about an all-of-the-above energy strategy, it must ensure that both traditional and renewable energy resources can be developed efficiently and responsibly,” concluded the Members.

Central New York environmental and civic officials worry that impacts could be felt locally if the move goes through and conservation and health protections are lost.

The Endangerment Finding legally recognizes greenhouse gases as air pollutants posing dangers to public health. The ruling, adopted in 2009, is the legal underpinning for restrictions on tailpipe emissions, the smokestacks of power plants burning fossil fuels, and regulations for clean air and water to limit industrial pollutants.

We spoke with Central-Northern New York Chair of the Sierra Club Rhea Jezer, who said losing that authority would undermine progress toward new kinds of energy and climate resilience.

“Renewable energy will be decimated,” Jezer said. “All the incentives we’re getting to put our solar panels up, all the incentives we’re getting to get electric cars, that’ll be gone.”

Jezer, who runs Energy 21, a forum on renewable power, added the effects would extend far beyond energy policy. She worries that without federal regulation, public health in cities like Syracuse will worsen.

“The asthma rate, for instance, the city of Syracuse, it's appalling,” she said “If all this is put in place the way the administration wants to, we are going to have more disease. We're going to have more changes in cold and warm, less snow.”

Since 2009, the Endangerment Finding has served as the basis for federal efforts to help eliminate carbon emissions that threaten human health and the environment. The Trump administration argues the science behind the endangerment finding is outdated–and no longer supports have the E-P-A limit emissions from cars and power plants.

Syracuse City Auditor Alexander Marion said the EPA’s mission to protect communities is essential, decrying changes that would weaking it.

“The EPA's job is to keep us safe,” he said. “It is to ensure that children have clean drinking water, and our workers can go outside and have better air quality, it is their job to ensure that our communities are safe to exist in going forward.”

Still, Marion urged local residents are not powerless. He believes communities can push back through civic engagement and advocacy.

“The hope I have is in the people in Syracuse and communities across this country to step up, do the right thing, push their federal government, use the levers of democracy, including the levers in the voting machine, to ensure that we are enacting the policies that we need to safeguard our communities for the future.”

Marion added that higher greenhouse gas levels and resultant effects become a direct problem for the city

“When we are not taking the steps we need to mitigate the damage of climate change, that will cost us money, whether that’s worker’s compensation, infrastructure,” he said, “We are already outfitting our schools with better air condition units because our buildings are old and they are getting hot.”

Both Jezer and Marion say maintaining the Endangerment Finding is critical is critical to protecting not only Central New York’s air, water, and climate, but ensuring the whole country remains a safe and healthy place to live.

As companies navigate a business landscape defined by continuing disruption and uncertainty, decarbonization’s dual value of climate mitigation and long-term enterprise and financial resilience ensures it remains a business imperative. Indeed, few other corporate actions can simultaneously cut costs, open new markets, increase access to finance, reduce regulatory exposure, and bolster energy security.

This second blog in our three-part series on operational decarbonization explores how companies can use tailored fleet management to reduce their emissions while also bolstering operational performance. As with our first blog on industrial heat, we highlight real-world case studies to bring fleet decarbonization to life and highlight its unique challenges and opportunities.

How to reduce fleet emissions and fuel costs with smart fleet management

Companies can drive significant reductions in both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel costs through a focus on vehicle fleets (e.g., route optimization, electric vehicle adoption, alternative fuels, etc.). While exact solutions will vary by organization and jurisdiction, companies can develop tailored, value adding fleet decarbonization approaches with the right expert diagnosis.

For companies with large vehicle fleets, addressing transportation emissions is crucial to meeting sustainability goals. Still, the task can appear daunting. High upfront capital costs, significant operational impacts, and policy uncertainty often challenge companies and can slow progress. In the U.S., for example, the recent sunsetting of federal tax credits for electric vehicles will likely complicate corporate fleet management strategies that involve alternative fuel vehicles, although fleet/route optimization strategies remain value accretive. By contrast, in Europe and elsewhere, total cost of ownership (capital cost plus long run operating costs) of electrifying passenger car and van fleet can deliver impressive ROI. In one ERM project example, a pan-European manufacturing firm saw a 2.7 year payback through shift from diesel vehicle ownership to electric vehicle leasing.

Many of ERM’s clients also have fleets that span vehicle types which serve different purposes. Their fleet situations are further complicated because their vehicles are distributed across geographies and are at different stages of their useful asset life. Faced with these complexities, businesses struggle to identify a starting point for addressing fleet emissions.

Businesses can cut through these challenges by developing a strong fleet decarbonization strategy that breaks a fleet into component parts and identifies solutions for each, rather than pursuing a single, fleet-wide solution. For example, public incentives and low electricity prices in a given operating region might make certain fleet segments—such as light-duty vans or refrigerated trailers—well-suited for electrification, driving rapid financial upside.

Conversely, electrification in other fleet segments may be challenged by capital limitations, leading businesses to turn to renewable fuels that do not require significant infrastructure investment to achieve emissions reductions. Here, a “yes, and” approach enables more practical, scalable progress than an “either, or” approach.

The case studies we outline below exemplify how businesses have successfully applied this philosophy to reduce their fleet emissions.

Fleet decarbonization in action: 3 steps to get started

To get started on fleet decarbonization, consider the following practical steps and read on to see how real-world companies are putting them into action.

Conduct a fleet assessment: Identify the most impactful and cost-effective decarbonization opportunities across the fleet.

Tailor your strategy: Implement a fleet decarbonization strategy tailored to business circumstances, rather than deploying a common approach across the organization.

Build a phased roadmap: Do not try to do everything all at once. Build a practical, phased roadmap for fleet decarbonization that enables steady progress.

Case study one

Challenge:

A U.S.-based HVAC company’s fleet, comprised of passenger vans and trucks with significant towing requirements, represented more than 90 percent of the firm’s total GHG emissions.

The company aimed to achieve fleet cost savings and simultaneous emissions reductions, all while avoiding significant operational changes.

The solution:

ERM’s financial and emissions modeling showed that while transitioning the entire company’s fleet to EVs would drive the largest GHG emissions reductions, such a transition would be cost-prohibitive. Instead, ERM identified vans as the fleet segment where emissions reductions would be most cost-effective.

ERM proposed a pilot tailored to a subset of vehicle types, targeting vans in the U.S. state of Massachusetts (where the business had a higher concentration of vans and owned property to facilitate charger installation, thus reducing costs). After success in Massachusetts, the company expanded the pilot across the U.S.

In addition to the pilot, ERM leveraged creative financing options to lower fleet transition costs. By leasing electric vans rather than owning them outright, the company could save money and limit capital outlay, while still reducing GHG emissions.

The impact:

This strategy identified levers to realize a 34 percent reduction in emissions intensity and $2.2 million in annual operational savings due to lower operations and maintenance costs and fuel spending. Furthermore, by switching to leased vans, the company could avoid capital expenditures of $80,000 or more per new van purchased.

Lessons learned:

Rather than waiting for the entire fleet to be electrification-ready, focus on the segments where you can make immediate progress. This incremental approach reflects the “yes, and” philosophy in action—electrify where it works now and explore other solutions across your fleet as you go.

Location matters. Conduct a pilot for the fleet in a location with favorable conditions (e.g., concentration of particular vehicle types, strong EV infrastructure, etc.) and then apply lessons learned to other locations with similar characteristics.

Consider leasing options for the fleet in addition to outright capital purchases of EVs and other low carbon vehicle types.

Case study two

Challenge:

A U.S.-based wholesale distributor aimed to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by more than 25 percent. Although its fleet represented nearly three-quarters of these emissions, total electrification was not feasible because long-haul trucks composed a majority of its fleet and cost-effective low carbon alternatives were not yet available.

The solution:

ERM’s financial analysis showed that switching to renewable diesel would enable the company to reduce emissions without the significant capital costs associated with electrification.

ERM also compiled a portfolio of producers that could supply renewable diesel and determined geographies where supportive regulatory frameworks would make the fuel cost-competitive with fossil diesel.

ERM then recommended a tiered transition plan, where the company would first switch to renewable diesel in U.S. states where it achieved cost parity with fossil diesel, before expanding to more nascent markets.

The impact:

By switching to renewable diesel, the company was able to reduce its emissions by 13 percent and cost competitively with fossil diesel, putting it on track to achieve its Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction goal.

Further, the renewable diesel solution offered 40 percent cost savings compared to electrifying the company’s entire fleet.

Lessons learned:

Even if total fleet electrification is not viable, do not rule out other paths to fleet decarbonization. By remaining flexible and adopting solutions aligned to specific contexts, businesses can achieve significant GHG emissions reductions.

Public incentives can make a material difference to the economics of fleet decarbonization.

Breaking fleets into segmented parts and applying bespoke solutions can help unlock faster decarbonization and overcome complexities that might otherwise slow progress.

Case study three

Challenge:

A European waste services provider based in Europe with an extensive refuse collection and street cleaning fleet set out to establish reduction targets for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

The company had to navigate fleet decarbonization across demanding duty cycles, short (8-10 years) contract lengths with its customers (primarily municipalities), and customer-imposed budget caps that limited the company’s ability to absorb capital cost uplift.

While an early adopter of electric refuse collection vehicles in some jurisdictions, its wider fleet was diverse with distinct operational requirements for different use cases.

The solution:

ERM conducted a detailed duty cycle analysis that found that off-the-shelf battery electric models would be suitable for some of the client’s operations; however, transitioning its most demanding operations would depend on future technology advancements.

ERM’s financial modelling showed that vehicles accounting for 17 percent of the company’s emissions could be immediately transitioned cost-effectively, while others would become cost-effective in the 2030s as upfront vehicle costs decreased.

ERM recommended a gradual fleet electrification program that would require upfront investment but would begin generating net returns for the company beginning inthe early 2030s.

To ensure the company maintained net income during its transition, ERM calculated the level at which contract prices for customers would need to increase and explored several levers for improving the business case for electrification, including longer contract lengths and shared charging infrastructure.

The impact:

By transitioning the fleet gradually instead of all at once, the company will be able to abate 50-70 percent of emissions by 2035 compared to an all diesel fleet.

Lessons learned:

By accounting for diverse fleet operations, companies can develop tailored electrification plans that prioritize cost-effective solutions for the portions of their fleets that can be transitioned immediately, while also accounting for future actions that will enable them to transition their remaining vehicle types as technologies develop.

By viewing fleet electrification as a single investment, rather than a processes with multiple starts and stops for different vehicle types, companies can more rapidly and comprehensively deploy innovative business models to support decarbonization.

Innovative contracting approaches allow fleet operators to transition their vehicles while also helping their customers overcome economic barriers.

Conclusion: Fleet decarbonization as a strategic imperative

Decarbonization is a clear strategic imperative for companies looking to improve operational resilience and financial performance. Whether by reducing operational costs, guarding against energy price volatility, or enhancing brand reputation, operational emissions reductions can deliver broad business value.

Using lessons learned from the case studies above, companies with large vehicle fleets can turn decarbonization from ambition to actuality, reaping benefits along the way.

The U.S. Department of Energy approved a $1.6 billion loan guarantee for American Electric Power (AEP) to modernize 5,000 miles of high-voltage power lines. The upgrades will cross Oklahoma, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and West Virginia.

This project will strengthen regional reliability and reduce outages linked to severe weather. For Oklahoma, the investment supports grid resilience and clean energy integration. The lines will connect existing oil-and-gas-powered generation with renewable energy transmission corridors.

Energy analysts say the move positions Oklahoma to handle expanding power demand from data centers, electric vehicle charging, and manufacturing growth.

The project also supports Oklahoma’s growing role as a regional transmission hub, linking renewable generation in western Oklahoma with industrial and urban demand centers near Tulsa and Oklahoma City for improved reliability statewide.

Texas Orphan Wells Highlight Broader Market Stress

Meanwhile, Texas regulators report a troubling increase in orphaned oil and gas wells, now surpassing 10,000 sites. Industry observers warn the number could grow as oil prices fall and small operators abandon unprofitable wells.

The surge raises environmental concerns, including methane leaks and groundwater contamination. It also threatens energy-sector employment in rural regions tied to Oklahoma’s southern border.

With the electric car market as big and important as it is now, President Mark Reuss, understandably, wishes GM weren’t so quick to lower the EV1 to its grave.","Ah, the EV1. General Motors’ electric moonshot of the late 1990s has become a legend, solidifying itself as the first modern EV for the masses, despite just a handful being leased to owners—several of whom were celebrities—before they were taken back by the company and mostly crushed.

The EV1’s tale is a fascinating one, with tons of data out there about how the car came to be, and all of the interesting ways engineers made it happen. I highly recommend reading David Tracy’s write-up on the EV1 factory service manuals he picked up last year, or our exclusive story on how there was nearly an EV1 convertible.

With just 137 horsepower from a single electric motor, 26 lead-acid batteries, and around 90 miles of range, the EV1 wasn’t exactly mind-blowing by modern EV standards. But it was vastly ahead of its time. This was a viable battery-powered car that hit the market over 10 years before the Tesla Roadster, after all. GM was way ahead of the game and in a position to set itself up for success in the decades to come.

Of course, everyone knows what happened next. Low demand and high costs forced GM to cancel the EV1 program, despite owners voicing their praise for the car. GM collected every example and crushed them, aside from around 40 cars, which were donated to museums and universities. It would be another decade until GM introduced another electric car to the market, the Spark EV, in 2013.

With the electric car market as big and important as it is now, President Mark Reuss, understandably, wishes GM weren’t so quick to lower the EV1 to its grave. When asked about what he’d change with hindsight in an interview with InsideEVs, he brings up the revolutionary EV almost immediately:

I wasn’t around for EV1; I wasn’t in the company. But I think that might have been one example of something that we, the company, should not have done, which was canceling that; that was really quite a car.

The EV1 was a game-changer for a lot of reasons. It introduced stuff like low-rolling-resistance tires, regenerative braking, HVAC heat pumps, and keyless ignition. Gen-two cars got nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, which doubled range, while third-generation cars got even longer-range lithium-polymer batteries. It also had a drag coefficient of just 0.19, beating out modern equivalents like the Lucid Air and the Mercedes-Benz EQS. While most other manufacturers hadn’t even figured out EVs, GM was already hundreds of steps ahead. Who knows just how far ahead the company would be now in the EV space had it stuck with developing the car further.

While Reuss believes the EV1 was a stopping point, others at the company believed it was a stepping stone. Gary Witzenburg, GM’s EV program Vehicle Test and Development manager during the EV1’s development, said as much in 2021 in a retelling of the car’s chaotic history, which he wrote for Hagerty:

The momentum the EV1 program generated led to fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) research; Allison hybrid buses; plus “two-mode” hybrid technology for trucks, SUVs, and two generations of extended-range electric (EREV) Chevrolet Volts. (Successful and satisfying as the Volts were, they were too costly to be profitable.) Now GM touts the battery-electric (BEV) Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV, with many more electric vehicles to come.

Witzenburg believed it was limited battery tech that held GM back from building the EV1’s successor in the early 2000s, rather than cost or demand. Whether you agree with him or not, Reuss seems to have learned from the past, going by the rest of that InsideEVs interview:

I think the strategy that we set a few years ago to grow our company with electric vehicles and ICE vehicles, and being able to manufacture some of those in the same place, like Spring Hill, Tennessee, and have cell plants in the United States located in the places we do. You can talk about adoption rate, you can talk about where we are today. But all I know is the adoption rate isn’t as quick as what we thought it was going to be.

The tax credit goes away, what’s going to happen? We’re going to see what happens. But I can tell you that a high percentage of people with buying a electric vehicle, for instance, buy another one. Yeah. So that’s a really good flywheel to be on, and a good trend that’s long term. And while the rate may fluctuate year to year in terms of how many, it’s permanent and it’s real. And I don’t I don’t see ever not being a big part of the U.S. auto industry.

So, despite the notion that EV sales will soon dip in America due to tariff costs and a lack of federal tax credits, don’t expect GM to give up on the tech any time soon.

However, the removal of the federal EV tax credit has forced Slate to jack up the truck’s estimated starting price, and it may also be shockingly expensive to lease, considering how few features you get.

While the company has yet to confirm a final price for the model, Cars Direct speculates that it could cost upwards of $500 per month. The outlet has come to this conclusion by estimating a $27,500 price tag, which, over a typical 36-month lease with no money down, could work out to be $468.

Add in the first month’s payment and an estimated acquisition fee of $700, and this will effectively jump to near $500 per month, before taxes and fees. Had the EV tax credit still been around, the equivalent price would drop to $341 a month, a hefty difference of $127.

However, it’s worth noting that actual lease prices for the truck may be different. The publication based its estimate on a money factor of 0.00292 or 7 percent APR and assumes a residual value of 55 percent.

This or a Ford Maverick?

If Slate Auto wants the back-to-basics EV to be successful, it’ll have to convince many shoppers to buy it instead of a Ford Maverick. It’s currently possible to lease a 2025 Maverick XLT AWD with the EcoBoost engine for as little as $289 per month over 36 months with $3,709 due at signing.

Admittedly, leasing a hybrid version of the Maverick is more expensive. Depending on location, the hybrid Mavericks generally start at around the $430 per month mark, and that usually doesn’t account for a hefty $3,000+ payment due at signing, bringing effective monthly payments to over $500.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Slate-EV-707-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 13:19:31.286967

U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico averaged 7.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in May 2025, the most of any month on record as Mexico’s demand for natural gas, particularly in the electric power sector, increases. On an annual basis, U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico averaged 6.4 Bcf/d in 2024, a 25% increase compared with 2019 and the highest on record in data going back as early as 1975.

Total consumption of natural gas in Mexico increased from 7.7 Bcf/d to 8.6 Bcf/d during the same time period, with most growth concentrated in Mexico’s electric power sector.

Natural gas exports from the United States enter Mexico along four main corridors—South Texas, West Texas, Arizona, and California—with a combined capacity of about 14.8 Bcf/d and an approximate utilization rate of 43% in 2024. Several factors limit U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico, including:

Constraints in Mexico's pipeline infrastructure, including new pipeline construction and permitting delays

Limited natural gas storage capacity in Mexico

In 2024, pipeline exports from West and South Texas collectively accounted for 91% of U.S. natural gas pipeline exports to Mexico. The South Texas corridor connects from the Agua Dulce Hub into northeastern Mexico. Natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas primarily serves northwestern, central, and southwestern Mexico through various natural gas systems in Mexico. Exports from West Texas increased from 0.6 Bcf/d in 2019 to 1.8 Bcf/d in 2024. The increase of U.S. imports was facilitated by the commissioning of additional connecting pipelines in central and southwestern Mexico in recent years.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration; Mexico Ministry of Energy, Hydrocarbon Map

Mexico plans to continue to expand its domestic pipeline network to meet potential growth in demand. Natural gas imported from the South Texas corridor through the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline has access to liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, power plants, and other uses of demand, and the pipeline connects with the Gasoducto Puerta al Sureste (Southeast Gateway Gas pipeline), an offshore pipeline completed in 2025 and designed to supply natural gas to new power plants in the Yucatan Peninsula. In 2022, sections of the Tula–Villa de Reyes and Tuxpan–Tula pipelines commenced partial operation, with full service anticipated in 2025. The Energia Mayakan pipeline is expected to expand natural gas infrastructure on the Yucatán Peninsula by 2025. Developers of the Centauro del Norte pipeline, which will provide additional pipeline capacity to northwestern Mexico's combined-cycle power plants, began construction in 2025.

LNG was first exported from Mexico in August 2024 from the Fast LNG Altamira Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) 1. Two additional LNG export projects, Fast LNG Altamira FLNG 2 and Energía Costa Azul, are currently under construction with a combined capacity of 0.6 Bcf/d, drawing supply from U.S. natural gas imports.

A leading developer and manufacturer of injection systems for the self-administration of liquid medicine, Ypsomed will invest $195.4 million to develop its chosen site in Wake County. From end of 2027 onwards, the new site in Holly Springs will supply products for the U.S. market.

Ypsomed is buying a 160,000-square-foot building, with an option for further expansion. The company initially plans to create around 100 new jobs, with the goal of expanding the workforce to about 200 as demand increases.

“Establishing our new production site in the United States marks an important step in Ypsomed’s global growth strategy. We have deliberately chosen Holly Springs, a location at the heart of our industry, close to our customers,” said Simon Michel, CEO of Ypsomed. “The cooperative approach of the local authorities, the excellent infrastructure, and the proximity to top-tier universities provide ideal conditions for our future growth. This environment will allow us to attract the skilled workforce we need and to further strengthen our position as a leading supplier of self-injection systems worldwide, while contributing to the security of supply for the U.S. healthcare market.”

“The self-injectable market is a quickly evolving and expanding market,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. “Welcoming a company like Ypsomed into our dynamic life sciences community is a tremendous win for Holly Springs, Wake County, North Carolina, and all the people Ypsomed continues to support through its innovative products.”

Electrolux Expanding In Lenoir County, NC

About one hour east of the Ypsomed site, Electrolux Consumer Products, Inc. is expanding its manufacturing capacity in Lenoir County, North Carolina. Planning a $23.7 million investment, the company will add 74 jobs as its Kinston dishwasher production facility and Manufacturing Center of Excellence for dish production in North America.

The Kinston location opened in 1989, manufacturing plastic tub dishwashers for the company’s North American market. This expansion will add 30,000 square feet to its existing footprint.

“This expansion is a testament to our commitment to U.S. manufacturing and our belief in the strength of the Kinston workforce,” said Ricardo Cons, President and CEO of Business Area North America for Electrolux Group. “We’re proud to continue investing in a community that has supported us for more than three decades, and to do so in North Carolina – a state with a pro-business climate that prioritizes and champions manufacturing.”

“Companies already operating in our state are some of the best recruiters,” said N.C. Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “When innovative manufacturers like Electrolux reinvest in North Carolina, it’s a powerful signal that our state is indeed the best place to do business in America because we are home to the largest manufacturing workforce in the Southeast, strong manufacturing partnerships, and a robust transportation system to help them get products to market faster.”

A performance-based grant of $200,000 from the One North Carolina Fund will help the company’s expansion in North Carolina. The OneNC Fund provides financial assistance to local governments to help attract economic investment and to create jobs.

Corning Fiber Optic Production Grows In Catawba County, NC

In the western part of the state, Corning Optical Communications LLC, a division of Corning Incorporated, will acquire a lot in Trivium Corporate Center to expand in Hickory in Catawba County. The company is growing its manufacturing operations there with plans to hire and maintain a minimum of 132 jobs at an average salary to exceed $65,000/year.

“With this capacity expansion, Corning is addressing demand from leading network operators — in particular AT&T, which previously announced plans to significantly expand its fiber footprint,” said Michael A. Bell, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Corning Optical Communications. “We believe the industry is in the early stages of a major growth cycle, and we’re turning once again to the highly skilled local workforce in Catawba County to help us meet the demand. We deeply appreciate the support of local and state officials, particularly Governor Roy Cooper, Commerce Secretary Machelle Baker Sanders, and state lawmakers.”

Corning’s Optical Communications business operates cable facilities throughout the state of North Carolina, including Hickory, Newton, and Winston-Salem, and optical fiber facilities in Wilmington and Concord. Its Optical Communications headquarters is in Charlotte.

Corning’s project will be facilitated by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee. Using a formula that takes into account the tax revenues generated by the new jobs, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $2,041,200, spread over 12 years.

Corning’s JDIG agreement could also move as much as $226,800 into a fund that helps rural communities across the state attract business in the future. When companies select a site located in a Tier 2 county such as Catawba, their grant agreements move some of the new tax revenue into the state’s Industrial Development Fund – Utility Account.

“And so while it is cost-effective in some cases to shift data center demand to renewables, sometimes this shifting of demand instead recruits more stable base-load fossil plants.

If coordinated properly, flexibility can encourage the use of and investment in renewables, cutting emissions while offering significant savings to the operators of data centers.
But without that coordination, we risk locking in more fossil generation instead of moving toward greener infrastructure.” Read the paper: Flexible data centers and the grid: lower costs, higher emissions?","What you’ll learn:

Data center flexibility — the ability to shift workloads to different times of day when renewable energy generation is high or prices are low — is one way to address rising energy consumption. A new study finds that flexibility always reduces costs. But the environmental effects depend on the local grid, with flexibility sometimes even increasing emissions.

Data centers in the U.S. consumed about 4.4% of all domestic electricity in 2023. The Department of Energy expects this number to rise to between 7% and 12% by 2030.

Much of this growth in data center electricity demand is being driven by artificial intelligence and cloud computing, according to a professor of applied economics at MIT Sloan. “These technologies are transformative, but they also put enormous stress on the grid,” he said. “That raises big questions about how we manage demand and whether our power systems can keep pace in ways that are both reliable and sustainable.”

With Juan Senga and Shen Wang, postdoctoral associates at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, Knittel analyzed how operational flexibility within data centers affects costs and emissions. They found that the flexibility to shift workload to different times of day when renewable energy generation is high or prices are low always reduces costs. The environmental effects, however, depend on the generational mix of the local grid, with flexibility sometimes even increasing emissions.

Flexibility cuts costs but not necessarily emissions

The researchers ran a model that compared three regional energy grids — the Texas grid, the mid-Atlantic grid, and the Western Interconnection — which together are projected to manage more than 80% of data center demand by 2030. They measured the economic and environmental effects of two factors: how far a center can shift workload within a 24-hour period, and what fraction of work can be shifted.

They found that flexible workloads universally create cost savings compared with grids that don’t support flexible workloads, with reductions ranging from about 2% in the Western Interconnection to 5% on the Texas grid. Cost savings can rise as the share of work that is flexible increases, though the approach has diminishing returns.

“At the start, it’s very easy to shift loads to times that have the cheapest energy generation, so there’s a lot of money on the table,” Senga said. “But as you use up those initial, cheap options, it gets harder to squeeze out benefits.”

On the environmental side, flexibility can lead to investment in renewable infrastructure: When demand shifts to times of day when renewables are active, the value of that infrastructure increases. Specifically, the researchers showed that flexibility can spur solar investment in the mid-Atlantic and the Western Interconnection while pushing wind investment in Texas. (These differences hinge on the relative abundance of wind and sun in each region.)

Yet flexibility does not always generate emissions reductions. In Texas, where wind and solar constitute roughly half of the grid’s projected energy mix, the researchers found that flexible workloads led to emissions reductions of up to 40%. In the other two regions, where coal and gas make up a greater share of the grid, flexible operations led to an increase in emissions of up to 3%.

“This happens because our model is optimizing for costs — meaning the number of investments that are made and how expensive it is to operate different types of generators, be it renewables, natural gas plants, coal plants, nuclear plants, you name it,” Senga said. “And so while it is cost-effective in some cases to shift data center demand to renewables, sometimes this shifting of demand instead recruits more stable base-load fossil plants. This just depends on the underlying economics of renewable and fossil generation.”

Incorporate flexibility from Day 1

This research implies that companies in the business of building data centers should design for flexibility from the outset, since it’s a guaranteed path to savings.

Some types of work are inherently more flexible than others — training AI models can be shifted around more readily than fielding AI queries, for instance. For that reason, flexible data center design may entail a concerted balancing of processes across data centers to maximize flexibility in each location by looking at the type of work that it does.

For companies that are also pursuing emissions reduction goals, flexibility is essential but insufficient on its own. The mix of regional electricity-generation sources and their underlying economics will ultimately determine whether flexibility generates environmental benefits.

“We don’t have a hard number, but in our simulated numerical results, we needed about 50% renewable penetration to see these lower emissions,” Wang said. “If you’re below that, then fossil generation is the dominant system and emissions may increase, even with more flexibility.”

With data centers projected to consume a growing percentage of electricity in coming years, companies and states may benefit from working together to manage demand, the researchers write. If coordinated properly, flexibility can encourage the use of and investment in renewables, cutting emissions while offering significant savings to the operators of data centers. But this result won’t unfold on its own.

“The lesson here is that flexibility has to be built into data center operations from the start, and it has to be paired with strong policy support for clean energy,” Knittel said. “If companies and policymakers work together, flexibility can reduce costs and also accelerate investment in renewables. But without that coordination, we risk locking in more fossil generation instead of moving toward greener infrastructure.”

New Jersey electric bills rose up to 20% this summer

Experts say PJM must act to modernize the state’s aging power grid

Data centers, EVs and clean energy goals are increasing electricity demand

Investing in new transmission lines could lower costs and boost reliability

This summer, many of us in New Jersey were stunned when we opened our electric bills and saw a huge increase. Starting June 1, the average monthly bill rose between 17% and 20%, depending on where you live in the state. That’s on top of the fact that New Jersey’s electricity rates are already about 20% higher than the national average.

When we sweat through these lingering heatwaves, we shouldn’t also have to sweat about our wallets.

There’s a clear reason for this price spike: our aging electric grid is struggling to keep up with today’s needs — let alone tomorrow’s demands.

If we want to stabilize prices, make sure the lights stay on, and meet our clean energy goals, we need to build a modern energy grid that can handle it all.

We’re still relying on an electric transmission system that was largely built more than 60 years ago. This aging infrastructure – which moves power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed – can only be patched and upgraded so much. While tools like Advanced Transmission Technologies and Grid-Enhancing Technologies can help squeeze more capacity out of existing lines, they are not a substitute for building new transmission infrastructure. To truly make a difference, we need new transmission built sooner rather than later.

That starts with PJM, the regional grid operator responsible for planning and managing the high-voltage transmission system across 13 states, including New Jersey.

A call to rise to the moment

PJM has significant authority over how electricity gets from where it’s generated to where it’s used in our homes, businesses, and critical facilities. But while other grid operators – such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator in the Midwest – are engaging in long-term, proactive planning that evaluates system-wide benefits, PJM continues to lag.

That delay has real consequences: it leaves our region more vulnerable to reliability issues and price spikes. We need PJM to rise to the moment.

That means robustly complying with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s new Order No. 1920, which directs regional grid operators to plan for the long-term needs of the electric system. It also means planning not just for today’s electricity needs, but for the wave of new power demand that is already arriving.

A troubling picture

Just look at the numbers. Data centers already consume 5% of New Jersey’s total electricity — a figure that’s expected to more than double by 2030. Hearings conducted by the state’s Legislative Oversight Committee earlier this year revealed that artificial intelligence data centers are placing unsustainable strain on our aging grid.

These facilities are enormously energy intensive. Add in the coming surge of electric vehicles, home and building electrification, and onshore manufacturing, the demand forecast paints a troubling picture: without action, we’re facing a future power crisis.

Investing in transmission doesn’t just improve reliability and support clean energy — it also saves money.

New Jersey also has some of the most ambitious clean energy goals in the country: 100% clean energy by 2035 and 11,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2040. Meeting these goals will require a grid that is capable of moving large amounts of clean power from where it’s generated – often far offshore or in more remote areas – to population centers. That won’t happen on its own.

Investing in transmission doesn’t just improve reliability and support clean energy — it also saves money. A recent report found that for every $1 invested in new transmission lines, customers like you and me receive between $3.80 and $4.70 in benefits.

Now’s the time to plan for the future

PJM is in a position of enormous influence. The choices its leadership makes in the months and years ahead will shape our electric system and our electricity bills for decades. If PJM doesn’t plan for the future now, New Jerseyans will pay the price.

That means cutting through red tape to speed up permitting and making bold investments in new transmission lines. New Jerseyans deserve lower energy bills, fewer blackouts, and a stronger foundation for clean energy and innovation. If we act now, we can protect customers, power our communities, and build a grid for everyone.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/10/Electric-Transformer.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 18:18:43.861463

The panel brought together leaders from across sectors, including Adonai Herrera-Martínez (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), Jiang Hao (China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute), Gauri Singh (International Renewable Energy Agency), Karen Westley (Ipieca), and keynote speaker Marco Lambertini (Nature Positive Initiative) and host Rachel Asante-Owusu, Senior Programme Coordinator for Energy Transition at IUCN.

Defining a Nature Positive Energy Transition

Panelists converged on a shared ambition: expanding renewable energy without eroding ecosystems or marginalising communities. For keynote speaker Marco Lambertini, “nature positive” means going beyond reducing harm—it means actively regenerating biodiversity. “Nature positive,” he said, “is about pursuing economic development that results in more nature, not less. It’s more ambitious than net zero, because nature can regenerate faster than the climate can recover.”

The conversation underscored how this ambition is being translated into measurable targets under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, adopted by 196 countries. Applying a stepwise mitigation hierarchy is central to this approach: renewable energy projects must avoid sensitive ecosystems and threatened species wherever possible, mitigate unavoidable impacts through careful planning, and restore and compensate where damage occurs to ensure net gains for biodiversity.

From Ambition to Action: Indicators, Policy, and Finance

Speakers stressed the urgent need for credible, practical indicators to track nature positive outcomes — similar to existing greenhouse gas protocols for climate. This would give governments, developers, and investors the clarity needed to align projects with biodiversity targets.

A major focus was on bridging policy and finance. “Aligning finance for biodiversity is more complex than for climate,” noted Adonai Herrera-Martínez. “We need clear guidance, blended finance, and safeguards to make nature positive projects financially viable.”

Panelists highlighted transmission infrastructure as a critical bottleneck: while solar and wind investments are increasing, underinvestment in smart grids could slow the transition.

People at the Centre

Cross-sector collaboration and stakeholder engagement emerged as key themes. Jiang Hao shared a hydropower case in China where community input and scientific research led to halting a project to protect rare species. “Without listening to communities,” he noted, “the energy transition cannot be sustainable.”

Karen Westley showcased Shell’s efforts to integrate biodiversity into operations — from methane reductions to Indigenous-led restoration projects — highlighting how corporate actors can be part of the solution.

Speakers also addressed regional disparities: projects in Africa face longer timelines and higher costs due to regulatory hurdles, while ministries of environment often remain side-lined. Participants called for breaking down silos between energy, environment, and finance ministries to improve coordination and reduce costs.

Dialogue, Innovation, and Enabling Environments

The conversation underscored the need to mainstream nature positive narratives in energy policy and project planning. This requires ongoing dialogue between governments, investors, communities, and technical experts — through platforms, forums, and assemblies.

Innovation — including AI and advanced monitoring technologies — was identified as a key enabler for better biodiversity measurement, while policy levers like procurement and traceability can help create market demand for nature positive solutions.

As Gauri Singh concluded: “The energy transition is the most important transformation humanity is living through today. We must make sure it doesn’t come at the expense of biodiversity and resilience.”

Next Steps: From Dialogue to Delivery

The session concluded with a strong call for collective action. Participants underscored the need to develop and launch clear guidance for the investment community on integrating biodiversity into renewable energy development, expected in 2026. Strengthened cross-sector policy dialogues will be crucial to bridge gaps between ministries and agencies, while global platforms will continue to share lessons and best practices to accelerate progress.",https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/nature-positive-renewables.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 13:01:20.078453

It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the 176-member state UN agency responsible for developing global standards for shipping, announced that its member states have voted to delay the adoption of the “IMO Net-Zero Framework,” a global agreement aimed at implementing measures to reduce the climate impact of ocean shipping.

The establishment of the international net zero shipping framework was delayed despite an initial draft receiving majority support in April, following significant pressure from the U.S.’ Trump administration, which had threatened a series of retaliatory actions against nations supporting the agreement.

Maritime shipping accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and are on track to roughly double by 2050 under most economic scenarios. Shipping emissions are also among the most difficult to address, with a need to develop and implement low emissions fuels, infrastructure and technologies in order to significantly reduce the sector’s climate footprint.

The draft framework included a series of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, including a global fuel standard, and the establishment of a global carbon pricing mechanism.

Under the framework, ships would be required to comply with a new global fuel standard to reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI) over time, with ships above the GFI thresholds required to balance their emissions deficit by transferring “surplus units” earned by other ships or used surplus units they may have already banked, or to purchase remedial units.

Proceeds from the sale of remedial units would contribute to an IMO Net-Zero Fund, rewarding low-emission ships, supporting innovation, research, infrastructure and just transition initiatives in developing countries, funding technology transfer and capacity building to support the IMO GHG Strategy, and mitigating negative impacts on vulnerable states.

The April framework was approved by 63 nations in April, while the U.S. publicly opposed the agreement and left the negotiations prior to the vote, following which the administration warned of “reciprocal measures” to compensate for any fees under the new framework charged to U.S. ships, and “for any other economic harm from any adopted GHG emissions measures.”

Prior to the beginning of negotiations to adopt the framework last week, the U.S. State Department issued a communication stating that “the Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO,” and detailing a series of actions that it would consider on nations supporting the framework, including “considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries,” imposing visa restrictions on crews, imposing commercial penalties and additional port fees, and “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers,” among other potential measures.

A motion to delay the negotiations on the framework by a year put forward by Singapore and tabled for a vote by Saudi Arabia was agreed to by 57 countries, and opposed by 49, with 21 abstaining.

Industry participants expressed disappointment with the delay, citing the uncertainty it will create in their emissions reduction initiatives and investments. In a statement following the announcement, shipping giant Maersk called the decision “a loss of momentum for the shipping industry’s efforts to decarbonize,” and that it now must “await further clarity on the road ahead and on how the IMO intends to continue the work on the Net Zero Framework.”

Maersk added:

“The energy transition of the shipping industry has never been an easy task. It requires action and support from the entire shipping ecosystem, including fuel producers, ship owners, regulators, and many more. Global regulations are a precondition to securing a level playing field in a global industry.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMO-Oct-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:10:36.672036

Sales in China, once a money-printing region for VW Group, have collapsed due to heightened competition from domestic models.
One of the more interesting bits Manager Magazin reports involves the launch plan for VW’s newest brand, Scout Motors.","I’m a pretty big fan of Volkswagen’s products, so whenever I hear about the company not doing well, it makes me sad. These days, I feel like this has been happening a lot.

According to a new report from German publication Manager Magazin, VW is in fairly dire straits financially right now. Net cash flow—or, how much money is left after taking away all costs—is reportedly falling to dangerously low levels, which is leading the company to make some tough cost-cutting decisions.

Those decisions lie with Arno Antlitz, VW Group’s chief financial officer. Manager Magazin reports that he’s assembled the CFOs from the conglomerate’s biggest brands to figure out how to turn things around. From the article:

CFO David Powels (63) was present for VW, Jürgen Rittersberger (53) for Audi, and Jochen Breckner (48) for Porsche. The group, not a popular topic within the company, was designated the “Net Cash Flow” Task Force.

Antlitz’s mission for the high-profile group caused unrest: According to those involved, the CFO demanded €12 billion in additional cash flow, and specifically for 2026. “This magnitude, so quickly; that’s never happened before,” commented one top executive. It’s a massive cost-cutting shock.

Things are looking even worse this year. Sales in China, once a money-printing region for VW Group, have collapsed due to heightened competition from domestic models. Going by deliveries, Audi is down nearly 5% globally through he first three quarters. Porsche, meanwhile, is down 6%. Even the company’s historically market-proof brands, Bentley and Lamborghini, are down slightly year-over-year. The VW brand itself, as well as Euro-centric brands Skoda, SEAT, and Cupra, are up slightly this year.

It’s not just China. The North American market isn’t helping either. Spiking prices due to tariffs and the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit mean sales are waning, with deliveries for the group down nearly 8% in the region this year so far. The result of all this, according to Manager Magazin, will be stuff like more platform-sharing:

For example, the next Audi A6 and the second generation of the Porsche Taycan could be based on a common architecture. Despite the models’ quite different profiles (a conventional premium sedan and a sports car), this would reduce costs.

One of the more interesting bits Manager Magazin reports involves the launch plan for VW’s newest brand, Scout Motors. The revived American nameplate that relaunched in 2022 plans to introduce an electric SUV and truck by 2027. Last year, the company revealed it would also offer its vehicles with a range extender option, which quickly became the most popular drivetrain amongst those placing pre-orders. Going by this article, it sounds like VW is smartly prioritizing those buyers:

[A]ccording to information from manager magazin, the Scout electric truck, intended as a promising prospect for North America, will initially only be available with a combustion engine as a range extender – and not as a purely battery-electric vehicle.

Scout declined to confirm to me whether this is its plan, but considering the state of the EV pickup truck market in the US right now, it makes the most sense. Even the most popular pure BEV trucks occupy a tiny niche of the market, so building the battery-powered Scouts first wouldn’t have moved the needle.

The range-extended Scouts, meanwhile, are a far more promising proposition. They pair a 60-to-70 kWh battery pack to a naturally aspirated four-cylinder mounted under the bed, just in front of the rear axle, there just to keep the battery charged. With a fully charged pack and a full tank of gas, Scout promises around 500 miles of range. Importantly, these range-extended Scouts can also tow long distances without drivers having to stress about topping off the battery at a charging station, something that a lot of buyers seem to care about, whether they’re actually towing stuff frequently or not.",https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Scout-Terra_Gas_TS.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:06:35.109867

Across the session, a clear consensus emerged: achieving global restoration goals requires shared learning, inclusive participation, and innovative approaches to policy, finance, and implementation.","The event, held in the IUCN Programme Pavilion, brought together a diverse group of speakers offering unique perspectives on restoration across scales. The session discussed topics ranging from the Target 2 under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to financial mechanisms and instruments for restoration, to social equity and rights-based approaches to restoration. Ultimately, the session recognised existing restoration successes while also highlighting remaining challenges and barriers faced by communities, as well as solutions for overcoming them. Speakers emphasized that ecosystem degradation and deforestation, driven by unsustainable human activity, continue to undermine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and adaptive capacity in the face of intensifying climate change. Restoration, they agreed, must be at the centre of solutions; linking environmental integrity, social inclusion, and economic opportunity.

Ecosystem degradation is a global threat affecting all habitat types. Current estimates indicate that 20% – 40% of the world’s land is degraded, harming the well-being of approximately 3.2 billion people. In recognition of these challenges, several global restoration goals have been established. Target 2 of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF) aims to ensure that 30% of the total area of degraded terrestrial, inland water, and marine and coastal ecosystems is under effective restoration by 2030.

Similarly, the Bonn Challenge aims to bring under restoration 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. Furthermore, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, lasting from 2021 through 2030, is a global movement aiming to support and scale up global restoration efforts while raising awareness of the importance of multi-scale restoration. Together, these rallying calls are driving global progress on restoration—but challenges and barriers remain.

Raising and Sustaining Ambition at the National Level

The session began with high-level remarks from H.E. Hambardzum Matevosyan, Minister of Environment of Armenia, where he discussed Armenia’s role as Presidency of the 17th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP17) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), set to take place in 2026. The Minister laid out Armenia’s commitment to advancing biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration and supporting the aims of the CBD under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KM-GBF), including Target 2. The Minister highlighted Armenia’s integrated approach to restoration as a cornerstone of its climate and sustainable development strategies, underscoring new afforestation and reforestation programs, improved forest data transparency, and stronger links between protection and restoration. The Minister’s intervention came just after the announcement of Armenia joining IUCN as a new State Member, concurrently highlighting Armenia’s commitment to raising ambition for nature.

Mr. Oliver Conz, Director General at Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUKN) followed with a keynote address, discussing Germany’s history of commitment to supporting restoration efforts globally. Mr. Conz reaffirmed Germany’s continued leadership and partnership through the Bonn Challenge, combining financial, technical, and policy support for restoration worldwide. “The Bonn Challenge promotes forest landscapes restoration as a key contribution to deliver on the 2030 goals of the Rio Conventions and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Bonn Challenge promotes synergies between climate protection and biodiversity conservation translating commitments into concrete action,” said Mr. Conz.

Leveraging Finance and Conventions to Amplify Impact

The session then transitioned to a panel where a diverse set of decisionmakers and stakeholders convened to share their unique perspectives on ecosystem restoration and progress towards global restoration goals, with institutional leaders and international partners expanding on the enabling conditions for large-scale restoration. Finance and inclusion emerged as recurring themes in need of urgent attention.

Valerie Hickey, Global Director, Climate Change Group at the World Bank began by setting the stage for discussion on financial mechanisms and instruments which can be leveraged to support restoration efforts across scales. Ms. Hickey noted that de-risking investment and addressing systemic barriers such as insecure land tenure, especially for women, are essential to unlocking private capital for restoration. Without finance being unlocked and directed to communities to support restoration and reward nature-positive practices, she emphasised, restoration goals cannot be met.

“Ecosystem restoration is key to the reversal of biodiversity loss – and central to achieving Target 2 and indeed the entirety of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework,” said Olivier Rukundo, Senior Programme Management Officer, Head of Peoples and Biodiversity Unit at the CBD Secretariat, underscoring the need to move beyond pledges and accelerate practical implementation toward the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’s Target 2. “To accelerate action on ecosystem restoration, in particular strengthening Parties to report on the headline indicator for Target 2, the CBD Secretariat, FAO and other partners have launched a global capacity-development programme, the ‘Target 2 Roadmap.’”

“For restoration efforts to be successful, we need to start with the people who live in the area in question. Gender equality and social inclusion are essential. This means recognizing and honouring the unique strengths, needs and challenges of women and men, jointly removing barriers to participation and ensuring that everyone can contribute their skills and knowledge and have their voice heard,” said Chantal Felder, Head of Section Climate, Disaster Risk Reduction and Environment, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC). Ms. Felder further emphasised the importance of local ownership, participatory processes, and gender equality, arguing that sustainable restoration begins with people and must deliver long-term benefits for communities.

“The restoration economy has the potential to bring jobs, economic development, health, social, biodiversity, climate and ecosystem services dividends in real ways. It bridges sectoral siloes and offers smart investment choices, but only if we get out of the conservation bubble for meaningful partnerships,” said Doreen Lynn Robinson, Deputy Director, Ecosystem Division at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), stressing that restoration must be embedded at the heart of development policy, aligning with economic and social frameworks to unlock the 'restoration economy' and its potential for equity, gender, and employment dividends.

Government, Civil Society, and Community Perspectives Intersect at the Heart of Restoration

Scientific, technical perspectives were also elevated. “To achieve restoration at scale, we must bridge science and practice. Evidence from landscapes around the world shows that restoration succeeds when local knowledge, strong data, economics and inclusive policies come together. Collaboration across disciplines and sectors is essential if we are to restore ecosystems that sustain both people and the planet,” said Dr. Robert Nasi, Director General, CIFOR and Director of Science, CIFOR-ICRAF, highlighting the need to apply behavioural and social sciences to better understand the drivers of degradation and make scientific knowledge actionable at local levels.

Several panellists stressed, however, that restoration goals cannot be achieved without integrating social equity concerns and gender-responsive approaches, nor without including smallholders and local community members who act as land stewards but who often are overlooked. “True restoration is not only of lands, waters and ecosystems,” said Mrinalini Rai, Director, Women4Biodiversity. “It is also the restoration of rights, recognition, and resources to women who sustain them. Financing gender-responsive, community-led restoration is not charity—it is an investment in resilience, justice, and the planet’s future.”

“Indigenous Peoples have restored their territories for generations and continue to do so. The objective of restoration should not be to respond to donors but more importantly to restore balance between man and nature,” said Minnie Degawan, Managing Director, FSC Indigenous Foundation (FSC-IF), underlining that Indigenous Peoples, women, and local communities are not only beneficiaries but essential knowledge-holders whose perspectives must guide planning, decision-making, and implementation.

Pedro de Castro Cunha e Menezes, Director of Protected Areas at the Ministry of Environment of Brazil and Raúl Jiménez Rosenberg, Executive Secretary of El Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad (CONABIO) of Mexico offered additional country perspectives, laying out successes from their countries as well as challenges they are working to overcome. Both Mr. Castro and Mr. Jimenez explained how restoration is being embedded in their countries’ national policies, from identifying priority sites and integrating restoration into planning frameworks to promoting research, innovation, and nature-based tourism through initiatives such as long-distance ecological trails. They then expanded on how other countries can learn from their experiences with ecosystem restoration, and they underscored why national and regional ambition are essential to achieving global goals.

The session ended with a virtual intervention from Richard Verbisky, Senior Advisor at Natural Resources Canada and Head of the International Model Forest Network (IMFN) Secretariat. IMFN is a voluntary global community of practice whose members and supporters work toward the sustainable management of forest‐based landscapes and natural resources through the Model Forest approach. Mr. Verbisky highlighted how partnership networks like IMFN can bridge the gap between the many dimensions outlined by other speakers—connecting local communities to global resources and enabling them to support progress towards national, regional, and global targets, while also ensuring restoration is locally-relevant and conscientious of equity and rights concerns. Mr. Verbisky’s full intervention is available to view below.

Across the session, a clear consensus emerged: achieving global restoration goals requires shared learning, inclusive participation, and innovative approaches to policy, finance, and implementation. Restoration is not only a technical or ecological imperative, but a human one—a pathway to resilience, equity, and renewed connection with nature.",https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/img_5232.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 13:01:37.859495

As a base for economic growth, the district ranks among the top in Texas for new energy projects, with Webb and Starr Counties leading the way in generation and development.

“I’ve always said that South Texas doesn’t have to choose between oil and gas and clean energy,” said Congressman Cuellar. “We can do both – and that’s exactly what we’re doing. Our district is producing more energy, creating more jobs, and generating more local tax revenue than ever before. This growth keeps costs down for every household in South Texas while ensuring reliable power for years to come.”

He continued, “When I talk with families in places like Laredo, Zapata, or Rio Grande City, I hear the same thing: people just want steady work, affordable energy, and a better future for their kids. That’s what these projects bring — not slogans, but results. They mean paychecks, progress, and pride for our communities.”

Powering Local Communities

Texas’ 28th District is home to 30 active clean energy projects, generating 3,548 megawatts (MW) of power across six counties — with 18 more projects planned that will add another 3,062 MW of new capacity in the coming years.

County Highlights:

Webb County: Over 1,800 MW of solar and wind power

Starr County: Over 1,000 MW of solar and wind power

Zapata County: Over 400 MW of solar and wind power

Bexar County: Over 100 MW of solar and wind power

Jim Hogg County: 78 MW of wind power

Guadalupe County: 4.9 MW of solar power

Investing in Reliability and Jobs

Construction is underway on new battery storage projects in Bexar, Webb, Atascosa, Guadalupe, Jim Hogg, and Zapata Counties, which will hold up to 2,375 MW of stored energy to make the grid more reliable. In addition, new solar farms in Atascosa, Webb, and Zapata Counties will soon bring another 686 MW of clean power online.

“These projects mean more than numbers on a page,” Cuellar said. “They mean a young technician in Jim Hogg County can build a career close to home. They mean that a small business owner in Zapata can keep her lights on when the grid is stressed. They mean that South Texas — our workers, our families, our values — are shaping the future of American energy.”

He added, “We’re proving that economic growth and environmental responsibility don’t have to be at odds. We’re showing the country that if you believe in hard work, innovation, and community — you can build something that lasts.”

That means a shift to electric bikes could boost local producers, foster startups, and attract new investment.
She added that ride-hailing fleets stand to gain too since they travel longer distances and electric bikes could help them save on fuel.","Hanoi, Vietnam — Vietnam is split between two visions: the rumbling, reliable gas-powered motorbikes that now rule the roads, and sleek, silent electric bikes the government says are its future.

Hanoi plans to ban fossil-fuel motorcycles from its city center in July 2026, part of a national drive to cut emissions and air pollution. Its commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, is weighing a similar step. By 2030, Vietnam aims for a third of cars and more than a fifth of motorbikes to run on electricity.

Some see this as an opportunity to swap out smoke-belching engines for cleaner, quieter rides, But others remain wary. Gas-powered bikes are still cheaper, sturdier, and easier to repair. Many owners worry that electric models could fall short on range, affordability, and charging convenience.

At the heart of the debate is the motorbike’s central place in Vietnamese life. The country’s 77 million two-wheelers — including 7 million in Hanoi and 8.5 million in Ho Chi Minh City — power small businesses, shape daily commerce, and set the rhythm of cities. Shopkeepers pile goods onto scooters to push through traffic, while families squeeze three generations onto a single bike for the school run.

While delivery drivers and mechanics are scrambling, electric bike start ups are opening new retail stores and e-bike sales are climbing.

Vietnam’s biggest motorbike makers, Honda and Yamaha, say the 2026 timeline is too ambitious. Vietnamese electric vehicle companies — startups like Dat Bike or the larger VinFast, backed by Vietnam’s largest conglomerate VinGroup — and the Chinese electric bikemaker Yadea are betting on an electric future.

Ta Manh Cuong, 45, a ride-hailing driver who earns about $20 on good days, calls his battered but reliable motorbike his “iron horse,” a slang riders use for their faithful companion through the city’s daily chaos. He'd be willing to shift to an electric bike, would even welcome it if it cost less.

“But right now I can’t afford to buy an electric bike,” he said.

Vietnam’s motorbike market, at about 3.5 million units a year, is the second-largest in Southeast Asia. It's also among the most electrified markets for two-wheelers, ranking third only to China and India, though electric motorbikes make up about 12% of total sales.

Electrifying remaining two-wheelers is key for cutting tailpipe emissions and clearing smog from the streets. EVs are more energy efficient than gas engines, said Zifei Yang of the International Council on Clean Transportation. About 70,000 deaths in Vietnam each year are linked to polluted air, according to the Boston-based nonprofit Health Effects Institute.

Unlike the car market, Yang added, motorbikes sold in Vietnam are made there. That means a shift to electric bikes could boost local producers, foster startups, and attract new investment. Vietnam’s transition could also shape other developing markets.

“These countries look at each other. Look at the experience,” she said.

Electric motorbike sales have surged since the ban was announced, with purchases of smaller bikes up 89% and full-sized bikes 197% in the first eight months of 2025. VinFast led as its sales more than quadrupled, outpacing Yadea and other local rivals, according to industry tracker MotorcyclesData.

Yang said government subsidies to scrap old motorbikes could help riders like Cuong. While better public transport in crowded city centers would also encourage the shift to electric vehicles. She added that ride-hailing fleets stand to gain too since they travel longer distances and electric bikes could help them save on fuel. Stations where riders can replace depleted batteries with a fully charged one instead of waiting for it to recharge would also help.

Yang said smaller batteries make home charging easier, battery costs are falling globally, and EVs are no more fire-prone than older vehicles, though such fires need special training and strict safety standards.

Ho Chi Minh City plans to replace 400,000 gasoline motorbikes with electric ones by 2028, starting with a 2026 ban on using gas bikes for ride-hailing and delivery. The city will offer low-interest loans, tax breaks and set up low-emission zones to curb pollution. In Hanoi, people affected by the ban can get $120 to $200 in subsidies to buy electric bikes worth at least $590, depending on income, and won’t have to pay new registration or license plate fees until 2030.

VinFast looks set to profit from the transition. Its ride-hailing company, Green SM, surpassed Singapore-based regional ride-hailing firm Grab in February to become the market leader in Vietnam. It soon will launch its first battery‑swapping electric motorbike, selling for about $760. It plans, also, to build 150,000 battery-swapping stations nationwide within three years.

VinFast is partnering with Vietnamese banks to offer low‑interest loans and subsidies to boost electric vehicle adoption, including covering up to 90% of costs and waiving registration fees.

These policies and incentives can encourage more purchases of electric motorbikes, said Dat Bike CEO and founder Son Nguyen, but long-term success hinges on making electric bikes that deliver high performance, long ranges and fast charging at prices equal to or better than gas-guzzling motorbikes. “Incentives can help add momentum, but long-term success depends on building products that win on their own merits,” he said.

Dat Bike raised $22 million in September from private investors, nearly doubling its capital to $47 million. The company said it will use the funding to boost production, research and expand its sales.

Honda dominates Vietnam’s motorcycle market with a more than 80% market share. It sold about 2.3 million bikes in Vietnam from April 2024 to March 2025 and exported 300,000 more, cementing the country as both a top market and a key production hub.

Yamaha trails with about a 17% share. Through Vietnam’s manufacturers’ association, the two companies said the 2026 ban is too rushed. Honda only began selling e-bikes this year and warned that replacing millions of bikes quickly would strain consumers.

Honda and the Vietnam's motorcycle manufacturers' association didn't respond to requests for comment. Yamaha told The Associated Press that it was reviewing the plan and couldn't respond yet.

For now, many businesses are hedging their bets. Bao Ngoc Cao, who rents motorbikes to expats and tourists, said she was “terrified” when she first heard about the ban. Her business runs on the principle that bikes are cheap — costing about $80 monthly. Losing access to Hanoi’s most touristy streets would cut her off from her core customers, and while interest in EVs is growing, current subsidies aren’t nearly enough for her to replace her fleet. Still, she says she supports the ban in principle, welcoming the promise of cleaner air and healthier streets.

“We are just waiting to get more clarity and see what happens,” she said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/20/PDTN/86800524007-ap-25291606448912.jpg?crop=4999,2812,x0,y260&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-20 12:11:50.344258

Regulation is fast becoming the choke point not just for growth in energy use, but for growth in productive intelligence.","Artificial intelligence doesn’t run on optimism or buzzwords. It runs on electricity. This seems to be a growing concern as the technology advances, with outlets from Teen Vogue and Wired to the Washington Post and Harvard Business Review publishing articles about AI’s alarming energy and water consumption. The previous AI doomerism now seems to be focused less on AI’s application and more on its use of resources. However, there should be a case for optimism on both energy policy and technology policy regarding this issue.

Rather than immediately rushing to fit these growing energy demands into our existing policy frameworks, AI can provide an opportunity to rethink our static models and mental frameworks around energy. Such rethinking provides opportunities for dynamic growth in both technological innovation and energy. If the United States wants to lead the world in AI, policymakers must abandon the illusion that a centrally planned grid can power a decentralized technological revolution. Energy abundance and technological progress thrive when they are built on the same foundation: an open-ended market process with less government intervention.

Understanding AI’s Energy Demands and Society’s Accompanying Panic

AI is already reshaping electricity demand in ways the traditional system wasn’t designed to handle. After two decades of essentially no growth in electricity demand, US data centers could consume 6.7 to 12 percent of America’s electricity in just three years, up from 4.4 percent today. McKinsey estimates this surge will add about 460 terawatt-hours of demand between 2023 and 2030—roughly tripling current levels of electricity consumption by data centers. The scale and speed of data center growth highlight a fundamental mismatch: AI-driven demand is accelerating far faster than the legacy grid can accommodate.

But AI’s energy demands are far more complicated and part of a long-standing tradition of concerns about energy depletion in the face of new technologies. A 1999 Forbes headline, for example, discussed the need to “dig more coal, the PCs are coming” and noted the “electric load of a small village” the large servers needed. The original industrial revolution was met with The Coal Paradox and fears that the world’s coal supply would be exhausted.

But what actually happened in all of these cases? We found new sources of energy and improved our efficiency in the use of existing resources to power our growing and changing needs.

AI’s energy use is also more complicated than it may seem. For example, some of the significant elements of AI, like training a model, are one-time costs. In other cases, there are questions about what the alternative energy consumption would have been, such as doing repeated searches or longer processes that would also draw on energy resources. And as Daniel Castro’s report on the models that have predicted the demands and concerns of AI’s energy use shows, there is at least some reason to believe the current numbers might be inflated.

What AI Needs from the Energy Sector

Energy policy will be a needed element of our AI infrastructure if we want to continue to see this technology grow and flourish in many beneficial ways. The rapid pace of innovation means the AI revolution won’t wait for multi-year permitting fights, cost-of-service hearings held by regulators, or planning processes built for the analog era. And yet those are the structures that still govern electricity in much of the country.

Building a new transmission line in the US now takes about 10 years, while generation projects spend multiple years stuck in interconnection queues, with more than 2,600 gigawatts of capacity now in queues nationwide. America is trying to power a permission-less innovation boom in AI with an agonizingly slow, permission-first utility regime, and the results are predictably bad.

Market participants are already trying to solve the mismatch. Major firms are seeking direct power purchase agreements with independent generators, building behind-the-meter capacity, exploring private microgrids, and even considering small-scale nuclear partnerships when the technology matures. These efforts aren’t futurist gambits—they are attempts to work around today’s regulatory regime, which assumes electricity is something the government must gatekeep rather than something people can freely build and buy.

But unfortunately, many of these ideas can run up against existing regulatory barriers or significant requirements. (Ironically, in some cases, AI would be able to help with these requirements, such as reviewing environmental impact analysis or other paperwork steps to allow new solutions.) For policymakers who want to support unleashing American energy and innovation, the AI moment may provide a perfect opportunity for reform.

Tangible Policy Reforms

State policymakers have shown how simple reform can be. In August, New Hampshire enacted a one-page law that exempts off-grid electricity providers from public utility regulation. The logic is straightforward: if you’re not using or impacting the legacy grid, you shouldn’t have to ask legacy regulators for permission. We call this policy Consumer Regulated Electricity, or CRE. Similar reforms have already moved forward in Ohio, Utah, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

That makes room for industrial-scale networks, development that is consumer-driven rather than regulator-approved, and tailored contracts between energy producers and large customers. Responsibility for any cost overruns stays with the parties involved, rather than being socialized across captive ratepayers.

It is an open question whether a new federal law could enact CRE nationwide in one fell swoop, but there are immediate steps federal policymakers could take to embrace the same hands-off approach. As one example, if a new industrial network is not connected to the existing bulk power system, grid reliability watchdogs at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation should exempt it from the stringent rules that apply to the broader synchronized grid. This could be done by FERC through a rulemaking or by Congress through a simple definitional change in section 215 of the Federal Power Act.

Unlike burdensome top-down regulation focused on AI’s application, reforming energy policy can provide a way for policymakers at all levels to provide an infrastructure that could power AI innovation without dictating its applications or limits.

Why It Matters

In addition to practical policy issues, there is a philosophical debate beneath the surface. Progress does not come from central planning. It comes from exploration, the process of trial and error, and dynamic adaptation to changing circumstances. In a recent issue of Free Society, Johan Norberg argued that abundance tends to arise from unplanned, bottom-up problem-solving—not from central blueprints.

This year’s Nobel Prize in economics underscores the importance of innovation, knowledge systems, and openness to disruption. The laureates demonstrated how growth and long-run prosperity emerge when markets allow talent, ideas, and capital to move freely. Their research confirms what experience has already shown: we don’t get growth from planned economies. We get it by allowing discovery and competition, by embracing the open-ended market process. Regulations that restrict entry or stifle entrepreneurs may create stability in the short run, but they suffocate progress in the long run.

Energy and AI are no exceptions. In too many parts of the country, electricity policy is still built around forecasting demand, rationing supply, and approving projects through multi-year regulatory battles. AI and the industries emerging around it are growing quickly through trial and error, experimentation, and iteration. These worldviews were bound to collide. The notable exception is in the state of Texas, where the electricity system is dynamic and seems uniquely capable of accommodating the massive demand growth from data centers. But even the grid in Texas falls under heavy regulation and could benefit from Texas lawmakers adopting a true free-market approach like CRE.

Policymakers often claim they are acting out of caution when they slow or block new technology, but history tells a different story. The greatest risks come not from moving too quickly, but from freezing existing systems in place and assuming yesterday’s institutions can meet tomorrow’s needs. Overly cautious policies don’t signal a system preparing for the future; they signal that policymakers are afraid of it. Today’s obstructionism comes from local pushback on data centers and federal permitting regimes that stretch project timelines to a decade or more. Regulation is fast becoming the choke point not just for growth in energy use, but for growth in productive intelligence.

Conclusion

History shows that our fears of new technologies leading us to run out of energy are nothing new. Instead of further miring us in the status quo, AI could disrupt the way we approach energy policy. The ideas discussed above would allow policymakers to embrace the ways a free market can help meet AI’s electricity needs and unlock the broader economic transformation it represents.

In the sclerotic electricity sector, smart reform means a radical return to the American idea by legalizing alternatives to monopoly control, clearing government obstacles, and allowing price signals to guide investment. Intelligent power will not come from a permission-first system run by bureaucrats—it will come from the open-ended market process that runs on free enterprise and entrepreneurship.

“I am relieved that the Judge upheld our concerns with Commonwealth LNG, and that LDENR failed the people of Cameron Parish.
My hat is off to the local district court for this unbiased decision to hopefully protect the citizens and save a piece of God’s country in Cameron Parish.”","A wave of planned U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects is perceived to be under scrutiny in the aftermath of a recent court ruling, which revoked a permit for an LNG export terminal over alleged climate harms. This decision is anticipated to halt the project’s construction activities on the west bank of the Calcasieu Ship Channel at the mouth of the Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico) near Cameron Parish in Louisiana, United States.

Based on the court’s findings, the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR) violated the Louisiana Constitution by issuing the coastal use permit for the proposed Commonwealth LNG export facility without considering its disproportionate effect on the surrounding communities of color and low-income communities, alongside the climate change and cumulative impacts, with other export facilities in the area.

Eric Huber, Managing Attorney at Sierra Club, commented: “We are heartened by the court’s ruling that LDENR’s refusal to consider the environmental justice impacts of the project violated the Louisiana Constitution. It is past time for LDENR to account for the true costs of its permits on Louisiana’s coastline and communities in terms of loss of wetlands and storm buffers.

“This is another in a series of permits by LDNR for the LNG build-out on the Gulf, including the permit for CP2 directly across Calcasieu Pass. We urge LDENR to stop its pro-forma permitting and carry out its mission to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans.”

With this in mind, a Louisiana state court vacated the coastal use permit for the proposed export project, highlighting that state officials failed to consider the environmental implications of the development. Commonwealth LNG, which is controlled by the energy-focused alternative investment manager Kimmeridge, has secured multiple LNG offtake deals, including the most recent one with EQT.

James Hiatt, Director of For a Better Bayou, said: “This ruling is a victory for the people and the wetlands of Southwest Louisiana. It shows that when our government fails to protect our coast from reckless industrial expansion, the courts can still uphold the law.

“For too long, communities like ours have carried the burden of pollution, flooding, and destruction while corporations profit. This decision is a reminder that our coast is not a sacrifice zone—it’s our home, and it deserves protection.”

Climate change campaigners believe that Commonwealth LNG would permanently destroy over 75 acres of wetlands in the Calcesieu Pass area, and alter hundreds more, adding to the already permanent alteration of over 500 acres of wetlands approved for just two of the neighboring coastal LNG projects.

Joanie Steinhaus, Ocean Program Director for Turtle Island Restoration Network, emphasized: “This is an area of the Louisiana coastline that is being devastated by LNG facilities. These agencies have long ignored the cumulative impact to air and water quality and the health of the local community members and the environment.”

This is not Commonwealth LNG’s first brush with the law, as a three judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authorization for the same project in July 2024, ruling that FERC failed to adequately assess the cumulative and direct environmental and health impacts that would be caused by air pollution from the facility.

The decision caused FERC to revise its air pollution analysis and give the project the go-ahead to begin site preparation for construction. However, the Cameron Parish court’s decision has now revoked the state coastal use permit, which is anticipated to stop the project’s construction unless and until a new permit is issued in compliance with the Louisiana Constitution.

Anne Rolfes, Director of Louisiana Bucket Brigade, underlined: “Like the rest of the gas export industry, Commonwealth would be a polluting disaster that would destroy fragile fishing areas and further decimate fishing families in southwest Louisiana. It should never have been permitted. We hope this ruling shakes Louisiana to its senses.

“On one side are out of state profiteers who export our natural resources and pollute us in the process. On the other are Louisiana families who want to be able to live here and catch and eat our seafood. Commonwealth would destroy our coast and our culture. It would make us more vulnerable to storms. The coastal use permit needs to be revoked.”

Sierra Club claims that the liquefied methane gas, known as LNG, which the project would export, would have annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 14 coal-fired power plants or 13 million new gasoline-powered vehicles.

With six LNG export terminals proposed, approved, under construction, or operating in the area, including Venture Global’s Calcesieu Pass and CP2 facilities, energy analysts believe that there is a risk the latest court ruling could impact other LNG development and expansion projects.

According to Sierra Club, these facilities contribute to the loss of hundreds of acres of wetland and habitat for sensitive species, increased flooding, loss of buffer areas from storms, air and water pollution, and increased risks of catastrophic industrial accidents.

John Allaire, Resident of Cameron Parish, stated: “As a long-term landowner in Cameron Parish who lives adjacent to the Commonwealth LNG site and one mile from Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG, I see the effects of LNG export terminals every day— the frequent flaring, the noise and light pollution, and destruction of our wetlands and fisheries. It’s a massive burden and destroying our community.

“I am relieved that the Judge upheld our concerns with Commonwealth LNG, and that LDENR failed the people of Cameron Parish. My hat is off to the local district court for this unbiased decision to hopefully protect the citizens and save a piece of God’s country in Cameron Parish.”",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/10174305/Commonwealth-LNG-facility-in-Louisiana-1024x576-1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1744299785,N,,2025-10-20 11:29:42.373639

“But that is where we are as a state.” As large data centers consider moving to Missouri, they are asking for unprecedented amounts of energy.
“Not just a data center, it could be any economic development project that we're talking to, that still is our No.
The company’s leaders have said they want to both protect existing customers and attract data centers to the region.
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a letter to Ameren CEO Lyons on Wednesday demanding information about utility bill increases and data center costs.","The director of the Missouri Department of Economic Development flipped through a slideshow at an October meeting about the future of power in the state. She landed on a slide showing large business projects the department is trying to attract to Missouri.

“I think this is the money slide, right?” said Michelle Hataway.

The slide displayed 10 data centers that the office is courting. Their peak electric demands were huge, reaching as high as 2,000MW, which is almost the entire output of Ameren Missouri’s largest power plant, the Labadie coal plant in Franklin County. In 2024, the largest single Ameren customer had a peak demand of 32MW.

“If you would have told me, whenever I became director of the department, that for an entire year I would be going around talking about power and the importance of power, I would have rolled my eyes and told you you're crazy, right?” Hataway said. “But that is where we are as a state.”

As large data centers consider moving to Missouri, they are asking for unprecedented amounts of energy. At the October summit, state policymakers and business leaders discussed how they would meet the demand.

Gov. Mike Kehoe urged the attendees to figure it out, saying energy is the most important factor for growing Missouri’s economy.

“Not just a data center, it could be any economic development project that we're talking to, that still is our No. 1 question, ‘What can you do for me for reliable base load power?’” Kehoe said. “And so I implore upon you to help us move that ball down the field.”

But with the data center-driven push for more electricity, experts say there is a real risk that regular people will see their electric bills skyrocket because the decades-long precedent for how monopoly utilities make money wasn’t built for customers that are potentially 60 times larger than the current biggest energy consumer on a system.

Incentives to build

The data center boom is particularly enticing for monopoly utility companies because they make money by building things, said Ari Peskoe, director of the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard Law School and co-author of the paper “Extracting Profits from the Public: How Utility Ratepayers Are Paying for Big Tech’s Power.”

“Utilities have a peculiar business model where their profits are tied to how much money they spend on physical infrastructure,” Peskoe said. “So the more power lines and power plants they build, the more profitable they are.”

A single data center can use as much power as a large city, which Peskoe said means utilities will need to build a lot of new, expensive infrastructure.

On top of that, Peskoe said investor-owned utilities like Ameren Missouri have an incentive to tell shareholders they are going to be building soon, and thus bringing in more profits.

“Ameren is a for-profit company,” Peskoe said. “It has a stock that trades on a stock exchange, and some of the information that it puts out is designed for investors and potential investors.”

In its Aug. 1 call with investors, Ameren said that it had a “robust data center pipeline” and that its sales growth in the coming years would be primarily driven by increased data center demand.

Ameren said it had about 2,300MW of signed construction agreements with data centers, and previous public filings by the company said those agreements represented five projects. The company’s CEO, Marty Lyons, also said these prospective customers have already paid Ameren millions of dollars.

“These developers have demonstrated their confidence in and commitment to their potential projects by submitting nonrefundable payments totaling $28 million towards the cost of necessary transmission upgrades,” Lyons said.

The company would need to quickly accelerate the building of power plants for new customers, Lyons said.

Along with a business model that incentivizes construction, utility companies like Ameren also typically spread the cost of building power plants and other infrastructure out among all customers through rate increases, Peskoe said.

“So in effect, utility profits go up, and everybody's bills go up as well,” Peskoe said.

Risk of overbuilding

Peskoe also said a huge risk is that utilities will build power plants for data centers that don’t move to their areas.

“There's a possibility that we're in a bubble right now, and if the utilities do build out a lot of new infrastructure, and the data centers never show up or they use less power, the utilities may very well go to regulators and say, ‘We want everyone else to pay for this infrastructure that we thought was going to be paid at least in part by the data centers,’” Peskoe said.

As these companies shop for a location, they are talking to multiple utilities in various states, which presents the risk that the projects are being double-counted in energy planning. The Sierra Club found more than 700GW of data center claims from U.S. utilities, which would represent more energy than the entire country produced in 2024.

At the October energy summit, multiple speakers said Missouri is competing with other states to win data center contracts. During a question and answer session, Hataway, the director of economic development, was asked if this might represent a bubble that would burst.

“Honestly, everything is cyclical, right?” Hataway said. “So I'm not going to sit here and tell you guys that there's not going to be potentially a boom with regards to data centers, right, and the bubble burst, right?”

But she said the size of investment from the companies signaled long-term commitments.

“I would ask, do we want to take advantage of the opportunity as it's happening?” Hataway said. “I'm not saying we have to take advantage of 100 data centers that are looking at Missouri, but do we be extremely picky?”

Protecting other customers

One way to keep regular people from paying for data center infrastructure is by designing special rates, called tariffs, for the huge customers, Peskoe said. There is a movement to do that across the country.

Missouri’s legislature passed a law this year that requires utilities to write tariffs for customers demanding 100MW or more of energy.

“That's a good step to kind of isolate these data centers from everybody else,” Peskoe said. “But the devil really is in the details.”

Ameren has written its proposal for these rates and submitted it to the Public Service Commission, which regulates monopoly utilities in Missouri. The company’s leaders have said they want to both protect existing customers and attract data centers to the region.

“We're going to do everything that we possibly can to reasonably ensure that these customers are paying their fair share, and that we're not unjustly passing costs on to other customers,” Rob Dixon, Ameren’s senior director for economic, community and business development, told St. Louis Public Radio in August.

At the October energy summit in Missouri, Ameren’s senior vice president who oversees data center customers, Ajay Arora, said the company is focused on making sure everyone is paying a representative share and the most vulnerable customers are protected from data center costs.

“We just have to make sure that we allocate capital in the most optimal manner to find the exact places which have the most value to customers,” Arora said. “And that's what we do, while also ensuring that we're negotiating hard, we're planning the supply chain, we're ensuring we're keeping costs low for customers, but most importantly, that we are keeping the operating and maintaining costs as low as possible.”

On the August earnings call, Ameren CEO Lyons also said the construction of data centers and more energy infrastructure will benefit everyone by creating jobs and tax revenue that support the local economy.

“To realize this opportunity, we must also offer attractive rates,” Lyons said.

In the initial proposal for data center tariffs, Ameren laid out a base rate of $0.06 per kWh, which is similar to the bulk rate other industrial customers currently pay. Residential customers pay $0.16 per kWh in the summer.

Ameren’s proposal for data center customers also includes terms to try to isolate costs and prevent overbuilding, like a minimum 15 years of service, exit terms and fees, a minimum energy use of 70% of what the data center asked for, and credit or collateral requirements.

While Peskoe said these tariffs are common sense, nailing down rates is always a contested process that is ultimately up to Missouri’s Public Service Commission.

“There's a lot of calculations that are going to go into determining what the rate structure ought to be,” Peskoe said. “And this is not a physics problem that ultimately has a single right answer.”

And Peskoe said it will be difficult to know the actual amount data centers might add to regular people’s bills.

“There's a long history in this industry of hiding a lot of information from the public about the utilities future plans and about how it computes its rates, and it's going to be challenging to figure out exactly how much costs these facilities are adding to rate payer bills,” Peskoe said.

In September, Missouri Public Service Commission staff called on the body to reject Ameren’s data center proposal. They calculated that a single 100MW data center would raise the bills of existing Ameren customers by about $22 million every year until the data center’s new load was accounted for in a rate case. An Ameren spokesperson said the company disagrees with the staff’s position.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent a letter to Ameren CEO Lyons on Wednesday demanding information about utility bill increases and data center costs.

“Missourians deserve affordable and reliable electricity,” Hawley wrote. “They should not be forced to subsidize corporate projects while struggling to keep their lights on.”

Ameren expects a decision about its data center rates from the Public Service Commission by February.

Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the plan “will give workers the skills needed for the switch to clean energy – good for them, good for industry, and good for growth across the nation.”

The document also introduces binding labour standards to ensure that the expansion of renewable energy creates high-quality, secure employment. Employment protections currently enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers —including the national minimum wage— will be extended to the entire clean energy sector, while a Fair Work Charter will be signed between offshore wind developers and trade unions to guarantee decent pay and robust workplace rights. The Government also acknowledged the need to strengthen union representation —which has fallen from 70 per cent in the 1990s to around 30 per cent today— describing trade unions as “essential to ensuring good pay and fair conditions.”

Since July 2024, the Government estimates that its clean energy mission has mobilised more than £50 billion in private investment, supporting projects such as the Sizewell C nuclear plant, which will create 10,000 construction jobs; the Rolls-Royce Small Modular Reactor programme, expected to support 3,000 jobs; and the Acorn and Viking projects in Scotland and the North East, set to add 35,000 jobs including 1,000 apprenticeships. An additional 4,000 positions will arise from new carbon capture and storage (CCUS) projects in the North West and Teesside.

The salary impact is equally significant: entry-level roles in the clean energy sector pay around 23 per cent more than comparable positions in other industries, while jobs in wind, nuclear and electricity networks offer average annual salaries of £50,000, compared with the UK average of £37,000.

The plan’s publication was welcomed by leading companies —including Centrica, ScottishPower, EDF, Siemens Energy, E.ON, Uniper, National Grid, Renewable UK and Energy UK— which agreed that the strategy provides the regulatory certainty needed to invest in talent, innovation and industrial expansion. “Clean energy is not only about technology but about purpose —renewing the skills and infrastructure that have served us for decades to power the next chapter,” said Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica. Keith Anderson, CEO of ScottishPower, added: “With clear direction, we are creating thousands of well-paid jobs in the communities we serve.”

Major trade unions —TUC, Unite, GMB, UNISON, Prospect and Community— also endorsed the plan, highlighting its inclusion of fair-work principles and collective bargaining rights as foundations for a just transition. “This plan puts workers at the heart of our energy system and proves that when government, unions and employees collaborate, the whole country benefits,” said Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC.

The Clean Energy Jobs Plan thus stands as the social pillar of the UK’s energy strategy. Beyond megawatts and technology, it seeks to consolidate a transition that creates genuine opportunities for economic and regional development, particularly in coastal and post-industrial areas. As Miliband concluded, “The clean energy mission is not only about energy security —it’s about good jobs and a nation renewed from the ground up.”",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Default-Social-Share-Image-v2.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:18.720891

The utility giant, currently valued at $59.6 billion, has demonstrated strong momentum with a 30.4% return over the past six months and has maintained dividend payments for 28 consecutive years.

The upgrade follows Sempra’s September announcement regarding its SIP Sale, which Barclays views as marking the company’s transition toward focused U.S. utility growth. The firm expects Sempra to target 95% utility earnings contribution starting in 2027. According to InvestingPro, three analysts have recently revised their earnings upward for the upcoming period, supporting this positive outlook.

Barclays cited recent stock underperformance as creating an attractive entry point for investors to gain exposure to the Oncor asset, which has 14-15% RAB growth. The investment bank projects that Texas will represent approximately 60% of Sempra’s asset base by the end of the decade.

The firm’s EPS estimates for 2026-2028 are ""well-north of consensus,"" putting Sempra above the high end of its 7-9% EPS outlook and back within its prior 6-8% range by 2027, based on 2024 estimated earnings of $4.75.

At a 15.5x P/E ratio, representing a 10% discount to large cap electric and gas utilities, Barclays considers Sempra shares undervalued given the company’s EPS trajectory, high rate base growth, no expected equity issuance in the next few years, and increased earnings mix toward higher multiple, lower risk Texas assets.

Launching the West Midlands Major Investments Prospectus the Mayor presented more than £19bn of opportunities to drive new growth, jobs and homes across the region.

And he invited investors to share in the region’s future success with exciting opportunities across infrastructure, regeneration, and world-leading sectors.

The Prospectus showcases some of the region’s biggest projects including the £4bn Sports Quarter with its new Birmingham City FC stadium, the Sandwell – Dudley Metro Corridor and the region’s three key Investment Zone sites in Coventry & Warwick, Wolverhampton and Birmingham.

The Prospectus builds on the Mayor’s Growth Plan, a blueprint for how the region will grow its economy by £17 billion over the next decade, creating 100,000 new jobs and 120,000 new homes.

Richard Parker, Mayor of the West Midlands, said: “Our region is brimming with talent: We have brilliant people, globally renowned businesses and world-class universities. Yet there is so much more potential waiting to be released.

“This Prospectus shows the sheer scale of what’s happening across our region, offering investors the opportunity to be at the forefront of driving a new era of growth, good jobs and affordable homes – the things that really matter to people.

“We have a proud history of innovation and industry but now is the time to go further and faster than ever before. Now is the time to invest in the West Midlands.”

Several Birmingham schemes set out in the prospectus will benefit from a new Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC), the biggest and most ambitious of its kind in the UK.

They include the Sports Quarter, the £4 billion Birmingham Knowledge Quarter, the HS2 station at Curzon Street, the £1.9 billion Smithfield development, and a major creative industries hub in Digbeth - all part of the Birmingham and North Solihull Gateway Project.

The MDC will give investors speed, scale and certainty, helping to deliver major schemes more quickly by bringing together planning powers, land, funding and delivery under one roof, cutting bureaucracy.

The Prospectus will play a key role for the region when the Mayor joins Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Secretary of State for Business and Trade Peter Kyle, in co-hosting the Regional Investment Summit in Birmingham tomorrow (Tuesday October 21).

The Summit will give the West Midlands and other regions the chance to showcase to global investors their potential for growth, innovation, and talent.

The West Midlands has seen a wave of inward investment over recent years and is now home to the country’s largest advanced manufacturing base and fastest-growing tech sector outside London. It also boasts world-leading clusters in clean energy, health tech and professional services.

Leading economist Bridget Rosewell CBE, who has been appointed by the Mayor to provide independent advice on aligning the region’s capital investments with his Growth Plan, said: “The West Midlands is a modern economic powerhouse with world leading sectors and an ambition and capacity to match.

“The Mayor’s Growth Plan provides us with a clear route to sustained growth. By bringing together transport, commercial development and housing in an aligned approach we can create dynamic new places, strengthen communities and give investors clarity on what’s coming, where and when.

“This is about crowding in private sector investment, sequencing schemes intelligently and moving from plan to spades in the ground with speed and confidence.”

The Prospectus showcases regional strengths and highlights investment opportunities underpinned by more than £2.4bn of new transport infrastructure to provide fast, reliable connections across the region.

On October 9, 2025, the U.S. Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year (FY) 2026 (Senate NDAA). The NDAA is annual legislation that authorizes policies and authorities for Department of Defense (DOD) programs and activities, military construction, and national security programs of the Department of Energy (DOE). While the NDAA focuses mostly on defense-related activities, this can include policy impacting the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), critical mineral supply chains, and nuclear energy. The House passed its version last month. The conference process between the Senate and House armed services committees will now kick off.

Below are some of the notable provisions in the roughly $914 billion defense legislation impacting environmental and natural resource policies, most of which are not included in the House version.

NEPA

Section 311 of the Senate NDAA requires the DOD to overhaul its existing guidance for implementing NEPA. Within 120 days of the bill's enactment, the Secretary of Defense must rescind all current NEPA-related directives and issue a new, unified directive applicable across all military departments and DOD agencies.

This new directive must ensure full compliance with NEPA, including updated procedural requirements established in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. Additionally, within 90 days, the Secretary must appoint a responsible official to oversee the implementation of the directive and ensure environmental reviews are conducted promptly, avoiding unnecessary regulatory delays. This section clarifies that it does not change or override any part of NEPA itself. However, it is important to note that the Trump Administration is in the process of its NEPA overhaul, managed through the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), so provisions in the final NDAA could instruct or be guided by the CEQ effort.

PFAS

The PFAS-related sections of the Senate NDAA outline several significant policy changes and new requirements for how the DOD addresses contamination from PFAS.

PFAS Disposal and Procurement Restrictions

Section 315 grants the DOD authority to destroy or dispose of PFAS using ""innovative technologies"" that are also ""cost effective"" and approved by relevant federal or state agencies. The DOD must also update its existing PFAS disposal guidance to align with this approach.

In Section 316, the law updates a previous restriction on buying firefighter protective gear containing intentionally added PFAS, now allowing such purchases if the equipment meets the safety specifications of Standard 1970 from the National Fire Protection Association, rather than banning PFAS-containing gear outright. Section 318 repeals prior prohibitions on DOD procurement of certain PFAS-containing products (cookware, cooking utensils, furniture, carpets, and rugs containing perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)).

Community Support

Section 317 (which is included in the House version as Section 314) mandates that the DOD continues providing bottled water to communities with private wells contaminated by PFAS due to military activities—so long as contamination exceeds the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) limits and bottled water was already being supplied prior to the bill's passage. This requirement ends only if households are connected to municipal water systems or the contamination has been remediated to meet federal and state standards.

Cleanup Measures and Reporting Requirements

Section 319 repeals the moratorium on incinerating PFAS and aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF), potentially allowing the resumption of incineration under approved methods. While Section 320 expands the DOD's responsibilities to address both actual and potential PFAS contamination. It requires preliminary site assessments at all ""covered facilities""—especially those with fire training pits. These assessments must consider interim responses to reduce public exposure, including bottled water, public water connections, and filtration systems. The DOD must expedite these measures, particularly in areas relying on a single drinking water source, and share assessments with the EPA, states, tribal governments, and the public for a minimum 60-day review period. Follow-up reports to Congress are required to track progress and justifications for any inaction.

Long-Term Transparency

Section 333 (which is included in the House version as Section 320) introduces a new annual reporting requirement to Congress detailing funding, site-by-site status updates, and progress on PFAS interim remedial actions across military installations. The reports must break down project phases, delays, and barriers, and provide site-specific timelines and remediation strategies. Additionally, within 180 days, the DOD must submit a PFAS remediation acceleration strategy with prioritization criteria, cleanup timelines, lab testing capabilities, and department performance benchmarks. To ensure public transparency, a regularly updated online dashboard must be launched within a year, providing real-time data on site cleanups, budgets, and community contacts.

Nuclear Energy

These provisions reflect a broad federal effort to modernize nuclear waste management, safeguard the uranium supply chain, enhance nuclear safety, and explore innovative nuclear technologies like microreactors.

Uranium Supply Chain Modernization

Section 3111 (Subsection 5633) mandates that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) accelerates the modernization of depleted uranium manufacturing processes by 2030, including establishing repeatable production methods and exploring off-site manufacturing options. The NNSA must report annually to Congress on the cost and progress of the program. Section 3111 (5642) requires DOE to submit biennial long-term plans through 2031 for meeting national security requirements for unencumbered uranium. These plans must include inventories, projected needs through 2070, enrichment options, industrial capabilities, potential shortfalls, and how policy changes or domestic enrichment investments could reduce reliance on adversary nations.

Section 3111 (Subsection 5643) complements this by requiring a separate report—due 120 days after enactment—on creating domestic uranium enrichment capability sufficient to meet all DOD needs through 2060. The plan must outline material requirements, milestones, funding needs, and how the U.S.-Australia-UK (AUKUS) nuclear submarine partnership affects enriched uranium demands. Annual compliance certifications will be required until the final milestone is achieved.

Microreactor Deployment

Section 922 requires the DOD to launch a pilot program for deploying microreactors at U.S. military bases. This initiative is designed to improve energy resilience and reduce dependence on vulnerable civilian power grids, signaling growing interest in small-scale, deployable nuclear power for national security infrastructure.

Critical Minerals

A new section from S.Amdt.3712 adds a critical minerals and rare earth elements mapping initiative to the Senate NDAA, reinforcing U.S. strategic resource independence and supply chain security. It authorizes the Department of the Interior, through the U.S. Geological Survey, to partner with foreign governments to cooperatively map and assess global mineral resources while prioritizing U.S. and allied access to those resources.

What's Next

The conference committee is traditionally used to resolve differences between the Senate and House on the NDAA. Conferees are House and Senate members, drawn mainly from the two armed services committees, who are expected to resolve disagreements between the House and Senate positions and provide an agreement in the form of a conference report.

Once agreed to by the conference committee, the conference report is subject to debate during floor consideration but cannot be amended. If organizations want to affect change to the final NDAA legislation, then now is the time to reach out to Congress.

Taken together, LNG export capacity in North America is projected to climb from 11.4 Bcf/d at the start of 2024 to 28.7 Bcf/d in 2029, if all projects under construction begin operating as scheduled.
That expansion would account for more than half of all new LNG capacity expected globally through 2029, according to the International Energy Agency.
Canada’s west coast LNG terminals are strategically positioned to serve Asian markets, with transit times about 50% shorter than from U.S. Gulf Coast terminals.
Outlook: A global supply shift If completed as planned, the North American LNG buildout would add more than 17 Bcf/d of new export capacity by 2029, cementing the region’s dominance in global LNG trade.","Liquefied natural gas (LNG) developers across North America are on track to more than double the region’s export capacity by the end of the decade, led by a new wave of large-scale projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s Liquefaction Capacity File and trade press reports, U.S. LNG exporters have announced plans to add about 13.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of new capacity between 2025 and 2029. The United States, already the world’s largest LNG exporter, currently has 15.4 Bcf/d of installed capacity.

Taken together, LNG export capacity in North America is projected to climb from 11.4 Bcf/d at the start of 2024 to 28.7 Bcf/d in 2029, if all projects under construction begin operating as scheduled. That expansion would account for more than half of all new LNG capacity expected globally through 2029, according to the International Energy Agency.

U.S. expansion centered on Gulf Coast

Most of the new U.S. capacity will be concentrated along the Gulf Coast, where developers continue to build new liquefaction trains and marine terminals to meet global demand. The region is already the largest export hub in the Atlantic Basin.

Plaquemines LNG Phase 1 shipped its first cargo in December 2024, while Plaquemines Phase 2 and Corpus Christi Stage III began cargo shipments earlier this year, though neither has yet entered full commercial service.

Five additional U.S. export projects have reached final investment decision (FID) and are now under construction:

Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 (1.6 Bcf/d)

Rio Grande LNG (2.1 Bcf/d)

Woodside Louisiana LNG (2.2 Bcf/d)

Golden Pass LNG (2.1 Bcf/d)

CP2 LNG Phase 1 (2.0 Bcf/d)

To feed these terminals, developers are advancing new pipeline projects to move gas from major producing regions to the Gulf Coast. However, permitting and construction delays remain a potential constraint for supply growth.

Canada enters export market

Canada officially joined the ranks of LNG exporters in mid-2025 when LNG Canada shipped its first cargo from Train 1 in Kitimat, British Columbia. The facility, the country’s first LNG export terminal, can produce a combined 1.84 Bcf/d from its two liquefaction trains and is expected to reach full capacity in 2026.

A proposed second phase would double that capacity to 3.68 Bcf/d by adding two additional trains, though the expansion is not expected online until after 2029, according to the Canada Energy Regulator.

Canada’s west coast LNG terminals are strategically positioned to serve Asian markets, with transit times about 50% shorter than from U.S. Gulf Coast terminals. The projects will draw feedgas primarily from the prolific Montney Formation in Alberta and British Columbia.

Two other projects are also under construction in Western Canada:

Woodfibre LNG (0.3 Bcf/d), expected online in 2027

Cedar LNG (0.4 Bcf/d), a floating facility that reached FID in June 2024 and is scheduled to begin exports in 2028

Mexico emerges as new export route

Mexico’s LNG export sector is also taking shape, supported largely by U.S. natural gas supplies. Two projects now under construction will add a combined 0.6 Bcf/d of export capacity by the end of the decade.

The Fast LNG Altamira floating production vessel (FLNG2) on Mexico’s east coast will provide 0.2 Bcf/d of liquefaction capacity, while Energía Costa Azul on the west coast will contribute 0.4 Bcf/d.

Mexico’s first LNG cargo was produced in August 2024 from the Fast LNG Altamira FLNG1 vessel, which sources feedgas via the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline from the United States.

Outlook: A global supply shift

If completed as planned, the North American LNG buildout would add more than 17 Bcf/d of new export capacity by 2029, cementing the region’s dominance in global LNG trade. The surge in supply capacity reflects continued demand growth from Europe and Asia, where buyers are seeking long-term contracts for reliable, lower-carbon energy sources.

The expansion also underscores the shifting geography of LNG exports—anchored by the U.S. Gulf Coast, supported by new routes through Mexico, and extended to the Pacific via Canada’s west coast. Together, these developments are set to redefine global gas flows over the next decade.",https://www.compressortech2.com/Images/1260x628/index-20251020-150855-Gas-Lines-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 10:59:11.218518

Investing in Ukraine's underground gas storage facilities was not attractive to American players in the past when cheap Russian gas went to Europe, according to energy expert, Viktoriia Voitsitska.
""We have the Odesa–Brody pipeline, and the U.S. wants to ensure zero Russian gas and zero Russian oil,"" the president said.
Last month, President Donald Trump reprimanded Europe for continuing to purchase Russian gas and oil and called for an end to Russian imports.
""The Americans will, in any case, completely drive out Russian gas from Europe.","Ukraine has presented potential gas, nuclear, and oil projects to the White House and American companies as Washington pushes Europe to rid itself of Russian energy and fuel, Zelensky told reporters during a press briefing on Oct. 19.

Zelensky's comments come as Brussels confirms its plans to completely end Russian gas imports by 2028, while the U.S. increases its energy exports to Europe. Kyiv is also offering its energy resources to the U.S.-Ukraine reconstruction investment fund, with state-owned oil and gas giant Naftogaz pitching 10 projects to the fund in September.

Among the projects Kyiv is discussing with the U.S. is a terminal in Odesa to import American liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to Zelensky, who added that ""this entire gas project has been presented both at the White House and to American companies.""

For the project to work, Turkey would have to agree to unwind restrictions that prohibit LNG tankers from passing through the Bosphorus, which links the Aegean Sea to the Black Sea, he said.

Zelensky also said the U.S. was ""interested"" in Ukraine's gas storage facilities and gas network, without providing details. Ukraine’s network connects its gas fields to neighboring European nations and its massive underground gas storage facilities, the biggest in Europe.

""They see that we have the largest number of gas storage facilities and an established network — they are interested,"" he said.

Investing in Ukraine's underground gas storage facilities was not attractive to American players in the past when cheap Russian gas went to Europe, according to energy expert, Viktoriia Voitsitska. ""But since Europe has this vision of phasing out Russian fossil fuels, more and more players will be interested in selling their products to European markets,"" she said.

Another project under consideration is the Odesa-Brody oil pipeline, said Zelensky. The pipeline transports crude from Odesa to Brody on the Polish border in Lviv Oblast and is operated by the state-owned ​​company UkrTransNafta.

""We have the Odesa–Brody pipeline, and the U.S. wants to ensure zero Russian gas and zero Russian oil,"" the president said.

Zelensky also noted that the U.S. could boost Ukraine’s nuclear energy sector by erecting nine additional nuclear reactors. Nuclear power makes up half of Ukraine’s current energy generation, although six of Ukraine’s 15 reactors are located in the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

The sector has strong ties with the U.S., as American nuclear firm Westinghouse provided fuel for reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant before Russia’s full-scale invasion. It planned to sell fuel to other nuclear plants in Ukraine. In July, the company inked plans for new factories in Ukraine to make parts for nuclear fuel, having previously agreed in 2022 to build nine new reactors.

To address urgent energy needs this winter after recent Russian attacks damaged 60% of Ukraine’s gas facilities, Zelensky said Kyiv could import American LNG via Poland if needed. Ukraine may need an additional $2 billion worth of gas to survive winter, with financing secured from Norway and Ukrainian banks, while gas can be sourced from Greece and Azerbaijan, said Zelensky.

The U.S., the world’s largest LNG producer, exported a record 9.4 million metric tons of LNG to Europe, its top market, in September. While Europe is increasing American LNG imports this year, it still brought nearly 5 billion euros worth of Russian LNG in the first half of 2025 — 1 billion euros more than the same period last year.

Last month, President Donald Trump reprimanded Europe for continuing to purchase Russian gas and oil and called for an end to Russian imports.

""The Americans will, in any case, completely drive out Russian gas from Europe. We must understand — regardless of various agreements — that Russia has lost Europe to the Americans,"" Zelensky said.",https://assets.kyivindependent.com/content/images/2024/11/GettyImages-2147892507.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:11:22.375512

Backed by major government and private investment, this boom is fuelling demand for skilled workers across every corner of the country – from electricians and plumbers to welders and engineers.

UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband explained: “Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and we are publishing a landmark national plan to make it happen.

“Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government’s commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid, secure jobs.

“This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.”

Green jobs boom backed by record investment

Driven by the government’s clean energy mission, more than £50bn in private investment has flowed into the sector since last July.

Projects like the Sizewell C nuclear plant, which will support up to 10,000 clean energy jobs at peak construction, and the Rolls-Royce small modular reactor programme, expected to create 3,000 roles, are at the forefront of this industrial resurgence.

The government’s green light for carbon capture projects such as Acorn in Scotland and Viking in the North East adds a further 35,000 jobs, including 1,000 apprenticeships.

Combined with ongoing carbon capture, usage and storage initiatives in the North West and Teesside, the clean energy sector is fast becoming one of the UK’s largest sources of industrial employment.

National strategy to train the next generation

For the first time, the UK Government will publish a comprehensive national plan to train the next generation of clean energy workers.

This landmark workforce strategy aims to ensure that the 860,000 jobs expected by 2030 are not only plentiful, but also high-quality and well-paid.

At the heart of this plan are five new Technical Excellence Colleges, dedicated to equipping young people with the skills needed for careers in renewables, nuclear, and advanced energy systems.

Pilot schemes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire – worth a combined £2.5 million – will support new training centres, courses and career advice.

Education providers, industry leaders and local authorities will collaborate under one cohesive framework, aligning skills training with real-world demand in 31 priority occupations, including welders, electricians and engineers.

Empowering veterans, ex-offenders and oil & gas workers

A series of tailored initiatives aims to open clean energy jobs to a wider workforce. In partnership with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a veterans’ transition programme, matching ex-service members with roles in wind, solar and nuclear energy.

For ex-offenders, school leavers and the unemployed, targeted schemes will provide training pathways into skilled energy roles – tapping into a pool of over 13,000 people who already possess relevant skills from previous industries.

Meanwhile, workers from traditional oil and gas backgrounds will benefit from up to £20m in retraining funds.

The successful Aberdeen skills pilot is being expanded nationwide, alongside the extension of the Energy Skills Passport, helping offshore workers seamlessly transfer into clean energy roles such as offshore wind and grid maintenance.

Better pay and fairer work in the clean energy economy

Clean energy jobs are not only plentiful – they’re lucrative. Entry-level roles in this sector pay 23% more than equivalent positions elsewhere, while jobs in wind, nuclear and grid infrastructure offer average salaries exceeding £50,000, compared to the UK’s national average of £37,000.

The government’s new Fair Work Charter, developed with trade unions, will guarantee strong pay, secure contracts and safe conditions for all workers in the clean energy industry.

In addition, new legislation will extend employment protections, including the National Minimum Wage, to offshore clean energy workers beyond UK territorial waters.

These measures underscore a renewed commitment to ensuring that the clean energy transition delivers prosperity and dignity for every worker.

Building a future-ready workforce

As demand for skilled labour surges, the government has pledged to restore trade unions’ role as key partners in shaping modern workplaces.

With union membership in the energy sector down from 70% in the 1990s to around 30% today, ministers see collaboration as vital to securing fair pay and good conditions across the industry.

The UK’s clean energy transformation also aligns with broader education reforms announced by the Prime Minister, setting a target for two-thirds of young people to engage in higher-level learning – whether academic, technical or through apprenticeships – by age 25.

Powering Britain’s clean energy future

From the industrial heartlands of Teesside to the coastal wind farms of the East of England, where 60,000 people are expected to be employed in the sector by 2030, the clean energy revolution is reshaping Britain’s economic future.

As investment accelerates, opportunities expand, and pay rises, the UK is positioning itself as a global leader in clean energy jobs – delivering not just a net-zero future, but a fairer, more prosperous one for all.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2247342469-696x376-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:29.152757

According to an Ocober 10 ruling signed by district judge Judge Penelope Richard, the Office of Coastal Management under the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources did not consider several factors when issuing the permit.

The court finds that the LDENR – OCM “failed to consider the secondary and cumulative

impacts, specifically this facility’s impact on climate-related change in the coastal zone, if any, in conjunction with the other LNG facilities in the area.”

Moreover, the LDENR – OCM also “failed to consider environmental justice issues in its basis of decision.”

“Based on the OCM’s failure to consider these two issues, the court hereby remands this case to the OCM, for further proceedings, as may be appropriate. The coastal use permit will be vacated until such time that the OCM has considered these issues in issuing the CUP to Commonwealth and makes a finding that the benefits of this project outweigh the costs to the community,” it said.

Kimmeridge’s Commonwealth told FERC in its newest monthly status report it was notified that its coastal use permit had been vacated and remanded to the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy Office of Permitting and Compliance, formerly LDENR-OCM, to fully consider two issues raised during public comment about the proposed project.

The project is “working with our state officials and regulators to resolve this matter as quickly as possible, while ensuring our permit record fully demonstrates the project’s compliance with all regulatory criteria.”

“The project will notify the Commission when the permit is reissued. Site preparation activities will not be initiated until such time,” Commonwealth said.

Commonwealth has not yet taken a final investment decision on its project.

However, the US LNG developer previously said that it plans to decide on the facility by the end of this year.

Last month, Commonwealth received approval from FERC to start initial site preparation activities for its LNG export project.

In June, Commonwealth received the Commission’s final order upholding authorization for its LNG export project.

Solar is no longer a niche asset class, it sits at the heart of how organisations decarbonise, reduce costs and build energy resilience.

For Pivot Energy, that mission is both commercial and social. Founded in 2009, the company develops, constructs, finances, owns and manages onsite and offsite solar projects across the US.

Today, Pivot Energy is a leading independent power producer and Certified B Corp. Its portfolio spans 4.1 GW and nearly 1,800 projects completed or in development, delivering reliable renewable power and tangible benefits to host communities.

Agrivoltaics is now a strategic pillar for the firm; instead of choosing between farmland and photovoltaics, Pivot Energy integrates both to improve land productivity and local livelihoods.

Angela Burke is driving that shift. As Director of Operations at Pivot Energy since 2022, Angela has spearheaded the company’s agrivoltaics strategy and operations.

Her leadership is accelerating a 100% agrivoltaics portfolio, turning ambition into deployment at pace.

The result is thousands of grazing sheep and dozens of new solar farmers working productively beneath panels.

Recognised as the 2024 North American Agrivoltaics “Champion of the Year”, Angela is a vocal advocate for solar farming and a practical operator focused on safety, quality and long-term performance.

In this interview with Sustainability Magazine, Angela shares her expertise of agrivoltaics with us.

What is agrivoltaics?

Agrivoltaics, also known as dual use solar, is an approach that integrates solar panel production with agricultural production on existing farmland usually between 5 acres and 50 acres.

Pivot Energy, who has been utilising some element of agrivoltaics on its qualified solar sites since 2022 and currently has 72 active dual use solar projects, more than any other solar developer.

Pivot follows a three-pronged strategic agrivoltaics approach that focuses on livestock grazing, enhanced habitat and crop production.

More than 95% of the solar sites Pivot operates include at least one of these land stewardship practices:

Livestock grazing

Multiple types of animals: sheep, chicken, pigs, alpaca, llamas, ducks and other livestock can be integrated into the solar array area to complete grazing activities that manage vegetation while also improving soil health.

Today, more than 3,200 sheep are grazing on 700 acres of dual use solar across 6 states.

Enhanced habitat

Planting customised native, low-growth plant seed mixes that flower throughout the year to maximise pollinator benefits.

Pivot Energy’s site plans also incorporate native crops, wildflowers and we partner with apiaries to house bee hives to pollinate land and produce honey to sell.

Crop production

Pilot sites’ harvests include vegetables such as radishes, daikon, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions.

April 2024, Pivot led first-ever U.S. PV+Crop+Subsurface Drip Irrigation configuration that was installed in LaSalle, CO.

In late April of 2025, Pivot’s farm partner tilled and planted the site and we look forward to seeing the first harvest this fall.

Pilot PV+Cropping site in IL will support a hay/alfalfa crop to be harvested 2-3 times annually.

These pilot projects are integral to achieving Pivot’s overall goal of adopting agrivoltaics as a standard and at scale.

What is the impact of these?

Pivot works with landowners to sign long-term leases between 20 and 40 years in order to develop purpose-driven community-scale solar projects.

This enables landowners to receive dual-use solar projects that are helping to restore soil quality, increase ecosystem functioning and create pollinator habitats under the solar panels in rural communities across the country.

Almost all of Pivot’s ground-mounted sites have committed to dual-use agricultural practices and we have more solar grazing sites than most U.S. developers.

The benefits of agrivoltaics include soil enrichment where sustainable seeding and land practices and fertilisers enhance soil health over a solar array’s lifetime.

Additionally, shade reduces the amount of water needed for irrigation and in return, the vegetation underneath the solar panels keeps those panels cooler, boosting operational efficiency and the amount of electricity they produce.

Overall, it reduces the need for fossil-fueled vegetation management, machinery, herbicides and pesticides.

Agrivoltaics sites also provide impactful financial benefits to the community.

While energy security tends to come into focus during geopolitical unrest or unexpected supply disruptions, it isn’t just an event-driven issue.
Energy security also encompasses reliability and affordability, which are perennially important for the economy, quality of life, and safety.
Undoubtedly, energy security was a key factor for the 20+ countries that signed a declaration to triple nuclear energy in 2023 at COP 28.
Energy security is vital for economic growth and national security.","Summary:

Energy security was particularly topical in 2022, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked a global energy crisis, with pronounced severity in Europe. Oil prices temporarily rose above $120 per barrel in the first half of 2022, and even the U.S. felt the pain, despite being the world’s largest oil producer.

The Biden Administration responded with the largest-ever release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in coordination with the International Energy Agency (IEA). Both the SPR and the IEA were actually born out of the energy crises in the 1970s.

The impact of higher prices for oil and liquefied natural gas were broad, albeit most severe for the European Union. Prior to the invasion, Russia accounted for 50% of EU oil imports and over 60% of the EU’s natural gas imports.

In retrospect, the EU was able to pivot away from Russian imports in fairly quick order, limiting Russia’s ability to further weaponize its natural gas exports. However, improving energy affordability and being better prepared for price crises are key focuses of the EU’s energy policy going forward.

While energy security tends to come into focus during geopolitical unrest or unexpected supply disruptions, it isn’t just an event-driven issue. Energy security also encompasses reliability and affordability, which are perennially important for the economy, quality of life, and safety. With electricity demand expected to grow globally, sufficient and affordable power is critical to economies and central to an ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) arms race.

From an energy security standpoint, AI is arguably a mixed bag. For example, AI can help energy companies combat cyberattacks, albeit those attacks have become more complex due to AI. Meanwhile, AI data centers are driving more electricity demand, which could put upward pressure on energy prices.

On the other hand, hyperscalers have been quick to support innovative power solutions, including advanced nuclear (read more). Hyperscalers have plenty of capital to back new projects, while their influence in Washington can also help ease the path for nuclear. Nuclear support is one area of continuity in energy policy from the Biden to the Trump administration (read more), with the U.S. military also focused on advanced nuclear as exemplified by an announcement last week.

In the U.S., power demand has largely been flat for 20 years, so a shift to growing electricity demand is notable. The U.S. will need plenty of affordable power from a range of sources, including renewables, natural gas, and nuclear. The political focus may even move from prices at the pump to monthly electricity bills.

Energy security concerns in the 1970s were part of the impetus for the robust build-out of nuclear capacity in the ’70s and ’80s in the U.S., as shown below. Undoubtedly, energy security was a key factor for the 20+ countries that signed a declaration to triple nuclear energy in 2023 at COP 28. Signatories include the U.S., Canada, Japan, and several European countries. In total, 31 countries have now signed on to the declaration to triple nuclear power by 2050.

It is not surprising that countries are turning to nuclear. Its carbon-free power generation is important for meeting climate goals, while its reliability can complement intermittent renewables.

Energy security is vital for economic growth and national security. Countries around the world are recognizing the importance of nuclear power in addressing energy security concerns, sparking a new nuclear renaissance. For investors, this can represent a compelling growth opportunity. The Range Nuclear Renaissance Index (NUKZ ) includes global companies participating in this long-term megatrend.

That risk isn't abstract: The administration is weighing additional multibillion-dollar cuts to clean-energy funds after canceling other awards, which is a shift that could stall projects, hiring, and private investment tied to them.

Why are these policy changes important?

These are not niche jobs. The clean energy workforce outnumbers oil, gas, and coal jobs by about three to one, according to E2, anchoring supply chains for heat pumps, batteries, and modernized grids that lower household energy costs and improve air quality.

Communities in fast-growing states — from Gulf Coast manufacturing hubs to Mountain West construction crews — stand to lose the most if factories pause retooling and developers shelve projects.

There's also a consumer knock-on effect: When grid upgrades and efficient equipment slip, families face higher bills and more frequent outages during heat waves and winter storms — exactly when reliable power matters most. Globally, renewables are surging, which underscores how retreating here could mean ceding jobs and competitiveness to other countries.

What's being done about these changes?

States are moving to keep demand and jobs alive. California and New York have rules requiring all new passenger vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035, sustaining investment in EV supply chains and charging. A recent federal decision also shielded California's clean-car waiver from a fast-track repeal in Congress, adding regulatory certainty automakers say they need to invest.

People can choose high-efficiency appliances when replacing old ones, opt into community solar where available, and support local policies that expand building upgrades and grid modernization.

These are the kinds of purchases and programs that keep electricians, factory workers, and installers on the job. Paired with durable state standards and stable federal funding, those choices help hold together a workforce that has become a backbone of community resilience.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lsK87tiSQ1uhXAhYTb4jTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/36e36b02cc5f8790ec45ada720b5a3a9,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:33.327791

Billions in Cuts Would Harm Clean Energy Hubs Across the Country

On October 2, the Trump administration announced $7.6 billion in cuts targeted at clean energy projects. Many experts are concerned over potential project cancellations in more states as the government shutdown continues. For instance, the South Texas Direct Air Capture Hub and the Louisiana Project Cypress Air Capture Project, both supported by bipartisan groups of lawmakers, stand to lose funding from cuts. More troubling are at-risk multi-state initiatives, such as the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, which invests throughout Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.

Future cuts could contribute to higher power prices as electricity demand rises, leading many companies to move their investments outside the country. Carbon removal hubs in Louisiana and Texas and offshore wind projects on the east coast are predicted to create thousands of high-paying jobs in the clean energy industry. If the Department of Energy (DOE) decides to make these cuts, the United States will move even further away from a just transition to clean energy.

News and Updates

FEMA Cancels $11B in Disaster Payments to States

In a report released in late September, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) publicly confirmed that the administration withheld $10.9 billion in critical disaster assistance from more than 45 states.

In addition to this rescission of previously approved funds, FEMA’s proposed budget would significantly cut the agency’s disaster spending by tens of billions of dollars. The states that the budget shortfall would most heavily impact are New York, California, Maryland, Georgia, Florida, and Pennsylvania. These states all experience increasingly frequent extreme weather disasters made worse by climate change.

For First Time, Renewables Beat Out Coal in Total Generation Globally

In the first six months of the year, renewable energy sources like wind and solar generated more electricity globally than coal, according to a report published this month by energy think tank Ember. As the United States deprioritizes renewables, green energy has made historic gains around the rest of the world.

“We are seeing the first signs of a crucial turning point,” Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember, stated within the report. While the lead renewables had over coal this year is small, the trajectory is clear: solar and wind are surging because they are increasingly very cheap compared to coal. In the U.S. a study found that 99 percent of coal plants are more expensive to run than renewable replacements would be. Renewables are cheaper, healthier, and overall better than their coal alternatives to generate electricity, which puts us on a strong path forward as we counter the climate crisis.

At the time, I described hydropower as ‘the forgotten giant of electricity’.
“That’s similar to all the power produced worldwide by solar and wind combined, and 50% more than the amount generated from nuclear plants,” Birol noted.
“Many hydropower plants in advanced economies are over 40 years old.
And I hope that in another four years’ time, hydropower will no longer be a forgotten giant.”","The Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol, has renewed his call for the global energy community to give hydropower the attention it deserves, warning that the sector remains “the forgotten giant of electricity.”

In a LinkedIn post published on October 17, Birol said that four years after the IEA released its major report on hydropower, the technology continues to be left out of key energy policy discussions despite its central role in global electricity systems.

“Four years ago, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released a major report on hydropower. It noted that hydro is often left out of conversations on energy, despite its huge role in electricity systems around the world. At the time, I described hydropower as ‘the forgotten giant of electricity’. Unfortunately, this is still the case today,” Birol wrote.

Hydropower remains the third largest source of power generation worldwide, after coal and natural gas, generating around 4,500 terawatt-hours of electricity last year — 14% of global supply. “That’s similar to all the power produced worldwide by solar and wind combined, and 50% more than the amount generated from nuclear plants,” Birol noted.

Hydropower, Birol said, is uniquely placed to help countries meet rising electricity demand as the world enters what the IEA has described as a “new Age of Electricity.”

“Hydropower can help meet this increasing power consumption as populations and economies grow, electrification advances and investment pours into digital infrastructure like data centres,” he said.

Birol also highlighted hydropower’s role as a dispatchable low-emissions source of electricity with “unmatched capabilities when it comes to flexibility.”

“Hydro plants can quickly adjust their generation up and down – and can be stopped and restarted relatively smoothly. This enables them to quickly adapt to shifts in demand, helping to keep the lights on in times of strain – and usually at a lower cost than most nuclear or coal plants,” he wrote.

He added that hydropower is a crucial partner to renewables: “In periods when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow, hydro can quickly and cheaply fill the gaps.”

Birol also underlined hydropower’s critical role in electricity storage, noting that pumped storage hydro plants “are currently the largest form of electricity storage worldwide, with the capacity to hold 30 times more power than batteries.”

Birol pointed out that in many advanced economies, hydro plants are decades old and in need of refurbishment.

“Many hydropower plants in advanced economies are over 40 years old. Refurbishing them is vital to sustain output, and owners should consider simultaneous upgrades that improve flexibility and storage,” he said.

In contrast, developing and emerging economies hold vast untapped potential.

“In emerging and developing economies – where about 60% of hydro potential remains untapped – hydropower can both expand energy access and power industrialisation, spurring economic growth,” Birol wrote.

He emphasized the multiple benefits hydropower can bring to communities and industries alike — from low-cost electricity and irrigation services to jobs and cross-border trade.

Calling for urgent action, Birol urged governments to make financing more accessible and affordable, speed up permitting processes, and strengthen the resilience of hydropower infrastructure in the face of changing rainfall patterns due to climate change.

“Hydropower development requires long-term planning, so challenges need to be addressed now,” he said. “This is why I believe it’s essential to move hydropower up today’s energy policy agenda.”

“These actions can be taken now. And I hope that in another four years’ time, hydropower will no longer be a forgotten giant.”",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/1760636026652.png,N,,2025-10-20 12:11:43.985187

It comes as the UK Government has published a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030.

The plan will set out clear workforce estimates for the first time, and aims for industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations.

For young people, the government said the jobs can offer higher levels of pay – with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23% more than the same occupations in other sectors.

Jobs in wind, nuclear, and electricity networks all advertise average salaries of over £50,000, compared to the UK average of £37,000, and are spread across coastal and post-industrial communities.

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers – 5 new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles.

Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new programme to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation, wind turbine factories, and nuclear power stations

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed

Upskill existing workers – Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy.

The plan also includes proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have good quality pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts

It comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50%.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

“Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs. The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call – and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen.”

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, said:

“We’re giving workers the skills needed for switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry – and will drive growth across the nation.”

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

“Projects right across the country from Pembrokeshire to Flintshire are creating opportunities for hundreds of our young people and will help drive regional growth as well as accelerating our drive towards lower bills and energy security.”

Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the TUC, said:

“After years of previous governments starving British industry of investment, this represents a serious plan to start to rebuild our industrial heartlands and deliver quality jobs in clean energy – as well as supporting even more in supply chains right across the country.”

Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, National Officer at the GMB, said:

“GMB has long campaigned for a jobs first transition. The government is listening and having a jobs plan to underpin the industrial strategy is exactly what this country needs.”

Eddie Dempsey, General Secretary of the RMT, said:

“RMT welcomes the government’s commitment to closing loopholes in maritime and offshore employment law, which should in turn create domestic opportunities in coastal communities that support the entirety of the offshore wind supply chain.”

Christina McAnea, General Secretary of UNISON said:

“Clean, homegrown energy is essential in tackling climate change and delivering economic growth. This plan can help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.”

Sue Ferns OBE, Senior Deputy General Secretary at Prospect, said:

“The infrastructure investment required to achieve the government’s clean energy mission must be backed by a major boost to jobs and skills. If this mission is to be a success, and support the wider industrial strategy and growth agendas, then we urgently need a step-change in the level of workforce development. In this context is it welcome that this Jobs Plan now exists and the new initiatives are a welcome step in the right direction.”

Frances O’Grady, Former General Secretary of the TUC, said:

“Energy workers and their families are at the heart of this plan – showing the clean energy transition provides not just energy security but job security.”

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said:

“Well paid, secure work must be at the heart of any green transition. Unite members will welcome the commitment to 400,000 green jobs with strong collective bargaining rights. The actions set out in this plan are initial steps in what must be an ambitious strategy for tangible jobs, backed by an equally ambitious programme of public investment.”

Chris O’Shea, Chief Executive of Centrica, said:

“We have committed to creating a new apprenticeship for every day of this decade. These new secure, skilled, well-paid jobs are key to unlocking the economic growth the UK so desperately needs.”

Katy Heidenreich Supply Chain and People Director at Offshore Energies UK, said:

“Investing in skills development is essential to support the UK’s energy sector and it is encouraging to see governments recognise the huge resource of our oil and gas workforce and how their skills can be developed to provide the expertise needed for the energy mix of the future.”

Claire Mack OBE, Chief Executive of Scottish Renewables, said:

“The clean power mission is not just about energy security for the country, it’s about good jobs and a workforce fit the future in your locale. The scale and importance of the energy transition requires new approaches to ensure investments in skills, apprenticeships and training serve the needs of the entire economy.”

Ben Martin, Policy Manager at the British Chambers of Commerce, said:

“The net zero economy is continuing to grow, and the Clean Energy Jobs Plan clearly sets out how the government will recruit essential workers who are critical for the UK’s energy transition. This will support both net zero and economic growth across the UK, providing certainty for people and local communities. “

Verity Davidge, Director of Policy and Public Affairs, at Make UK said:

“Manufacturers are moving at pace to invest in decarbonisation and net zero projects and the transition to clean energy offers huge opportunities for industry. To take full advantage, companies will need to have access to increasingly higher levels of skills and a talent pipeline which will fuel the growth we need to see.”

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said:

“We welcome the Clean Energy Jobs Plan’s recognition that hydrogen will be vital to net zero and to creating high-quality jobs. Much of the oil and gas workforce already has transferable skills, and supporting their transition into hydrogen will be key to a just and rapid shift to a clean energy economy.”

Olivia Powis, CEO of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said:

“We welcome the Clean Jobs Plan and its recognition of the vital role CCUS and hydrogen will play in achieving the UK’s growth and decarbonisation goals while keeping industries competitive. Developing the necessary skills base is crucial to unlocking these sectors’ full potential and protecting thousands of existing industrial jobs.”

Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said:

“This Jobs Plan shows the huge opportunity clean power offers the UK, and the vital role nuclear will play in delivering it. With 100,000 people already working in nuclear in good, skilled jobs across the country, new stations like Sizewell C and a fleet of SMRs will create thousands more — especially for young people — in clean and secure energy.”

Chris Hewett, Chief Executive, Solar Energy UK, said:

“Solar energy and battery energy storage already support over 20,000 British jobs, with expectations that the sectors will employ more than twice the number in 10 years’ time. But to reach our goals for cheaper, cleaner power, we need to redouble our efforts to attract and train staff for these fast-growing sectors. With our Solar Careers UK programme and critical support from government under the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, we have every expectation that our aspirations will be fulfilled.”

Yselkla Farmer, CEO of BEAMA, said:

“We have a long heritage of manufacturing for the electricity industry in the UK. As a supply chain at the heart of the clean energy sector we know the growth potential is substantial as we electrify our energy system. “

Lawrence Slade, CEO of Energy Networks Association, said:

“This plan is an important step towards accelerating the real economic benefits of the clean energy transition right around the country. Today network operators employ around 26,000 people and facilitate 1,500 apprenticeships, in order to maintain the safe, reliable operation of over 500,000 miles of wires and cables.”

Lieutenant General (Retd) Richard Nugee CB CVO CBE, Chair, Mission Renewable, said:

“The Clean Energy Jobs Plan reflects the valuable contributions those who have served have made and can continue to make to the nation. By linking veterans and their families with career opportunities in the clean energy sector, Mission Renewable helps companies tap into and retain skilled talent, while at the same time enabling Armed Forces communities to thrive and feel valued.”

Paul Cox, Group CEO of Energy & Utility Skills, said:

“For the government to achieve its 2030 target, we must put people at the heart of that ambition – only by having the right people with the right skills will we deliver the UK’s energy future.”

David Hughes, Chief Executive of Association of Colleges, said:

“This exciting plan will help people get the skills they need to secure good work locally and it is great to see the investment in colleges to back the government’s ambitions on a net zero future.”",https://transportandenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1530086603-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:38.210144

(Reuters) — The Trump administration's plans to cancel nearly $8 billion in Energy Department grants are illegal because contracts had already been signed and will cause consumer energy prices to skyrocket, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate energy committee said on Oct. 16.

Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled $7.56 billion in funding for clean energy projects that it claimed would not provide sufficient returns to taxpayers.

""These are projects that would have added energy to the grid and added flexibility,"" Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said. ""The administration is constraining the energy that we can put on the grid, and at the end of the day, this is going to raise energy costs for consumers.""

Heinrich said that 218 of the 233 projects ranging from battery storage to green hydrogen were located in states with Democratic governors.

Soaring home electricity bills, driven largely by skyrocketing electricity demand by data centers to power artificial intelligence, have become a top voter concern, and one that Democrats hope to seize on ahead of upcoming gubernatorial elections and next year's congressional elections.

Heinrich said retail electricity prices were already 10% higher year over year even before the cuts were proposed.

The Energy Department has said it is prioritizing oil, gas and coal energy, which it says will meet baseload demand needed by data centers and lower prices.

“It’s a voluntary program,” an Xcel spokesman told the news outlet.
“It erodes personal choice, home comfort, and the basic right to control appliances and vehicles you paid for with your own money.
However, when the grid gets overwhelmed, for any reason, the companies can take control and shut down air, heat, and hot water.
Ultimately, public utility companies exist to serve the public and cater to their convenience – not the other way around.","Ohio – which has a Republican governor and Republican supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature – has become the latest state to consider legislation allowing utility companies to seize control of thermostats during heat waves or shut off hot water during peak demand in the name of protecting the power grid. Other states are considering similar measures that critics say represent an egregious violation of private property rights and shift blame to customers for the failure of politicians and utility companies to improve grid capacity and reliability.

The legislation under consideration in the Buckeye State is being sold as an effort to “modernize Ohio’s energy regulations and help homeowners and small businesses save money while improving electric grid reliability.” The bill would create “voluntary demand response programs, where participating customers can allow utilities to temporarily adjust energy usage, such as raising thermostat settings or cycling water heaters, during periods of high demand.”

Rep. Klopfenstein claims customers could “override these actions” and that other states have implemented similar programs with success.

“Demand response programs have proven to be a vital tool for our large commercial users, and it’s important that similar programs are made available to residential and small commercial users,” the Republican claimed. “These programs will ease the strain on our energy grid and save money for all Ohioans.”

But the experience of other states shows that these promises are paper thin, and there’s no guarantee customers will always be able to “override” the controls.

Colorado serves as a cautionary tale. There, Xcel Energy operates a voluntary program that also promised tens of thousands of residents they could override the controls if they chose.

But during an “energy emergency” caused by equipment failure in 2022, ABC News’s Denver affiliate reported that Coloradans “learned they had no control over the temperatures in their own homes” even as a heat wave washed over the state.

“I mean, it was 90 out, and it was right during the peak period,” Tony Talarico told the outlet. “It was hot.” Talarico said that “normally” he is able to override the thermostat lock, but “[i]n this case, we weren’t. So, our thermostat was locked in at 78 or 79.”

Asked for comment, the utility company shockingly blamed the customers and emphasized that they signed up for the program (leaving out that they were promised they could bypass the controls).

“It’s a voluntary program,” an Xcel spokesman told the news outlet. “Let’s remember that this is something that customers choose to be a part of based on the incentives.”

But as Colorado Public Radio noted, the utility program changed the rules in the middle of the game. While the program says it can be used during “the hottest summer days,” it said nothing about “thermostat adjustments due to equipment failures.”

Other states have proposed going much further, taking away any agency for consumers and forcing them into the program. A bill in Connecticut, for instance, backed by both Democrats and Republicans, would give utility companies the same ability to take over not just thermostats and water heaters, but also electric cars, inverting the batteries to put power back into the grid.

Some people fear that this is part of a larger plan to restrict energy usage and make government even more invasive in the lives of everyday Americans. “This legislation is a slippery slope toward centralized, government control of private energy use,” Chris Herb, CEO and president of Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, said in April. “It erodes personal choice, home comfort, and the basic right to control appliances and vehicles you paid for with your own money. When does it end?”

Others have pointed out that the companies are charging customers more for not having smart meters, which could coerce Social Security recipients and other low-income individuals into signing up to save money. The program may appear to give customers free will, but imposed costs for not complying will effectively force many to submit to allowing utility companies to control their air conditioner and other appliances.

“Participation in programs like AC Rewards [in Minnesota] will be voluntary at first, but like the $180 fee, I predict the extra costs associated with not allowing the utility to control your power will eventually become cost-prohibitive, especially for low-income families and businesses,” Isaac Orr, an energy researcher with the Center of the American Experiment, warned in 2024.

These “voluntary” programs all start the same way: they come into houses under the guise of installing helpful “smart meters” with the supposedly altruistic goal of helping Americans save a few dollars on electricity. Oftentimes the companies even offer $100 or more as a “gift” for compliance.

However, when the grid gets overwhelmed, for any reason, the companies can take control and shut down air, heat, and hot water. Instead of focusing on fixing the problems underlying the grid failures – like overreliance on wind and solar, the decommissioning of fossil fuels plants, and decades of deferred maintenance – the companies simply turn the blame and burden back onto the customer.

Americans should be wary of such programs as they continue to gain popularity among utility company executives, bureaucrats, and politicians nationwide. While they promise lower power bills, that may come at the cost of personal freedom and comfort.

The animal health company’s homecoming signaled a new commitment to innovation and an era of collaboration in a space emerging with opportunity: One Health (the intersection of animal, plant, human and environmental health).

In partnership with Purdue University and the State of Indiana, Elanco’s campus includes the OneHealth Innovation District, a community-centered research hub designed to unite corporate innovators, academic researchers, students, investors and government leaders to advance science and inspire innovation. Indiana’s $72.4 billion agbioscience economy, coupled with its leading life sciences sector, positions the state to lead in the exploration, development and growth of this new economy and its impact on the planet.

AgriNovus CEO, Christy Wright, remarks that this concept holds tremendous opportunity across the value chain. “The One Health discussion generates new ideas simply by understanding what problems can be solved through cross-sectional collaboration. It also brings to surface new perspectives on how innovation in food and nutrition fit into the larger discussion of the One Health portfolio.”

Elanco’s OneHealth Innovation District bolsters this concept significantly, and the success stories are already rolling in Indiana. Let’s examine a few.

BiomEdit exploring the untapped potential of the microbiome

Elanco announced in 2021 the intention to carve out its microbiome platform and pipeline. About six months later, BiomEdit was launched in Indiana to explore the ways that the health of animals, humans and the environment are influenced by the populations of bacterial species they host. They leverage the animal’s own microbial ecosystem to innovate solutions where none exist – preventing disease and focusing on critical issues like food security and methane emission reduction.

BiomEdit has a long-term strategic research and commercial partnership with Nutreco, to bring livestock and aquaculture producers feed additives developed through microbiome technology. They have also received a $4.5 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to accelerate research and development of novel microbiome-based solutions to reduce methane emissions that also enhance feed efficiency for beef and dairy cattle.

Their technology, BE-101 has entered the final phase of the USDA conditional licensure process and is advancing toward commercialization, expected in 2026. Assuming the name “Optavant,” it is the first-of-its-kind probiotic vectored antibody designed to prevent mortality associated with necrotic enteritis (NE) in broiler chickens. The disease causes an estimated $6 billion in annual losses worldwide.

Corteva Agriscience accelerating disruptive innovation through Corteva Catalyst

Corteva Catalyst, the company’s investment and partnership platform, was launched in 2024 focused on accessing and bringing to market innovation that accelerates the development of early-stage, disruptive technologies that enable farmers to sustainably produce more food and feed. Six months later they announced an equity stake and strategic collaboration in Pairwise, a technology company accelerating the delivery of advanced gene editing solutions to farmers, ultimately benefiting the environment and consumers.

A five-year joint venture, Pairwise and Corteva are leveraging both companies’ advanced gene editing capabilities to generate and evaluate unique gene edits across multiple traits in a range of crops to develop and deploy new products that are more resilient to extreme weather events and climate change.

Also enabled through Corteva Catalyst in 2025 was the strategic collaboration with Profluent Bio, a pioneer in generative AI for protein design, to deliver a new generation of more sustainable, resilient crops. This partnership integrates with Corteva’s Genlytix ecosystem, a set of industry-leading capabilities that enable gene editing and its future role in plant breeding, including precision to improve yield, pest resistance, tolerance to drought and heat, and quality – creating dependable solutions for growers around the world.

Startup landscape emerging across One Health, food is health

AgriNovus identified Food is Health as a priority for Indiana’s innovation future in its Accelerate 2050 strategy and there is early-stage innovation quickly emerging and contributing to the overall One Health picture.

True Essence Foods is a technology company focused on licensing flavor balancing and symmetry solutions for the food and beverage industry.

FloVision Solutions leverages automated data collection and actionable insights to optimize protein quality, processes and yield.

NutriPop is a healthy super food snack made from popped water lily seeds that is 130 calories and 3 grams of protein per serving.

Earth Life Foods is a plant-based food manufacturing company that offers their own branded products, bulk packaging, private labeling and non-GMO, vegan and non-vegan options.

As the focus of One Health continues to crystalize and collaborations evolve, Wright encourages leaders to consider new conversations that feel unconventional. “Across Indiana’s leading R1 academic institutions, agbioscience and life sciences ecosystems, there is a massive opportunity to identify, ideate and solve some of the biggest challenges facing One Health. The conversations need to start in rooms with new faces where we learn new things, and that’s an exciting endeavor.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/BQ48t7yUlqk48ls0GQXpcR8nipu9I_vB8oYMIaW6EuE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9lbGFuY29fZ2xvYmFsX2hxXy1fa3ZfOTgxNC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-20 10:07:02.538556

Hope in data centre development?
However, BESS being tied to data centre development is not necessarily a sure thing.
Morrison says, “I think people have not totally figured out yet what role battery storage is going to play with data centres.
But we’ve not seen that deployed at the same scale as we have other technologies for purposes of behind-the-meter delivery to data centres.","This policy is expected to significantly affect Chinese companies or those with over 20% Chinese ownership, beginning at the end of this year.

As seen in Troutman Pepper Locke’s report and noted by other analysts, such as BloombergNEF’s Isshu Kikuma, the US is expected to see a significant amount of load growth over the next decade, primarily from the rapid development of data centres.

Industry discussion has seen data centre development as a potential lifeline for continued BESS project development.

Morrison highlights how companies are responding to the FEOC restrictions, as well as the pros and cons of integrating BESS with data centres.

The impacts of FEOC restrictions

“Battery storage emerged relatively unscathed from this budget reconciliation process, at least in the near and medium terms,” Morrison says.

“If you look at where the industry is now compared to where it was before the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed, when there were no tax credits for battery storage except to the extent paired with solar-plus-storage, the industry is much better off, for sure.”

Morrison hopes to see the industry grow, but acknowledges the current confusion companies are experiencing in maintaining eligibility requirements and navigating FEOC restrictions.

“There are developers that are closely held, and that’s the end of the discussion. Others are owned by hundreds of LPs, which is more complex. And then there are those who have publicly issued debt, multiple tranches of publicly issued debt over time. Going back and trying to figure out who it was sold to at the time of the issuance is just a Herculean task.”

John Leonti, a partner at Troutman, who contributed to the report with Morrison, notes, “The most prepared in the sector have acted nimbly to restructure supply chains, and key stakeholders are strengthening their close working relationships to share risk and collaboratively revise strategies.”

Morrison says a large focus has been placed on avoiding the need to restructure arrangements to allocate risk in the first place.

This is complicated because if a taxpayer, potentially including a tax equity investor, is the “wrong type” of entity, it could lead to a disallowance.

Morrison clarifies that when an FEOC holds too much of a taxpayer’s debt, it can lead to disallowance. Consequently, some companies are considering including representations and covenants to shift the risk to the party best able to manage it.

He says, “Our primary focus has been on negotiating risk allocation with suppliers and service contractors. This includes crafting contracts that may activate certain control categories, such as representations and covenants confirming that the counterpart is not, and will not become, a specified foreign entity.”

Morrison continues, “We’ve also dedicated significant effort to designing contracts that avoid triggering these categories, especially for clients with a more cautious approach. This involves removing affirmative licenses to prevent falling under licensing restrictions and adjusting clauses to ensure they are well within safe boundaries, providing greater certainty that these categories are not met.”

Additionally, the Troutman Pepper Locke partner notes that many companies have not previously needed to monitor debts and ownership details at this level of detail. Consequently, many are now “scrambling” to gather this information.

Hope in data centre development?

In a recent discussion with ESN Premium, Jason Abiecunas, business development manager at FlexGen, said:

“There is the potential that the data centre market is one of our larger market segments. It’s a significant driver of economic growth. It’s a significant driver of the next major wave of industrialisation. We see it as enduring, and we see it as significant.”

Morrison says that, perhaps crucially, to its relative sparing in the OBBBA, the storage industry has separated itself from the renewable energy industry, a “logical” decision, he notes.

The industry’s focus on providing energy security over being a renewable energy source has already had a bit of a ripple effect, with solar developers taking note of the messaging and others adapting it further.

BESS projects can help data centre developers manage power fluctuations and quality; the pairing makes logical sense. However, BESS being tied to data centre development is not necessarily a sure thing.

Morrison says, “I think people have not totally figured out yet what role battery storage is going to play with data centres. There are some intuitive use cases, particularly around pairing storage with intermittent generation, which is so important to a lot of the hyperscalers. But we’ve not seen that deployed at the same scale as we have other technologies for purposes of behind-the-meter delivery to data centres. So, that’s still early days.”

He continues, pointing out the risk as well: “The risk is that the load does not actually pan out the way people think it will, or that if it does, people are so focused on reliability that they just disregard non-conventional generation technologies altogether. So, there is a risk of either that boat not coming into port or missing that boat if other technologies gain an advantage that can’t be overcome.”

There are multiple unknowns for BESS and data centre development. As Thomas Cornell, CEO and President of Prevalon Energy, recently pointed out in a discussion with ESN Premium:

“I think everybody’s been following the existing process, but now the question is, are they going to declare an emergency?”

Cornell continued, “Then, the data centres are going to move to the front of the line, or some of these gas assets are being moved to the front. Especially now, the government has really hampered wind and solar. Most of the queues, if you look at them over the next five years, are flooded with wind and solar energy, mainly solar projects, and then gas is beyond that.”

“Now, you take solar out of the mix, and you cannot build gas generation fast enough. What are people left to do?”

In a situation like the one Cornell described, developers would find themselves in an even tougher spot, and have limited opportunities to pivot into other industries or niches.

Morrison explains, “If you’re just a general energy investor, then you probably just pivot to natural gas or data centres at that point. If you’re a battery storage developer, I think you’re focusing more on opportunities that are not as vulnerable to interconnection queue delays.”

“We have already seen a good bit of that in PJM and ISO New England, where existing interconnects are repurposed for ancillary services or what have you, and then focus on behind-the-meter applications,” he continues.

While a large number of projects are thought to be secure through Safe Harbouring, and onshoring the supply chain presents a potentially longer-term opportunity, creating domestic BESS products and adhering to FEOC restrictions remain a near-term issue that could become more significant.

Morrison says, “I think between the FEOC rules, the 45X credits and the domestic content bonus under the Inflation Reduction Act, what we’re seeing at the federal level is a unified market signal from both parties that domestic manufacturing is important, and it’s something that the federal government is investing in, regardless of who’s in power.”

“If you’re in the business of building the only thing that the two political parties can agree on, that’s a good business to be in, for sure.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-71.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:04.391137

According to a government report released on Sunday by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the decarbonisation plan will stimulate job creation across several sectors, including nuclear, renewable energy, carbon capture, and energy efficiency- Bloomberg first reported.

The report highlights that trades such as plumbing, carpentry, electrical work, and welding will experience significant demand growth as the country ramps up its clean energy infrastructure.

In the East of England, construction of the Sizewell C nuclear facility on the Suffolk coast is expected to generate around 10,000 jobs at peak construction.

Meanwhile, Scotland and the North East of England will see approximately 35,000 jobs supported by carbon capture and storage projects. London’s clean energy workforce could also more than double, with up to 25,000 people employed directly in the sector by the end of the decade.

A breakdown of the report

The report noted that the clean energy expansion will require a major skills upgrade to meet labour demands.

By 2030, the number of plumbers and carpenters will need to double compared to 2023 levels, while the number of welders must triple to support the planned growth.

The government has committed to increased funding for vocational training and technical education to bridge the skills gap.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized that the government’s priority is to ensure British workers benefit directly from the green jobs boom. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Miliband stated, “We will do everything we can to make sure that these jobs go to workers from Britain.” He added that the government aims to train about 20,000 people to prepare them for the new employment opportunities in clean energy industries.

“Where are the good jobs of the future going to come from? What’s the job my son or daughter can do in the future?” Miliband said. “This is the answer: clean energy jobs working on nuclear power stations, offshore wind, and carbon capture.”

What you should know

However, reports have raised concerns that the government’s projections may be overly optimistic, noting that the UK could face challenges in sourcing workers with the necessary expertise domestically.

Some reports warn that additional reliance on skilled labour from abroad could increase costs for employers and slow down project timelines.

Despite the skepticism, the Labour government maintains that its green transition plan will be a cornerstone of the UK’s economic renewal strategy, positioning clean energy as both an environmental and employment driver.

Earlier, Nairametrics reported that the British government had announced a record £3 billion investment in skills training, aimed at reducing the country’s dependence on foreign labour by equipping locals with industry-relevant skills.

The initiative is expected to create 120,000 training opportunities across high-demand sectors, including construction, engineering, health and social care, and digital.

The initiative is part of the UK’s broader goal to achieve a net-zero energy system by 2050, with significant progress targeted by 2030 through investments in nuclear power, offshore wind, and carbon capture technologies.",https://nairametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/United-States-1.png,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:42.812790

On Oct. 19, the government published a comprehensive national plan to train up the next generation of clean energy workers, with employment expected to double to 860,000 by 2030, ensuring jobs are high quality and well paid.

The government is aiming to galvanize industry, the public sector, and education providers to work together to deliver one cohesive strategy to invest in training for specific in demand occupations, setting clear workforce estimates for the first time.

The Energy Secretary will also set out how the government sees trade unions as an essential part of the modern workplace and economy. Across the broader energy sector, trade union coverage has declined from over 70 percent in the mid-90s to around 30 percent currently. Recognizing trade unions is vital to securing high pay and good conditions for workers.

“Communities have long been calling out for a new generation of good industrial jobs” said Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. ""The clean energy jobs boom can answer that call - and today we publish a landmark national plan to make it happen. Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job. Thanks to this government's commitment to clean energy, a generation of young people in our industrial heartlands can have well-paid secure jobs, from plumbers to electricians and welders. This is a pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-union agenda that will deliver the national renewal our country needs.""

The government's clean energy mission has already galvanized over £50 billion of private investment since last July.

For young people, these jobs can offer higher levels of pay- with entry level roles in the majority of occupations in clean energy paying 23 percent more than the same occupations in other sectors.

“We're giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry - and will drive growth across the nation” added Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden. “Our new jobs plan will unlock real opportunities and ensure everyone has access to the training and support to secure the well-paid jobs that will power our country's future, as part of our Plan for Change.”

New initiatives include:

Training up the next generation of clean energy workers - Five new Technical Excellence Colleges will help train young people into essential roles. Skills pilots in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire will be supported by a total of £2.5 million – which could go towards new training centres, courses or career advisers.

Harnessing the valuable expertise and transferrable skills of veterans - Working with Mission Renewable, the government is launching a new program to match veterans up with careers in solar panel installation and wind turbine factories, alongside other roles in nuclear power stations.

Tailored schemes for ex-offenders, school leavers, and the unemployed – Last year alone, 13,700 people who were out of work possessed many of the skills required for key roles in the clean energy sector, such as engineering and skilled trades.

Upskill existing workers - Oil and gas workers will benefit from up to £20 million in total from the UK and Scottish Governments to provide bespoke careers training for thousands of new roles in clean energy. This follows high demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot, which is already supporting workers into new careers. Government is also extending the 'energy skills passport', which identifies routes for oil and gas workers to easily transition into roles in offshore wind and to new sectors such as the electricity grid.

The plan also includes landmark proposals to ensure that jobs in the clean energy sector have world class pay, terms and conditions.

Closing loopholes in legislation to extend employment protections enjoyed by offshore oil and gas workers working beyond UK territorial seas, including the national minimum wage, to the clean energy sector.

A new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights.

Workforce criteria in grants and procurements to test and pilot innovative ways to drive fair work and skills in DESNZ grants and contracts, including through the Clean Industry Bonus and Great British Energy.

This comes after the Prime Minister announced a package of reforms to elevate and transform the education skills system, with a new target for two-thirds of young people to participate in higher-level learning – academic, technical or apprenticeships – by age 25, up from 50 percent currently.

With at least one in six ex-military already armed with many of the skills needed for the clean energy sector, the government is joining forces with Mission Renewable to match them up with careers in solar panel installation and wind turbine factories.

The pilot will initially focus on the East of England, which will benefit from the biggest increase in the size of the clean energy workforce with over 55,000 people expected to be employed in the sector by the end of the decade.

The initiative, announced by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, will focus on training workers for roles in solar, wind, nuclear and other low-carbon industries. Plumbers, electricians and welders are among 31 priority occupations identified as being “particularly in demand.”

Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Miliband said the new jobs are essential to achieving the UK’s energy ambitions. “Four hundred thousand jobs is not a target, it’s what we need,” he said. “Our plans will help create an economy in which there is no need to leave your hometown just to find a decent job.”

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said employment in the sector is expected to double to 860,000 within five years. Five “technical excellence colleges” will be created to deliver clean energy training, with £2.5m in funding for pilot schemes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire.

The government will also launch a programme to help veterans move into clean energy roles such as solar panel installation and wind turbine maintenance. Oil and gas workers will be offered up to £20m in retraining support, funded jointly by the UK and Scottish governments. Tailored schemes will also support ex-offenders, school leavers and unemployed individuals.

Miliband confirmed that construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station will create around 10,000 jobs. He also highlighted growth at Siemens’ wind turbine factory in Hull, describing it as “booming.”

According to DESNZ, clean energy jobs currently pay an average salary of more than £50,000 compared to the national average of £37,000.

Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said: “We’re giving workers the skills needed to switch to clean energy, which is good for them, good for industry and will drive growth across the nation.”

Industry and union leaders welcomed the move. Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, called it “a critical step forward in building the workforce required to deliver our future energy system.”

Unison general secretary Christina McAnea added that investment in apprenticeships and training “could help create a UK workforce with highly skilled, fairly paid and secure jobs.”",https://www.energylivenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Shutterstock_2487076075.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:27:52.167401

The Solar for All program, managed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), aimed to fund solar installations for disadvantaged households. The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced its termination in August, calling it a “boondoggle”. The agency declined to comment on ongoing litigation.

California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said the cancellation violates federal obligations and would strip billions from renewable energy investments. “The Trump administration is trying to hold us in the past, tethered to fossil fuel companies,” he said. “In doing so, Trump is making America more expensive and more polluted.”

California will lose around $250m in congressionally approved funds, while Arizona will forfeit $156m. Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said the move will affect 900,000 low-income households nationwide, including 11,000 in her state. She warned that energy bills could rise by 20%. “Without this program, for many Arizonans, clean energy will be out of reach,” she said.

The lawsuits, filed in the court of federal claims and federal court in Washington state, seek monetary damages and reinstatement of the program. They follow a separate legal challenge from solar companies and labor unions filed earlier this month.

The cancellation stems from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by Donald Trump in July, which eliminated the program’s funding source. The president has repeatedly rolled back support for renewable energy, describing solar and wind as unreliable and costly.

Mayes highlighted the impact on Arizona’s Hopi tribe, which was set to receive $25m to bring electricity to hundreds of homes using solar and battery systems.

The IEA’s Energy Policy Review of Mozambique was officially launched today alongside complementary IEA analysis, National Climate Resilience Assessment for Mozambique, during the 5th Energy Seminar of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) in Maputo. The Seminar is part of the CPLP Energy and Climate week, co-organised by the Lusophone Renewable Energy Association (ALER) and the Association of the Portuguese-Speaking Energy Regulators (RELOP).

IEA Deputy Executive Director Mary Burce Warlick launched both reports in the opening ceremony of the CPLP Seminar, which also included remarks from Ms. Marcelina Mataveia, National Energy Director at the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy of Mozambique. Speaking by video message, Ms Warlick said: “Mozambique is a country with tremendous energy potential. From vast natural gas reserves to abundant hydropower, solar and wind resources, the foundations are in place to build a modern, inclusive, and sustainable energy system. With the right partnerships, planning, and investment, Mozambique can turn its energy potential into lasting development gains.”

The IEA worked closely with the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy of Mozambique for the preparation of the Energy Policy Review, which benefitted from broad consultations with the key stakeholders across the energy sector, ranging from public bodies to development partners, private sector developers, academia, civil society and commercial banks. The review takes stock of progress in expanding electricity access and encourages continued efforts to strengthen governance, coordination, and data quality for the government to achieve its energy and development goals.

Over the past decade, Mozambique nearly doubled its electrification rate thanks to grid extensions and off-grid solutions. Yet, more than half of the population still lacked access to electricity in 2022, and access to clean cooking is critically low, with just 7% of the population using modern solutions. The report shows that mini-grids and standalone solar home systems will be key to enable least-cost electricity access in rural areas, but further efforts are needed to stimulate market development in these sectors, which remain dependant on public funding.

Through its Energy Transition Strategy (ETE), approved in 2023, Mozambique has set a long-term vision to achieve universal, affordable, and reliable access to modern energy by 2030. It aims to leverage Mozambique abundant energy resources – including hydropower, solar, wind, biomass, and some of the world’s largest natural gas reserves – to build a modern and inclusive energy system, accelerate industrialisation and move up the value chain of critical minerals.

However, implementation of the ETE faces constraints, including infrastructure and affordability challenges. Mozambique’s investment environment is hampered by a high cost of capital, restricting access to finance for projects and making it hard to close the country’s energy infrastructure gap. While Mozambique is already exporting LNG, major projects have been delayed, and the anticipated benefits have yet to materialise. The government has established a new Sovereign Wealth Fund to help manage the financial revenues generated from the country’s gas operations.

Moreover, Mozambique has developed a strong policy foundation for enhancing climate resilience and adaptation, including the National Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Strategy (NCCAMS) and the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The National Climate Resilience Assessment for Mozambique highlights that further benefits could be achieved by developing a comprehensive adaptation plan for the energy sector, conducting detailed analyses of climate impacts on hydropower, and promoting coordinated actions through collaborative frameworks and capacity-building programmes.",https://iea.imgix.net/250e83dd-7e90-483f-a65d-f189274c1f96/AerialofskylineofMaputo_Mozambique_shutterstock_1458983672.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=min&h=600&q=80&rect=902%2C0%2C2772%2C2772&w=1200,N,,2025-10-20 11:28:32.111394

This is why I am calling upon the Long Beach business community and every concerned stakeholder to stand up now for a balanced energy approach.","The current state of California’s energy policy landscape reflects the ongoing debate over how to best balance energy needs and preferences with resource reliability, evolving environmental protections and the economy’s vitality.

Business groups, labor organizations and communities across both the state and here locally in Long Beach are calling for a solution that prioritizes a thoughtful energy transition. There must be prioritization for an even-handed plan capable of respecting the real-world economic pressures faced by working families, businesses and industries.

In Long Beach, this crucial need is sewn into the very fabric of our communities. We are a proudly diverse, deeply progressive city complemented by the busiest, most robust port complex in North America, “America’s Coolest Airport” and some of the nation’s most innovative aerospace companies. While we are all dedicated to working towards a cleaner energy future, we are also deeply tied to logistics, manufacturing, the working communities and the small businesses that rely on affordable, reliable fuel and transportation.

Our values are being directly challenged by the state’s recent energy policies, and their unintended consequences. A gas excise tax increase on July 1, the newly expanded Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) mandates, and the pending closures of the Phillips 66 refinery in Wilmington and the Valero refinery in Benicia (which together account for over 17% of in-state fuel production) each promise unnecessary, self-inflicted economic hardships in our community. There is an economic storm brewing across the state; Long Beach as a trade hub must also navigate the impacts of federal trade volatility.

Regulations must be realistic

Trade through the Port of Long Beach supports nearly 2.7 million jobs nationwide, contributes $309 billion to GDP and generates $84 billion in tax revenue. In the five-county Southern California region, over 691,000 jobs are connected to port trade, construction, and tourism – or 1 out of every 17 jobs. As a sobering reminder of what is at stake, port and civic leaders emphasize that a 10% drop in cargo cost more than 100,000 jobs regionally.

Continuing to add fuel costs to our industries and partners already dealing with historically tight margins will be more than the straw that breaks the camel’s back. Our drayage trucks, freight operators and warehouse workers depend on diesel. Each incremental cent at the pump adds up fast.

Take for example, Ability TriModal, an award-winning transportation company that has specialized in trans-loading, consolidation and deconsolidation, warehousing, and retail delivery in Long Beach since 1947 and proud member of The Chamber since 1984.

Few companies embody the realities of California’s energy policy shifts more than they do. Having worked directly with the EPA and CARB since the 1980s, they’ve seen every iteration of environmental regulation come down the pipeline. What they will tell you is not that change is unwelcome, but that mandates too often arrive without consultation, scientific grounding or realistic timelines. The result is technology and regulation moving on two separate tracks: manufacturers can’t build fast enough, technicians can’t be trained fast enough and companies are left with equipment that is too expensive, too unreliable and too quickly obsolete.

It’s not that there is opposition to innovation; there is opposition to this mandate-first mentality that ignores on-the-ground realities and undermines the very spirit of American industry – the drive to continuously make things better. For businesses both in and beyond this industry, California’s current path risks sidelining progress by setting rules we cannot realistically follow.

Long Beach is a forward-thinking community capable of balancing industry growth and environmental sustainability. From the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, to the groundbreaking Clean Trucks Program, to investments into green infrastructure expansion, we have proven we are dedicated to working together to build a bridge to a cleaner future, but one our businesses are still able to walk across.

Young entrepreneurs and climate-considerate workers are looking for a path in the middle. They want to see job growth in logistics, clean manufacturing, port-adjacent green tech. What they don’t want is being forced to choose clean energy at the expense of local wages and commerce.

This is why I am calling upon the Long Beach business community and every concerned stakeholder to stand up now for a balanced energy approach. We must continue to invest in initiatives like port-side charging or hydrogen fueling infrastructure, advocate for stable trade policy, and ensure our workers and businesses have access to reliable, affordable energy. Our infrastructure, our industry, our communities are simply not prepared for the burdensome and unrealistic mandates set upon us by the state.

This is not a call to retreat from progressive environmental values; it is instead an embrace of a solution that balances our unique economic realities. That fact that there is debate in Sacramento represents our progress already. Legislators and regulators are listening. It is time that we speak up.",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LABJ-placeholder-logos-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:28:35.315144

This month, we continue our crusade to bring back American energy dominance, uplift the American worker, protect the American industry, cherish American resources, and make America the most prosperous country on the face of the Earth.","President Donald Trump issued a Proclamation declaring the month of October as National Energy Dominance Month.

Trump was Monday’s KVML “Newsmaker of the Day”. Here are his words:

“From the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River to the Great Plains and beyond, for nearly 250 years, America has been endlessly sustained and enriched by our abundance of precious natural resources like oil, clean coal, minerals, and natural gas. This National Energy Dominance Month, my Administration proudly recommits to harnessing the liquid gold and minerals under our feet and bountiful resources in our waters, forests, and fields, achieving American energy dominance, and forging a future defined by three simple words: “Drill, baby, drill.”

During my first term in office, America became the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world and the coal industry was coming back — after eight hard years of Obama’s War on Coal. Tragically, after the conclusion of my first term, the previous administration launched a war on American energy — reversing all of my historic first term actions, leading all 50 States to hit record-high gas prices. Meanwhile, the Green New Scam shuttered dozens of coal plants leaving our power grid vulnerable, halted mining productions, and shipped our energy jobs from Texas to Tehran, from the Midwest to Moscow, and from Baton Rouge to Beijing. As I have stated many times before, energy security is national security. My predecessor outrageously depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve — emboldening our enemies and making us reliant on foreign nations while subjecting the American people to sky-high energy prices here at home.

This period of national self-destruction ended on January 20, 2025. As the 47th President of the United States, my energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power. On my first day in office, I declared a National Energy Emergency to lower escalating energy prices. I signed an Executive Order to unleash American energy, which rolled back energy restrictions imposed by the previous administration. I established the National Energy Dominance Council to ensure the American energy industry maintains its global leadership in the decades to come. I also took action to revive America’s dominance in offshore critical minerals and resources, lift burdensome regulations on coal plants to ensure they can continue to run, launch the nuclear energy renaissance, and open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, one of the largest drilling sites in the world. Every day, we are making good on our promise to restore the United States as a global energy superpower — and our work has only just begun. Now, under my Administration, our workers are drilling, mining, and producing like never before.

This month, we continue our crusade to bring back American energy dominance, uplift the American worker, protect the American industry, cherish American resources, and make America the most prosperous country on the face of the Earth.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2025 as National Energy Dominance Month.”

Researchers are proposing an approach that will allow policymakers and technology developers to better align the values programmed into smart city technologies with the ethics of the people who will be interacting with them.

“Our work here lays out a blueprint for how we can both establish what an AI-driven technology’s values should be and actually program those values into the relevant AI systems,” says Veljko Dubljević, corresponding author of a paper on the work and Joseph D. Moore Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at North Carolina State University.

At issue are smart cities, a catch-all term that covers a variety of technological and administrative practices that have emerged in cities in recent decades. Examples include automated technologies that dispatch law enforcement when they detect possible gunfire, or technologies that use automated sensors to monitor pedestrian and auto traffic to control everything from street lights to traffic signals.

“These technologies can pose significant ethical questions,” says Dubljević, who is part of the Science, Technology & Society program at NC State.

“For example, if AI technology presumes it detected a gunshot and sends a SWAT team to a place of business, but the noise was actually something else, is that reasonable?” Dubljević asks. “Who decides to what extent people should be tracked or surveilled by smart city technologies? Which behaviors should mark someone out as an individual who should be under escalated surveillance? These are reasonable questions, and at the moment there is no agreed upon procedure for answering them. And there is definitely not a clear procedure for how we should train AI to answer these questions.”

To address this challenge, the researchers looked to something called the Agent Deed Consequence (ADC) model. The ADC model holds that people take three things into account when making a moral judgment: the agent, which is the character or intent of the person who is doing something; the deed, or what is being done; and the consequence, or the outcome that results from the deed.

In their paper, the researchers demonstrate that the ADC model can be used to not only capture how humans make value judgments and ethical decisions, but can do so in a way that can be programmed into an AI system. This is possible because the ADC model uses deontic logic, which is a type of imperative logic.

“It allows us to capture not only what is true, but what should be done,” says Daniel Shussett, first author of the paper and a postdoctoral researcher at NC State. “This is important because it drives action, and can be used by an AI system to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate orders or requests.”

“For example, if an AI system is tasked with managing traffic and an ambulance with flashing emergency lights approaches a traffic light, this may be a signal to the AI that the ambulance should have priority and alter traffic signals to help it travel quickly,” says Dubljević. “That would be a legitimate request. But if a random vehicle puts flashing lights on its roof in an attempt to get through traffic more quickly, that would be an illegitimate request and the AI should not give them a green light.

“With humans, it is possible to explain things in a way where people learn what should and shouldn’t be done, but that doesn’t work with computers. Instead, you have to be able to create a mathematical formula that represents the chain of reasoning. The ADC model allows us to create that formula.”

“These emerging smart city technologies are being adopted around the world, and the work we’ve done here suggests the ADC model can be used to address the full scope of ethical questions these technologies pose,” says Shussett. “The next step is to test a variety of scenarios across multiple technologies in simulations to ensure the model works in a consistent, predictable way. If it passes those tests, it would be ready for testing in real-world settings.”

This proposed amendment is similar to what voters in eight states considered in 2024; all eight approved the language.
In Maine, voters — via one citizen-initiated question — will decide whether to amend state law to make several voting-related changes.
Parental Rights A proposed constitutional amendment in Texas would, affirm “that parents are the primary decision makers for their children,” the ballot title says.
Taxes and State Investments A majority of the ballot measures in Texas relate to taxes.","Voters in six states will consider ballot measures this November, including a proposed redistricting amendment in California that is part of a national battle over who will control the U.S. House of Representatives after the 2026 elections.

Colorado, Maine, New York, Texas, and Washington also have measures up for a vote this year. Seventeen of the 26 total measures will appear on Texans’ ballots.

Unlike in 2024, when access to reproductive care was put to voters in 10 states, no single issue dominates across the country. Some voters will, however, see propositions similar to those popular on 2024 ballots, including adding language to constitutionally limit the right to vote to citizens and initiatives to require voter ID. Below are some of the issues the measures address.

Redistricting

California’s Proposition 50 is a legislatively referred constitutional amendment that would allow use of a new congressional district map until 2030. The map is designed to favor Democratic candidates for the U.S. House. Drawing a new map was endorsed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) after Texas Republicans, with the encouragement of President Donald Trump, began discussing — and subsequently passed — a new congressional map in their state that favors Republicans and is expected to flip five current Democratic seats. If Proposition 50 passes, five California congressional seats are expected to become either competitive for or easily winnable by Democratic candidates.

Congressional maps are usually only redrawn after release of the once-a-decade census results. Mid-cycle redraws, as Texas did, are rare. Proposition 50 would also require that, following the 2030 elections and thus the 2030 census, power to draw congressional lines would return to the state’s nonpartisan redistricting committee.

Voting

Voters in Texas will decide whether to amend their constitution to say that “persons who are not citizens of the United States” cannot vote in Texas. This proposed amendment is similar to what voters in eight states considered in 2024; all eight approved the language. Both state and federal law already limit voting to citizens only, and noncitizens voting in elections is extremely rare.

In Maine, voters — via one citizen-initiated question — will decide whether to amend state law to make several voting-related changes. Multiple of the changes relate to limiting absentee voting, like eliminating two days of absentee voting, banning prepaid potage on absentee ballot return envelopes, ending ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, and requiring voters to provide proof of photo ID before voting absentee. The measure would also require photo ID for in-person voting.

Maine saw its second-highest absentee voting levels in 2024 (after only the 2020 election, during the pandemic). Limiting access to by-mail voting is a focus of the Trump administration. The League of Women Voters has urged Maine citizens to vote no on the question.

Gun Laws

Question two on Maine’s ballot relates to firearm restrictions. The citizen-initiated measure asks voters whether state law should be amended to “allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger” to themselves or others.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills (D) is against the measure. She argues gun laws already on the books allow law enforcement to take necessary steps to remove firearms from those who are a danger and that any removal process should be initiated by contacting law enforcement and not be left up to family members or friends to navigate the court procedures. Difficulties family members could encounter if they choose the court process, such as feelings of confusion or intimidation regarding what is required, might deter them from following through with getting the necessary help, she writes.

Parental Rights

A proposed constitutional amendment in Texas would, affirm “that parents are the primary decision makers for their children,” the ballot title says. The Texas Tribune described the amendment as codifying in the state constitution rights that are currently defined mostly in federal court cases.

Judicial Conduct

Another proposed Texas amendment would change the makeup of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, including by increasing the number of citizens on the commission who are selected by the governor from five to seven, which would give the governor the power to appoint a majority of the commission’s 13 members. The amendment would also alter how the chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court selects the tribunals that review the commission’s recommendations for removal or retirement of a judge and restrict the commission’s ability to issue private reprimands in certain circumstances. Current Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) previously removed acting commissioners for their 2019 decision to reprimand a judge who was refusing to conduct same-sex marriages.

Environment

Texas’s ballot also includes a proposed amendment that would dedicate a portion of certain tax revenue to the Texas water fund and to provide for the allocation of that revenue. The proposed amendment comes as at least one estimate said a major drought could mean the state couldn’t meet its water supply needs as soon as 2030. If the amendment passes, funds could be used to repair aging infrastructure and develop new water sources.

A proposed amendment in New York would allow for the development of winter sports facilities on more than 300 acres of a sports complex in the Adirondack mountains, but would also require preserving more than 2,500 acres of land in the area.

Criminal Law

Texas’s Proposition 4 would make several changes to the state constitution’s provisions relating to certain criminal offenses — including capital murder, aggravated sexual assault, or indecency with a child — to deny the accused bail if the state shows “by a preponderance of the evidence” that bail is not sufficient to prevent the defendant’s “nonappearance” in court or ensure the safety of the community.

Taxes and State Investments

A majority of the ballot measures in Texas relate to taxes. Some of Texas’s measures involve a ban on capital gains taxes for individuals or estates, a tax exemption related to “border security infrastructure,” school tax exemptions for the elderly, and increased property tax exemptions that will allow Texas homeowners to pay lower taxes for public school funds.

A Colorado proposition would lower some citizens’ tax deduction limits in order to generate funds for Healthy School Meals for All Programs. A proposed amendment in Washington would allow a specific state fund to be invested in stocks. Currently, the state constitution forbids investment of public funds in private stocks, thus limiting state investments to less risky options like government bonds. The amendment had bipartisan support in the state legislature.

• • •

Most of the measures up for vote next month would amend states constitutions and were initiated by state legislators, who voted to put the measure up for public approval. Maine’s, however, are citizen-initiated legislative changes rather than constitutional amendments. The measures need a simple majority of the public vote to pass.

,Texas American Energy ,2025-10-20 12:21:57+00:00,Solar Power World,EG4 meets the moment in solar with budget-friendly off-grid products,Kelsey Misbrener,,,,,https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2025/10/eg4-meets-the-moment-in-solar-with-budget-friendly-off-grid-products/,"EG4 and its parent company Energy Access Innovations (EAI) were created in rural Sulphur Springs, Texas, by CEO James Showalter.
He and his team noticed many of the residential solar products on the market weren’t the best fit for its customer base.
Showalter’s DIY roots mean the products are designed with the off-grid solar customer front-of-mind.
The user-friendly elements of EG4’s products are another selling point for West Texas Solar.
“I know that they are continually adding new products, and I hope there’s compatibility with old products to new products.","Catching the solar industry’s attention sometimes means spending money on an enormous booth at RE+. Other times, word of mouth can bring a brand to the forefront without too much flashy marketing.

Hybrid inverter + battery storage manufacturer EG4 Electronics is one of those companies the residential solar industry can’t stop talking about right now — and the transformation from a modest, far-flung RE+ booth in 2024 to hefty square footage in the main exhibit hall in 2025 reflected that come-up.

“They weren’t really on my radar, and then I just kept hearing people ask about it, ask about it, ask about it. So then it makes you go, ‘OK, well, what is this?'” said Gage Mueller, senior energy consultant at Texas-based Solstice Solar.

EG4 and its parent company Energy Access Innovations (EAI) were created in rural Sulphur Springs, Texas, by CEO James Showalter. Showalter started his solar journey in the DIY community, installing a fully off-grid system on his family’s home in 2013. From there, he opened a long-tail solar installation company in West Texas. Ever the entrepreneur, he gave the company to one of his brothers to start a new endeavor — a solar product distribution company called Signature Solar that sold the products he wished he had access to at his installation firm.

Focusing on the DIY market meant fielding many questions from homeowners, so Signature established a call center with NABCEP-trained customer representatives.

“We were taking over 10,000 consultative phone calls a week with people building systems. The idea for an OEM new-generation storage manufacturer came within the first year,” Showalter said.

He and his team noticed many of the residential solar products on the market weren’t the best fit for its customer base. Many were tailored to the customers in the largest solar state of California — homeowners with relatively low energy demand, high energy prices and decent net-metering rates to sell power back to utilities (prior to NEM 3.0).

“When you define the problem by that market, it becomes irrelevant to the rest of the country, because the energy costs are much, much higher in California than the rest of the country, and people use less energy, so you end up with higher-priced hardware that isn’t designed to put out high power,” Showalter said.

So he set out to create a product that would work for a market like his hometown in Texas — high energy demand, lower but rising energy costs, and little to no incentive to export power to the grid.

Partnering with a Chinese OEM called LuxpowerTek, in 2020 Showalter launched EG4 — which stands for “energy generation for everyone” — to close that gap he saw in the market. EG4 makes hybrid inverters such as the FlexBOSS, the 18k and 12k, as well as wall-mounted batteries. Showalter’s DIY roots mean the products are designed with the off-grid solar customer front-of-mind.

“We’re an off-grid system that [was] designed to hook up to the grid. Most of the systems out there are grid-tied systems that they’re trying to go back and add off-grid functionality to,” he said. “Our inverter, for instance, can start a 5-ton air conditioner right out of the box. That’s not even a design protocol for most of the other battery ESS providers.”

Installer experience

EG4 isn’t the first to prioritize the off-grid or hybrid solar customer, but installers having issues with other manufacturers have found success with the company.

“The companies that I was using before, their service seemed to tank around the time EG4 was coming out, and EG4 service has been pretty spot-on,” said Rudy Wright, CEO of East Texas installer Wright-Way Solar Technologies.

The first generation of EG4’s products weren’t UL-rated or grid-interactive, and they also had quality issues, according to Wright and Landon Liles, VP of operations for West Texas Solar. But the installers say the company has addressed those problems in its current models.

“The RMA process is super simple on the very few issues that we have had with the inverters. But the batteries have been, I would say, foolproof,” Liles said.

Aside from reliable service, the biggest draw of EG4 has been the low prices.

“Their 14-kWh battery hit the market at one-third of the price-per-kWh of the one I was selling prior to that,” Wright said. “I was willing to sell American-made at a 20 to 30% premium. But by the time you’re at a 66% premium… I have to get off the boat of American-made and jump into China import.”

West Texas Solar has had nearly 100% battery attachment rates on solar jobs for the past two years, with customers wanting more backup power as utilities pivot away from export compensation. EG4’s larger, low-cost battery checked those boxes.

“We realized that grid-tied-only was not working out for them, and assuming that utilities are going to buy your power back is a wrong assumption,” Liles said. “We needed bigger battery banks that don’t cost an arm and a leg.”

Now, West Texas Solar is installing at least two EG4 outdoor-rated batteries on every job.

“Having it truly outdoor-rated allows us to take up a lot less space in the garage or on the walls, and we can put it under our ground mounts, or kind of get creative with our placement of the batteries,” Liles said.

The user-friendly elements of EG4’s products are another selling point for West Texas Solar. Homeowners can click a button for pre-loaded settings that meet their needs, including nighttime battery use or self-consumption.

“From the installation to the commissioning to the support in the design, it’s been good, and I hope it stays that way,” Liles said. “I know that they are continually adding new products, and I hope there’s compatibility with old products to new products. People want to add on to their systems — hopefully that all meshes well and it doesn’t get too software-heavy.”

2026 plans and FEOC

As the end of the 25D residential ITC approaches this year, budget-friendly solar products like EG4’s are only going to become more important.

“With the tax credit going away, with homeowners not wanting to rely on the grid anymore — now this is an affordable option, even without the tax credit,” said Mueller of Solstice Solar.

At the same time, more residential installers may turn to TPO financing structures to claim the 48E ITC — and will need to comply with new FEOC requirements limiting products from China and other countries.

EG4 is working on options for both categories of installers going into 2026.

“A lot of companies are going to raise the price for higher FEOC compliance, and they’re going to douse their 25D folks. We created a dual solution,” Showalter said.

Last summer, EG4 opened a 310,000-ft2 manufacturing facility in Commerce, Texas, to start assembling product in the United States. The company also acquired U.S. off-grid solar manufacturer OutBack Power to “combine OutBack’s legacy of engineering excellence with EAI’s global resources.”

In the fall, EG4 formed a supply partnership with LG Energy Solution to purchase 13.5 GWh of Michigan-made battery cells through 2030 that it will assemble into batteries at its Commerce facility for a “hyper-compliant” product, to be paired with its next-generation inverter. The company will still have Chinese batteries available for installers looking for cheaper options and not concerned with FEOC restrictions.

“We have a unified home EMS inverter and energy management platform, but we have a domestic content battery that’s rigorously compliant that we can bolt on, or we have a Chinese battery,” Showalter said.

Despite its humble DIY-focused beginnings, EG4 is becoming a recognizable name in solar during this time of slashed federal incentives and waning utility compensation.

“I think that’s what they initially started doing, was off-grid, and that’s what their passion was. And they still carry that with them, but have realized that they can compete with everybody else too,” Liles said.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EG4-texas-manufacturing-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:29:25.949984

The Stellantis U.S. investment expands the automaker’s presence across its 34 manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, and R&D sites in 14 states. These operations already support more than 48,000 employees, 2,600 dealers, and 2,300 suppliers, it said.

The projects cover Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. ""The upgrades supported by this financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy"", AEP said in a press release.

""Energy demand is increasing across AEP’s footprint. Customers have committed to business expansions or additions that will require an additional 24 gigawatts of electricity demand by the end of the decade"", the Columbus, Ohio-based company said.

""The upgrades have primarily been identified to support data center, artificial intelligence and manufacturing development and represent generational load growth on the electric system.

""Seeking federal funding opportunities and implementing rate structures that ensure new large customers are supporting infrastructure investment are some of the ways AEP is working to reduce rate impacts for customers"".

It estimates the projects to save customers $275 million in financing costs over the life of the loan through lower bills.

""Approximately 100 miles of transmission lines across Ohio and Oklahoma are the first projects to be supported by the loan guarantee"", AEP said.

This is ""the first closed loan guarantee under the Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) Program created by the Working Families Tax Cut, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act"", DOE said separately.

""All electric utilities receiving an EDF loan must provide assurance to DOE that financial benefits from the financing will be passed onto the customers of that utility"", DOE added.

The AEP guarantee ""was carefully evaluated under the new LPO [Loan Programs Office] guidance directed by Secretary Wright"", DOE added.

Funding Cancelations

Days earlier, DOE announced it had terminated nearly 350 financial awards for over 200 projects, ""resulting in a savings of approximately $7.56 billion for American taxpayers"".

Targeted were awards by the Clean Energy Demonstrations Office, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office, the Grid Deployment Office, the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy Office and the Fossil Energy Office, DOE said in an online statement October 2.

""Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars"", DOE claimed.

Of the terminated awards, 25 percent were granted by the Biden administration between Election Day and the end of the administration, totaling over $3.1 billion, according to DOE.

The reviews were conducted under Energy Secretary Chris Wright's ""Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance Memorandum"", issued May 15. The memorandum said it is DOE's policy to ensure federally backed projects are ""financially sound and economically viable, aligned with national and economic security interests, and consistent with federal law and this administration's policies and priorities and program goals and priorities (standards)"".

""If it is determined that projects do not meet standards, DOE may modify the project or, DOE in its discretion, may terminate the project based on the outcome of DOE's evaluation, as allowed by law"", stated the memorandum, published on DOE's website.

The Friday Award pairs a former Faculty Fellow or Academic Leadership Fellow with an undergraduate student to work on a research project.","Doctoral student Sejal Mahendru grew up in New Delhi, India, where experiencing air pollution was a part of daily life. She recalls heavy smog, especially in the winter months, from industrial waste and agricultural crop burning to the north.

It was a tangible problem, something you could see and feel. Today, Mahendru, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in English and comparative literature with an interest in environmental humanities, is working on a far more invisible problem closer to her Carolina home.

PFAS is the abbreviation for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which are found in a variety of consumer products including nonstick cookware, fast-food containers, microwave popcorn bags, water-repellant clothing and firefighting foam. These human-created substances are often called “forever chemicals” and “legacy pollutants” because they are extremely difficult to break down over time and can be present in water, soil, air and food.

“The forever nature of PFAS is really scary. It’s nebulous. It’s everywhere,” Mahendru said.

Peer-reviewed studies have shown that high levels of PFAS exposure may lead to negative health effects, including increased risk for certain cancers, fertility issues and developmental delays, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

UNC-Chapel Hill is a leader in studying how to mitigate the impact of PFAS in North Carolina, with researchers from chemistry to public health working on the issue.

But Mahendru is part of a team of scholars, led by English faculty members Jordynn Jack and Courtney Rivard, who are examining the effects of PFAS exposure on people’s lives via a humanities lens. The team is gathering oral histories from residents in Pittsboro, North Carolina — Chapel Hill’s southern neighbor — where PFAS has been identified in some drinking water.

Creating a story archive

Different personal and professional experiences led Jack and Rivard, both leaders in the field of rhetoric, to team up to explore the impact of PFAS.

Jack grew up in Chatham, Ontario, Canada, and became interested in how community members there were dealing with water quality issues in their rural area after the installation of wind turbines.

During the pandemic, Rivard and her family discovered a new passion: exploring the Haw River by canoe. She also began reading news stories about some PFAS being found in the Haw River, which is Pittsboro’s drinking water source. The Haw is part of the Cape Fear River Basin, which extends into 26 counties in North Carolina. The Cape Fear River flows into the Atlantic Ocean.

The duo also realized the value of joining strengths through their respective English research labs — Jack co-directs the Health and Humanities: An Interdisciplinary Venue for Exploration Lab, also known as the HHIVE Lab, and Rivard directs the Digital Literacy and Communications Lab or DLC Lab.

Their resulting project is Forever Chemicals: A Story Archive in North Carolina, where they will develop a digital platform for sharing stories and valuable resources for people living with PFAS exposure. In the pilot phase of the project, the team has conducted and transcribed five oral histories, with a goal of gathering 15-20 interviews before creating a public-facing website. The oral histories are being stored in University Libraries’ Carolina Digital Repository and will eventually become part of the Southern Oral History Program. SOHP’s unofficial motto is “You don’t have to be famous for your life to be history.”

What can humanistic research methods bring to this multi-faceted problem?

“We’re really interested in hearing how people are making sense of this complicated issue through community-engaged research,” Rivard said. “Humanities also sits with that complexity instead of trying to get away from it or simplify it.”

Jack said that the Forever Chemicals team is also exploring how people are digesting information about PFAS contamination and its impacts on their health. Where do they go for information, and who do they trust? The EPA? Local government? News outlets?

“We are using our knowledge as scholars who study language and who are comfortable dwelling in the in-between to examine how people are relating to the scientific information they are receiving,” Jack said. “Many of our sources have been tested and are aware of their PFAS blood levels, but they are trying to understand that in the context of their lives.”

“It has been powerful to bear witness to people’s stories, but there’s a general frustration about what to do,” added Rivard, who is hoping that their project can help inform both scientists and policymakers. “The truth is there’s very little guidance for medical providers at the moment. And so that frustration is real.”

Strengths of a collaborative team

The English professors have built a team of creative undergraduate and graduate student scholars across disciplines.

Forever Chemicals project members have been reaching out to local advocacy groups like the Haw River Assembly and have published a Facebook page to try to solicit more interview sources.

In 2024, the team received two College awards to support the project.

Jack, Rivard and Mahendru received an Arts and Humanities Research grant, co-funded by the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and the Institute for the Arts and Humanities. Mahendru has been working to ensure that the project adheres to best practices for environmental justice issues.

Tara Hinton ’25 of Sylva, North Carolina, was a part of the team as an undergraduate. She graduated last May with a major in environmental studies and a minor in statistics and analytics. She was also an intern with the SOHP.

Rivard and Hinton received a William C. Friday Arts and Humanities Research Award from the IAH. The Friday Award pairs a former Faculty Fellow or Academic Leadership Fellow with an undergraduate student to work on a research project.

Hinton, who brought strengths in conducting oral histories across the lifespan, worked on transcribing the interviews and also developing metadata — learning how to organize the audio and transcripts in an ethical and easily accessible way for future researchers. She said she loved the seamless blending of the humanities and the sciences through this project.

“One of the things that we are also learning is that people are turning this exposure to PFAS into a sense of agency — they’ve started environmental activism groups and have been advocating for their health in really important ways,” Hinton said.

The project received early support from the Arts and Humanities Grant Studio, an initiative based in the College that supports scholarly activity among humanists and humanistic social scientists at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Mariah Marsden, who today is the studio’s grants development manager, was a postdoctoral fellow when she began working on the Forever Chemicals project. She sat in on weekly team meetings, supported grant development proposals and helped with project management tasks.

“Having that kind of sustained attention was important to me,” said Marsden, a folklorist who grew up in the Ozarks in Missouri. “We have an engaging set of academic and community collaborators who work really well together. Artists and humanists ask really interesting, robust, meaningful research questions. And there’s something very satisfying about being a part of this project from the ground up and seeing it grow.”

Mahendru said the opportunity to work on a local project with possibly a larger statewide impact has been especially meaningful.

“When it comes to the environment, there are conversations about what you should be focusing on,” Mahendru said. “There’s an argument to be made for global — our environment connects us all. But being immersed in a local community is important to help make sense of that larger narrative.”

Courtney Rivard was named a Thorp Faculty Engaged Scholar in fall 2025.

YAHD SIGNS AND BUMPAH STICKAHS SENATE SPECIAL — State Rep. Rodney Elliot will run for the Senate seat previously held by late state Sen. Edward Kennedy.","BANK ON IT — While we were focused on the nascent Senate race, the latest Federal Election Commission filing deadline came and went.

THE SENATE SHOWDOWN — Sen. Ed Markey posted one of his biggest quarters this cycle, raising $755,741 from July through September as reports of a potential primary challenge ramped up. That’s more than twice Moulton’s $300,279 haul in the third quarter.

Markey also ended September with $2,662,200 on hand, more than Moulton’s $2,125,110.

But Moulton has raised another $500,000 since announcing his Senate bid, his campaign announced over the weekend (We won’t be able to check the totals until the fourth quarter reporters are out early next year.).

HIGHS AND LOWS — Markey raised the most of any member of the delegation, but Rep. Jake Auchincloss is sitting on a lot more money than everyone else. He ended the three-month period with more than $6.4 million in the bank. Elizabeth Warren had the next most cash on hand (just under $4 million). Rep. Stephen Lynch raised the least of any incumbent, with just $60,617. Meanwhile …

THE CHALLENGERS — … his challenger, Patrick Roath, an attorney from Jamaica Plain, pulled in about $143,000. Lynch still has more money in the bank ($1,056,625 to Roath’s $261,369).

Jeromie Whalen, the former Northampton teacher who is running against Rep. Richard Neal, raised $55,394 since getting in the race in August and ended the period with $15,743 in the bank. Neal had a significant advantage there, raising $216,461 and ending the quarter with $3,973,431 in his campaign coffers.

GOOD MONDAY MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS. In other fundraising news …

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Dan Koh, a former Biden White House official and longtime aide to former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, raised more than $800,000 in the first 24 hours of his congressional campaign launch, an amount he says is the largest first-day haul for any Democratic campaign this cycle.

That includes $50,000 of his own cash Koh is putting into the race. That money (which Koh says is a donation, not a loan) will go toward covering health care premiums for campaign staff.

“I know how hard it is to be a staffer, and I know how hard it is to work on a campaign. And on top of that, I don’t want my staff to be worried about how they’re going to pay their medical bills when they get sick,” Koh told Playbook.

Koh said he was “incredibly humbled” by the early fundraising haul. “I’m just grateful to the hard-working people who supported my campaign because they want a representative who will fight for working people, protect democracy and make life more affordable,” he said.

Koh raised some serious cash during his previous run for Congress in Massachusetts’ Third District, though his campaign also earned headlines for how much of that money was flowing from donors outside the district. Koh ended up coming in a close second in that race to Rep. Lori Trahan. His home in Andover ended up in the Sixth District after lawmakers drew new congressional maps in 2021.

YAHD SIGNS AND BUMPAH STICKAHS

SENATE SPECIAL — State Rep. Rodney Elliot will run for the Senate seat previously held by late state Sen. Edward Kennedy.

“This announcement comes with heartfelt deference to both Senator Kennedy and his family upon his passing,” Elliott said in announcing his bid for the seat that covers Lowell, Dracut, Dunstable, Pepperell and Tyngsboro. “As a member of the House of Representatives and previously as a City Councilor, I had the distinct honor of working closely with Senator Kennedy, and have long respected his dedication and passion for serving both Lowell and the First Middlesex District.”

The Senate has yet to officially set the date for the special election to fill the seat Kennedy held until his death earlier this month.

MONEY WARS — Rep. Seth Moulton’s announcement that he won’t take money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (commonly known as AIPAC), isn’t sitting well with the organization. AIPAC took aim at Moulton in a fundraising missive last week, accusing Moulton of “capitulating to extremes rather than standing on conviction.”

DATELINE BEACON HILL

— Massachusetts gambling regulators look to rein in VIP programs by sports betting apps by Patrick Madden, WBUR: “The Massachusetts Gaming Commission is eyeing regulations for VIP programs used by online sports betting companies that offer perks to frequent bettors. VIP or loyalty programs at companies like DraftKings and FanDuel have come under increasing scrutiny over concerns they target gamblers who are losing money and encourage them to keep playing by rewarding them with trips, sports tickets or bet credits.”

— Education council releases draft of new state graduation standard after overturn of MCAS by Grace Zokovitch, Boston Herald: “Proposed regulations for a new graduation standard could see students across Massachusetts taking “end of course assessments” designed and administered by the state, according to a new draft released nearly a year after voters overturned the statewide MCAS testing graduation requirement. The preliminary draft released by state education officials lays out what standards Massachusetts high school students may be required to meet to graduate, replacing the former MCAS standardized testing requirement.”

IN ALIGNMENT — Massachusetts Republican gubernatorial hopeful Brian Shortsleeve has plenty of criticism for Gov. Maura Healey. But there’s one policy area where Shortsleeve and Healey overlap (at least a little): housing.

Shortsleeve wants to free up state-owned land for housing development in an effort to address the state’s housing crisis, he said during an interview on WCVB’s “On the Record” that aired Sunday.

“The state owns 100,000 acres of land around metro Boston in areas where the community would be happy to have you build,” he said, pointing to a program then-Gov. Charlie Baker launched in 2015.

If that sounds familiar, it’s because Healey made a similar move this summer. Her administration opened up 450 acres of state-owned land to developers who claim it could mean up to 3,500 new homes in the area of a former hospital campus, an abandoned school and an old state prison.

FROM THE HUB

DRAWING A CROWD — Boston’s “No Kings” protest caught social media attention for the aerial view of its crowd.

But for #mapoli watchers, it was also the first time Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Seth Moulton took the stage at the same event since Moulton announced he would challenge Markey for his Senate seat.

Markey appeared, draped in a transgender flag (a gift from a transgender high school student who attended the event, according to Markey’s campaign), a not-so-subtle reminder of comments Moulton made about transgender athletes to The New York Times in the wake of the 2024 election.

Some in the crowd still took issue with those remarks. Moulton’s speech was greeted with some booing, “and expletives from some rallygoers,” per MassLive. More on the protests in Quincy, Hyannis, Worcester, the Berkshires and the South Coast.

The Race for City Hall

— Incorrect email address led to New Bedford City Council candidate’s tardy campaign filing by Frank Mulligan, The Standard-Times: “City Council candidate Christopher Cotter has filed a required campaign financial document with the state that had been due last month, a lapse he had been warned could subject him to $25-per-day fines. However, he said his lack of response to the warnings was unintentional. Cotter stated in an Oct. 16 communication to the state Office of Campaign and Political Finance that the lapse had been due to an incorrect email address.”

— Attleboro mayoral write-in candidate incorrectly claims police charge against him is a rumor by Rhianwen Watkins, The Sun Chronicle: “Write-in mayoral candidate John Robinson is claiming a news article published last week in The Sun Chronicle about him being charged with threatening to assault a school committee member was based on rumor and that no formal charges have been filed against him. The claim was debunked by Police Chief Kyle Heagney. Heagney confirmed with The Sun Chronicle Sunday that a charge has indeed been filed against Robinson in Attleboro District Court and that Robinson will be summonsed at a date to be determined by the court.”

WHAT'S ON CAMPBELL'S DOCKET

— AGs sue Trump EPA over solar energy program by Christian M. Wade, The Eagle-Tribune: “Attorney General Andrea Campbell has joined about two dozen other Democrats in suing the Trump administration over its decision to pull the plug on a $7 billion solar energy program for low-income households. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, alleges that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency violated federal law and the Administrative Procedures Act when it terminated the Solar for All program, approved by Congress in 2023 as part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.”

PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES

— Feds freeze funding for Cape Cod’s aging bridges due to government shutdown by Tonya Alanez, The Boston Globe: “Hundreds of millions in federal funding to help pay for the replacement of two aging bridges that carry traffic on and off Cape Cod suddenly appears to be in flux. The Trump administration last week announced a pause in $11 billion in US Army Corps of Engineers projects in Democratic cities, including Boston, due to the government shutdown. Governor Maura Healey and other Massachusetts lawmakers immediately expressed concern about the federal money, $350 million for the Sagamore Bridge and $250 million for the Bourne Bridge, which was earmarked in the spring of 2024 for the replacement projects.”

FROM THE DELEGATION

— Neal: It’s up to Trump, and the pressure of rising health insurance costs, to end the shutdown by Jim Kinney, The Springfield Republican: “Democrats are firm in their resolve to protect tax credits in the Affordable Care Act as the government shutdown heads toward its fourth week. U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal said higher bills for health insurance — costs the tax credits are meant to counteract for working Americans making too much money for Medicaid —that will end the impasse.”

THE LOCAL ANGLE

— Tens of thousands of Massachusetts federal workers face uncertainty amid government shutdown by Anjali Huynh, Katie Johnston, Laura Crimaldi and Jason Laughlin, The Boston Globe: “As congressional Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a standoff to reopen the government, federal workers in Massachusetts are facing chaos and confusion over whether they will get paid, or have jobs to return to if they are furloughed. More than half of Massachusetts’ estimated 46,000 federal employees — about 25,000 — have faced furloughs or are working without pay because of the shutdown, according to the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, a union of federal workers. That number is part of a bleak national picture, in which federal workers say they’re acutely feeling the shutdown’s effects as many have now missed paychecks since the shutdown began Oct. 1.”

— Quincy ordered to pay $16 million to retirement pension fund. It could raise taxes by Peter Blandino, The Patriot Ledger: “The expected tax hike for Quincy property owners next year may be higher than previously anticipated. The $456 million fiscal 2026 budget is an 8.6% increase over the previous year, largely due to an expected $20 million jump in debt service tied to the city’s 2021 pension obligation bond. Debt service makes up almost 20% of the city’s budget. The bond is essentially a fixed-rate $475 million loan Quincy took out to fund the pensions of retired city workers fully by 2040, as mandated by the state. But Quincy also has another new $16 million bill to pay. The money is due to be paid into Quincy’s retirement system. The budget, proposed by Mayor Tom Koch and passed unanimously by city council, allocates nothing for it.”

The cuts appear to be the first that DOE has confirmed from a list of targeted projects circulating among lobbyists.
The cancellations are some of the largest to date of advanced battery manufacturing projects, affecting plans to build landmark plants in red states like Kentucky and Missouri.
LuxWall planned to use its $31.7 million DOE grant for construction of an advanced glass factory at the site of an old coal plant in Detroit.
The circulating list has angered Democrats and prompted several Republicans to pressure DOE to save projects in their states.","The Department of Energy has canceled more than $700 million in battery and manufacturing awards, advancing the Trump administration’s efforts to nix Biden-era energy projects.

DOE told POLITICO’s E&E News on Friday that it canceled the five grants during the second week of October. The cuts appear to be the first that DOE has confirmed from a list of targeted projects circulating among lobbyists. Until now, it was unclear if DOE planned to move forward with scrapping any of the more than $200 billion in awards on the list.

The $700 million covers grants that the Biden administration awarded to battery companies Ascend Elements, American Battery Technology Co., Anovion and ICL Specialty Products, as well as a glass manufacturer LuxWall, according to DOE.

The projects “had missed milestones, and it was determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement. He did not specify the milestones that DOE says the projects missed.

The cancellations are some of the largest to date of advanced battery manufacturing projects, affecting plans to build landmark plants in red states like Kentucky and Missouri. That distinguishes them from DOE’s initial tranche of $7.56 billion in terminations, which mainly affected projects in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

Those earlier cancellations included less than $175 million in funding cuts from DOE’s Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office (MESC) . The newly canceled funding totals approximately $718 million from the same office, affecting initiatives to manufacture components for electric vehicles and grid batteries.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and other Trump administration officials have been critical of federal funding of electric vehicles and renewables, which often work in tandem with batteries.

Wright has been leading a broad review of projects, following criteria outlined in a May memo. He defended funding cuts this month, saying that projects “have cancellation clauses.”

“If they’re not in the interest of the taxpayers, if they’re not a good expenditure of the money, you always have the ability to cancel these projects,” he said.

Democrats charge that DOE’s actions are illegal and will hurt the economy and slash jobs. Last week, 37 Democratic and independent senators said in a letter to Wright that “the illegality of your cancellations is the only thing as indisputable as the harm your cancellations will wreak.”

The department “must expend these funds and faithfully execute the law, including many programs that have strict requirements for the timing of fund expenditure, purposes, and contractual expectations,” the lawmakers said.

From Alabama to Michigan

The nixed grants affect projects backed by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

The $197.3 million award to ICL Specialty Products was slated to help build a plant in St. Louis producing 30,000 metric tons annually of lithium-ion phosphate powder for the battery industry. The company did not respond to request for comment but said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week that it was “reviewing DOE’s announcement and the implications thereof.”

When the project was announced, ICL projected it would create 120 permanent positions and more than 800 construction jobs.

The largest canceled award — $316 million to Ascend Elements — was intended to support the manufacture of components from recycled electric vehicle batteries at a planned $1 billion plant in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The battery components would compete with supply that now comes primarily from China, the company said.

“The DOE’s decision regarding the grant doesn’t change our trajectory. We’re moving forward,” Linh Austin, president and CEO of the company, said last Thursday to E&E News.

“Our funding path is diversified well beyond DOE. We are replacing the remaining unused portion of the DOE grant with a mix of other sources of funding available to the company including equity, project finance, municipal bonds, and other forms of debt.”

According to the Massachusetts-based company, $206 million of the DOE award had been disbursed, so the cancellation would affect the roughly remaining $100 million.

The $57.7 million grant to American Battery Technology Co. was meant to support construction of a Nevada plant to produce lithium hydroxide for batteries.

The company said it received a notice from DOE on Oct. 9 about the axed funding, which it plans to appeal, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It said there was roughly $52 million remaining to be disbursed from DOE, although the company said it has raised the same amount in public markets.

“Regardless of the outcome of the appeal process, the Company intends to move forward with the project without impact to timeline or scope,” the filing said. The filing added that Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council supported the project as a priority, and the administration has selected it for expedited permitting.

“All evidence demonstrates that this critical minerals project aligns with the administration’s mission and key priorities,” said American Battery Technology Co. CEO Ryan Melsert in an email

Melsert also told POLITICO on Friday that he was puzzled by DOE’s action, considering the administration’s earlier support of the project.

“Sometimes different agencies don’t communicate with each other, and we want to make sure this is really the decision of the administration,” Melsert said.

The $117 million award to Anovion was intended to support production of synthetic graphite for lithium-ion battery anodes, including through construction of a large plant in Alabama. Anovion did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.

LuxWall planned to use its $31.7 million DOE grant for construction of an advanced glass factory at the site of an old coal plant in Detroit. In announcing the funding in 2023, the Biden administration said the company’s products would support energy efficient windows that could help slash building emissions.

LuxWall said Saturday that it plans to appeal DOE’s decision to nix the grant.

It’s unclear if DOE intends to move forward with other cancellations on the $200 billion list. After the announcement of $7.56 billion in funding cuts, Wright told CNN there would be “many more” cancellations this fall.

The circulating list has angered Democrats and prompted several Republicans to pressure DOE to save projects in their states.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), for example, has said that funding for a “blue” hydrogen project in Appalachia that would use natural gas and carbon capture should not be eliminated. To date, DOE has canceled more than $2 billion in funding for two hydrogen hubs on the West Coast focused on producing the fuel with renewables.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/54/b5/fd4096d24086959c32b60918322a/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2239622919,N,,2025-10-20 09:03:30.467511

It is not hard to understand why. Access to reliable and affordable energy is essential to our daily lives. It is also critical to the state’s manufacturing and industrial sectors, which currently account for 26% of the state GDP, a larger share than any other state.

Though it is easy to understand why energy anxiety has hit new levels, it is a little harder to pinpoint, exactly why. It is a long and complex story. Suffice to say that economic incentives to support utility investment, the necessary process of retiring aging power plants and building replacement generation, inflationary pressures, changing customer demand, and a litany of other factors have all played a role in bringing us to this point. The interplay of these factors help explain why the process of creating balance between customers and utilities — which is the ultimate goal of the regulatory process — is difficult.

Unfortunately, while Indiana and some very dedicated policymakers and stakeholders have tried very hard to find the right balance between those pressures and their impact on customers, we haven’t gotten the mix quite right.

Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

At this historic juncture, with a need to expand electric capacity on a scale the likes of which this country has not seen since the 1940s and 50s, we now have two broad paths open to us. One is to keep doing what we have been doing. The other is to try new approaches to adjust the balance. Understanding the story of how we got here is important, not to lay blame, but to focus on the essential question: “Which path do choose?” If we want reliable and affordable power as well as economic prosperity and development, we cannot continue along our current trajectory.

But if we choose a different path, what does that look like?

One step is to establish better support for customer investment in the energy resources which serve them. Indiana already has customer generation and, in fact, industrial customers in Indiana generate hundreds of megawatts of their own power to support their operations. But more could be done to balance the rights of customers and the interests of utilities. Expanded options for ownership and operational models for customer generation, actively supporting voluntary partnerships between utilities and customers to develop generation, and removing geographic and economic constraints on generation are all positive steps that could expand private investment in energy resources and reduce the need for costly new utility construction at public expense.

We also need to re-evaluate the incentives currently provided to utilities. In the past, Indiana has encouraged infrastructure investment by providing financial incentives for cost recovery. But a sustained cycle of incentivized capital investment by utilities will continue to drive utility rates higher. In that regard, Gov. Mike Braun has suggested we need to be more “attentive” to the investments utilities make.

One approach would be to revisit prior legislation to add stronger ratepayer protections. Utilities should be required to provide better justification for investments which receive automatic rate recovery; to demonstrate more than ordinary business risk before recovering cost overruns from customers; and adjust their profit margins to reflect the reduced risk arising from pre-approved investments. These are common sense steps to balance the existing investment incentives with the corresponding rate burden on customers.

Indiana has many advantages as we head into the future. Our location at the Crossroads of America means we have the highways, the pipelines, the transmission facilities and other resources to propel ourselves forward. As we consider that future, no single answer is the “right” one. It is clear that if we want different outcomes, we need to implement different approaches. Hopefully, we choose that path.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gettyimages-2203483581-1024x7061760958351.jpg?h=a9b1ba5e&itok=BO2FxtV2,N,,2025-10-20 10:06:51.110379

Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire.
""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""
McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself.","Monday marks the start of early voting in Texas' Nov. 4 general election. The only statewide contests this year are ballot propositions to amend the state constitution – 17 of them, to be exact.

More than half the constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall deal with taxation, while others pertain to bail practices, dementia research and the state’s water supply.

Arguably, the most significant measures would raise homestead exemptions. They determine how much of a home's property value can be taxed to pay for public schools.

Proposition 13 would lift the homestead exemption for all Texas homeowners from $100,000 to $140,000.

""Now that will save all those 5.7 million homeowners $484 per year,"" said Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt of Houston, author of the measure. ""Once the voters approve of a homestead exemption for schools, it follows you, no matter where you go. That $140,000 exemption means it’s whatever your primary homestead is, and it doesn’t matter if it’s year one or year 50, that’s going to be there. So that’s a substantial lifetime benefit.""

Bettencourt is also the author of Proposition 11, which would lift the additional homestead exemption for homeowners who are over age 65 or disabled from $10,000 to $60,000. In other words, if both Propositions 11 and 13 pass, those homeowners would have a homestead exemption of $200,000.

""Now you may ask, ‘Why do more for over-65 and disabled homeowners?'"" Bettencourt said. ""They’re generally on fixed income, and they need the most help staying in their home. And in the case of seniors, you can’t argue that they already paid a lifetime of taxes and probably don’t have any current students in the public education system.""

The combined benefits, and burdens, of tax breaks

Taken together with amendments to reduce property taxes passed in earlier elections, maintaining these reductions will cost the state roughly $51 billion.

“A lot of those have been funded out of surplus money, and surplus money is one-time revenue,"" said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""It’s not recurring revenue. So, when the surplus ends, you have to find another way to finance these reductions.""

If the amendments are approved, the state would make up the difference for the revenue school districts lose from property taxes, through a process called ""compression."" But unlike the homestead exemptions, the compressions would not be written into the constitution.

""There’s a big difference between the homestead exemptions, which are constitutionally passed and so guaranteed forever, but the compressions can be taken away just like that,"" Diamond said, snapping his fingers. ""Those are not protected.""

And that could lead to deep cuts in public education funding in lean budget years, much as Texas saw 20 years ago.

Some of the other tax measures are highly targeted. Proposition 7 would provide a full or partial homestead exemption to the surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a disease or medical condition related to their service. Proposition 17 would provide property tax relief for homeowners whose property has been affected by the installation or construction of border security infrastructure along the Mexican border.

Then there's Proposition 10, which would provide a temporary property tax exemption for people whose homes are destroyed by fire. That's another of Bettencourt's measures.

""And so we decided, fine, we’ll give them the same coverage that we do for tornadoes and hurricanes,"" Bettencourt said. “Because if your home’s burned down, you shouldn’t have to pay for all the whole full value.""

University of Houston economist Steven Craig said all those exemptions add up.

""Our heart can go out to all kinds of people, and then the question is, ‘Is this the way to help them, or is there a better way to help them?'"" Craig said. ""As you whittle away against a property tax, you’re setting it up so that the property tax stops working.""

Then there are a series of measures that would ban the state from collecting certain kinds of taxes altogether. Proposition 2 would ban capital gains taxes. Proposition 6 would ban taxes on securities transactions. That's ahead of Texas establishing its own stock exchange. And Proposition 8 would ban inheritance taxes.

Texas doesn't collect any of these at present, but Diamond said ruling them out limits the state's options when revenues from other sources fall.

""Sales taxes, I could definitely see those flattening out as the consumers' resilience finally fades,"" Diamond said, ""and then federal transfers almost certainly are going to fall and could fall significantly. That is a huge chunk of the Texas budget.""

Felony bail reform

At least three ballot measures that don't relate to taxation have potentially widespread ramifications for the state. Take Proposition 3, which would amend the constitution to allow judges to deny bail to people charged with certain felonies. Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman of Houston has been trying to get this passed since 2019.

""A judge would have to determine that either the person was going to be a threat in some way to the safety of the community or to law enforcement and/or a likelihood that the person would not return to court,"" Huffman said.

The amendment would apply only to the most serious offenses – capital murder, murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated sexual assault, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and continuous human trafficking.

""This doesn’t take away any of the other rights that they would have for a trial, for the state to have to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Huffman said. ""It’s just reserved for those that would be held pending trial. And I will say that many states have this exact same type of system, and the federal system operates this way for violent offenders.""

Prop 3 would affect a relatively small number of cases in the Texas justice system, about 40,000 out of more than 800,000 arrests made in Texas every year. That's according to Nick Hudson, senior manager of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of Texas. But Hudson said he has serious concerns that the measure would worsen overcrowding in Texas jails.

""I think this is very likely to pass. Our focus has been on trying to mitigate the harm it will cause,"" Hudson said. “We, along with many other people and many House and Senate negotiators, worked to ensure that there was access to lawyers baked into this proposal to blunt some of the potential negative impacts. We are happy to see that provision in, but we are really concerned that this will accelerate pretrial detention.""

Hudson argued that the measure could wind up violating one of the most basic rights of the accused.

""They have not been convicted,"" Hudson said. ""They are presumed innocent [until proven guilty], waiting for trial behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of about $1.2 billion a year.""

Investments in water infrastructure and dementia prevention

One ballot measure with a similar price tag, but less controversial, is Proposition 4. This amendment would dedicate up to $1 billion per year from existing state sales tax revenue to the Texas Water Fund for the next 20 years. The money would be used to fix some of the state's most pressing water infrastructure needs.

Sarah Rountree Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation, estimated the state's total needs for new water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as to replace aging infrastructure, at $150 billion, far above the maximum of $20 billion that Prop 4 would provide.

""Is it enough? No, it’s not enough to meet everything,"" Schlessinger said. ""Is it a significant move towards funding water infrastructure in Texas? Yes, significantly so.""

Schlessinger said the total amount of money the amendment would commit is less significant than the fact that the amendment provides for a dedicated and ongoing source of funds – allowing the state to better plan for long-term needs, like combatting droughts worsening in the face of climate change.

RELATED: Mayor Whitmire considers sending Houston water to West Texas – despite forecasted shortfall

Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at the public policy think tank Texas 2036, said Houston and other major cities have a lot riding on the passage of Prop 4.

""First, they need to expand and diversify their water supply portfolio for a dynamic, growing region,"" Mazur said. ""And second, there’s also this issue of aging, deteriorating, leaking water systems within the Houston metropolitan area that really need to be resolved sometime soon. These are systems that annoy everyday families and businesses through inadequate or leaking service, causing boil water notices or even service interruptions.""

Then there's Proposition 14, which would create a state institute for fighting dementia, formally the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT), similar to one Texas has already established to target cancer (CPRIT). The amendment would provide an initial $3 billion in state surplus revenue to a fund dedicated to finding medical breakthroughs, cures, and prevention.

""It would be a breakthrough,"" said Ashley McPhail, chief external affairs and administration officer at the Texas Medical Center. ""It really would make a huge difference in sort of the path and trajectory that we are on for dementia and other related diseases within this space. If you look across funding, this would be sort of the second-largest funding for something like this, for brain health outside of the [National Institutes of Health] in the United States.""

McPhail said the investment of state tax dollars would more than pay for itself. It could lure hundreds of researchers to the state and spark the creation of dozens of companies dedicated to fighting Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, much as CPRIT has done already with cancer research. And that doesn't even touch the savings in residents' medical bills.

""Currently, over 400,000 Texans are living with Alzheimer’s, which costs families over $20 billion per year,"" McPhail said. ""Texas ranks third in the nation for the number of Alzheimer’s cases and second in the number of Alzheimer’s deaths. So, the need here in Texas is also very acute and specific from that side, and I would say it’s a $3.9 billion cost for Alzheimer’s to the Texas Medicaid program every year.""",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/25164942/Photo-of-voting-sign.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 08:10:51.569500

However, the EPA in August announced that it would be cancelling the Solar for All Program. Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the EPA, said in a post to X that Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” eliminated the program.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, in an announcement Thursday, said that clawing back the funds already granted for the Solar for All Program is unlawful since the Big Beautiful Bill states that only unobligated funds were taken away.

“The EPA had no legal right to terminate this congressionally approved program or rescind funds that have already been obligated to the states,” Bonta said in a virtual briefing.

So it’s little surprise that Energy Secretary Chris Wright chose the conservative academic to help write a government-backed report — released in July — that called into question the severity of global warming. Wright himself has disputed the risks of climate change, and the five authors he handpicked to write the report align with that perspective.

But a review by POLITICO’s E&E News has found another common thread.

Advertisement

Four of the five authors that Wright selected to write the July report have spoken out against the endangerment finding, a 2009 EPA decision that underpins many federal climate regulations. That includes Koonin, who in February urged the administration to begin the process of rolling back the endangerment finding “as soon as possible.”

The criticism from Koonin and his co-authors is significant because the report they co-wrote is being used as evidence by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to eliminate the endangerment finding, which Zeldin once called the “holy grail” of climate science. EPA’s plan to undo the endangerment finding cites the Wright climate report no less than 16 times, E&E News has found.

Climate scientists, environmental groups and Democrats have seized on the revelation and said it’s further proof the Wright climate report is little more than a political document — written with the express purpose of helping the Trump administration unravel climate rules made possible by the endangerment finding.

The goal of the report is “to basically develop enough soundbite-worthy quotes that policymakers could use … to try to cast doubt on the science” of global warming, said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University who organized an academic response to the Wright climate report.

Wright has defended the report as an attempt to counter the narrative of mainstream climate science, which has made clear in thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers that humanity’s burning of fossil fuels is heating the planet, with dangerous repercussions for people and other living things.

“Hydrocarbon-based fuels, the argument goes, must be rapidly abandoned or else we risk planetary ruin,” Wright wrote in a forward to the report.

“That view demands scrutiny,” he continued. “That’s why I commissioned this report: to encourage a more thoughtful and science-based conversation about climate change and energy.”

The writers themselves have defended the report too, with author Judith Curry, a former climatologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, telling E&E News that it was a “red herring” to question their independence.

“This issue of ‘independence’ is never raised about scientists employed by, or affiliated with or otherwise supporting, environmental advocacy groups,” she said.

But one climate law expert argued that the authors’ past criticism of the endangerment finding — coupled with their ties to groups that have advocated for its elimination — call into question the Wright report’s credibility.

“It’s the furthest thing from an independent review, it’s a preordained review,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “It’s an additional brick in an already high wall of facts discrediting the report.”

The courts have also shown skepticism toward Wright’s framing of the report as an independent review.

Environmental groups have sued over the Wright report — largely because they don’t want it included in EPA’s review of the endangerment finding.

Last month, a federal judge denied the green groups’ attempts to bar its inclusion. But in doing so, Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts — a Reagan appointee — threw cold water on Wright’s claims about its intentions.

“The conclusion of the report itself shows that it is no mere ‘review’ of the literature. To suggest otherwise borders on sophistry,” Young wrote. “No reasonable jury could find that these words, arranged as they are, do not constitute advice or recommendations for a renewed approach to climate policy.”

Endangerment critics tapped to attack it

The endangerment finding stands out as a milestone in U.S. climate policy — as it empowered the federal government to take more robust action against global warming.

Announced during the first Obama administration, the 2009 determination asserts that six greenhouse gases are driving climate change and that EPA has the authority to regulate these gases in the interest of public health.

The federal government has used the endangerment finding to implement a wide swath of climate regulations, including those intended to reduce greenhouse emissions from vehicles and power plants.

For that reason, conservatives have long sought to overturn the endangerment finding — which they say has been used to drive up prices and create unnecessary regulation.

Among its critics are four of the five authors that Wright tapped to write the July report on climate.

Chief among them is Koonin, a fellow at the Hoover Institution. Koonin organized an adversarial review of climate science during the first Trump administration, and in February, he sent Zeldin an email offering “technical assistance from me and colleagues in the review of the Endangerment Finding.”

Two other authors — University of Alabama climatologist Roy Spencer and University of Guelph economist Ross McKitrick — spoke in May at an event hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation entitled: “Is the Sky Falling, a Reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding.”

During the Heritage event, McKitrick said “most climate policies would make societies worse off.” A 2017 paper written by McKitrick “outlines a case for re-doing the science behind the Endangerment Finding.”

For his part, Spencer was a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation last year as it was promoting a conservative playbook — known as Project 2025 — now being used by the Trump administration to attack a wide range of policies, including climate regulations. The document recommends the Trump administration “establish a system, with an appropriate deadline, to update the 2009 endangerment finding.”

At Heritage, Spencer wrote white papers and blog entries — one of which is cited in the Wright climate report. In the post, Spencer explicitly warns against policy based on climate models, a support beam of the endangerment finding.

He said climate models that warn of significant future warming are “unreliable” — even though mainstream scientists have shown them to be accurate.

Then there is John Christy, a University of Alabama, Huntsville, climatologist, who has spent years attacking climate models and claiming they have been manipulated. He has previously stated that the endangerment finding was a “political exercise” because parts of it were written by Obama administration officials. He pledged to work on rolling back the finding during the first Trump administration.

“When you can prove and demonstrate that climate models used for the basis of the endangerment finding can be falsified, that would at least bring the endangerment finding back for consideration,” he told E&E News in 2017.

Ties to groups opposed to climate action

Wright last week defended the authors’ backgrounds in response to questions from E&E News.

“These are not political people,” Wright said. “All of them were top and well-known scientists.”

He added the report is not about “their personal histories or their past, it’s about the science and the data.”

But at least three of the authors have ties to groups that employ and promote critics of climate action, including the endangerment finding.

In addition to his work with Heritage, Spencer has been affiliated with the Heartland Institute, which has long sought to tear down the endangerment finding.

And McKitrick is a fellow at the Fraser Institute and has been affiliated with the Cato Institute. Both have published and promoted his work advocating against the endangerment finding or other arguments against climate policy.

Koonin’s work for the Hoover Institution has long focused on tearing down the endangerment finding.

Heritage, Heartland, Cato, Hoover and Fraser have long criticized energy regulations and have collectively received millions of dollars in funding from fossil fuel industry groups or foundations that oppose regulations.

The only one of the five authors who did not have an extensive public record of targeting the endangerment finding for rollback is Curry, the former climatologist at Georgia Tech.

Speaking for the other authors of the report, she said their affiliations with outside groups did not shape the report’s findings.

“This whole issue is a red herring,” she wrote in an emailed response to questions. “The scientific content of our report, and any other report, should be judged by its merits.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/59/8e/d3c3615d4123af34c1ff9834c68d/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2235553092,N,,2025-10-20 08:10:54.235741

LNG projects under construction in the United States include those in southeast Texas — like the Golden Pass project and the Port Arthur facility — and ones in Louisiana, such as Louisiana LNG in Calcasieu Parish.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-10-20 10:34:27+00:00,Just Auto,Niron Magnetics and Stellantis partner on 'rare-earth-free' electric motor tech - Just Auto,David Leggett,,,,,https://www.just-auto.com/news/niron-magnetics-and-stellantis-partner-on-rare-earth-free-electric-motor-tech/,"Niron Magnetics has announced a project in collaboration with Stellantis to develop a new generation of electric motor designs for automotive use using magnets free of rare-earth elements.
The collaboration builds upon Stellantis Ventures’ strategic investment in Niron Magnetics in 2023.
In contrast, Niron Magnetics’ Iron Nitride magnets are made from abundant iron and atmospheric nitrogen, materials readily available in the United States and globally.
“Collaborating with the Niron Magnetics team allows us to explore the possibilities of this innovative magnet technology,” said Micky Bly, senior vice president, head of propulsion systems engineering for Stellantis.
The announcement coincides with the groundbreaking of Niron Magnetics’ first commercial-scale manufacturing facility in Sartell, Minnesota.","Niron Magnetics has announced a project in collaboration with Stellantis to develop a new generation of electric motor designs for automotive use using magnets free of rare-earth elements. Niron’s breakthrough Iron Nitride magnet technology offers a promising alternative to traditional rare-earth-based magnets, helping to reduce dependence on foreign-dominated supply chains.

The collaboration builds upon Stellantis Ventures’ strategic investment in Niron Magnetics in 2023. It features additional support from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO), which contributed $2.7 million to the project as part of its strategy to strengthen American energy independence and secure critical materials.

Permanent magnets play a vital role in dozens of vehicle systems, from audio and power steering to fluid pumps and powertrains. Magnets are critical components in a wide range of powertrains, including those used in internal combustion engines, hybrids, and electric vehicles.

Traditional permanent magnets rely heavily on rare earth elements, primarily sourced from China. In contrast, Niron Magnetics’ Iron Nitride magnets are made from abundant iron and atmospheric nitrogen, materials readily available in the United States and globally.

“Collaborating with the Niron Magnetics team allows us to explore the possibilities of this innovative magnet technology,” said Micky Bly, senior vice president, head of propulsion systems engineering for Stellantis. “As part of our broader research into advanced propulsion solutions, we’re continually evaluating emerging technologies that could support future mobility options and enhance customer choice.”

The Stellantis-Niron project aims to enhance motor architecture across all vehicle types by leveraging the unique properties of Iron Nitride magnets to deliver improved performance and efficiency.

“This collaboration is another critical notch of success in our strategy to scale our technology to meet the demands for permanent magnets and securing our domestic supply chains for leading manufacturers like our partners at Stellantis,” said Jonathan Rowntree, CEO of Niron Magnetics. “By switching to rare-earth-free Iron Nitride, we’re not only working together to build a more resilient foundation for industry but expanding the boundaries of what’s possible for motor performance.”

Titled “Variable Flux Field Intensifying Motors Using Iron Nitride Permanent Magnets,” the joint project builds on Stellantis’ investment and ongoing collaboration with Niron Magnetics in areas such as traction motors, automotive audio, and other magnet-driven systems.

The announcement coincides with the groundbreaking of Niron Magnetics’ first commercial-scale manufacturing facility in Sartell, Minnesota. When fully operational, the site will be one of North America’s largest magnet production facilities, producing 1,500 tons of magnets annually and creating 175 full-time jobs.

Niron Magnetics and Stellantis will also collaborate with leading research institutions, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Illinois Institute of Technology, to leverage their expertise in advanced motor systems analysis and testing.",https://www.just-auto.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2021/05/2020-11-10-14-01-stellantislogo_cropped_90.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 12:12:05.781342
,EVs,2025-10-20 10:24:52+00:00,Axios,"Federal EV tax credits expire, but Ohio offers no relief - Axios Columbus","Andrew King, Tyler Buchanan, Joann Muller",,,,,https://www.axios.com/local/columbus/2025/10/20/federal-ev-tax-credits-ohio-electric-vehicles,"Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases are dead, and there's no state tax break to speak of in Ohio.
State of play: Biden-era federal tax credits on EV purchases — up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 on pre-owned EVs — were killed by Congress, effective Sept. 30.
Buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring federal credits, leading many forecasters to predict an immediate drop in EV sales.
Context: In car sales platform Carvana's 2024 state-by-state breakdown, EV sales in Ohio accounted for just 2.9% of used car sales.
Between the lines: Ohio's lack of EV tax credits may be par for the course, but our EV infrastructure lags far behind other states.","Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases are dead, and there's no state tax break to speak of in Ohio.

Why it matters: The rewards and penalties on EVs reflect an industry in flux, as policymakers try to balance environmental goals with the need to pay for roads and other critical infrastructure.

State of play: Biden-era federal tax credits on EV purchases — up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 on pre-owned EVs — were killed by Congress, effective Sept. 30.

Buyers rushed to take advantage of the expiring federal credits, leading many forecasters to predict an immediate drop in EV sales.

The numerous states with continuing incentives hope they'll sustain some level of sales momentum.

Yes, but: Ohio doesn't have any, and its fees can run counter to increasing EV adoption, note researchers at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank that mostly supports lower taxes.

Ohioans pay a $200 annual EV registration fee, $150 for plug-in hybrids and $100 for hybrids.

Context: In car sales platform Carvana's 2024 state-by-state breakdown, EV sales in Ohio accounted for just 2.9% of used car sales.

That was lower than the national average (4.3%) and significantly behind EV hot spots that approached 10%.

What we're watching: State lawmakers are once again pushing back with a bipartisan proposal to eliminate the $100 hybrid fee.

The big picture: States fund most of their road and infrastructure budgets with revenues from federal and state gasoline taxes.

But that income isn't enough to meet rising costs, and the funding gap will keep growing as cars get more efficient and EV ownership grows.

Since EV owners don't pay gas taxes, states like Ohio levy the extra fees to ensure they pay their share for road maintenance.

Between the lines: Ohio's lack of EV tax credits may be par for the course, but our EV infrastructure lags far behind other states.

As of January, our 15.5 charging stations per 100,000 residents was far behind the top states, and even neighbors like Michigan and Pennsylvania.

To close the gap, some Central Ohio suburbs are taking matters into their own hands.",https://static.axios.com/img/axios-site/axios-placeholder-16x9.png,N,,2025-10-20 09:03:33.623183
